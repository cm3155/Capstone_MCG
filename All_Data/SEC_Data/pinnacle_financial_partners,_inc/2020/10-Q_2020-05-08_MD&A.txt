 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following is a discussion of our financial condition at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 and our results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019. The purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about our financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from our consolidated financial statements. The following discussion and analysis should be read along with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein and the risk factors discussed in Part II, Item 1A - Risk Factors , herein as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 (Form 10-K) and the other reports we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission since we filed that Form 10-K. 

Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic 

On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency related to a novel strain of the coronavirus, COVID-19. With that declaration, we activated our pandemic response team and began work to prepare both our associates and clients for the impact of COVID-19. The spread of COVID-19 has created a global public health crisis that has resulted in unprecedented uncertainty, volatility and disruption in financial markets and in governmental, commercial and consumer activity in the United States and globally, including the markets that we serve. These actions included the decision by the Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee to lower the target for the federal funds rate to a range of between zero to 0.25% on March 15, 2020. This action followed a prior reduction of the targeted federal funds rate to a range of 1.0% to 1.25% on March 3, 2020. 

We have been intentional in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure strength in our balance sheet, including increases in liquidity and reserves. We have adjusted our business practices, including restricting employee travel, encouraging employees to work from home, where possible, converting to drive-thru only service with specific needs facilitated by appointment, implementing social distancing guidelines within our offices and by the launch of our pandemic response team. 

On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ("CARES") Act was signed into law. It contains substantial tax and spending provisions intended to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act includes the Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP"), a program designed to aid small- and medium-sized businesses through federally guaranteed loans distributed through banks. These loans are intended to guarantee eight weeks of payroll and other costs to provide support to participating businesses and increase the ability of these businesses to retain workers. As of April 30, 2020, we had obtained approvals for approximately 13,000 clients totaling approximately $2.4 billion in approved loans. 

We have also implemented a short-term loan modification program to provide temporary payment relief to certain of our borrowers. This program allows for a deferral of payments for 90 days, which we may extend for an additional 90 days, for a maximum of 180 days on a cumulative and successive basis. As of April 30, 2020, we had granted deferrals on approximately $4.1 billion in aggregate principal amount of loans. 

We believe our response has allowed and continues to allow us to appropriately support our associates, clients and their communities. The COVID-19 pandemic along with the implementation of CECL have contributed to an increased provision for credit losses for the first quarter of 2020 and an extended duration of economic disruption resulting from the virus could lead to increased net charge-offs and increased provisioning expense. We continue to monitor both the impact of COVID-19 and the effects of the CARES Act closely; however, the extent to which each will impact our operations and financial results during the remainder of 2020 is uncertain. 

Overview 

Our diluted net income per common share for the three months ended March 31, 2020 was $0.37 compared to $1.22 for the same period in 2019. At March 31, 2020, loans had increased to $20.4 billion, as compared to $19.8 billion at December 31, 2019, and total deposits increased to $21.3 billion at March 31, 2020 from $20.2 billion at December 31, 2019. 

Results of Operations. Our net interest income increased to $193.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to $187.2 million for the same period in the prior year, representing an increase of $6.4 million. For the three months ended March 31, 2020 when compared to the comparable period in 2019, this increase was the result of organic loan growth during the comparable periods, a portion of which was the result of commercial loan draws we believe were the result of our borrowers accessing these lines in response to the economic uncertainty from the COVID-19 pandemic. The net interest margin (the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets) for the three months ended March 31, 2020 was 3.28% compared to 3.62% for the same period in 2019 and 

reflects the competitive rate environments for loans and deposits in our markets, the decline in short-term interest rates and for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 declining levels of positive impact from purchase accounting. 

&#160; 

Our provision for credit losses was $99.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to $7.2 million for the same period in 2019. The primary drivers of the increase in provision were the anticipated economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and our adoption of FASB ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020. ASU 2016-13, which introduces the current expected credit losses (CECL) methodology, requires us to estimate all expected credit losses over the remaining life of our loan portfolio. Also contributing to the increase in provision was an increase in net charge-offs, which totaled $10.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to $3.6 million for the same period in 2019. The increase in net charge-offs in the first quarter of 2020 was in large part the result of an approximately $5.0 million charge-off related to a single credit in the commercial and industrial loan category. This credit was criticized going into the COVID-19 pandemic and as a result of the pandemic suffered further deterioration resulting in its partial charge-off during the quarter. 

At March 31, 2020, our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.09% compared to 0.48% at December 31, 2019. The increase in the allowance for credit losses is largely the result of the implementation of CECL on January 1, 2020, which resulted in an adjustment to the opening balance of the allowance for credit losses of $38.1 million, and increased provisioning during the quarter ended March 31, 2020 due to the anticipated economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in the opening balance upon the implementation of CECL is partially attributable to a change in the treatment of acquired loans. Prior to the adoption of CECL, acquired loans required an allowance only if estimated credit losses exceeded the remaining purchase accounting fair value discounts. Under CECL, an allowance for credit losses is recognized for all loans without regard to fair value discounts. Also contributing to the increase in the opening balance upon adoption was an overall increase in reserve rates under CECL due to the estimation of all expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life of the portfolio rather than only probable incurred losses as was required under the prior accounting standard. 

Noninterest income increased by $19.3 million, or 37.8%, during the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The growth in noninterest income was in part attributable to gains on mortgage loans sold, net, which increased by $3.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in the prior year, largely due to the interest rate environment as well are our increased number of mortgage originators in the respective periods. Additionally, income from our equity method investment in BHG increased $2.3 million, or 17.3%, during the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year. Also impacting our noninterest income was the $5.0 million, or 42.4%, year-over-year increase in wealth management revenue during the quarter ended March 31, 2020 as compared to March 31, 2019 and $463,000 in net gains on sales of securities compared to $1.9 million in net losses on sales of securities during the three months ended March 31, 2019. Other noninterest income increased during the three months ended March 31, 2020 by $5.4 million, of which $1.4 million was attributed to revenues associated with customer back-to-back swap transactions and $769,000 was related to revenues associated with SBA loan sales, not inclusive of those loans associated with the PPP. The remaining increase was realized throughout our other fee revenue lines of business. 

Noninterest expense increased by $23.3 million, or 20.4%, during the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019. Impacting noninterest expenses during the three months ended March 31, 2020, was an increase in our associate base in the first quarter of 2020 versus the first quarter of 2019 and the resulting increase in salaries and employment benefits expense of $10.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in the prior year. Also impacting noninterest expense in the first quarter of 2020 was $5.2 million in lending related costs related to an increase in our off balance sheet reserves. The increase in the expense related to off balance sheet reserves during the three months ended March 31, 2020 was largely due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on expected credit losses under CECL. 

Our efficiency ratio (the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income) was 52.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to 47.9% for the same period in 2019. The efficiency ratio measures the amount of expense that is incurred to generate a dollar of revenue. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2020, we recorded an income tax benefit of $1.7 million compared to income tax expense of $23.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2020 was a benefit of 6.2% compared to expense of 19.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2019. Our tax expense in the first quarter of 2020 was impacted by the provision for credit losses recorded in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which was recorded as a discrete item of total income tax and contributed a tax benefit of $22.4 million. Our tax rate in each period was also impacted by the vesting and exercise of equity-based awards previously granted under our equity-based compensation program, resulting in the recognition of tax benefits of $862,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to tax benefits of $769,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2019. 

Financial Condition. &#160; Net loans increased $609.0 million, or 3.1%, during the three months ended March 31, 2020, when compared to December 31, 2019, due in part to approximately $257.4 million in commercial loan draws, most of which we believe were in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as continued economic growth in our core markets prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, increases in the number of relationship advisors we employ and continued focus on attracting new customers to our company. Total deposits were $21.3 billion at March 31, 2020, compared to $20.2 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $1.1 billion, or 5.7%. Deposit growth during the period is largely the result of our intentional emphasis on gathering low cost core deposits during 2020, but was also likely aided by our clients' need to build liquidity going into the COVID-19 pandemic, stock market conditions and the extension of the deadline for filing of U.S. income tax returns and the payment of taxes as a result of COVID-19. 

Capital and Liquidity. At March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our capital ratios, including our bank's capital ratios, exceeded regulatory minimum capital requirements and those necessary to be considered well-capitalized under applicable federal regulations. See Note 10. Regulatory Matters in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. From time to time we may be required to support the capital needs of our bank (Pinnacle Bank). At March 31, 2020, we had approximately $81.3 million of cash at the parent company to be used to support our bank. Additionally, we believe we have various capital raising techniques available to us to provide for the capital needs of our company and bank, such as the $300 million subordinated debt offering issued during the third quarter of 2019 as well as an established line of credit with another bank that can be utilized, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to provide up to $75 million of additional capital through July 24, 2020 to support Pinnacle Bank and for other matters, if needed. We also have the ability to issue equity or debt securities, including preferred shares or subordinated debt, from time to time as we have done in the past to support our capital needs and those of Pinnacle Bank, and we periodically evaluate capital markets conditions to identify opportunities to access those markets if necessary or prudent to support our capital levels. 

On November 13, 2018, Pinnacle Financial announced that its board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $100.0 million of Pinnacle Financial&#8217;s outstanding common stock and on October 15, 2019, the board approved an additional $100.0 million of repurchase authorization. The current repurchase program expired on March 31, 2020, with the additional $100.0 million authorization expiring on December 31, 2020. Prior to January 1, 2020, we repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $82.1 million. During the quarter ended March 31, 2020, we repurchased approximately 1.0 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $50.8 million. Our last purchase of shares of our common stock occurred on March 19, 2020. At this time, we have suspended our repurchase program until we gain more clarity on the length and depth of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The accounting principles we follow and our methods of applying these principles conform with U.S. GAAP and with general practices within the banking industry. On January 1, 2020, we adopted FASB ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) which significantly changes our methodology for determining our allowance for credit losses, and ASU 2017-04 , Intangibles &#8211; Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment which simplifies our process for performing goodwill impairment testing. See Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for further information related to these changes. There have been no other significant changes to our Critical Accounting Estimates as described in our Form 10-K.

Results of Operations 

Net Interest Income. Net interest income represents the amount by which interest earned on various earning assets exceeds interest paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities and is the most significant component of our revenues. Net interest income totaled $193.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, an increase of $6.4 million from the levels recorded in the first three months of 2019. This increase was attributable to organic growth in our loan portfolio, a portion of which was attributable to commercial loan draws by our commercial borrowers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of the loans we acquired in connection with our acquisition of Advocate Capital offset in part by decreases in the yields we earn on earning assets, increases in the volume of deposits and our other funding sources. 

The following tables set forth the amount of our average balances, interest income or interest expense for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the average interest rate for interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, net interest spread and net interest margin for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands):

The tax-exempt benefit has been reduced by the projected impact of tax-exempt income that will be disallowed pursuant to IRS Regulations as of and for the period presented. 

(3) Yields realized on interest-bearing assets less the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The net interest spread calculation excludes the impact of demand deposits. Had the impact of demand deposits been included, the net interest spread for the three months ended March 31, 2020 would have been 3.22% compared to a net interest spread of 3.57% for the three months ended March 31, 2019. 

(4) Net interest margin is the result of annualized net interest income calculated on a tax-equivalent basis divided by average interest-earning assets for the period. 

For the three months ended March 31, 2020, our net interest margin was 3.28% compared to 3.62% for the three months ended March 31, 2019. Our net interest margin for the three month period ended March 31, 2020 was negatively impacted by yield compression in our earning asset portfolio due to a declining macroeconomic interest rate environment, which included a 150 basis points reduction in the federal funds rate in March 2020, as well as a reduction in purchase accounting accretion. This decrease was offset somewhat by a decrease in funding costs. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, our earning asset yield decreased by 53 basis points from the same period in the prior year. Our total funding rates decreased by 18 basis points compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019. 

We continue to deploy various asset liability management strategies to manage our risk to interest rate fluctuations. Pricing for creditworthy borrowers and meaningful depositors is very competitive in our markets and this competition has adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our margins. This challenging competitive environment may continue during 2020 even during a time of economic uncertainty due to COVID-19. We also expect the positive impact of purchase accounting on our net interest income will lessen in future periods, which will negatively affect our net interest margin in 2020. We have sought to mitigate much of the negative impact that reductions in short-term interest rates would have on our net interest margin through restructuring a portion of our investment securities portfolio, purchasing loan interest rate floors, and unwinding fixed-to-floating loan interest rate swaps. Those tactics have benefited us during this recent period of falling short-term interest rates. However, our net interest margin could be additionally impacted if we are not able to continue to lower deposit rates at a pace necessary to offset declines in our earning asset yields. Should we determine holding additional on-balance sheet liquidity to be a prudent response to the COVID-19 pandemic, this would likely result in lowering the net interest margin even if the additional liquidity has no effect on net interest income. We seek to fund increased loan volumes by growing our core deposits, but will utilize non-core funding to fund shortfalls, if any. To the extent that our dependence on non-core funding sources increases during 2020 our net interest margin would likely be negatively impacted as we may not be able to reduce the rates we pay on these deposits as quickly as we can on core deposits. 

Provision for Credit Losses. On January 1, 2020, we adopted FASB ASU 2016-13, which introduces the current expected credit losses (CECL) methodology and requires us to estimate all expected credit losses over the remaining life of our loan and held-to-maturity securities portfolios. Accordingly, the provision for credit losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish an allowance for credit losses that, in management's evaluation, is adequate to provide coverage for all expected credit losses. The provision for credit losses amounted to $99.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to $7.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. Provision expense is impacted by organic loan growth in our loan portfolio, our internal assessment of the credit quality of the loan portfolio, our expectations about future economic conditions and net charge-offs. The primary driver of the increase in provision for credit losses for the three months ended March 31, 2020 was the estimated economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our CECL model relies on projected macroeconomic conditions, including unemployment and GDP, as key inputs to estimate future credit losses. As a result, the anticipated deterioration in economic conditions resulting from COVID-19 has resulted in a significant increase in expected credit losses. Also contributing to the increase in the provision for credit losses was an increase in net charge-offs, which totaled $10.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to $3.6 million for the same period in 2019. The increase in net charge-offs in the first quarter of 2020 was in large part the result of an approximately $5.0 million charge-off related to a single credit in the commercial and industrial loan category. This credit was criticized going into the COVID-19 pandemic and as a result of the pandemic became further deteriorated resulting in its partial charge-off during the quarter ended March 31, 2020. 

Our allowance for credit losses reflects an amount deemed appropriate to adequately cover all expected future losses as of the date the allowance is determined based on our allowance for credit losses assessment methodology. At March 31, 2020, our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.09%, up from 0.48% at December 31, 2019. The increase in the allowance for credit losses is largely the result of the implementation of CECL on January 1, 2020, which resulted in an adjustment to the opening balance of the allowance for credit losses of $38.1 million, and increased provisioning during the quarter ended March 31, 2020 due to the estimated economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Noninterest Income. &#160; Our noninterest income is composed of several components, some of which vary significantly between quarterly and annual periods. Service charges on deposit accounts and other noninterest income generally reflect customer growth trends, while fees from our wealth management departments, gains on mortgage loans sold, gains and losses on the sale of securities and gains or losses related to our efforts to mitigate risks associated with interest rate volatility will often reflect financial market conditions and fluctuate from period to period. 

The following is a summary of our noninterest income for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands): 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2020 - 2019 Percent &#160; 2020 2019 Increase (Decrease) Noninterest income: &#160; &#160; &#160; Service charges on deposit accounts $ 9,032 &#160; $ 8,542 &#160; 5.7% Investment services 9,239 &#160; 5,468 &#160; 69.0% Insurance sales commissions 3,240 &#160; 2,928 &#160; 10.7% Gains on mortgage loans sold, net 8,583 &#160; 4,878 &#160; 76.0% Investment (gains) losses on sales of securities, net 463 &#160; (1,960) &#160; 123.6% Trust fees 4,170 &#160; 3,295 &#160; 26.6% Income from equity method investment 15,592 &#160; 13,290 &#160; 17.3% Other noninterest income: Interchange and other consumer fees 9,969 &#160; 7,507 &#160; 32.8% Bank-owned life insurance 4,652 &#160; 4,095 &#160; 13.6% Loan swap fees 2,187 &#160; 761 &#160; 187.4% SBA loan sales 1,341 &#160; 572 &#160; 134.4% Gain (loss) on other equity investments (174) &#160; 782 &#160; (122.3)% Other noninterest income 2,083 &#160; 905 &#160; 130.2% Total other noninterest income 20,058 &#160; 14,622 &#160; 37.2% Total noninterest income $ 70,377 &#160; $ 51,063 &#160; 37.8% 

The increase in service charges on deposit accounts in the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 is primarily related to increased analysis fees due to an increase in the volume and number of commercial checking accounts resulting from organic growth. 

&#160; 

Income from our wealth management groups (investments, insurance and trust) is also included in noninterest income. For the three months ended March 31, 2020, commissions and fees from investment services at our financial advisory unit, Pinnacle Asset Management, a division of Pinnacle Bank, increased by $3.8 million to $9.2 million compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019. At March 31, 2020 and 2019, Pinnacle Asset Management was receiving commissions and fees in connection with approximately $4.0 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, in brokerage assets. Revenues from the sale of insurance products by our insurance subsidiaries for the three months ended March 31, 2020 increased by $312,000 compared to the same period in the prior year. Included in insurance revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2020 was $1.1 million of contingent income received in the first quarter of 2020 that was based on 2019 sales production and claims experience compared to $815,000 recorded in the same period in the prior year. Additionally, at March 31, 2020, our trust department was receiving fees on approximately $2.7 billion of managed assets compared to $2.3 billion at March 31, 2019, reflecting organic growth and increased market valuations. The growth in our wealth management businesses is attributable to the addition of associates in these areas, market volatility and the attractive markets in which we operate. 

Gains on mortgage loans sold, net, consists of fees from the origination and sale of mortgage loans. These mortgage fees are for loans primarily originated in our current markets that are subsequently sold to third-party investors. Substantially all of these loan sales transfer servicing rights to the buyer. Generally, mortgage origination fees increase in lower interest rate environments and more robust housing markets and decrease in rising interest rate environments and more challenging housing markets. Mortgage origination fees will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as the rate environment changes. Gains on mortgage loans sold, net, were $8.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to $4.9 million for the same period in the prior year. We hedge a portion of our mortgage pipeline as part of a mandatory delivery program. The hedge is not designated as a hedge for GAAP purposes and, as such, changes in its fair value are recorded directly through the income statement. There is a positive correlation between the dollar amount of the mortgage pipeline and the value of this hedge. Therefore, the change in the outstanding mortgage pipeline at the end of any reporting period will directly impact the amount of gain recorded for mortgage loans held for sale during that reporting period. At March 31, 2020, the mortgage pipeline included $288.6 million in loans expected to close in 2020 compared to $115.9 million in loans at March 31, 2019 expected to close in 2019. 

Investment gains and losses on sales, net represent the net gains and losses on sales of investment securities in our available-for-sale securities portfolio during the periods noted. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, we sold approximately $30.2 million of securities for a net gain of $463,000 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019, when we sold approximately $126.6 million of securities for a net loss of $1.9 million. 

Income from equity-method investment. Income from equity-method investment is comprised solely of income from our 49% equity-method investment in BHG. BHG is engaged in the origination of commercial and consumer loans primarily to healthcare providers and other professionals throughout the United States. The loans originated by BHG are either financed by secured borrowings or sold without recourse to independent financial institutions and investors. BHG has expanded its operations to include commercial lending to other professional service firms such as attorneys, accountants and others. 

Income from this equity-method investment was $15.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to $13.3 million for the same period last year. The increased level of contribution we have experienced from BHG in the three months ended March 31, 2020 when compared to the comparable period in 2019 reflects the positive results BHG has experienced as a result of enhancements to its business model, including its marketing efforts. Historically, BHG has sold the majority of the loans its originates to a network of bank purchasers though a combination of online auctions, direct sales and its direct purchase option. In the second half of 2019, BHG began retaining more loans on its balance sheet than historically had been the case in recent years. As a result of the economic disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, BHG, in the first quarter of 2020, sold more loans through its auction platform than we had anticipated would be the case earlier in the year and will likely slow its transition to holding more loans on its balance sheet as the effects of COVID-19 are monitored. As is the case for our business, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on BHG's business is not fully known at this point though, we believe its business, including demand for its loans and losses it may incur as a result of borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, will be negatively impacted. 

Income from equity-method investment is recorded net of amortization expense associated with customer lists and other intangible assets of $293,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to $475,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2019. At March 31, 2020, there wer e $8.5 million of th ese intangible assets that are expected to be amortized in lesser amounts over the next 15 years. Also included in income from equity-method investment, is accretion income associated with the fair valuation of certain of BHG's liabilities of $564,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2020, compared to $683,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2019. At March 31, 2020, there were $4.3 million of these liabilities that are expected to accrete into income in lesser amounts over the next six years. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2020, Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank received dividends from BHG of $8.0 million in the aggregate compared to $12.7 million for the same period in the prior year, which reduced the carrying amount of our investment in BHG, while earnings from BHG during such periods increased the carrying amount of our investment in BHG. Profits from intercompany transactions are eliminated. Our proportionate share of earnings from BHG is included in our consolidated tax return. No loans were purchased from BHG by Pinnacle Bank for the three month periods ended March 31, 2020 or 2019, respectively. Earnings from BHG are likely to fluctuate from period-to-period. 

As our ownership interest in BHG is 49% and our representatives do not occupy a majority of the seats on BHG's board of managers, we do not consolidate BHG's results of operations or financial position into our financial statements but record the net result of BHG's activities at our percentage ownership in income from equity method investment in noninterest income. For the three months ended March 31, 2020, BHG reported $97.9 million in revenues, net of substitution losses of $16.3 million compared to revenues of $62.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, net of substitution losses of $12.4 million. 

Approximately $69.7 million of BHG's revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2020 related to gains on the sale of commercial loans BHG had previously issued primarily to doctor, dentist and other medical practices compared to $48.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. BHG refers to this activity as its core product. BHG typically funds these loans from cash reserves on its balance sheet. Subsequent to origination, these core product loans have typically been sold by BHG with no recourse to a network of community banks and other financial institutions at a premium to the par value of the loan. The purchaser may access a BHG cash reserve account of up to 3% of the loan balance to support loan payments. BHG retains no servicing or other responsibilities related to the core product loan once sold. As a result, this gain on sale premium represents BHG's compensation for absorbing the costs to originate the loan as well as marketing expenses associated with maintaining its business model. 

At March 31, 2020 and 2019, there were $2.8 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, in core product loans previously sold by BHG that were being actively serviced by BHG's network of bank purchasers. BHG, at its sole option, may also provide purchasers of these core product loans the ability to substitute the acquired loan with another more recently-issued BHG loan should the previously-acquired loan become at least 90-days past due as to its monthly payments. This substitution is subject to the purchaser having adhered to the standards of its purchase agreement with BHG. Additionally, all substitutions are subject to the approval by BHG's board of managers. As a result, the reacquired loans are deemed purchased credit impaired and recorded on BHG's balance sheet at the net present value of the loan's anticipated cash flows. BHG will then initiate collection efforts and attempt to restore the reacquired loan to performing status. As a result, BHG maintained a liability as of March 31, 2020 and 2019 of $179.0 million and $91.2 million, respectively, that represents an estimate of the future inherent losses for the outstanding core portfolio that may be subject to future substitution. This liability represents 6.4% and 4.6%, respectively, of core product loans previously sold by BHG that remain outstanding as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in this liability in the three months ended March 31, 2020 was principally the result of the economic disruption associated with the COVID-19 pandemic which has adversely impacted physician and dental practices in a material manner. 

BHG will maintain loans on its balance sheet for a period of time prior to sale or transfer to a purchaser. Alternatively, BHG may elect to keep certain loans on its balance sheet through maturity. From time to time, BHG may hold a higher volume of these loans depending upon the timing of loan originations, their loan pipeline and market demand as well as the deployment of their business strategy. As previously discussed, BHG realigned their business model to retain more of their originated loans on their balance sheet beginning in the second half of 2019. At March 31, 2020, BHG reported loans totaling $735.2 million compared to $412.7 million as of March 31, 2019. A portion of these loans do not qualify for sale accounting and accordingly an offsetting secured borrowing liability has been recorded. At March 31, 2020 and 2019, BHG had $361.8 million and $174.5 million, respectively, of secured borrowings associated with loans held for investment which did not qualify for sale accounting. At March 31, 2020 and 2019, BHG reported allowance for loan losses totaling $9.2 million and $2.5 million, respectively. Interest income and fees amounted to $24.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to $10.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. 

BHG also sometimes refers loans to other financial institutions and, based on an agreement with the institution, earns a fee for doing so. Typically, these are loans that BHG believes would either be classified as consumer-type loans rather than commercial loans, fail to meet the credit underwriting standards of BHG but another institution will accept the loans or are loans issued to borrowers in certain geographic locations where BHG has elected not to do business. For the three months ended March 31, 2020, BHG recognized fee income of $558,000 compared to $629,000 for the same period in the prior year related to these activities. 

Included in other noninterest income are interchange and other consumer fees, gains from bank-owned life insurance, swap fees earned for the facilitation of derivative transactions for our clients, SBA loan sales, gains or losses on other equity investments and other noninterest income items. Interchange revenues increased in the three months ended March 31, 2020 as a result of increased debit and credit card transactions as compared to the comparable periods in 2019 resulting from organic growth. Other noninterest income included changes in the cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance which was $4.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to $4.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. The increase in earnings on these bank-owned life insurance policies resulted primarily from the purchase $60.0 million of new policies purchased in the first quarter of 2019 and an additional $50.0 million in new policies later in 2019. The assets that support these policies are administered by the life insurance carriers and the income we recognize (i.e., increases or decreases in the cash surrender value of the policies) on these policies is dependent upon the crediting rates applied by the insurance carriers, which are subject to change at the discretion of the carriers, subject to any applicable floors. Earnings on these policies generally are not taxable. Loan swap fees increased by $1.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 due primarily to reduced third party fees and an increase in the volume of activity resulting from the current interest rate environment. SBA loan sales are also included in other noninterest income and fluctuate based on the current market environment. Additionally, the carrying values of other equity investments are adjusted either upwards or downwards from the transaction price to reflect expected exit values as evidenced by financing and sale transactions with third parties, or when determination of a valuation adjustment is confirmed through ongoing reviews by senior investment managers. 

Noninterest Expense. &#160; Noninterest expense consists of salaries and employee benefits, equipment and occupancy expenses, other real estate expenses, and other operating expenses. The following is a summary of our noninterest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands): 

&#160; Three Months Ended March 31, 2020 - 2019 Percent &#160; 2020 2019 Increase (Decrease) Noninterest expense: &#160; &#160; &#160; Salaries and employee benefits: &#160; &#160; &#160; Salaries $ 52,176 &#160; $ 45,056 &#160; 15.8 % Commissions 3,983 &#160; 3,140 &#160; 26.8 % Cash and equity incentives 10,280 &#160; 11,163 &#160; (7.9 %) Employee benefits and other 14,041 &#160; 11,017 &#160; 27.4 % Total salaries and employee benefits 80,480 &#160; 70,376 &#160; 14.4 % Equipment and occupancy 20,978 &#160; 19,331 &#160; 8.5 % Other real estate expense, net 2,415 &#160; 246 &#160; 881.7 % Marketing and other business development 3,251 &#160; 2,948 &#160; 10.3 % Postage and supplies 1,990 &#160; 1,892 &#160; 5.2 % Amortization of intangibles 2,520 &#160; 2,311 &#160; 9.0 % Other noninterest expense: Deposit related expense 5,238 &#160; 4,543 &#160; 15.3 % Lending related expense 12,068 &#160; 5,299 &#160; 127.7 % Wealth management related expense 558 &#160; 530 &#160; 5.3 % Other noninterest expense 7,851 &#160; 6,575 &#160; 19.4 % Total other noninterest expense $ 25,715 &#160; $ 16,947 &#160; 51.7 % Total noninterest expense $ 137,349 &#160; $ 114,051 &#160; 20.4 % 

Total salaries and employee benefits expenses increased approximately $10.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, primarily as a result of increases in our associate base and as the result of our annual merit increases that are effective on January 1 of each year. At March 31, 2020, our associate base was 2,562.0 full-time equivalent associates as compared to 2,324.0 at March 31, 2019. We expect salary and benefit expenses will continue to rise though at a lesser percentage rate on a linked-quarter basis as we slow our hiring efforts and focus primarily on expanding our associate base in the Atlanta market and those hires critical to our business across the rest of our franchise. 

We believe that cash and equity incentives are a valuable tool in motivating an associate base that is focused on providing our clients effective financial advice and increasing shareholder value. As a result, and unlike many other financial institutions, all of our bank's non-commissioned associates participate in our annual cash incentive plan with a minimum targeted bonus equal to 10% of each associate's annual salary, and all of our bank's associates participate in our equity compensation plans. Under the annual cash incentive plan, the targeted level of incentive payments requires achievement of a certain soundness threshold and a targeted level of, and average rate paid on, core deposits and earnings (subject to certain adjustments). To the extent that the soundness threshold is met and core deposit volumes and rates and earnings are above or below the targeted amount, the aggregate incentive payments are increased or decreased. Historically, we have paid between 0% and 125% of our targeted incentives. Through the first quarter of 2020, we have accrued incentive costs for the cash incentive plan in 2020 at approximately 50% of our targeted awards. The rate at which we are accruing for payouts under the plan is largely the result of the current and expected future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations and deposit volumes and costs. 

Also included in employee benefits and other expense for the three months ended March 31, 2020 were approximately $5.5 million of compensation expenses related to equity-based awards for restricted shares or restricted share units, including those with performance-based vesting criteria, compared to $4.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. Under our equity incentive plans, we provide a broad-based equity incentive program for all of our bank's associates. We believe that equity incentives provide a vehicle for all associates to become meaningful shareholders of Pinnacle Financial over an extended period of time and create a shareholder-centric culture throughout our organization. Our compensation expense associated with equity awards for the three months ended March 31, 2020 increased when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019. Key drivers of this increase were the first-time inclusion of our associates hired through our acquisition of Advocate Capital in our annual associate grant in January of 2020 as well as additional associates we have hired throughout our footprint. Additionally, performance-based awards to senior management were increased in 2020 compared to 2019. Our compensation expense associated with equity awards with time-based vesting criteria is likely to continue to increase during the remainder of 2020 when compared to 2019 as a result of the increased number of associates and our intention to hire additional experienced financial advisors, though for the remainder of 2020 we will focus primarily on expanding our associate base in the Atlanta market and those hires critical to our business across the rest of our franchise. Compensation expense associated with our performance-based vesting awards will be impacted by our performance in 2020. 

Employee benefits and other expenses were $14.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to $11.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and include costs associated with our 401k plan, health insurance and payroll taxes. 

Equipment and occupancy expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2020 increased $1.6 million to $21.0 million as compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase during the quarter ended March 31, 2020 was largely the result of our growth and increased expenses associated with technology improvements to enhance the infrastructure of our firm. We expect to incur additional costs in future periods as we continue to enhance our technology infrastructure. 

Other real estate income and expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2020 increased $2.2 million to $2.4 million as compared to the same period in the prior year. Included in the quarter ended March 31, 2020 were writedowns of previously foreclosed upon properties to market value based on updated appraisals received. 

Marketing and business development expense for the three months ended March 31, 2020 was $3.3 million compared to $2.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. The primary source of the increase for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 is the associated marketing and business development expenses necessary to support the growth of our firm across our entire footprint, specifically as we build our presence in the Atlanta market. 

Intangible amortization expense was $2.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to $2.3 million for the same period in 2019. The following table outlines our amortizing intangible assets, their initial valuation and amortizable lives at March 31, 2020: 

&#160; Year acquired Initial Valuation (in millions) Amortizable Life (in years) Remaining Value (in millions) Core Deposit Intangible: &#160; &#160; &#160; CapitalMark 2015 $ 6.2 &#160; 7 &#160; $ 0.7 &#160; Magna Bank 2015 3.2 &#160; 6 &#160; 0.2 &#160; Avenue 2016 8.8 &#160; 9 &#160; 3.0 &#160; BNC 2017 48.1 &#160; 10 &#160; 29.3 &#160; Book of Business Intangible: &#160; &#160; &#160; Miller Loughry Beach Insurance 2008 $ 1.3 &#160; 20 &#160; $ 0.2 &#160; CapitalMark 2015 0.3 &#160; 16 &#160; 0.1 &#160; BNC Insurance 2017 0.4 &#160; 20 &#160; 0.3 &#160; BNC Trust 2017 1.9 &#160; 10 &#160; 1.4 &#160; Advocate Capital 2019 13.6 &#160; 13 &#160; 12.1 &#160; 

These assets are being amortized on an accelerated basis which reflects the anticipated life of the underlying assets. Amortization expense of these intangibles is estimated to decrease from $9.5 million to $5.3 million per year over the next five years with lesser amounts for the remaining amortization period. 

Other noninterest expenses, which consists primarily of deposit, lending, wealth management and administrative expenses increased by $8.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019. Deposit related expense increased by $695,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019. Lending related expenses increased $6.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019. This increase is primarily the result of building our off balance sheet reserves following the implementation of CECL effective January 1, 2020 and the effect that macroeconomic factors impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic had on our CECL models. Wealth management related expenses increased during the three months ended March 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019. This increase is directly correlated with increased wealth management activities during the three months ended March 31, 2020. Total other noninterest expenses increased by $1.3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019. These increases are due to a variety of factors and include increases in audit, legal and consulting fees and increased regulatory exam fees. 

Our efficiency ratio (ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income) was 52.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to 47.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2019. The efficiency ratio measures the amount of expense that is incurred to generate a dollar of revenue. The efficiency ratio for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was impacted in part by increased noninterest expense during the period as a result of our building of off balance sheet reserves upon the adoption of CECL during the quarter as well as net gains and losses on sales of securities in both periods. 

Income Taxes. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, we recorded an income tax benefit of $1.7 million compared to income tax expense of $23.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2020 was a benefit of 6.2% compared to expense of 19.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2019. Our effective tax rate differs from the combined federal and state income tax statutory rate in effect of 26.14% primarily due to our investments in bank-qualified municipal securities, tax benefits from our real estate investment trust subsidiary, participation in Tennessee's Community Investment Tax Credit (CITC) program, tax benefits associated with share-based compensation, bank-owned life insurance and our captive insurance subsidiary, offset in part by the limitation on deductibility of meals and entertainment expense, non-deductible FDIC insurance premiums and non-deductible executive compensation. Our tax expense in the first quarter of 2020 was impacted by the provision expense recorded in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which was recorded as a discrete item of total income tax and contributed a tax benefit of $22.4 million. Our tax rate in each period was also impacted by the vesting and exercise of equity-based awards previously granted under our equity-based compensation program, resulting in the recognition of tax benefits of $862,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to tax benefits of $769,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2019. 

Financial Condition 

Our consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2020 reflects an increase in total loans outstanding to $20.4 billion compared to $19.8 billion at December 31, 2019. Total deposits increased by $1.2 billion between December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020. Total assets were $29.3 billion at March 31, 2020 compared to $27.8 billion at December 31, 2019. 

Loans. The composition of loans at March 31, 2020 and at December 31, 2019 and the percentage (%) of each classification to total loans are summarized as follows (in thousands): 

&#160; March 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 &#160; Amount Percent Amount Percent Commercial real estate Owner-occupied $ 2,650,170 &#160; 13.0 % $ 2,669,766 &#160; 13.5 % Non-owner occupied 5,070,572 &#160; 24.9 % 5,039,452 &#160; 25.5 % Consumer real estate &#8211; mortgage 3,106,465 &#160; 15.2 % 3,068,625 &#160; 15.5 % Construction and land development 2,520,937 &#160; 12.4 % 2,430,483 &#160; 12.3 % Commercial and industrial 6,752,317 &#160; 33.1 % 6,290,296 &#160; 31.8 % Consumer and other 296,392 &#160; 1.4 % 289,254 &#160; 1.4 % Total loans $ 20,396,853 &#160; 100.0 % $ 19,787,876 &#160; 100.0 % 

At March 31, 2020, our loan portfolio composition remained consistent with the composition at December 31, 2019 with commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending generally making up the largest segments of our portfolio. At March 31, 2020, approximately 34.3% of the outstanding principal balance of our commercial real estate loans was secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate properties, compared to 34.6% at December 31, 2019. Owner-occupied commercial real estate is similar in many ways to our commercial and industrial lending in that these loans are generally made to businesses on the basis of the cash flows of the business rather than on the valuation of the real estate. Additionally, the construction and land development loan segment continues to be a meaningful portion of our portfolio and reflects the development and growth of the local economies in which we operate and is diversified between commercial, residential and land. 

Banking regulations have established guidelines for the construction ratio of less than 100% of total risk-based capital and for the non-owner occupied ratio of less than 300% of total risk-based capital. Should a bank&#8217;s ratios be in excess of these guidelines, banking regulations generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management. Both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by Pinnacle Bank&#8217;s total risk-based capital. At March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, Pinnacle Bank&#8217;s construction and land development loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital were 84.2% and 83.6%, respectively. Construction and land development, non-owner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital were 264.1% and 268.3% as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. At March 31, 2020, Pinnacle Bank was within the 100% and 300% guidelines and has established what it believes to be appropriate controls to monitor its lending in these areas as it aims to keep the level of these loans to below the 100% and 300% thresholds. 

The following table classifies our fixed and variable rate loans at March 31, 2020 according to contractual maturities of (1) one year or less, (2) after one year through five years, and (3) after five years.

Loans in Past Due Status. &#160; The following table is a summary of our loans that were past due at least 30 days but less than 89 days and 90 days or more past due as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 (in thousands): 

&#160; March 31, December 31, Loans past due 30 to 89 days: 2020 2019 Commercial real estate: Owner occupied $ 8,049 &#160; $ 5,239 &#160; Non-owner occupied 7,763 &#160; 6,797 &#160; Consumer real estate &#8211; mortgage 13,777 &#160; 13,803 &#160; Construction and land development 2,112 &#160; 2,103 &#160; Commercial and industrial 10,841 &#160; 10,952 &#160; Consumer and other 1,177 &#160; 2,184 &#160; Total loans past due 30 to 89 days $ 43,719 &#160; $ 41,078 &#160; Loans past due 90 days or more: &#160; Commercial real estate: Owner occupied $ 2,463 &#160; $ 1,719 &#160; Non-owner occupied 4,705 &#160; 3,816 &#160; Consumer real estate &#8211; mortgage 8,034 &#160; 7,304 &#160; Construction and land development 1,527 &#160; 1,487 &#160; Commercial and industrial 4,565 &#160; 6,364 &#160; Consumer and other 427 &#160; 570 &#160; Total loans past due 90 days or more $ 21,721 &#160; $ 21,260 &#160; Ratios: &#160; Loans past due 30 to 89 days as a percentage of total loans 0.21 % 0.21 % Loans past due 90 days or more as a percentage of total loans 0.11 % 0.11 % Total loans in past due status as a percentage of total loans 0.32 % 0.32 % 

Potential Problem Loans. Potential problem loans, which are not included in nonperforming assets, amounted to approximately $249.2 million, or 1.2% of total loans at March 31, 2020, compared to $276.0 million, or 1.4% of total loans at December 31, 2019. Potential problem loans represent those loans with a well-defined weakness and where information about possible credit problems of borrowers has caused management to have doubts about the borrower's ability to comply with present repayment terms. This definition is believed to be substantially consistent with the standards established by Pinnacle Bank's primary regulators, for loans classified as substandard, excluding the impact of substandard nonaccrual loans and substandard troubled debt restructurings. Troubled debt restructurings are not included in potential problem loans. Approximately $3.9 million of potential problem loans were past due at least 30 days but less than 90 days as of March 31, 2020. 

Nonperforming Assets and Troubled Debt Restructurings. At March 31, 2020, we had $98.2 million in nonperforming assets compared to $91.1 million at December 31, 2019. Included in nonperforming assets were $71.0 million in nonaccrual loans and $27.2 million in OREO and other nonperforming assets at March 31, 2020 and $61.6 million in nonaccrual loans and $29.5 million in OREO and other nonperforming assets at December 31, 2019. At March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there were $3.9 million and $4.9 million, respectively, of troubled debt restructurings, all of which were accruing as of the restructured date and remain on accrual status. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact to its customers, Pinnacle Bank implemented a short-term modification program in accordance with interagency regulatory guidance to provide temporary payment relief to those borrowers directly impacted by COVID-19 who were not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019. This program allows for a deferral of payments for 90 days, which Pinnacle Bank may extend for an additional 90 days, for a maximum of 180 days on a cumulative and successive basis. Pursuant to the interagency regulatory guidance, Pinnacle Financial may elect to not classify loans for which these deferrals are granted as troubled debt restructurings. As of April 30, 2020, we had granted deferrals on approximately $4.1 billion in loans. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans (allowance). On January 1, 2020, we adopted FASB ASU 2016-13, which introduces the current expected credit losses (CECL) methodology and requires us to estimate all expected credit losses over the remaining life of our loan portfolio. Accordingly, beginning in 2020, the allowance for credit losses represents an amount that, in management's evaluation, is adequate to provide coverage for all expected future credit losses on outstanding loans. As of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our allowance for credit losses was approximately $222.5 million and $94.8 million, respectively, which our management believes to be adequate at each of the respective dates. Our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.09% at March 31, 2020, up from 0.48% at December 31, 2019. 

The increase in the allowance for credit losses is largely the result of the implementation of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, which resulted in an adjustment to the opening balance of the allowance for credit losses of $38.1 million, and increased provisioning during the quarter ended March 31, 2020 due primarily to the then current estimated economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our CECL models rely largely on projections of macroeconomic conditions to estimate future credit losses. Macroeconomic factors used in the model include the national unemployment rate, gross domestic product, the commercial real estate price index and certain US Treasury interest rates. Projections of these macroeconomic factors, obtained from an independent third party, are utilized to predict quarterly rates of default. The projections utilized at March 31, 2020 reflect significant deterioration in these macroeconomic factors, most notably unemployment rates, which has resulted in the significant increase in our allowance for credit losses. 

Under the CECL methodology the allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics, and for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with the collectively evaluated pools, evaluations are performed on an individual basis. Losses are predicted over a period of time determined to be reasonable and supportable, and at the end of the reasonable and supportable period losses are reverted to long term historical averages. At March 31, 2020, reasonable and supportable periods ranging from 9 to 18 months were utilized followed by a 12 month straight line reversion period to long term averages. 

The overall balance of our allowance at December 31, 2019 was impacted by fair value accounting on our acquired loan portfolios, for which an allowance for credit losses was only necessary if it exceeded the remaining fair value discount. Subsequent to the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, an allowance for credit losses is recognized for all acquired loans, regardless of the amount of remaining fair value discounts. In addition, the remaining nonaccretable discount at December 31, 2019 was reclassified into the allowance for credit losses upon adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020. At March 31, 2020, the remaining fair value discount for all acquired portfolios was $43.9 million, all of which will be accreted into income over the remaining contractual lives of the related loans. 

For the three months ended March 31, 2020, the net fair value discount changed as follows (in thousands): 

&#160; Accretable Yield Nonaccretable Yield Total December 31, 2019 $ (51,322) &#160; $ (3,828) &#160; $ (55,150) &#160; Reclassification of discount to allowance for credit losses &#8212; &#160; 3,828 &#160; 3,828 &#160; Year-to-date accretion and settlements 7,452 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 7,452 &#160; March 31, 2020 $ (43,870) &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ (43,870) &#160; 

The following table sets forth, based on management's estimate, the allocation of the allowance for credit losses to categories of loans as well as the unallocated portion as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 and the percentage of loans in each category to total loans (in thousands):

Pinnacle Financial's management assesses the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis. This assessment includes procedures to estimate the allowance and test the adequacy and appropriateness of the resulting balance. The level of the allowance is based upon management's evaluation of historical default and loss experience, current and projected economic conditions, asset quality trends, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers' ability to repay the loan (including the timing of future payments), the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, industry and peer bank loan quality indications and other pertinent factors, including regulatory recommendations. The allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries of amounts previously charged-off. For further discussion regarding our allowance for credit losses, refer to Critical Accounting Estimates in Part I Item 2 - Critical Accounting Estimates herein. We expect that the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic will cause our net charge-offs to increase in 2020 when compared to comparable periods in 2019. 

Based upon our evaluation of the loan portfolio, we believe the allowance for credit losses to be adequate to absorb our estimate of expected future credit losses on loans outstanding at March 31, 2020. While our policies and procedures used to estimate the allowance for credit losses as well as the resultant provision for credit losses charged to operations are considered adequate by management, they are necessarily approximate and imprecise. There are factors beyond our control, such as conditions in the local and national economy, local real estate market or a particular industry or borrower which may negatively impact, materially, our asset quality and the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses and, thus, the resulting provision for credit losses. In particular, the length and severity of the economic disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic is difficult to predict and each may be worse than we have estimated, which could cause our provision for credit losses to be negatively impacted for the duration of the pandemic and its aftermath. We believe borrowers that operate in the restaurant, entertainment, hospitality, medical, dental, retail and construction sectors, including owners of commercial real estate properties and hotels, are likely to be the most impacted by the economic disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, though other businesses and nonprofit and religious organizations have been, and are likely to continue to be, impacted as well. If the strict social distancing practices and safer-at-home orders or directives are extended, these impacts could be more severe. 

Investments. &#160; Our investment portfolio, consisting primarily of Federal agency bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and state and municipal securities amounted to $4.1 billion and $3.7 billion at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Our investment portfolio serves many purposes including serving as a stable source of income, as collateral for public funds deposits and as a potential liquidity source. A summary of our investment portfolio at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 follows: 

&#160; March 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Weighted average life 6.24 years 6.55 years Effective duration* 4.34% 4.75% Tax equivalent yield 2.82% 2.85% 

(*) The metric is presented net of fair value hedges tied to certain investment portfolio holdings. The effective duration of the investment portfolio without the fair value hedges as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 was 5.32% and 5.89%, respectively. 

Restricted Cash. Our restricted cash balances totaled approximately $243.3 million at March 31, 2020, compared to $137.0 million at December 31, 2019. This restricted cash is maintained at other financial institutions as collateral primarily for our derivative portfolio. The increase in restricted cash is attributable primarily to an increase in collateral requirements on certain derivative instruments for which the fair value has declined. See Note 8. Derivative Instruments in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 

Deposits and Other Borrowings. We had approximately $21.3 billion of deposits at March 31, 2020 compared to $20.2 billion at December 31, 2019. Our deposits consist of noninterest and interest-bearing demand accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and time deposits. Additionally, we routinely enter into agreements with certain customers to sell certain securities under agreements to repurchase the security the following day. These agreements (which are typically associated with comprehensive treasury management programs for our clients and provide them with short-term returns for their excess funds) amounted to $186.5 million at March 31, 2020 and $126.4 million at December 31, 2019. Additionally, at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, Pinnacle Bank had borrowed $2.3 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati (FHLB). At March 31, 2020, Pinnacle Bank had approximately $1.9 billion in additional availability with the FHLB; however, incremental borrowings are made in a formal request by Pinnacle Bank and the subsequent approval by the FHLB. Our efforts to increase our on-balance sheet liquidity in the second half of the first quarter resulted in increased borrowings from the FHLB Cincinnati. 

Generally, we have classified our funding base as either core funding or noncore funding as shown in the table below. The following table represents the balances of our deposits and other funding and the percentage of each type to the total at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019:

(1) The reciprocating categories consists of deposits we receive from a bank network (the Promontory network) in connection with deposits of our customers in excess of our FDIC coverage limit that we place with the Promontory network. 

As noted in the table above, our core funding as a percentage of total funding decreased from 76.2% at December 31, 2019 to 75.9% at March 31, 2020, primarily as a result of our intentional increase in wholesale funding to build on-balance sheet liquidity as we prepared for the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as increased competition for core deposits in our markets. 

When wholesale funding is necessary to complement the company's core deposit base, management determines which source is best suited to address both liquidity risk management and interest rate risk management objectives. Our Asset Liability Management Policy imposes limitations on overall wholesale funding reliance and on brokered deposit exposure specifically. Both our overall reliance on wholesale funding and exposure to brokered deposits and brokered time deposits were within those policy limitations as of March 31, 2020. 

Our funding policies impose limits on the amount of non-core funding we can utilize based on the non-core funding dependency ratio which is calculated pursuant to regulatory guidelines. Periodically, we may exceed our policy limitations, at which time management will develop plans to bring our funding sources back into compliance with our core funding ratios. At March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with our core funding policies. Though growing our core deposit base is a key strategic objective of our firm and we experienced meaningful growth in core deposits in the first quarter of 2020, we may increase our non-core funding amounts from current levels if we need to do so to fund growth or increase levels of on-balance sheet liquidity, but we do not currently anticipate that such increases will exceed the limits we have established in our internal policies for total levels of non-core funding. 

&#160; 

The amount of time deposits as of March 31, 2020 amounted to $4.2 billion. The following table shows our time deposits in denominations of $100,000 and less and in denominations greater than $100,000 by category based on time remaining until maturity and the weighted average rate for each category as of March 31, 2020 (in thousands):

Subordinated debt and other borrowings. We have established, or through acquisition acquired, a number of statutory business trusts which were established to issue 30-year trust preferred securities and related junior subordinated debt instruments and certain other subordinated debt agreements. These securities qualify as Tier 2 capital subject to annual phase outs beginning five years from maturity. We also have a $75.0 million revolving credit facility that matures on July 24, 2020 which had no amounts outstanding as of March 31, 2020. These instruments are outlined below (in thousands):

An unused fee of 0.30% is assessed on the average daily unused amount of the loan. On April 22, 2020, the facility was amended to extend the maturity date to July 24, 2020. 

&#160; 

Effective January 1, 2020, we used $80.0 million of the net proceeds from our 2019 subordinated debt offering to redeem certain other of our subordinated notes, including the $20.0 million aggregate principal amount of Avenue subordinated notes and $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of BNC subordinated notes. We had previously anticipated using $130 million of the net proceeds from our 2019 subordinated debt offering to redeem two tranches of subordinated notes issued by Pinnacle Bank with a maturity date of July 30, 2025 but have decided to not redeem those notes at this time in light of the uncertainty resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Pursuant to regulatory guidelines, once the maturity date on these subordinated notes is within five years, a portion of the notes will no longer be eligible to be included in regulatory capital, with an additional portion being excluded each year over the five year period approaching maturity. 

Capital Resources. At both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our shareholders' equity amounted to $4.4 billion. During the quarter ended March 31, 2020, changes to shareholders' equity were attributable to increases in our net income and other comprehensive income offset in part by $50.8 million related to shares repurchased pursuant to the share repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors in November 2018 and October 2019. We currently have approximately $67.2 million remaining of our authorized repurchase program which is set to expire December 31, 2020. In March 2020, we suspended our share repurchase program in light of uncertainty regarding the length and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. For additional information regarding our capital and shareholders&#8217; equity, see Note 10. Regulatory Matters in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 

Dividends. Pursuant to Tennessee banking law, our bank may not, without the prior consent of the TDFI, pay any dividends to us in a calendar year in excess of the total of our bank's retained net profits for that year plus the retained net profits for the preceding two years, which was $571.3 million at March 31, 2020. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, our bank paid dividends of $44.1 million to us which is within the limits allowed by the TDFI. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2020, we paid $12.4 million in dividends to our common shareholders. On April 21, 2020, our board of directors declared a $0.16 per share quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders which should approximate $12.4 million in aggregate dividend payments that are expected to be paid on May 29, 2020 to common shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 1, 2020. The amount and timing of all future dividend payments, if any, is subject to board discretion and will depend on our receipt of dividends from Pinnacle Bank earnings, capital position, financial condition and other factors, including regulatory capital requirements, as they become known to and receipt of any regulatory approvals that may become required as a result of our and our bank subsidiary's financial results. 

Market and Liquidity Risk Management 

Our objective is to manage assets and liabilities to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies. Our Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) is charged with the responsibility of monitoring these policies, which are designed to ensure acceptable composition of asset/liability mix. Two critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management. 

Interest Rate Sensitivity. &#160; In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates. ALCO measures and evaluates the interest rate risk so that we can meet customer demands for various types of loans and deposits. ALCO determines the most appropriate amounts of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items. Measurements which we use to help us manage interest rate sensitivity include an earnings simulation model and an economic value of equity (EVE) model. 

Our interest rate sensitivity modeling incorporates a number of assumptions for both earnings simulation and EVE, including loan and deposit re-pricing characteristics, the rate of loan prepayments, etc. ALCO periodically reviews these assumptions for accuracy based on historical data and future expectations. Our ALCO policy requires that the base scenario assumes rates remain flat and is the scenario to which all others are compared in order to measure the change in net interest income and EVE. Policy limits are applied to the results of certain modeling scenarios. While the primary policy scenarios focus is on a twelve month time frame for the earnings simulations model, longer time horizons are also modeled. All policy scenarios assume a static volume forecast where the balance sheet is held constant, although other scenarios are modeled. 

During the first quarter of 2020, several unique events occurred that are noteworthy when comparing the results of both the earnings simulation and the economic value of equity modeling results as of March 31, 2020 to the modeling results at December 31, 2019: 

&#8226; In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve reduced the target federal funds rate by 150 basis points. 

&#8226; The spread between LIBOR rates and the federal funds rate expanded to unusually high levels that had not been seen since 2008. 

&#8226; We unwound a $1.3 billion in-the-money interest rate floor. 

Earnings simulation model. We believe interest rate risk is best measured by our earnings simulation modeling. Earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments are combined with forecasts of interest rates for the next 12 months and are combined with other factors in order to produce various earnings simulations over that same 12-month period. To limit interest rate risk, we have policy guidelines for our earnings at risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest income in both gradual and instantaneous changes to interest rates. For instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates from management's flat interest rate forecast over the next twelve months, assuming a static balance sheet, the following estimated changes are calculated: 

Estimated % Change in Net Interest Income Over 12 Months March 31, 2020 Instantaneous Rate Change 100 bps increase (0.3 %) 200 bps increase 0.8 % 100 bps decrease (3.1 %) 

While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Further, the earnings simulation model does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, hedging activities we might take and changing product spreads that could mitigate any potential adverse impact of changes in interest rates. 

The behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios set out in the table above is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. The projected impact on net interest income in the table above assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternative rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher-yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce the assumed benefit of those deposits. The projected impact on net interest income in the table above also assumes a "through-the-cycle" non-maturity deposit beta which may not be an accurate predictor of actual deposit rate changes realized in scenarios of smaller and/or non-parallel interest rate movements. 

At March 31, 2020, our earnings simulation model indicated we were in compliance with our policies for interest rate scenarios for which we model as required by our board approved Asset Liability Policy. 

Economic value of equity model. While earnings simulation modeling attempts to determine the impact of a changing rate environment to our net interest income, our EVE model measures estimated changes to the economic values of our assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items as a result of interest rate changes. Economic values are determined by discounting expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, which establishes a base case EVE. We then shock rates as prescribed by our Asset Liability Policy and measure the sensitivity in EVE values for each of those shocked rate scenarios versus the base case. The Asset Liability Policy sets limits for those sensitivities. At March 31, 2020, our EVE modeling calculated the following estimated changes in EVE due to instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates: 

March 31, 2020 Instantaneous Rate Change 100 bps increase (2.2 %) 200 bps increase (7.8 %) 100 bps decrease (1.3 %) 

While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current year). Further, EVE does not take into account factors such as 

future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, hedging activities we might take and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. 

At March 31, 2020, our EVE model indicated we were in compliance with our policies for all interest rate scenarios for which we model as required by our board approved Asset Liability Policy. 

Most likely earnings simulation models. We also analyze a most-likely earnings simulation scenario that projects the expected change in rates based on a forward yield curve adopted by management using expected balance sheet volumes forecasted by management. Separate growth assumptions are developed for loans, investments, deposits, etc. Other interest rate scenarios analyzed by management may include delayed rate shocks, yield curve steepening or flattening, or other variations in rate movements to further analyze or stress our balance sheet under various interest rate scenarios. Each scenario is evaluated by management and weighted to determine the most likely result. These processes assist management to better anticipate our financial results and, as a result, management may determine the need to invest in other operating strategies and tactics which might enhance results or better position the firm's balance sheet to reduce interest rate risk going forward. 

Each of the above analyses may not, on its own, be an accurate indicator of how our net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. In addition, the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgage loans, have features (generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors) which limit changes in interest rates. Prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments. The ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates. ALCO reviews each of the above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with several different interest rate scenarios as part of its responsibility to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies. 

Management's model governance, model implementation and model validation processes and controls are subject to review in our regulatory examinations to ensure they are in compliance with the most recent regulatory guidelines and industry and regulatory practices. Management utilizes a respected, sophisticated third party asset liability modeling software to help ensure implementation of management's assumptions into the model are processed as intended in a robust manner. That said, there are numerous assumptions regarding financial instrument behavior that are integrated into the model. The assumptions are formulated by combining observations gleaned from our historical studies of financial instruments and our best estimations of how, if at all, these instruments may behave in the future given changes in economic conditions, technology, etc. These assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. Additionally, given the large number of assumptions built into firms' asset liability modeling software, it is difficult, at best, to compare our results to other firms. 

ALCO may determine that Pinnacle Financial should over time become more or less asset or liability sensitive depending on the underlying balance sheet circumstances and our conclusions as to anticipated interest rate fluctuations in future periods. At present, ALCO has determined that its "most likely" rate scenario considers no change in short-term interest rates throughout the remainder of 2020. Our "most likely" rate forecast is based primarily on information we acquire from a service which includes a consensus forecast of numerous interest rate benchmarks. We may implement additional actions designed to achieve our desired sensitivity position which could change from time to time. 

We have in the past used, and may in the future continue to use, derivative financial instruments as one tool to manage our interest rate sensitivity, including in our mortgage lending program, while continuing to meet the credit and deposit needs of our customers. For further details on the derivatives we currently use, see Note 8. Derivative Instruments in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 

We may also enter into interest rate swaps to facilitate customer transactions and meet their financing needs. These swaps qualify as derivatives, even though they are not designated as hedging instruments. 

Liquidity Risk Management . The purpose of liquidity risk management is to ensure that there are sufficient cash flows to satisfy loan demand, deposit withdrawals, and our other needs. Traditional sources of liquidity for a bank include asset maturities and growth in core deposits. A bank may achieve its desired liquidity objectives from the management of its assets and liabilities and by internally generated funding through its operations. Funds invested in marketable instruments that can be readily sold and the continuous 

maturing of other earning assets are sources of liquidity from an asset perspective. The liability base provides sources of liquidity through attraction of increased deposits and borrowing funds from various other institutions. 

To assist in determining the adequacy of our liquidity, we perform a variety of liquidity stress tests including idiosyncratic, systemic and combined scenarios for both moderate and severe events. Liquidity is defined as the ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities. Liquidity management involves maintaining our ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of our customers, both depositors and borrowers. We seek to maintain a sufficiently liquid asset balance to ensure our ability to meet our obligations. The amount of the appropriate minimum liquid asset balance is determined through severe liquidity stress testing as measured by our liquidity coverage ratio calculation. At March 31, 2020, we were in compliance with our internal policies related to liquidity coverage ratio. 

Changes in interest rates also affect our liquidity position. We currently price deposits in response to market rates. If deposits are not priced in response to market rates, a loss of deposits, particularly noncore deposit, could occur which would negatively affect our liquidity position. 

Scheduled loan payments are a relatively stable source of funds, but loan payoffs and deposit flows fluctuate significantly, being influenced by interest rates, general economic conditions and competition. Additionally, debt security investments are subject to prepayment and call provisions that could accelerate their payoff prior to stated maturity. We attempt to price our deposit products to meet our asset/liability objectives consistent with local market conditions. Our ALCO is responsible for monitoring our ongoing liquidity needs. Our regulators also monitor our liquidity and capital resources on a periodic basis. 

In addition, our bank is a member of the FHLB Cincinnati. As a result, our bank receives advances from the FHLB Cincinnati, pursuant to the terms of various borrowing agreements, which support our funding needs. Under the borrowing agreements with the FHLB Cincinnati, our bank has pledged certain qualifying residential mortgage loans and, pursuant to a blanket lien, all qualifying commercial mortgage loans as collateral. As such, Pinnacle Bank may use the FHLB Cincinnati as a source of liquidity depending on its ALCO strategies. Additionally, we may pledge additional qualifying assets or reduce the amount of pledged assets with the FHLB Cincinnati to increase or decrease our borrowing capacity with the FHLB Cincinnati. At March 31, 2020, we estimate we had $1.9 billion in additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB Cincinnati. However, incremental borrowings are made via a formal request by Pinnacle Bank and the subsequent approval by the FHLB Cincinnati. At March 31, 2020, our bank had received advances from the FHLB Cincinnati totaling $2.3 billion. At March 31, 2020, the scheduled maturities of Pinnacle Bank's FHLB Cincinnati advances and interest rates are as follows (in thousands): 

Scheduled Maturities Amount Interest Rates (1) 

2020 $ 502,504 &#160; 1.34% 2021 798,750 &#160; 1.45% 2022 41,250 &#160; 2.85% 2023 &#8212; &#160; &#8212;% 2024 200,000 &#160; 2.09% Thereafter 775,016 &#160; 2.15% Total $ 2,317,520 &#160; Weighted average interest rate 1.74% 

(1) Some FHLB Cincinnati advances include variable interest rates and could increase in the future. The table reflects rates in effect as of March 31, 2020. 

Pinnacle Bank also has accommodations with upstream correspondent banks available for unsecured short-term advances which aggregate $195.0 million. These accommodations have various covenants related to their term and availability, and in most cases must be repaid within a month of borrowing. We had no outstanding borrowings at March 31, 2020 under these agreements. Our bank also had approximately $3.4 billion in available Federal Reserve discount window lines of credit at March 31, 2020. 

At March 31, 2020, excluding reciprocating time and money market deposits issued through the Promontory Network, we had $1.8 billion of brokered deposits. Historically, we have issued brokered certificates of deposit through several different brokerage houses based on competitive bid. During the quarter ended March 31, 2020, and in response to the uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we increased our levels of on-balance sheet liquidity. This increase was funded by a combination of increased core deposits, increased borrowings from the FHLB Cincinnati and increases in brokered time deposits. 

Banking regulators have defined additional liquidity guidelines, through the issuance of the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Modified LCR. These regulatory guidelines became effective January 2015 with phase in over subsequent years and require these large institutions to follow prescriptive guidance in determining an absolute level of a high quality liquid asset (HQLA) buffer that must be maintained on their balance sheets in order to withstand a potential liquidity crisis event. Although Pinnacle Financial 

follows the principles outlined in the Interagency Policy Statement on Liquidity Risk Management, issued March 2010, to determine its HQLA buffer, Pinnacle Financial is not currently subject to these regulations. However, these formulas could eventually be imposed on smaller banks, such as Pinnacle Bank, and require an increase in the absolute level of liquidity on our balance sheet, which could result in lower net interest margins for us in future periods. 

At March 31, 2020, we had no individually significant commitments for capital expenditures. But, we believe the number of our locations, including non-branch locations, will increase over an extended period of time across our footprint. In future periods, these expansions may lead to additional equipment and occupancy expenses as well as related increases in salaries and benefits expense. Additionally, we expect we will continue to incur costs associated with technology improvements to enhance the infrastructure of our firm. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. &#160; At March 31, 2020, we had outstanding standby letters of credit of $200.4 million and unfunded loan commitments outstanding of $8.0 billion. Because these commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and many will expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment level does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. If needed to fund these outstanding commitments, Pinnacle Bank has the ability to liquidate Federal funds sold or, on a short-term basis, to borrow and purchase Federal funds from other financial institutions. 

Impact of Inflation 

The consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and practices within the banking industry which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than the effects of general levels of inflation.
