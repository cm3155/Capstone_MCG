 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following is a discussion of our financial condition at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 and our results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. The purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about our financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from our consolidated financial statements. The following discussion and analysis should be read along with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein and the risk factors discussed in Part II, Item 1A - Risk Factors , herein as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 (Form 10-K) and the other reports we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission since we filed that Form 10-K. 

Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic 

On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency related to a novel strain of the coronavirus, COVID-19. With that declaration, we activated our pandemic response team and began work to prepare both our associates and clients for the impact of COVID-19. The spread of COVID-19 has created a global public health crisis that has resulted in unprecedented uncertainty, volatility and disruption in financial markets and in governmental, commercial and consumer activity in the United States and globally, including the markets that we serve. These actions included the decision by the Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee to lower the target for the federal funds rate to a range of between zero to 0.25% on March 15, 2020. This action followed a prior reduction of the targeted federal funds rate to a range of 1.0% to 1.25% on March 3, 2020. 

We have been intentional in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure strength in our balance sheet, including increases in liquidity and reserves. As a part of this intentional response, during the second quarter of 2020, we performed an in-depth review of all risk-graded loans greater than $1.0 million for which we had granted the borrower the ability to defer the payment of principal and/or interest for a period of up to 90 days following the COVID-19 outbreak. We also performed an in-depth review of all of our hotel and retail commercial real estate loans greater than $1.0 million regardless of their receipt of deferral. Additionally, we have continued to adjust our business practices, including restricting employee travel, encouraging employees to work from home, where possible, converting to drive-thru only service with specific needs facilitated by appointment, implementing social distancing guidelines within our offices and by the launch of our pandemic response team, which continues to meet on a regular basis. 

On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ("CARES") Act was signed into law. It contains substantial tax and spending provisions intended to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act includes the Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP"), a program designed to aid small- and medium-sized businesses, sole proprietors and other self-employed persons through federally guaranteed loans distributed through banks. These loans are intended to guarantee eight to 24 weeks of payroll and other costs to provide support to participating businesses and increase the ability of these businesses to retain workers. As of June 30, 2020, we had obtained approvals for approximately 14,000 clients totaling approximately $2.3 billion in approved loans. These loans are fully guaranteed by the SBA, carry a term of two or five years, dependent on the date originated, and a 1.0% annualized rate. Inclusive of fees from the SBA, our yield on PPP loans in the second quarter was 2.89%. The reduction in approved dollars from the amounts we previously disclosed as of April 30, 2020 is the result of PPP loans that borrowers chose to return to the SBA prior to June 30, 2020. 

We have also implemented a short-term loan modification program to provide temporary payment relief to certain of our borrowers. This program allows for a deferral of principal and/or interest payments for 90 days, which we may extend for an additional 90 days, for a maximum of 180 days on a cumulative and successive basis. As of June 30, 2020, we had granted deferrals on approximately $4.2 billion in aggregate principal amount of loans. As of July 17, 2020, loans with aggregate principal balances of approximately $2.7 billion remained on deferral. 

We believe our response has allowed and continues to allow us to appropriately support our associates, clients and their communities. The COVID-19 pandemic along with the implementation of CECL have contributed to an increased provision for credit losses for the first half of 2020 and an extended duration of economic disruption resulting from the virus could lead to increased net charge-offs and continued elevated levels of provisioning expense. We continue to monitor both the impact of COVID-19 and the effects of the CARES Act closely; however, the extent to which each will impact our operations and financial results during the remainder of 2020 remains uncertain. 

Overview 

Our diluted net income per common share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 was $0.83 and $1.20, respectively, compared to $1.31 and $2.53, respectively, for the same periods in 2019. At June 30, 2020, reflecting the significant number of loans 

we had originated under the PPP, loans had increased to $22.5 billion, as compared to $19.8 billion at December 31, 2019, and total deposits increased to $25.5 billion at June 30, 2020 from $20.2 billion at December 31, 2019. 

Results of Operations. Our net interest income increased to $200.7 million and $394.2 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to $188.9 million and $376.2 million, respectively, for the same periods in the prior year, representing increases of $11.7 million and $18.0 million, respectively. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 when compared to the comparable periods in 2019, this increase was largely the result of lower cost of funds, the impact of both interest and fees related to the PPP and our acquisition of additional liquidity in response to the economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as organic loan growth during the comparable periods. The net interest margin (the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 was 2.87% and 3.06%, respectively, compared to 3.48% and 3.55%, respectively, for the same periods in 2019 and reflects the impact of loans made pursuant to the PPP and our acquisition of additional on-balance sheet liquidity as noted above, the decline in short-term interest rates, declining levels of positive impact from purchase accounting and the competitive rate environments for loans and deposits in our markets. 

Our provision for credit losses was $68.3 million and $168.2 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to $7.2 million and $14.4 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2019. The primary drivers of the increase in provision were the anticipated economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and our adoption of FASB ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020. ASU 2016-13, which introduces the current expected credit losses (CECL) methodology, requires us to estimate all expected credit losses over the remaining life of our loan portfolio. Also contributing to the increase in provision was an increase in net charge-offs, which totaled $5.4 million and $15.5 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to $4.1 million and $7.7 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2019. The increase in net charge-offs in the first six months of 2020 was in large part the result of an approximately $5.0 million charge-off related to a single credit in the commercial and industrial loan category during the first quarter of 2020. This credit was criticized going into the COVID-19 pandemic and as a result of the pandemic suffered further deterioration resulting in its partial charge-off during the first quarter of 2020. During the second quarter of 2020, we had a partial recovery of approximately $1.7 million on this credit. 

At June 30, 2020, our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans, inclusive of PPP loans, was 1.27% compared to 0.48% at December 31, 2019. The increase in the allowance for credit losses is largely the result of the implementation of CECL on January 1, 2020, which resulted in an adjustment to the opening balance of the allowance for credit losses of $38.1 million, and increased provisioning during the first half of 2020 due to the anticipated economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in the opening balance upon the implementation of CECL is partially attributable to a change in the treatment of acquired loans. Prior to the adoption of CECL, acquired loans required an allowance only if estimated credit losses exceeded the remaining purchase accounting fair value discounts. Under CECL, an allowance for credit losses is recognized for all loans without regard to fair value discounts. Also contributing to the increase in the opening balance upon adoption was an overall increase in reserve rates under CECL due to the estimation of all expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life of the portfolio rather than only probable incurred losses as was required under the prior accounting standard. 

Noninterest income increased by $2.3 million, or 3.2%, and $21.6 million, or 17.7%, respectively, during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. The growth in noninterest income was in large part attributable to gains on mortgage loans sold, net, which increased by $13.6 million and $17.3 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 as compared to the same periods in the prior year, largely due to the favorable interest rate environment as well are our increased number of mortgage originators in the respective periods. These gains on mortgage loans sold, net, were offset in part by a decrease in income from our equity method investment in BHG of $15.1 million, or 46.7%, and $12.8 million, or 28.0%, respectively, during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in the prior year. Additionally impacting noninterest income were wealth management revenues of $12.2 million and $28.8 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to $11.5 million and $23.2 million, respectively, in the same periods in the prior year as well as $128,000 in net losses and $335,000 in net gains on sales of securities, respectively, during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to $4.5 million and $6.4 million, respectively, in net losses on sales of securities during the same periods in the prior year. Other noninterest income, which is the result of fee revenue lines of business other than those noted above, increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 by $725,000 and $6.2 million, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the prior year. 

Noninterest expense increased by $3.9 million, or 3.1%, and $27.2 million, or 11.3%, during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2019. Impacting noninterest expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 as compared to the same prior year periods was the $1.7 million decrease and $8.4 million increase, respectively, in salaries and employee benefits. The change in salaries and employee benefits was the result of an increase in our associate base in the first six months of 2020 versus the first six months of 2019 offset in part, or in the case of the three months ended June 30, 2020, in whole, by the reduction of our cash incentive plan accrual as well as the reduction in stock-based compensation expense due to our performance through the first half of 2020 compared to the earnings per share performance metric targets established pursuant to our 

annual cash incentive plan and the return on average tangible assets performance metric targets applicable pursuant to certain performance-based equity awards we have previously awarded, each due to the effects of COVID-19 on our anticipated earnings and performance for the year ended December 31, 2020. Also impacting noninterest expense in the first half of 2020 was $9.7 million in lending related costs related to an increase in our off balance sheet reserves. The increase in the expense related to off balance sheet reserves during the six months ended June 30, 2020 was largely due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on expected credit losses under CECL. 

Our efficiency ratio (the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income) was 48.1% and 50.0%, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 49.2% and 48.6%, respectively, for the same periods in 2019. The efficiency ratio measures the amount of expense that is incurred to generate a dollar of revenue. 

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, we recorded income tax expense of $11.2 million and $9.6 million, respectively, compared to income tax expense of $24.4 million and $47.5 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019. Our effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 was 15.2% and 9.5%, respectively, compared to 19.6% for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2019. Our tax expense in the first half of 2020 was impacted by the provision for credit losses recorded in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a portion of which was recorded as a discrete item of total income tax in the first quarter of 2020 and contributed a tax benefit of $22.4 million. Our tax rate in each period was also impacted by the vesting and exercise of equity-based awards previously granted under our equity-based compensation program, resulting in the recognition of tax expense of $272,000 and a tax benefit of $590,000, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to tax expense of $68,000 and a tax benefit of $701,000, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019. 

Financial Condition. &#160; Net loans increased $2.7 billion, or 13.8%, during the six months ended June 30, 2020, when compared to December 31, 2019. Contributing to increased loan volumes during the six months ended June 30, 2020, were $2.2 billion of loans, as of June 30, 2020, issued through the Small Business Administration's (SBA's) Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The remainder of the increase is primarily the result of loans made to borrowers that principally operate or are located in our core markets that were made prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, increases in the number of relationship advisors we employ and continued focus on attracting new customers to our company. Total deposits were $25.5 billion at June 30, 2020, compared to $20.2 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $5.3 billion, or 26.5%. Deposit growth during the period was likely aided by our clients' need to build liquidity going into the COVID-19 pandemic and current stock market conditions, but was also due in part to our intentional emphasis on gathering low cost core deposits during 2020. Although it is difficult to measure precisely the level of increased deposits that came to us from the PPP, we estimate that our PPP borrowers increased their deposit balances with us by approximately $1.7 billion between March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020. 

Capital and Liquidity. At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our capital ratios, including our bank's capital ratios, exceeded regulatory minimum capital requirements and those necessary to be considered well-capitalized under applicable federal regulations. See Note 10. Regulatory Matters in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. From time to time we may be required to support the capital needs of our bank (Pinnacle Bank). At June 30, 2020, we had approximately $318.8 million of cash at the parent company to be used to support our bank. 

During the second quarter of 2020, we issued 9.0 million depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of our 6.75% fixed rate non-cumulative, perpetual preferred stock, Series B (Series B Preferred Stock) in a registered public offering to both retail and institutional investors. Net proceeds from the transaction after underwriting discounts and offering expenses payable by us were approximately $217.6 million. The net proceeds were retained at Pinnacle Financial and are available to support our capital needs and other obligations, including payments related to our outstanding indebtedness, to support the capital needs and other obligations of our bank and for other general corporate purposes. Additionally, we believe we have various capital raising techniques available to us to provide for the capital needs of our company and bank, such as the $300 million subordinated debt offering issued during the third quarter of 2019 or entering into a new revolving credit facility with another financial institution. We also periodically evaluate capital markets conditions to identify opportunities to access those markets if necessary or prudent to support our capital levels. 

On November 13, 2018, Pinnacle Financial announced that its board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $100.0 million of Pinnacle Financial&#8217;s outstanding common stock and on October 15, 2019, the board approved an additional $100.0 million of repurchase authorization. The initial repurchase program expired on March 31, 2020, with the additional $100.0 million authorization expiring on December 31, 2020. Prior to January 1, 2020, we repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $82.1 million. During the quarter ended March 31, 2020, we repurchased approximately 1.0 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $50.8 million. Our last purchase of shares of our common stock occurred on March 19, 2020. We suspended our repurchase program at the end of the first quarter of 2020 and it remains suspended until we gain more clarity on the length and depth of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The accounting principles we follow and our methods of applying these principles conform with U.S. GAAP and with general practices within the banking industry. On January 1, 2020, we adopted FASB ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) which significantly changes our methodology for determining our allowance for credit losses, and ASU 2017-04 , Intangibles &#8211; Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment which simplifies our process for performing goodwill impairment testing. See Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for further information related to these changes. There have been no other significant changes to our Critical Accounting Estimates as described in our Form 10-K.

Results of Operations 

Net Interest Income. Net interest income represents the amount by which interest earned on various earning assets exceeds interest paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities and is the most significant component of our revenues. 

Net interest income totaled $200.7 million and $394.2 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to $188.9 million and $376.2 million, respectively, for the same periods in the prior year, representing increases of $11.7 million and $18.0 million, respectively. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 when compared to the comparable periods in 2019, this increase was largely the result of lower funding costs, the impact of the PPP and our acquisition of additional on-balance 

sheet liquidity in response to the economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as organic loan growth during the comparable periods. 

The following tables set forth the amount of our average balances, interest income or interest expense for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the average interest rate for interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, net interest spread and net interest margin for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands):

(3) Yields realized on interest-bearing assets less the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The net interest spread calculation excludes the impact of demand deposits. Had the impact of demand deposits been included, the net interest spread for the three months ended June 30, 2020 would have been 2.84% compared to a net interest spread of 3.42% for the three months ended June 30, 2019. 

(4) Net interest margin is the result of annualized net interest income calculated on a tax-equivalent basis divided by average interest-earning assets for the period.

The tax-exempt benefit has been reduced by the projected impact of tax-exempt income that will be disallowed pursuant to IRS Regulations as of and for the period presented. 

(3) Yields realized on interest-bearing assets less the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The net interest spread calculation excludes the impact of demand deposits. Had the impact of demand deposits been included, the net interest spread for the six months ended June 30, 2020 would have been 3.02% compared to a net interest spread of 3.49% for the six months ended June 30, 2019. 

(4) Net interest margin is the result of annualized net interest income calculated on a tax-equivalent basis divided by average interest-earning assets for the period. 

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, our net interest margin was 2.87% and 3.06%, respectively, compared to 3.48% and 3.55%, respectively, for the same periods in 2019. Our net interest margin for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 reflects the impact of PPP and the firm's acquisition of additional on-balance sheet liquidity as noted above, the decline in short-term interest rates, declining levels of positive impact from purchase accounting and the competitive rate environments for loans and deposits in our markets. More specifically, our net interest margin was negatively impacted by yield compression in our earning asset portfolio due to a declining macroeconomic interest rate environment, which included a 150 basis points reduction in the federal funds rate in March 2020. This decrease was offset somewhat by a decrease in funding costs. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, our earning asset yield decreased by 127 basis points and 93 basis points, respectively, from the same periods in the prior year. Our total funding rates decreased by 69 basis points and 46 basis points, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. 

We continue to deploy various asset liability management strategies to manage our risk to interest rate fluctuations. Pricing for creditworthy borrowers and meaningful depositors is very competitive in our markets and this competition has adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our margins. This challenging competitive environment may continue during 2020 even during a time of economic uncertainty due to COVID-19. We also expect the positive impact of purchase accounting on our net interest income will lessen in future periods, which will negatively affect our net interest margin in 2020. We have sought to mitigate much of the negative impact that reductions in short-term interest rates would have on our net interest margin through restructuring a portion of our investment securities portfolio, purchasing loan interest rate floors, and unwinding fixed-to-floating loan interest rate swaps. Those tactics have benefited us during this recent period of falling short-term interest rates. However, our net interest margin could be additionally impacted if we are not able to continue to lower deposit rates at a pace necessary to offset declines in our earning asset yields. We determined that holding elevated levels of on-balance sheet liquidity is a prudent response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This strategy will negatively impact the net interest margin until on-balance sheet liquidity returns to more normalized levels. We seek to fund increased loan volumes by growing our core deposits, but will utilize non-core funding to fund shortfalls, if any. To the extent that our dependence on non-core funding sources increases during 2020, our net interest margin would likely be negatively impacted as we may not be able to reduce the rates we pay on these deposits as quickly as we can on core deposits. 

Provision for Credit Losses. On January 1, 2020, we adopted FASB ASU 2016-13, which introduces the current expected credit losses (CECL) methodology and requires us to estimate all expected credit losses over the remaining life of our loan and held-to-maturity securities portfolios. Accordingly, the provision for credit losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish an allowance for credit losses that, in management's evaluation, is adequate to provide coverage for all expected credit losses. The provision for credit losses amounted to $68.3 million and $168.2 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to $7.2 million and $14.4 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019. Provision expense is impacted by organic loan growth in our loan portfolio, our internal assessment of the credit quality of the loan portfolio, our expectations about future economic conditions and net charge-offs. The primary driver of the increase in provision for credit losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 was the estimated economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our CECL model relies on projected macroeconomic conditions, including unemployment and GDP, as key inputs to estimate future credit losses. As a result, the anticipated deterioration in economic conditions resulting from COVID-19 has resulted in a significant increase in expected credit losses. Also contributing to the increase in provision was an increase in net charge-offs, which totaled $5.4 million and $15.5 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to $4.1 million and $7.7 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2019. The increase in net charge-offs in the first six months of 2020 was in large part the result of an approximately $5.0 million charge-off related to a single credit in the commercial and industrial loan category during the first quarter of 2020. This credit was criticized going into the COVID-19 pandemic and as a result of the pandemic suffered further deterioration resulting in its partial charge-off during the first quarter of 2020. During the second quarter of 2020, we had a partial recovery of approximately $1.7 million on this credit. 

Our allowance for credit losses reflects an amount deemed appropriate to adequately cover all expected future losses as of the date the allowance is determined based on our allowance for credit losses assessment methodology. At June 30, 2020, our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans, inclusive of PPP loans, was 1.27%, up from 0.48% at December 31, 2019. The increase in the allowance for credit losses is largely the result of the implementation of CECL on January 1, 2020, which resulted in an adjustment to the opening balance of the allowance for credit losses of $38.1 million, and increased provisioning during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 due to the estimated economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Noninterest Income. &#160; Our noninterest income is composed of several components, some of which vary significantly between quarterly and annual periods. Service charges on deposit accounts and other noninterest income generally reflect customer growth trends, while fees from our wealth management departments, gains on mortgage loans sold, gains and losses on the sale of securities and gains or losses related to our efforts to mitigate risks associated with interest rate volatility will often reflect financial market conditions and fluctuate from period to period. 

The following is a summary of our noninterest income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands): 

Three Months Ended June 30, 2020 - 2019 Percent Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 - 2019 Percent &#160; 2020 2019 Increase (Decrease) 2020 2019 Increase (Decrease) Noninterest income: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Service charges on deposit accounts $ 6,910 &#160; $ 8,940 &#160; (22.7)% $ 15,942 &#160; $ 17,482 &#160; (8.8)% Investment services 5,971 &#160; 5,868 &#160; 1.8% 15,210 &#160; 11,336 &#160; 34.2% Insurance sales commissions 2,231 &#160; 2,147 &#160; 3.9% 5,471 &#160; 5,075 &#160; 7.8% Gains on mortgage loans sold, net 19,619 &#160; 6,011 &#160; 226.4% 28,202 &#160; 10,889 &#160; 159.0% Investment (gains) losses on sales of securities, net (128) &#160; (4,466) &#160; 97.1% 335 &#160; (6,426) &#160; 105.2% Trust fees 3,958 &#160; 3,461 &#160; 14.4% 8,128 &#160; 6,756 &#160; 20.3% Income from equity method investment 17,208 &#160; 32,261 &#160; (46.7)% 32,800 &#160; 45,551 &#160; (28.0)% Other noninterest income: Interchange and other consumer fees 8,323 &#160; 9,088 &#160; (8.4)% 18,292 &#160; 16,595 &#160; 10.2% Bank-owned life insurance 4,726 &#160; 4,201 &#160; 12.5% 9,378 &#160; 8,296 &#160; 13.0% Loan swap fees 614 &#160; 799 &#160; (23.2)% 2,801 &#160; 1,560 &#160; 79.6% SBA loan sales 941 &#160; 1,171 &#160; (19.6)% 2,282 &#160; 1,743 &#160; 30.9% Gain (loss) on other equity investments (278) &#160; 832 &#160; (133.4)% (452) &#160; 1,614 &#160; (128.0)% Other noninterest income 2,859 &#160; 369 &#160; 674.8% 4,942 &#160; 1,274 &#160; 287.9% Total other noninterest income 17,185 &#160; 16,460 &#160; 4.4% 37,243 &#160; 31,082 &#160; 19.8% Total noninterest income $ 72,954 &#160; $ 70,682 &#160; 3.2% $ 143,331 &#160; $ 121,745 &#160; 17.7% 

The decrease in service charges on deposit accounts in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 is primarily related to analysis fees due to a decrease in the transaction volume of commercial checking accounts which we believe is the result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

&#160; 

Income from our wealth management groups (investments, insurance and trust) is also included in noninterest income. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, commissions and fees from investment services at our financial advisory unit, Pinnacle Asset Management, a division of Pinnacle Bank, increased by $103,000 and $3.9 million when compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2019. At June 30, 2020 and 2019, Pinnacle Asset Management was receiving commissions and fees in connection with approximately $4.5 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, in brokerage assets. Revenues from the sale of insurance products by our insurance subsidiaries for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 increased by $84,000 and $396,000, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. Included in insurance revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2020 was $1.1 million of contingent income received in the first quarter of 2020 that was based on 2019 sales production and claims experience compared to $873,000 recorded in the same period in the prior year. Additionally, at June 30, 2020, our trust department was receiving fees on approximately $2.9 billion of managed assets compared to $2.4 billion at June 30, 2019, reflecting organic growth and increased market valuations. The growth in our wealth management businesses is attributable to the addition of associates in these areas, market volatility and the attractive markets in which we operate. 

Gains on mortgage loans sold, net, consists of fees from the origination and sale of mortgage loans. These mortgage fees are for loans primarily originated in our current markets that are subsequently sold to third-party investors. Substantially all of these loan sales transfer servicing rights to the buyer. Generally, mortgage origination fees increase in lower interest rate environments and more robust housing markets and decrease in rising interest rate environments and more challenging housing markets. Mortgage origination fees will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as the rate environment changes. Gains on mortgage loans sold, net, were $19.6 million and $28.2 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to $6.0 million and $10.9 million, respectively, for the same periods in the prior year. This sizeable increase is the direct result of the current interest rate environment and the strong markets in which we operate. We hedge a portion of our mortgage pipeline as part of a mandatory delivery program. The hedge is not designated as a hedge for GAAP purposes and, as such, changes in its fair value are recorded directly through the income statement. There is a positive correlation between the dollar amount of the mortgage pipeline and the value of this hedge. Therefore, the change in the outstanding mortgage pipeline at the end of any reporting period will directly impact the amount of gain recorded for mortgage loans held for sale during that reporting period. At June 30, 2020, the mortgage pipeline included $340.7 million in loans expected to close in 2020 compared to $134.6 million in loans at June 30, 2019 expected to close in 2019. 

Investment gains and losses on sales, net represent the net gains and losses on sales of investment securities in our available-for-sale securities portfolio during the periods noted. During the six months ended June 30, 2020, we sold approximately $100.1 million of securities for a net gain of $335,000 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2019, when we sold approximately $476.7 million of securities for a net loss of $6.4 million. 

Income from equity-method investment. Income from equity-method investment is comprised solely of income from our 49% equity-method investment in BHG. BHG is engaged in the origination of commercial and consumer loans primarily to healthcare providers and other professionals throughout the United States. The loans originated by BHG are either financed by secured borrowings or sold without recourse to independent financial institutions and investors. BHG has expanded its operations to include commercial lending to other professional service firms such as attorneys, accountants and others. 

Income from this equity-method investment was $17.2 million and $32.8 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to $32.3 million and $45.6 million, respectively, for the same periods last year. Historically, BHG has sold the majority of the loans its originates to a network of bank purchasers through a combination of online auctions, direct sales and its direct purchase option. In the second half of 2019, BHG began retaining more loans on its balance sheet than historically had been the case in recent years. As a result of the economic disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, BHG, in the first six months of 2020, sold more loans through its auction platform than we had anticipated would be the case earlier in the year and will likely slow its transition to holding more loans on its balance sheet as the effects of COVID-19 are monitored. As is the case for our business, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on BHG's business is not fully known at this point though we believe its business, including demand for its loans and losses it may incur as a result of borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, will be negatively impacted. 

Income from equity-method investment is recorded net of amortization expense associated with customer lists and other intangible assets of $293,000 and $587,000, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to $475,000 and $950,000, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019. At June 30, 2020, there wer e $8.2 million of th ese intangible assets that are expected to be amortized in lesser amounts over the next 15 years. Also included in income from equity-method investment, is accretion income associated with the fair valuation of certain of BHG's liabilities of $541,000 and $1.1 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, compared to $660,000 and $1.3 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019. At June 30, 2020, there were $3.7 million of these liabilities that are expected to accrete into income in lesser amounts over the next six years. 

During the three months ended June 30, 2020, Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank received no dividends from BHG. During the six months ended June 30, 2020, Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank received $8.0 million in dividends from BHG in the aggregate. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank received dividends of $28.2 million and $40.9 million, respectively, in the aggregate. Dividends from BHG during such periods reduced the carrying amount of our investment in BHG, while earnings from BHG during such periods increased the carrying amount of our investment in BHG. Profits from intercompany transactions are eliminated. Our proportionate share of earnings from BHG is included in our consolidated tax return. No loans were purchased from BHG by Pinnacle Bank for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2020 or 2019, respectively. Earnings from BHG are likely to fluctuate from period-to-period. 

As our ownership interest in BHG is 49% and our representatives do not occupy a majority of the seats on BHG's board of managers, we do not consolidate BHG's results of operations or financial position into our financial statements but record the net result of BHG's activities at our percentage ownership in income from equity method investment in noninterest income. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, BHG reported $92.8 million and $190.7 million, respectively, in revenues, net of substitution losses of $28.1 million and $44.4 million, respectively, compared to revenues of $108.0 million and $170.8 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, net of substitution losses of $12.7 million and $25.1 million, respectively. 

Approximately $67.3 million and $136.9 million, respectively, of BHG's revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 related to gains on the sale of commercial loans BHG had previously issued primarily to doctor, dentist and other medical practices compared to $90.5 million and $139.2 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019. BHG refers to this activity as its core product. BHG typically funds these loans from cash reserves on its balance sheet. Subsequent to origination, these core product loans have typically been sold by BHG with no recourse to a network of community banks and other financial institutions at a premium to the par value of the loan. The purchaser may access a BHG cash reserve account of up to 3% of the loan balance to support loan payments. BHG retains no servicing or other responsibilities related to the core product loan once sold. As a result, this gain on sale premium represents BHG's compensation for absorbing the costs to originate the loan as well as marketing expenses associated with maintaining its business model. 

At June 30, 2020 and 2019, there were $3.2 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, in core product loans previously sold by BHG that were being actively serviced by BHG's network of bank purchasers. BHG, at its sole option, may also provide purchasers of these core product loans the ability to substitute the acquired loan with another more recently-issued BHG loan should the previously-acquired loan become at least 90-days past due as to its monthly payments. This substitution is subject to the purchaser having adhered to the standards of its purchase agreement with BHG. Additionally, all substitutions are subject to the approval by BHG's board of managers. As a result, the reacquired loans are deemed purchased credit impaired and recorded on BHG's balance sheet at the net present value of the loan's anticipated cash flows. BHG will then initiate collection efforts and attempt to restore the reacquired loan to performing status. As a result, BHG maintained a liability as of June 30, 2020 and 2019 of $229.3 million and $100.3 million, respectively, that represents an estimate of the future inherent losses for the outstanding core portfolio that may be subject to future substitution. This liability represents 7.2% and 4.6%, respectively, of core product loans previously sold by BHG that remain outstanding as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in this liability in the six months ended June 30, 2020 was principally the result of the economic disruption associated with the COVID-19 pandemic which has adversely impacted physician and dental practices in a material manner. 

BHG will maintain loans on its balance sheet for a period of time prior to sale or transfer to a purchaser. Alternatively, BHG may elect to keep certain loans on its balance sheet through maturity. From time to time, BHG may hold a higher volume of these loans depending upon the timing of loan originations, its loan pipeline and market demand as well as the deployment of its business strategy. As previously discussed, BHG realigned its business model to retain more of its originated loans on the balance sheet beginning in the second half of 2019. At June 30, 2020, BHG reported loans totaling $839.3 million compared to $467.2 million as of June 30, 2019. A portion of these loans do not qualify for sale accounting and accordingly an offsetting secured borrowing liability has been recorded. At June 30, 2020 and 2019, BHG had $310.4 million and $217.6 million, respectively, of secured borrowings associated with loans held for investment which did not qualify for sale accounting. At June 30, 2020 and 2019, BHG reported allowance for loan losses totaling $9.5 million and $2.3 million, respectively. Interest income and fees amounted to $22.0 million and $46.1 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to $13.5 million and $24.2 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019. 

BHG also sometimes refers loans to other financial institutions and, based on an agreement with the institution, earns a fee for doing so. Typically, these are loans that BHG believes would either be classified as consumer-type loans rather than commercial loans, fail to meet the credit underwriting standards of BHG but another institution will accept the loans or are loans issued to borrowers in certain geographic locations where BHG has elected not to do business. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, BHG recognized fee income of $195,000 and $753,000, respectively, compared to $495,000 and $1.1 million, respectively, for the same periods in the prior year related to these activities. 

Included in other noninterest income are interchange and other consumer fees, gains from bank-owned life insurance, swap fees earned for the facilitation of derivative transactions for our clients, SBA loan sales, gains or losses on other equity investments and other noninterest income items. Interchange revenues decreased in the three months ended June 30, 2020 as a result of decreased debit and credit card transactions as compared to the comparable period in 2019, which we believe is the result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Interchange revenues increased during the six months ended June 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 due to increased loan fees primarily as a result of loan prepayments during the second quarter of 2020. Other noninterest income included changes in the cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance which was $4.7 million and $9.4 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to $4.2 million and $8.3 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019. During the six months ended June 30, 2019, we purchased $110.0 million of new bank-owned life insurance policies. The assets that support these policies are administered by the life insurance carriers and the income we recognize (i.e., increases or decreases in the cash surrender value of the policies) on these policies is dependent upon the crediting rates applied by the insurance carriers, which are subject to change at the discretion of the carriers, subject to any applicable floors. Earnings on these policies generally are not taxable. Loan swap fees increased by $1.2 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 due primarily to reduced third party fees and an increase in the volume of activity resulting from the current interest rate environment. SBA loan sales are also included in other noninterest income and fluctuate based on the current market environment. Additionally, the carrying values of other equity investments are adjusted either upwards or downwards from the transaction price to reflect expected exit values as evidenced by financing and sale transactions with third parties, or when determination of a valuation adjustment is confirmed through ongoing reviews by senior investment managers. Other other noninterest income fluctuated during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 as compared to the same periods in 2019 due to the $1.5 million loss on the sale of the high-yield automobile portfolio in the second quarter of 2019. 

Noninterest Expense. &#160; Noninterest expense consists of salaries and employee benefits, equipment and occupancy expenses, other real estate expenses, and other operating expenses. The following is a summary of our noninterest expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands): 

&#160; Three Months Ended June 30, 2020 - 2019 Percent Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 - 2019 Percent &#160; 2020 2019 Increase (Decrease) 2020 2019 Increase (Decrease) Noninterest expense: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Salaries and employee benefits: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Salaries $ 54,645 &#160; $ 44,625 &#160; 22.5% $ 106,821 &#160; $ 89,681 &#160; 19.1% Commissions 3,611 &#160; 3,224 &#160; 12.0% 7,594 &#160; 6,364 &#160; 19.3% Cash and equity incentives 4,824 &#160; 16,159 &#160; (70.1%) 15,104 &#160; 27,322 &#160; (44.7%) Employee benefits and other 10,807 &#160; 11,612 &#160; (6.9%) 24,848 &#160; 22,629 &#160; 9.8% Total salaries and employee benefits 73,887 &#160; 75,620 &#160; (2.3%) 154,367 &#160; 145,996 &#160; 5.7% Equipment and occupancy 22,026 &#160; 23,844 &#160; (7.6%) 43,004 &#160; 43,175 &#160; (0.4%) Other real estate expense, net 2,888 &#160; 2,523 &#160; 14.5% 5,303 &#160; 2,769 &#160; 91.5% Marketing and other business development 2,142 &#160; 3,282 &#160; (34.7%) 5,393 &#160; 6,230 &#160; (13.4%) Postage and supplies 2,070 &#160; 2,079 &#160; (0.4%) 4,060 &#160; 3,971 &#160; 2.2% Amortization of intangibles 2,479 &#160; 2,271 &#160; 9.2% 4,999 &#160; 4,582 &#160; 9.1% Other noninterest expense: Deposit related expense 5,677 &#160; 4,873 &#160; 16.5% 10,915 &#160; 9,416 &#160; 15.9% Lending related expense 10,476 &#160; 5,401 &#160; 94.0% 22,544 &#160; 10,700 &#160; 110.7% Wealth management related expense 499 &#160; 610 &#160; (18.2%) 1,057 &#160; 1,140 &#160; (7.3%) Other noninterest expense 9,461 &#160; 7,183 &#160; 31.7% 17,312 &#160; 13,758 &#160; 25.8% Total other noninterest expense $ 26,113 &#160; $ 18,067 &#160; 44.5% $ 51,828 &#160; $ 35,014 &#160; 48.0% Total noninterest expense $ 131,605 &#160; $ 127,686 &#160; 3.1% $ 268,954 &#160; $ 241,737 &#160; 11.3% 

Total salaries and employee benefits expenses decreased approximately $1.7 million and increased approximately $8.4 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. The change in salaries and employee benefits was the result of an increase in our associate base in 2020 versus 2019 offset in part, or in the case of the three months ended June 30, 2020, in whole, by the reduction of our cash incentive plan accrual as well as the reduction in stock-based compensation expense due to our performance through the first half of 2020 compared to the earnings per diluted share performance metric targets established pursuant to our annual cash incentive plan and the return on average tangible assets performance metric targets applicable pursuant to certain performance-based equity awards we have previously granted, each due to the effects of COVID-19 on our anticipated earnings and performance for the year ended December 31, 2020. At June 30, 2020, our associate base was 2,577.5 full-time equivalent associates as compared to 2,361.0 at June 30, 2019. We expect salary and benefit expenses will continue to rise though at a lesser percentage rate on a linked-quarter basis as we slow our hiring efforts and focus primarily on expanding our associate base in the Atlanta market and those hires critical to our business across the rest of our franchise. 

We believe that cash and equity incentives are a valuable tool in motivating an associate base that is focused on providing our clients effective financial advice and increasing shareholder value. As a result, and unlike many other financial institutions, all of our bank's non-commissioned associates participate in our annual cash incentive plan with a minimum targeted bonus equal to 10% of each associate's annual salary, and all of our bank's associates participate in our equity compensation plans. Under the annual cash incentive plan, the targeted level of incentive payments requires achievement of a certain soundness threshold and a targeted level of, and average rate paid on, core deposits and earnings (subject to certain adjustments). To the extent that the soundness threshold is met and core deposit volumes and rates and earnings are above or below the targeted amount, the aggregate incentive payments are increased or decreased. Historically, we have paid between 0% and 125% of our targeted incentives. Through the second quarter of 2020, we have accrued incentive costs for the cash incentive plan in 2020 at approximately 25% of our targeted awards in light of our expectations that our 2020 results will not meet the minimum level of earnings per diluted share required under the plan. The rate at which we are accruing for payouts under the plan is largely the result of the current and expected future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations and deposit volumes and costs. The current rate of 25% is solely the result of our newly implemented deposit component for which our associates are outperforming with respect to both deposit and volume goals. 

Also included in employee benefits and other expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 were approximately $4.1 million and $9.6 million, respectively, of compensation expenses related to equity-based awards for restricted shares or restricted share units, including those with performance-based vesting criteria, compared to $5.2 million and $10.1 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019. Under our equity incentive plans, we provide a broad-based equity incentive program for all of our bank's associates. We believe that equity incentives provide a vehicle for all associates to become meaningful shareholders of Pinnacle Financial over an extended period of time and create a shareholder-centric culture throughout our organization. Our compensation expense associated with equity awards for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 decreased when compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 primarily as a result of the fact that our performance through the first half of 2020 made it unlikely that these awards would be earned as a result of the pandemic. Our compensation expense associated with equity awards with time-based vesting criteria is likely to continue to increase during the remainder of 2020 when compared to 2019 as a result of the increased number of associates and our intention to hire additional experienced financial advisors, though for the remainder of 2020 we will focus primarily on expanding our associate base in the Atlanta market and those hires critical to our business across the rest of our franchise. Compensation expense associated with our performance-based vesting awards will be impacted by our performance in 2020 and will likely continue to be less than prior year comparable periods. 

Employee benefits and other expenses were $10.8 million and $24.8 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to $11.6 million and $22.6 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and include costs associated with our 401k plan, health insurance and payroll taxes. 

Equipment and occupancy expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 were $22.0 million and $43.0 million, respectively, compared to $23.8 million and $43.2 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019. These costs were generally consistent between periods though we expect to incur additional costs in future periods as we continue to enhance our technology infrastructure. 

Other real estate income and expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 were $2.9 million and $5.3 million, respectively, as compared to $2.5 million and $2.8 million, respectively, for the same periods in the prior year. Included in the six months ended June 30, 2020 were writedowns in the first quarter of 2020 of previously foreclosed upon properties to market value based on updated appraisals received. 

Marketing and business development expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 was $2.1 million and $5.4 million, respectively, compared to $3.3 million and $6.2 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019. The primary source of the decrease for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 as compared to the same periods 2019 is the result of limited in-person client meetings and business development expenses as a result of the restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Intangible amortization expense was $2.5 million and $5.0 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to $2.3 million and $4.6 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2019. The following table outlines our amortizing intangible assets, their initial valuation and amortizable lives at June 30, 2020: 

&#160; Year acquired Initial Valuation (in millions) Amortizable Life (in years) Remaining Value (in millions) Core Deposit Intangible: &#160; &#160; &#160; CapitalMark 2015 $ 6.2 &#160; 7 &#160; $ 0.6 &#160; Magna Bank 2015 3.2 &#160; 6 &#160; 0.1 &#160; Avenue 2016 8.8 &#160; 9 &#160; 2.7 &#160; BNC 2017 48.1 &#160; 10 &#160; 27.9 &#160; Book of Business Intangible: &#160; &#160; &#160; Miller Loughry Beach Insurance 2008 $ 1.3 &#160; 20 &#160; $ 0.2 &#160; CapitalMark 2015 0.3 &#160; 16 &#160; 0.1 &#160; BNC Insurance 2017 0.4 &#160; 20 &#160; 0.3 &#160; BNC Trust 2017 1.9 &#160; 10 &#160; 1.3 &#160; Advocate Capital 2019 13.6 &#160; 13 &#160; 11.5 &#160; 

These assets are being amortized on an accelerated basis which reflects the anticipated life of the underlying assets. Amortization expense of these intangibles is estimated to decrease from $9.1 million to $5.1 million per year over the next five years with lesser amounts for the remaining amortization period. 

Other noninterest expenses, which consists primarily of deposit, lending, wealth management and administrative expenses increased by $8.0 million and $16.8 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 when compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2019. Deposit related expense increased by $804,000 and $1.5 million, respectively, during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 when compared to the same periods in 2019. Lending related expenses increased $5.1 million and $11.8 million, respectively, during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 when compared to the same periods in 2019. This increase is primarily the result of building our off-balance sheet reserves following the implementation of CECL effective January 1, 2020 and the effect that macroeconomic factors impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic had on our CECL models. Wealth management related expenses decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 when compared to the same periods in 2019. Total other noninterest expenses increased by $2.3 million and $3.6 million, respectively, during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 when compared to the same periods in 2019. This increase is primarily the result of $2.9 million in FHLB prepayment penalties as a result of our prepayment of $392.5 million in FHLB borrowings during the second quarter of 2020. 

Our efficiency ratio (the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income) was 48.1% and 50.0%, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 49.2% and 48.6%, respectively, for the same periods in 2019. The efficiency ratio measures the amount of expense that is incurred to generate a dollar of revenue. The efficiency ratio for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 was impacted in part by increased noninterest expense during the period as a result of our building of off-balance sheet reserves upon the adoption of CECL during the quarter as well as net gains and losses on sales of securities, gains on mortgage loans sold and income from our equity method investment in BHG in both periods. 

Income Taxes. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, we recorded income tax expense of $11.2 million and $9.6 million, respectively, compared to income tax expense of $24.4 million and $47.5 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019. Our effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 was 15.2% and 9.5%, respectively, compared to 19.6% for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2019. Our effective tax rate differs from the combined federal and state income tax statutory rate in effect of 26.14% primarily due to our investments in bank-qualified municipal securities, tax benefits from our real estate investment trust subsidiary, participation in Tennessee's Community Investment Tax Credit (CITC) program, tax benefits associated with share-based compensation, bank-owned life insurance and our captive insurance subsidiary, offset in part by the limitation on deductibility of meals and entertainment expense, non-deductible FDIC insurance premiums and non-deductible executive compensation. Our tax expense in the six months ended June 30, 2020 was impacted by the provision expense recorded in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which was recorded in the first quarter of 2020 as a discrete item of total income tax and contributed a tax benefit of $22.4 million. Our tax rate in each period was also impacted by the vesting and exercise of equity-based awards previously granted under our equity-based compensation program, resulting in the recognition of tax expense of $272,000 and a tax benefit of $590,000, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to tax expense of $68,000 and a tax benefit of $701,000, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019. 

Financial Condition 

Our consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2020 reflects an increase in total loans outstanding to $22.5 billion compared to $19.8 billion at December 31, 2019. Total deposits increased by $5.3 billion between December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2020. Total assets were $33.3 billion at June 30, 2020 compared to $27.8 billion at December 31, 2019. 

Loans. The composition of loans at June 30, 2020 and at December 31, 2019 and the percentage (%) of each classification to total loans are summarized as follows (in thousands): 

&#160; June 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 &#160; Amount Percent Amount Percent Commercial real estate: Owner-occupied $ 2,708,306 &#160; 12.0 % $ 2,669,766 &#160; 13.5 % Non-owner occupied 5,384,018 &#160; 23.9 % 5,039,452 &#160; 25.5 % Consumer real estate &#8211; mortgage 3,042,604 &#160; 13.5 % 3,068,625 &#160; 15.5 % Construction and land development 2,574,494 &#160; 11.4 % 2,430,483 &#160; 12.3 % Commercial and industrial 8,516,333 &#160; 37.8 % 6,290,296 &#160; 31.8 % Consumer and other 294,545 &#160; 1.4 % 289,254 &#160; 1.4 % Total loans $ 22,520,300 &#160; 100.0 % $ 19,787,876 &#160; 100.0 % 

At June 30, 2020, our loan portfolio composition had changed modestly from the composition at December 31, 2019 principally as a result of the PPP loans, though commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending generally continue to make up the largest segments of our portfolio. At June 30, 2020, approximately 33.5% of the outstanding principal balance of our commercial real estate loans was secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate properties, compared to 34.6% at December 31, 2019. Owner-occupied commercial real estate is similar in many ways to our commercial and industrial lending in that these loans are generally made to businesses on the basis of the cash flows of the business rather than on the valuation of the real estate. Additionally, the construction and land development loan segment continues to be a meaningful portion of our portfolio and reflects the development and growth of the local economies in which we operate and is diversified between commercial, residential and land. 

Banking regulations have established guidelines for the construction ratio of less than 100% of total risk-based capital and for the non-owner occupied ratio of less than 300% of total risk-based capital. Should a bank&#8217;s ratios be in excess of these guidelines, banking regulations generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management. Both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by Pinnacle Bank&#8217;s total risk-based capital. At both June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, Pinnacle Bank&#8217;s construction and land development loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital were 83.6%. Construction and land development, non-owner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital were 275.0% and 268.3% as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. At June 30, 2020, Pinnacle Bank was within the 100% and 300% guidelines and has established what it believes to be appropriate controls to monitor its lending in these areas as it aims to keep the level of these loans to below the 100% and 300% thresholds. 

The following table classifies our fixed and variable rate loans at June 30, 2020 according to contractual maturities of (1) one year or less, (2) after one year through five years, and (3) after five years. The table also classifies our variable rate loans pursuant to the contractual repricing dates of the underlying loans (in thousands):

Loans in Past Due Status. &#160; The following table is a summary of our loans that were past due at least 30 days but less than 89 days and 90 days or more past due as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 (in thousands):

Potential Problem Loans. Potential problem loans, which are not included in nonperforming assets, amounted to approximately $251.3 million, or 1.1% of total loans at June 30, 2020, compared to $276.0 million, or 1.4% of total loans at December 31, 2019. Potential problem loans represent those loans with a well-defined weakness and where information about possible credit problems of borrowers has caused management to have doubts about the borrower's ability to comply with present repayment terms. This definition is believed to be substantially consistent with the standards established by Pinnacle Bank's primary regulators, for loans classified as substandard, excluding the impact of substandard nonaccrual loans and substandard troubled debt restructurings. Troubled debt restructurings are not included in potential problem loans. Approximately $5.4 million of potential problem loans were past due at least 30 days but less than 90 days as of June 30, 2020. 

Nonperforming Assets and Troubled Debt Restructurings. At June 30, 2020, we had $84.7 million in nonperforming assets compared to $91.1 million at December 31, 2019. Included in nonperforming assets were $62.6 million in nonaccrual loans and $22.1 million in OREO and other nonperforming assets at June 30, 2020 and $61.6 million in nonaccrual loans and $29.5 million in OREO and other nonperforming assets at December 31, 2019. At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there were $3.3 million and $4.9 million, respectively, of troubled debt restructurings, all of which were accruing as of the restructured date and remain on accrual status. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact to its customers, Pinnacle Bank implemented a short-term modification program in accordance with interagency regulatory guidance to provide temporary payment relief to those borrowers directly impacted by COVID-19 who were not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019. This program allows for a deferral of payments of principal and/or interest for 90 days, which Pinnacle Bank may extend for an additional 90 days, for a maximum of 180 days on a cumulative and successive basis. Pursuant to the interagency regulatory guidance, Pinnacle Financial may elect to not classify loans for which these deferrals are granted as troubled debt restructurings. As of June 30, 2020, we had granted deferrals on approximately $4.2 billion in aggregate principal amount of loans. As of July 17, 2020, approximately $2.7 billion in aggregate principal loan balances remained on deferral. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans (allowance). On January 1, 2020, we adopted FASB ASU 2016-13, which introduces the current expected credit losses (CECL) methodology and requires us to estimate all expected credit losses over the remaining life of our loan portfolio. Accordingly, beginning in 2020, the allowance for credit losses represents an amount that, in management's evaluation, is adequate to provide coverage for all expected future credit losses on outstanding loans. As of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our allowance for credit losses was approximately $285.4 million and $94.8 million, respectively, which our management believes to be adequate at each of the respective dates. Our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans, inclusive of PPP loans, was 1.27% at June 30, 2020, up from 0.48% at December 31, 2019. 

The increase in the allowance for credit losses is largely the result of the implementation of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, which resulted in an adjustment to the opening balance of the allowance for credit losses of $38.1 million, and increased provisioning during 

the six months ended June 30, 2020 due primarily to the estimated economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our CECL models rely largely on projections of macroeconomic conditions to estimate future credit losses. Macroeconomic factors used in the model include the national unemployment rate, gross domestic product, the commercial real estate price index and certain US Treasury interest rates. Projections of these macroeconomic factors, obtained from an independent third party, are utilized to predict quarterly rates of default. Projected macroeconomic factors have experienced significant deterioration during the six months ended June 30, 2020, which has resulted in the significant increase in our allowance for credit losses during the same period. 

Under the CECL methodology the allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics, and for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with the collectively evaluated pools, evaluations are performed on an individual basis. Losses are predicted over a period of time determined to be reasonable and supportable, and at the end of the reasonable and supportable period losses are reverted to long term historical averages. At June 30, 2020, reasonable and supportable periods ranging from 12 to 18 months were utilized followed by a 12 month straight line reversion period to long term averages. 

The overall balance of our allowance at December 31, 2019 was impacted by fair value accounting on our acquired loan portfolios, for which an allowance for credit losses was only necessary if it exceeded the remaining fair value discount. Subsequent to the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, an allowance for credit losses is recognized for all acquired loans, regardless of the amount of remaining fair value discounts. In addition, the remaining nonaccretable discount at December 31, 2019 was reclassified into the allowance for credit losses upon adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020. At June 30, 2020, the remaining fair value discount for all acquired portfolios was $38.0 million, all of which is expected to be accreted into income over the remaining contractual lives of the related loans. 

For the six months ended June 30, 2020, the net fair value discount changed as follows (in thousands): 

&#160; Accretable Yield Nonaccretable Yield Total December 31, 2019 $ (51,322) &#160; $ (3,828) &#160; $ (55,150) &#160; Reclassification of discount to allowance for credit losses &#8212; &#160; 3,828 &#160; 3,828 &#160; Year-to-date accretion and settlements 13,319 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 13,319 &#160; June 30, 2020 $ (38,003) &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ (38,003) &#160; 

The following table sets forth, based on management's estimate, the allocation of the allowance for credit losses to categories of loans as well as the unallocated portion as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 and the percentage of loans in each category to total loans (in thousands):

Pinnacle Financial's management assesses the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis. This assessment includes procedures to estimate the allowance and test the adequacy and appropriateness of the resulting balance. The level of the allowance is based upon management's evaluation of historical default and loss experience, current and projected economic conditions, asset quality trends, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers' ability to repay the loan (including the timing of future payments), the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, industry and peer bank loan quality indications and other pertinent factors, including regulatory recommendations. The allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries of amounts previously charged-off. For further discussion regarding our allowance for credit losses, refer to Critical Accounting Estimates in Part I Item 2 - Critical Accounting Estimates herein. We expect that the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic will cause our net charge-offs to increase in 2020 when compared to comparable periods in 2019. 

Based upon our evaluation of the loan portfolio, we believe the allowance for credit losses to be adequate to absorb our estimate of expected future credit losses on loans outstanding at June 30, 2020. While our policies and procedures used to estimate the allowance for credit losses as well as the resultant provision for credit losses charged to operations are considered adequate by management, they are necessarily approximate and imprecise. There are factors beyond our control, such as conditions in the local and national economy, local real estate market or a particular industry or borrower which may negatively impact, materially, our asset quality and the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses and, thus, the resulting provision for credit losses. In particular, the length and severity of the economic disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic is difficult to predict and each may be worse than we have estimated, which could cause our provision for credit losses to be negatively impacted for the duration of the pandemic and its aftermath. We believe borrowers that operate in the restaurant, entertainment, hospitality, medical, dental, retail and construction sectors, including owners of commercial real estate properties and hotels, continue to be the most likely to be negatively impacted by the economic disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, though other businesses and nonprofit and religious organizations have been, and are likely to continue to be, negatively impacted as well. If the strict social distancing practices or safer-at-home directives that were initially implemented in response to the spread of COVID-19 were to return, these impacts could be more severe than currently anticipated. 

Investments. &#160; Our investment portfolio, consisting primarily of Federal agency bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and state and municipal securities amounted to $4.4 billion and $3.7 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Our investment portfolio serves many purposes including serving as a stable source of income, as collateral for public funds deposits and as a potential liquidity source. A summary of our investment portfolio at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 follows: 

&#160; June 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 Weighted average life 6.73 years 6.55 years Effective duration* 4.60% 4.75% Tax equivalent yield 2.59% 2.85% 

(*) The metric is presented net of fair value hedges tied to certain investment portfolio holdings. The effective duration of the investment portfolio without the fair value hedges as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 was 5.45% and 5.89%, respectively. 

Restricted Cash. Our restricted cash balances totaled approximately $254.6 million at June 30, 2020, compared to $137.0 million at December 31, 2019. This restricted cash is maintained at other financial institutions as collateral primarily for our derivative portfolio. The increase in restricted cash is attributable primarily to an increase in collateral requirements on certain derivative instruments for which the fair value has declined. See Note 8. Derivative Instruments in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 

Deposits and Other Borrowings. We had approximately $25.5 billion of deposits at June 30, 2020 compared to $20.2 billion at December 31, 2019. Our deposits consist of noninterest and interest-bearing demand accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and time deposits. Additionally, we routinely enter into agreements with certain customers to sell certain securities under agreements to repurchase the security the following day. These agreements (which are typically associated with comprehensive treasury management programs for our clients and provide them with short-term returns for their excess funds) amounted to $194.6 million at June 30, 2020 and $126.4 million at December 31, 2019. Additionally, at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, Pinnacle Bank had borrowed $1.8 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati (FHLB). During the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, $392.5 million in FHLB advances were restructured and prepayment penalties of $2.9 million were recognized in expense for the three months ended June 30, 2020. At June 30, 2020, Pinnacle Bank had approximately $2.4 billion in additional availability with the FHLB; however, incremental borrowings are subject to applicable collateral requirements and are made in a formal request by Pinnacle Bank and the subsequent approval by the FHLB. Our efforts to increase our on-balance sheet liquidity in the second half of the first quarter resulted in increased borrowings from the FHLB Cincinnati. 

Generally, we have classified our funding base as either core funding or noncore funding as shown in the table below. The following table represents the balances of our deposits and other funding and the percentage of each type to the total at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019:

(1) The reciprocating categories consists of deposits we receive from a bank network (the Promontory network) in connection with deposits of our customers in excess of our FDIC coverage limit that we place with the Promontory network. 

As noted in the table above, our core funding as a percentage of total funding decreased from 76.2% at December 31, 2019 to 75.8% at June 30, 2020, primarily as a result of the significant increase in deposits estimated to have been funded by PPP loans, offset in part by our intentional increase in wholesale funding to build on-balance sheet liquidity as we prepared for the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Competition for core deposits in our markets remains very competitive and we anticipate that our percentage of non-core funding is likely to increase as PPP loan funds are utilized. 

When wholesale funding is necessary to complement the company's core deposit base, management determines which source is best suited to address both liquidity risk management and interest rate risk management objectives. Our Asset Liability Management Policy imposes limitations on overall wholesale funding reliance and on brokered deposit exposure specifically. Both our overall reliance on wholesale funding and exposure to brokered deposits and brokered time deposits were within those policy limitations as of June 30, 2020. 

Our funding policies impose limits on the amount of non-core funding we can utilize based on the non-core funding dependency ratio which is calculated pursuant to regulatory guidelines. Periodically, we may exceed our policy limitations, at which time management will develop plans to bring our funding sources back into compliance with our core funding ratios. At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with our core funding policies. Though growing our core deposit base is a key strategic objective of our firm and we experienced meaningful growth in core deposits in the first half of 2020, we may increase our non-core funding amounts from current levels if we need to do so to fund growth or increase levels of on-balance sheet liquidity, but we do not currently anticipate that such increases will exceed the limits we have established in our internal policies for total levels of non-core funding. 

The amount of time deposits as of June 30, 2020 amounted to $4.5 billion. The following table shows our time deposits in denominations of $100,000 and less and in denominations greater than $100,000 by category based on time remaining until maturity and the weighted average rate for each category as of June 30, 2020 (in thousands):

Subordinated debt and other borrowings. We have established, or through acquisition acquired, twelve statutory business trusts which were established to issue 30-year trust preferred securities and certain other subordinated debt agreements. These securities qualify as Tier 2 capital subject to annual phase outs beginning five years from maturity. On April 22, 2020, we established a credit facility with the Federal Reserve Bank in conjunction with the PPP, with available borrowing capacity equal to the outstanding balance of PPP loans, which totaled approximately $2.2 billion at June 30, 2020. We also had a $75.0 million revolving credit facility with no outstanding borrowings as of June 30, 2020 that matured on July 24, 2020 and was not renewed.

&#160; 

Effective January 1, 2020, we used $80.0 million of the net proceeds from our 2019 subordinated debt offering to redeem certain other of our subordinated notes, including the $20.0 million aggregate principal amount of Avenue subordinated notes and $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of BNC subordinated notes. We had previously anticipated using $130 million of the net proceeds from our 2019 subordinated debt offering to redeem two tranches of subordinated notes issued by Pinnacle Bank with a maturity date of July 30, 2025 but have decided to not redeem those notes at this time in light of the uncertainty resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Pursuant to regulatory guidelines, once the maturity date on these subordinated notes is within five years, a portion of the notes will no longer be eligible to be included in regulatory capital, with an additional portion being excluded each year over the five year period approaching maturity. 

Capital Resources. At June 30, 2020, our shareholders' equity amounted to $4.7 billion compared to $4.4 billion at December 31, 2019. During the second quarter of 2020, we issued 9.0 million depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of Series B Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share of Series B Preferred Stock in a registered public offering to both retail and institutional investors. Net proceeds from the transaction after underwriting discounts and offering costs were approximately $217.6 million. The net proceeds were retained by Pinnacle Financial and are available to support our obligations including payments related to our outstanding indebtedness, to support the capital needs of our company and our bank, and for other general corporate purposes. Additionally, shareholders' equity during the six months ended June 30, 2020 was impacted by increases in our net income and other comprehensive income offset in part by $50.8 million related to shares repurchased pursuant to the share repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors in November 2018 and October 2019 and dividends of $24.8 million paid on shares of our common stock. We currently have approximately $67.2 million remaining of our authorized repurchase program which is set to expire December 31, 2020. In March 2020, we suspended our share repurchase program in light of uncertainty regarding the length and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our share repurchase program remains suspended as of the date of this filing. For additional information regarding our capital and shareholders&#8217; equity, see Note 10. Regulatory Matters in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 

Dividends. Pursuant to Tennessee banking law, our bank may not, without the prior consent of the TDFI, pay any dividends to us in a calendar year in excess of the total of our bank's retained net profits for that year plus the retained net profits for the preceding two years, which was $619.2 million at June 30, 2020. During the six months ended June 30, 2020, our bank paid dividends of $94.1 million to us which is within the limits allowed by the TDFI. 

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, we paid $12.4 million and $24.8 million, respectively, in dividends to our common shareholders. On July 21, 2020, our board of directors declared a $0.16 per share quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders which should approximate $12.4 million in aggregate dividend payments that are expected to be paid on Aug. 28, 2020 to common shareholders of record as of the close of business on Aug. 7, 2020. Additionally, on that same day, our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of approximately $3.8 million, or $16.88 per share (or $0.422 per depositary share), on the Series B Preferred Stock payable on Sept. 1, 2020 to shareholders of record at the close of business on Aug. 17, 2020. The amount and timing of all future dividend payments, if any, is subject to board discretion and will depend on our earnings, capital position, financial condition and other factors, including, if necessary, our receipt of dividends from Pinnacle Bank, regulatory capital requirements, as they become known to us and receipt of any regulatory approvals that may become required as a result of our and our bank subsidiary's financial results. 

Market and Liquidity Risk Management 

Our objective is to manage assets and liabilities to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies. Our Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) is charged with the responsibility of monitoring these policies, which are designed to ensure acceptable composition of asset/liability mix. Two critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management. 

Interest Rate Sensitivity. &#160; In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates. ALCO measures and evaluates the interest rate risk so that we can meet customer demands for various types of loans and deposits. ALCO determines the most appropriate amounts of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items. Measurements which we use to help us manage interest rate sensitivity include an earnings simulation model and an economic value of equity (EVE) model. 

Our interest rate sensitivity modeling incorporates a number of assumptions for both earnings simulation and EVE, including loan and deposit re-pricing characteristics, the rate of loan prepayments, etc. ALCO periodically reviews these assumptions for accuracy based 

on historical data and future expectations. Our ALCO policy requires that the base scenario assumes rates remain flat and is the scenario to which all others are compared in order to measure the change in net interest income and EVE. Policy limits are applied to the results of certain modeling scenarios. While the primary policy scenarios focus is on a twelve month time frame for the earnings simulations model, longer time horizons are also modeled. All policy scenarios assume a static volume forecast where the balance sheet is held constant, although other scenarios are modeled. 

During the first half of 2020, several unique events occurred that are noteworthy when comparing the results of both the earnings simulation and the economic value of equity modeling results as of June 30, 2020 to the modeling results at December 31, 2019: 

&#8226; In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve reduced the target federal funds rate by 150 basis points. 

&#8226; We built over $2.5 billion in additional on-balance-sheet liquidity. 

&#8226; We unwound a $1.3 billion in-the-money interest rate floor. 

Earnings simulation model. We believe interest rate risk is best measured by our earnings simulation modeling. Earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments are combined with forecasts of interest rates for the next 12 months and are combined with other factors in order to produce various earnings simulations over that same 12-month period. To limit interest rate risk, we have policy guidelines for our earnings at risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest income in both gradual and instantaneous changes to interest rates. For instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates from management's flat interest rate forecast over the next twelve months, assuming a static balance sheet, the following estimated changes are calculated: 

Estimated % Change in Net Interest Income Over 12 Months June 30, 2020* Instantaneous Rate Change 100 bps increase 0.0 % 200 bps increase 1.7 % 100 bps decrease 0.6 % 

*: Negative interest rates are not contemplated in these scenarios. The Treasury curve and all short-term rate indices, such as Fed Funds, LIBOR, etc., are assumed to be zero bound. 

While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Further, the earnings simulation model does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, hedging activities we might take and changing product spreads that could mitigate any potential adverse impact of changes in interest rates. 

The behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios set out in the table above is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. The projected impact on net interest income in the table above assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternative rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher-yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce the assumed benefit of those deposits. The projected impact on net interest income in the table above also assumes a "through-the-cycle" non-maturity deposit beta which may not be an accurate predictor of actual deposit rate changes realized in scenarios of smaller and/or non-parallel interest rate movements. 

At June 30, 2020, our earnings simulation model indicated we were in compliance with our policies for interest rate scenarios for which we model as required by our board approved Asset Liability Policy. 

Economic value of equity model. While earnings simulation modeling attempts to determine the impact of a changing rate environment to our net interest income, our EVE model measures estimated changes to the economic values of our assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items as a result of interest rate changes. Economic values are determined by discounting expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, which establishes a base case EVE. We then shock rates as prescribed by our Asset Liability Policy and measure the sensitivity in EVE values for each of those shocked rate scenarios versus the base case. The Asset Liability Policy sets limits for those sensitivities. At June 30, 2020, our EVE modeling calculated the following estimated changes in EVE due to instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates: 

June 30, 2020* Instantaneous Rate Change 100 bps increase 1.9 % 200 bps increase (1.2 %) 100 bps decrease (2.9 %) 

*: Negative interest rates are not contemplated in these scenarios. The Treasury curve and all short-term rate indices, such as Fed Funds, LIBOR, etc., are assumed to be zero bound. 

While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current year). Further, EVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, hedging activities we might take and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. 

At June 30, 2020, our EVE model indicated we were in compliance with our policies for all interest rate scenarios for which we model as required by our board approved Asset Liability Policy. 

Most likely earnings simulation models. We also analyze a most-likely earnings simulation scenario that projects the expected change in rates based on a forward yield curve adopted by management using expected balance sheet volumes forecasted by management. Separate growth assumptions are developed for loans, investments, deposits, etc. Other interest rate scenarios analyzed by management may include delayed rate shocks, yield curve steepening or flattening, or other variations in rate movements to further analyze or stress our balance sheet under various interest rate scenarios. Each scenario is evaluated by management. These processes assist management to better anticipate our financial results and, as a result, management may determine the need to invest in other operating strategies and tactics which might enhance results or better position the firm's balance sheet to reduce interest rate risk going forward. 

Each of the above analyses may not, on its own, be an accurate indicator of how our net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. In addition, the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgage loans, have features (generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors) which limit changes in interest rates. Prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments. The ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates. ALCO reviews each of the above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with several different interest rate scenarios as part of its responsibility to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies. 

Management's model governance, model implementation and model validation processes and controls are subject to review in our regulatory examinations to ensure they are in compliance with the most recent regulatory guidelines and industry and regulatory practices. Management utilizes a respected, sophisticated third party asset liability modeling software to help ensure implementation of management's assumptions into the model are processed as intended in a robust manner. That said, there are numerous assumptions regarding financial instrument behavior that are integrated into the model. The assumptions are formulated by combining observations gleaned from our historical studies of financial instruments and our best estimations of how, if at all, these instruments may behave in the future given changes in economic conditions, technology, etc. These assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. Additionally, given the large number of assumptions built into firms' asset liability modeling software, it is difficult, at best, to compare our results to other firms. 

ALCO may determine that Pinnacle Financial should over time become more or less asset or liability sensitive depending on the underlying balance sheet circumstances and our conclusions as to anticipated interest rate fluctuations in future periods. At present, ALCO has determined that its "most likely" rate scenario considers no change in short-term interest rates throughout the remainder of 2020. Our "most likely" rate forecast is based primarily on information we acquire from a service which includes a consensus forecast of numerous interest rate benchmarks. We may implement additional actions designed to achieve our desired sensitivity position which could change from time to time. 

We have in the past used, and may in the future continue to use, derivative financial instruments as one tool to manage our interest rate sensitivity, including in our mortgage lending program, while continuing to meet the credit and deposit needs of our customers. For further details on the derivatives we currently use, see Note 8. Derivative Instruments in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 

We may also enter into interest rate swaps to facilitate customer transactions and meet their financing needs. These swaps qualify as derivatives, even though they are not designated as hedging instruments. 

Liquidity Risk Management . The purpose of liquidity risk management is to ensure that there are sufficient cash flows to satisfy loan demand, deposit withdrawals, and our other needs. Traditional sources of liquidity for a bank include asset maturities and growth in core deposits. A bank may achieve its desired liquidity objectives from the management of its assets and liabilities and by internally generated funding through its operations. Funds invested in marketable instruments that can be readily sold and the continuous maturing of other earning assets are sources of liquidity from an asset perspective. The liability base provides sources of liquidity through attraction of increased deposits and borrowing funds from various other institutions. 

To assist in determining the adequacy of our liquidity, we perform a variety of liquidity stress tests including idiosyncratic, systemic and combined scenarios for both moderate and severe events. Liquidity is defined as the ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities. Liquidity management involves maintaining our ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of our customers, both depositors and borrowers. We seek to maintain a sufficiently liquid asset balance to ensure our ability to meet our obligations. The amount of the appropriate minimum liquid asset balance is determined through severe liquidity stress testing as measured by our liquidity coverage ratio calculation. At June 30, 2020, we were in compliance with our internal policies related to liquidity coverage ratio. 

Changes in interest rates also affect our liquidity position. We currently price deposits in response to market rates. If deposits are not priced in response to market rates, a loss of deposits, particularly noncore deposit, could occur which would negatively affect our liquidity position. 

Scheduled loan payments are a relatively stable source of funds, but loan payoffs and deposit flows fluctuate significantly, being influenced by interest rates, general economic conditions and competition. Additionally, debt security investments are subject to prepayment and call provisions that could accelerate their payoff prior to stated maturity. We attempt to price our deposit products to meet our asset/liability objectives consistent with local market conditions. Our ALCO is responsible for monitoring our ongoing liquidity needs. Our regulators also monitor our liquidity and capital resources on a periodic basis. 

In addition, our bank is a member of the FHLB Cincinnati. As a result, our bank receives advances from the FHLB Cincinnati, pursuant to the terms of various borrowing agreements, which support our funding needs. Under the borrowing agreements with the FHLB Cincinnati, our bank has pledged certain qualifying residential mortgage loans and, pursuant to a blanket lien, all qualifying commercial mortgage loans as collateral. As such, Pinnacle Bank may use the FHLB Cincinnati as a source of liquidity depending on its ALCO strategies. Additionally, we may pledge additional qualifying assets, reduce the amount of pledged assets or experience changes in the value of pledged assets with the FHLB Cincinnati to increase or decrease our borrowing capacity with the FHLB Cincinnati. At June 30, 2020, we estimate we had $2.4 billion in additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB Cincinnati. However, incremental borrowings are made via a formal request by Pinnacle Bank and the subsequent approval by the FHLB Cincinnati. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, $392.5 million in FHLB advances were restructured and prepayment penalties of $2.9 million were recognized in expense for the three months ended June 30, 2020. At June 30, 2020, our bank had received advances from the FHLB Cincinnati totaling $1.8 billion. At June 30, 2020, the scheduled maturities of Pinnacle Bank's FHLB Cincinnati advances and interest rates are as follows (in thousands): 

Scheduled Maturities Amount Interest Rates (1) 

2020 $ 125,000 &#160; 0.62% 2021 575,000 &#160; 0.89% 2022 &#8212; &#160; &#8212;% 2023 &#8212; &#160; &#8212;% 2024 200,000 &#160; 2.09% Thereafter 891,266 &#160; 1.95% Total $ 1,791,266 &#160; Weighted average interest rate 1.53% 

(1) Some FHLB Cincinnati advances include variable interest rates and could increase in the future. The table reflects rates in effect as of June 30, 2020. 

Pinnacle Bank also has accommodations with upstream correspondent banks available for unsecured short-term advances which aggregate $195 million. These accommodations have various covenants related to their term and availability, and in most cases must be repaid within a month of borrowing. We had no outstanding borrowings at June 30, 2020 under these agreements. Our bank also had approximately $3.4 billion in available Federal Reserve discount window lines of credit at June 30, 2020. 

At June 30, 2020, excluding reciprocating time and money market deposits issued through the Promontory Network, we had $3.3 billion of brokered deposits. Historically, we have issued brokered certificates of deposit through several different brokerage houses based on competitive bid. During the first half of 2020, and in response to the uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we intentionally increased our levels of on-balance sheet liquidity. During the first quarter of 2020, this increase was funded by a 

combination of increased core deposits, increased borrowings from the FHLB Cincinnati and increases in brokered time deposits. Core deposit growth during the second quarter of 2020 increased such that we were able to prepay certain wholesale maturities while maintaining an elevated level of on-balance sheet liquidity. 

Banking regulators have defined additional liquidity guidelines, through the issuance of the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Modified LCR. These regulatory guidelines became effective January 2015 with phase in over subsequent years and require these large institutions to follow prescriptive guidance in determining an absolute level of a high quality liquid asset (HQLA) buffer that must be maintained on their balance sheets in order to withstand a potential liquidity crisis event. Although Pinnacle Financial follows the principles outlined in the Interagency Policy Statement on Liquidity Risk Management, issued March 2010, to determine its HQLA buffer, Pinnacle Financial is not currently subject to these regulations. However, these formulas could eventually be imposed on smaller banks, such as Pinnacle Bank, and require an increase in the absolute level of liquidity on our balance sheet, which could result in lower net interest margins for us in future periods. 

At June 30, 2020, we had no individually significant commitments for capital expenditures. But, we believe the number of our locations, including non-branch locations, will increase over an extended period of time across our footprint and that certain of our locations will be in need of required renovations. In future periods, these expansions and renovation projects may lead to additional equipment and occupancy expenses as well as related increases in salaries and benefits expense. Additionally, we expect we will continue to incur costs associated with technology improvements to enhance the infrastructure of our firm. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. &#160; At June 30, 2020, we had outstanding standby letters of credit of $213.3 million and unfunded loan commitments outstanding of $8.7 billion. Because these commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and many will expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment level does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. If needed to fund these outstanding commitments, Pinnacle Bank has the ability to liquidate Federal funds sold or, on a short-term basis, to borrow and purchase Federal funds from other financial institutions. 

Impact of Inflation 

The consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and practices within the banking industry which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than the effects of general levels of inflation.
