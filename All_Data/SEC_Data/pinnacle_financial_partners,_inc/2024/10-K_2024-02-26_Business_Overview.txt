 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

OVERVIEW 

Pinnacle Financial Partners is a financial holding company headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee, with approximately $48.0 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2023. The holding company is the parent company of Pinnacle Bank, a Tennessee state-chartered bank, and owns 100% of the capital stock of Pinnacle Bank. The firm started operations on October 27, 2000, in Nashville, Tennessee, and has since grown through a combination of acquisitions and organic growth to 128 offices from which we conduct branch banking operations, including 51 in Tennessee, 39 in North Carolina, 21 in South Carolina, 10 in Virginia, three in Georgia, two in Alabama, one in Kentucky, and one in Maryland. 

Pinnacle Financial provides a full range of banking, investment, trust, mortgage and insurance products and services designed for businesses and their owners and individuals interested in a comprehensive relationship with their financial institution. The firm is the No. 1 bank in the Nashville-Murfreesboro-Franklin MSA, according to June 30, 2023 deposit data from the FDIC, is listed by Forbes as the No. 27 best bank in the nation in 2023 and earned a spot among the top 25 on the 2023 list of 100 Best Companies to Work For&#174; in the U.S., its seventh consecutive appearance. Pinnacle Bank was also listed in FORTUNE magazine as the No. 6 company to work for in the U.S. for women in 2023. American Banker recognized Pinnacle as the No. 4 of America&#8217;s Best Banks to Work in 2023 for the 11th year in a row and No. 1 among banks with more than $10 billion in assets in 2023. 

Pinnacle Bank owns a 49 percent interest in Bankers Healthcare Group (BHG), which provides innovative, hassle-free financial solutions to healthcare practitioners and other professionals. Prior to September 30, 2022, we held a portion of this investment at Pinnacle Financial and a portion at Pinnacle Bank. Effective September 30, 2022, Pinnacle Financial contributed 100% of the equity interests of BHG owned by it to Pinnacle Bank. The loans originated by BHG are either financed by secured borrowings or sold to independent financial institutions and investors. Great Place to Work and FORTUNE have listed BHG as a best workplace in multiple categories since 2016. 

Pinnacle Financial Partners operates as a community bank in 17 primarily urban markets across the Southeast region of the United States. As an urban community bank, Pinnacle Bank provides the personalized service most often associated with smaller banks while offering many of the sophisticated products and services, such as investments and treasury management, more typically found at much larger banks. This approach has enabled Pinnacle Bank to attract clients from the regional and national banks in all its markets. 

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES 

Lending Services 

We offer a full range of lending products, including commercial, real estate and consumer loans to individuals, businesses and professional entities. We compete for these loans with competitors who are also well established in our geographic markets as well as other non-depository institution lenders that are subject to less regulation than we are. 

Pinnacle Bank's loan approval policies provide for various levels of officer lending authority. When the total amount of loans to a single borrower exceeds an individual officer's lending authority, officers with higher lending authority determine whether to approve any new loan requests or renewals of existing loans. Loans to directors and executive officers subject to Regulation O of the FDIC's rules and regulations require approval of the board, and, certain extensions of credit, including loans above certain amounts require approval of a committee of the board. 

Pinnacle Bank's lending activities are subject to a variety of lending limits imposed by federal and state law. Differing limits apply based on the type of loan or the nature of the borrower, including the borrower's relationship to Pinnacle Bank. In general, however, at December 31, 2023, we were able to loan any one borrower a maximum amount equal to approximately $719.6 million, for loans that meet certain additional collateral guidelines. These legal limits will increase or decrease as Pinnacle Bank's capital increases or decreases as a result of its earnings or losses, the injection of additional capital, payments of dividends, acquisitions, or for other reasons. Pinnacle Bank has internal loan limits ranging from $15 million to $100 million, dependent upon the internal risk rating of a loan, all of which limits are well below the legal lending limit of the bank. 

The principal economic risk associated with each category of loans that Pinnacle Bank has made or may in the future make is the creditworthiness of the borrower. General economic factors affecting a commercial or consumer borrower's ability to repay include interest, inflation and unemployment rates, as well as other factors affecting a borrower's assets, clients, business, suppliers and employees. Many of Pinnacle Bank's commercial loans are made to small- to medium-sized businesses that are sometimes less able to withstand competitive, economic and financial pressures than larger borrowers. During periods of economic weakness or periods of increased inflation, like we have recently experienced, these businesses may be more rapidly and more adversely affected than other enterprises and may cause increased levels of nonaccrual or other problem loans, loan charge-offs and higher provision for credit losses. 

Pinnacle Bank's commercial clients borrow for a variety of purposes. The terms of these loans (which include, among others, equipment loans and working capital loans) will vary by purpose and by type of underlying collateral, if any. Commercial loans may be unsecured or secured by accounts receivable or by other business assets. Pinnacle Bank also makes a variety of commercial real estate loans, including loans secured by investment properties and business loans secured by real estate. 

Pinnacle Bank also makes a variety of loans secured and unsecured to individuals for personal, family, investment and household purposes, including installment and term loans, lines of credit, residential first mortgage loans, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit. We also offer credit cards for consumers and businesses directly. 

Through our subsidiary Advocate Capital, we make loans to law firms to finance case expenses and the firms' working capital needs. These loans are typically secured by the borrower's receivables and in certain circumstances include guaranties by individual partners of the firm. 

Through our subsidiary JB&#38;B Capital, we originate commercial equipment loans and leases, which we also originate through Pinnacle Bank. 

Additionally, during 2022, we added two specialty lending groups: franchise lending and equipment lease financing. 

Deposit Services 

Pinnacle Bank seeks to establish a broad base of core deposits, including savings, noninterest-bearing checking, interest-bearing checking, money market and certificate of deposit accounts, including access to products offered through IntraFi Network Deposit and other niche-based deposit programs. Pinnacle Bank is focused on attracting operating accounts and other core deposits while also lowering our cost of funds. Rates paid on such deposits vary across geographic markets and deposit categories due to different market competition, products and services, deposit size, and other services rendered. Pinnacle Bank acts as a depository for many state and local governments, government agencies, education systems and power and utility organizations. Such public fund deposits are often subject to competitive bid and in many cases must be secured by pledging a portion of our investment securities or a letter of credit. 

To attract deposits, Pinnacle Bank employs a reputation management plan within its geographic markets based on relationship banking. These plans feature broad product lines, competitive pricing, and services it believes will support clients' growth. The primary sources of deposits are businesses, their owners and employees along with individuals interested in a comprehensive banking relationship in Pinnacle&#8217;s geographic markets. Pinnacle Bank traditionally obtains deposits through personal solicitation by its financial advisors and leadership team, although its use of advertising has increased in recent years, primarily due to its partnerships with the Tennessee Titans NFL football team, The Pinnacle at Nashville Yards, and the Memphis Grizzlies NBA basketball team. 

Additionally, Pinnacle Bank offers its targeted small business and commercial clients a comprehensive array of treasury management and remote deposit services, which allow electronic deposits to be made from the client's place of business. Our treasury management services include, among other products, online wire origination, enhanced ACH origination services, positive pay, zero balance and sweep accounts, automated bill pay services, electronic receivables processing, lockbox processing, merchant card acceptance services, small business and commercial credit cards corporate purchasing cards and virtual accounting/deposit escrow solutions. 

&#160; 

Investment, Trust and Insurance Services 

Pinnacle Bank contracts with Raymond James Financial Services, Inc. ("RJFS"), a registered broker-dealer and investment adviser, to offer and sell various securities and other financial products to the public through associates who are employed by both Pinnacle Bank and RJFS. RJFS is a subsidiary of Raymond James Financial, Inc. 

Pinnacle Bank offers, through RJFS, non-FDIC insured investment products to help clients achieve their financial objectives within their risk tolerances. The brokerage and investment advisory program offered by RJFS complements Pinnacle Bank's general banking business and further supports its business philosophy and strategy of delivering to our clients a comprehensive array of products and services that meet their financial needs. Pursuant to its contract, RJFS is primarily responsible for the compliance monitoring of dual employees of RJFS and Pinnacle Bank. Additionally, Pinnacle Bank has developed its own compliance-monitoring program in an effort to further ensure that associates deliver these products in a manner consistent with the various regulations governing such activities. Pinnacle Bank receives a percentage of commission credits and fees generated by the program. Pinnacle Bank remains responsible for various expenses associated with the program, including furnishings, equipment and promotional expenses and general personnel costs, including commissions paid to licensed brokers. 

Pinnacle Bank also provides fiduciary and investment services through its Trust &#38; Investment Services department. Services offered for individual and commercial clients include an array of accounts including personal trust, investment management, estate administration, endowments, foundations, individual retirement accounts, escrow services and custody. Additionally, Trust &#38; Investment Services provides investment services for qualified plans, primarily through its Retirement Plan Services division. 

Additionally, Pinnacle Wealth Advisors, a registered investment advisor, provides investment advisory services to its clients. Miller Loughry Beach Insurance Services, Inc. and HPB Insurance Group, Inc., which are insurance agency subsidiaries of Pinnacle Bank, provide insurance products, particularly in the property and casualty area, to their respective clients. Advocap Insurance Agency, Inc., an insurance agency subsidiary of Advocate Capital, sells insurance products, including professional liability, cyber protection, directors and officers, errors and omissions and life insurance, to its clients consisting mainly of law firms and partners within those firms. 

M&#38;A Advisory and Securities Offering Services 

PNFP Capital Markets, Inc. launched in 2015. As a broker-dealer, this team offers corporate clients merger and acquisition advisory services, private debt, equity and mezzanine placement services and other selected middle-market advisory services. 

Other Banking Services 

Given client demand to access banking and investment services easily, Pinnacle Bank also offers a broad array of convenience-centered products and services, including 24-hour telephone and online banking, mobile banking, debit and credit cards, direct deposit, remote deposit capture and mobile deposit options. We also offer cash management services for businesses. Additionally, Pinnacle Bank is associated with a nationwide network of automated teller machines of other financial institutions that clients are able to use throughout our footprint. In many cases, Pinnacle Bank reimburses its clients for any fees that may be charged for using the nationwide ATM network, providing greater convenience as compared to regional competitors. 

Competitive Conditions 

We face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors, many of whom are larger and have more financial resources than we do. Such competitors primarily include national, regional and internet banks within the various markets in which we operate though we also compete with smaller community banks that seek to offer service levels similar to ours. We also face competition from many other types of institutions, including, without limitation, savings and loans associations, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies and other financial intermediaries. 

The financial services industry is becoming even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms, and insurance companies can operate as affiliates under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Many of our nonbank competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may be able to develop and offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services. Finally, our competitors may choose to offer lower interest rates and pay higher deposit rates than we do. The actions of these competitors in these regards could cause us to lose customers or elements of the total business relationship we have with a client which could negatively impact our business. 

We believe that the most important criteria to our bank's targeted clients when selecting a bank is their desire to receive exceptional and personal service. Equally important is being able to enjoy convenient access to a broad array of financial products offered by a financial institution with an ability to meet the changing needs of a sophisticated client base. Additionally, when presented with a choice, we believe that many of our bank's targeted clients would prefer to deal with an institution that favors local decision making as opposed to one where many important decisions regarding a client's financial affairs are made outside of the local community. 

Employees and Human Capital 

From our founding, we have focused on building an excellent work environment, because we believe excited associates lead to engaged clients and that engaged clients contribute to enriched shareholders. Our hiring philosophy has always been to create the best place to work in our markets. That started with our initial offices in our hometown of Nashville. From there we have branched out across our home state of Tennessee and into some of the best markets in the Southeast. Our hiring philosophy is simple: We aim to hire successful, experienced bankers in each of our markets that share our desire to build a team-oriented firm where our associates win together. In our company, all non-commissioned associates have one set of performance goals under our annual cash incentive plan and nearly every associate in our company is annually awarded equity-based compensation. We believe our unique culture and its resulting high levels of associate engagement and retention rates allow us to be better than our competitors in meeting the needs of our clients. 

We are engaging with our associates on a regular basis to assess job satisfaction, and we use the information from internal and third-party surveys to improve our ability to attract, develop, and retain talented associates who drive client engagement. All associates joining Pinnacle, including those joining as a result of an acquisition, participate in a three-day orientation that focuses on culture. During 2023, we received more than 15 local or national workplace awards including ranking No. 24 among the 100 Best Companies to Work For, No. 26 Best Workplaces for Millennials and No. 6 Best Workplaces for Women all by Great Place to Work&#174; and FORTUNE Magazine, as well as earning a spot on PEOPLE Magazine's 100 Companies That Care list. All of these honors place heavy emphasis on anonymous surveys of associates in the judging criteria. We believe these awards illustrate that our culture is strong, and our financial returns illustrate that the focus on culture is a winning business strategy. As of December 31, 2023, we employed 3,357.0 full-time equivalent associates. 

None of our associates are represented by a union, collective bargaining agreement or similar arrangement, and we have not experienced any labor disputes or strikes arising from any organized labor groups. We aim to create a great place to work for all of our associates. We believe that a strong and diverse team is critical to our success and are committed to being more vocal and focused on our efforts toward creating a great place to work for all. We are guided by the foundational elements of our diversity and inclusion policy, namely that all people deserve a great place to work and do business and that every community deserves an equal opportunity for economic prosperity. The Company's Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer along with two regional DEI advisors, lead and coordinate the focused effort and continued commitment to diversity, inclusion and equity with associates internally as well as with clients and in the communities we serve. At December 31, 2023, 65% of our associates were women and approximately 18% identify themselves as part of a racial or ethnic minority group. Among the Company&#8217;s 202-person Leadership Team, women make up approximately 34% of these associates, up from 23% in 2020, while minorities account for approximately 9% of the Leadership Team members, up from 4% in 2020. Beginning in 2020, a senior leadership team made up of a subset of these Leadership Team members was formed. Presently, the senior leadership team consists of 11 associates, with women making up 18% of this group and minorities making up 9%. Though we are proud of the progress we have made since 2020, we understand that more work remains to be done and we have implemented several initiatives designed to achieve a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive team, including enhanced training, leadership succession initiatives and the development of a multi-year strategy to focus on enhancing our associates&#8217; diversity, equity, and inclusion awareness. This diversity, equity, and inclusion awareness enhancement process includes a number of initiatives that are underway to build broader networks with diverse agencies and community organizations as we look to recruit and develop future diverse associates and leaders. Through these initiatives, we have also achieved improving diversity in our leadership succession plan. As of December 31, 2023, women represented 62% of leadership first-choice successors in our succession plan when an internal successor was identified, up 53% over 2022. Associates who identify themselves as part of a racial or ethnic minority group, represented 14% of leadership first-choice successors in our succession plan when an internal candidate was identified, up 32% over 2022. 

Serving the needs of all of the members of our communities also remains an important part of our strategy. For years, we have focused our community investment efforts on giving within four categories that we believe improve the quality of life of the citizens in our communities: education, health and human services, economic development and the arts. We also empower our associates to serve the causes about which they are most passionate. In 2022, our associates volunteered more than 33,643 hours of their time through 3,718 service opportunities o help organizations across our footprint.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 

Both Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank as well as many of their subsidiaries and entities in which they have made investments are subject to extensive state and federal banking and other laws and regulations that impose restrictions on and provide for general regulatory oversight of Pinnacle Financial's and Pinnacle Bank's and these subsidiaries&#8217; operations. These laws and regulations are generally intended to protect depositors and borrowers, not shareholders. 

Pinnacle Financial 

Pinnacle Financial is a bank holding company under the federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 that has elected to become a "financial holding company" thereunder. As a result, it is subject to the supervision, examination, and reporting requirements of the Bank Holding Company Act and the regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("Federal Reserve"). 

Acquisition of Banks. The Bank Holding Company Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the Federal Reserve's prior approval before: 

&#8226; Acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if, after the acquisition, the bank holding company will directly or indirectly own or control more than 5% of the bank's voting shares; 

&#8226; Acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of any bank; or 

&#8226; Subject to certain exemptions, merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company. 

Additionally, the Bank Holding Company Act provides that the Federal Reserve may not approve any of these transactions if it would substantially lessen competition or otherwise function as a restraint of trade, or result in or tend to create a monopoly, unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the communities to be served. The Federal Reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks concerned; the effectiveness of the applicant in combating money laundering; the convenience and needs of the communities to be served; and the extent to which the proposal would result in greater or more concentrated risk to the United States banking or financial system. 

Under the Bank Holding Company Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank Act"), if well capitalized and well managed, a bank holding company located in Tennessee may purchase a bank located outside of Tennessee. Conversely, a well capitalized and well managed bank holding company located outside of Tennessee may purchase a bank located inside Tennessee. In each case, however, state law restrictions may be placed on the acquisition of a bank that has only been in existence for a limited amount of time or will result in specified concentrations of deposits. For example, Tennessee law currently prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring control of a Tennessee-based financial institution until the target financial institution has been in operation for three years. 

Change in Bank Control. Subject to various exceptions, the Federal Change in Bank Control Act, together with related regulations, require Federal Reserve approval prior to any person or company acquiring "control" of a bank holding company. Control is conclusively presumed to exist if an individual or company, together with any other person deemed to be acting in concert with such individual or company, acquires 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the bank holding company. Control is rebuttably presumed to exist if an individual or company, together with any other person deemed to be acting in concert with such individual or company, acquires 10% or more, but less than 25%, of any class of voting securities and either: 

&#8226; The bank holding company has registered securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act; or 

&#8226; No other person owns a greater percentage of that class of voting securities immediately after the transaction. 

Pinnacle Financial's common stock is registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. The regulations provide a procedure for challenge of the rebuttable control presumption. 

Permitted Activities. Bank holding companies generally are prohibited, except in certain statutorily prescribed instances including exceptions for financial holding companies, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of 5% or more of any class of the outstanding voting securities of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or furnishing services to its subsidiaries. However, subject to prior notice or Federal Reserve approval, bank holding companies may engage in, or acquire shares of companies engaged in, activities determined by the Federal Reserve to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 amended the Bank Holding Company Act and expanded the activities in which bank holding companies and affiliates of banks are permitted to engage. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act eliminated many federal and state law barriers to affiliations among banks and securities firms, insurance companies, and other financial service providers, and provided that holding companies which elected to become financial holding companies, as Pinnacle Financial has done, could engage in activities that are: 

&#8226; Financial in nature; 

&#8226; Incidental to a financial activity (as determined by the Federal Reserve in consultation with the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury); or 

&#8226; Complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally (as determined by the Federal Reserve). 

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act identifies the following activities as financial in nature: 

&#8226; Lending, trust and other banking activities; 

&#8226; Insuring, guaranteeing, or indemnifying against loss or harm, or providing and issuing annuities, and acting as principal, agent, or broker for these purposes, in any state; 

&#8226; Providing financial, investment, or advisory services; 

&#8226; Issuing or selling instruments representing interests in pools of assets permissible for a bank to hold directly; 

&#8226; Underwriting, dealing in or making a market in securities; 

&#8226; Activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident to banking or managing or controlling banks; 

&#8226; Activities permitted outside of the United States that the Federal Reserve has determined to be usual in connection with banking or other financial operations abroad; 

&#8226; Merchant banking, including through securities or insurance affiliates; and 

&#8226; Insurance company portfolio investments. 

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also authorizes the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, to determine activities in addition to those listed above that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to such financial activity. In determining whether a particular activity is financial in nature or incidental or complementary to a financial activity, the Federal Reserve must consider (1) the purpose of the Bank Holding Company Act and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, (2) changes or reasonably expected changes in the marketplace in which financial holding companies compete and in the technology for delivering financial services, and (3) whether the activity is necessary or appropriate to allow financial holding companies to effectively compete with other financial service providers and to efficiently deliver information and services. Pinnacle Financial became a financial holding company effective as of February 17, 2016. 

To maintain financial holding company status, a financial holding company and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be "well capitalized" and "well managed" and, except in limited circumstances, in satisfactory compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act, as discussed in the section captioned &#8220;Community Reinvestment Act&#8221; below. A depository institution subsidiary is considered to be "well capitalized" if it satisfies the requirements for this status discussed in the section captioned "Capital Adequacy" below. A depository institution subsidiary is considered "well managed" if it received a composite rating and management rating of at least "satisfactory" in its most recent examination. A financial holding company's status will also depend upon it maintaining its status as "well capitalized" and "well managed" under applicable Federal Reserve regulations. If a financial holding company and its depository institution subsidiaries cease to meet these capital and management requirements, the Federal Reserve's regulations provide that the financial holding company must enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements. Until the financial holding company (including its depository institution subsidiaries) returns to compliance, the Federal Reserve may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities, and the company may not commence any of the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or acquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior approval of the Federal Reserve. If the financial holding company (including its depository institution subsidiaries) does not return to compliance within 180 days, the Federal Reserve may require divestiture of the holding company's depository institutions or alternatively the holding company may be required to cease to engage in the activities that it is engaged in that a bank holding company is not permitted to engage in without being a financial holding company. 

In order for a financial holding company to commence any new activity permitted by the Bank Holding Company Act or to acquire a company engaged in any new activity permitted by the Bank Holding Company Act, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company must have received a rating of at least "satisfactory" in its most recent examination under the Community Reinvestment Act. 

Despite prior approval, the Federal Reserve may order a financial holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any of these activities or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when it has reasonable cause to believe that the financial holding company's continued ownership, activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of any of its bank subsidiaries or if there is a failure to maintain certain capital or management standards. 

Support of Subsidiary Institutions. Pinnacle Financial is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for its bank subsidiary, Pinnacle Bank, and to commit resources to support Pinnacle Bank. This support can be required at times when it would not be in the best interest of Pinnacle Financial's shareholders or creditors to provide it. In the event of Pinnacle Financial's bankruptcy, any commitment by it to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of Pinnacle Bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. 

Pinnacle Bank 

Pinnacle Financial owns one bank - Pinnacle Bank. Pinnacle Bank is a state bank chartered under the laws of the State of Tennessee that is not a member of the Federal Reserve. As a result, it is subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements and the regulations of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") and Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions ("TDFI"). The TDFI has the authority to approve or disapprove mergers, the issuance of preferred stock and capital notes by Pinnacle Bank, the establishment of branches and similar corporate actions. The TDFI regularly examines state banks like Pinnacle Bank and in connection with its examinations may identify matters necessary to improve a bank's operation in accordance with principles of safety and soundness. The FDIC also has examination powers with respect to state, non-member banks like Pinnacle Bank. Any matters identified in such examinations are required to be appropriately addressed by the bank. Pinnacle Bank is also subject to numerous state and federal statutes and regulations that will affect its business, activities and operations. 

Branching. While the TDFI has authority to approve branch applications, state banks are required by the State of Tennessee to adhere to branching laws applicable to state chartered banks in the states in which they are located. With prior regulatory approval, Tennessee law permits banks based in the state to either establish new or acquire existing branch offices throughout Tennessee. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, Pinnacle Bank and any other national or state-chartered bank generally may, with receipt of any required regulatory approvals, branch across state lines to the same extent as banks chartered in the state where the branch is located. 

FDIC Insurance . Deposits in Pinnacle Bank are insured by the FDIC up to $250,000 subject to applicable limitations. To offset the cost of this insurance, the FDIC has adopted a risk-based assessment system for insured depository institutions that takes into account the risks attributable to different categories and concentrations of an insured depository institution&#8217;s assets and liabilities. An institution&#8217;s assessment rate depends on the category to which it is assigned and certain adjustments specified by the FDIC, with less risky institutions paying lower assessments. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has adopted regulations that base deposit insurance assessments on total assets less capital rather than deposit liabilities and include off-balance sheet liabilities of institutions and their affiliates in risk-based assessments. After an institution's average assets exceed $10 billion over four quarters as ours have, the assessment rate increases compared to institutions at lower average asset levels. In addition, for larger institutions, like Pinnacle Bank, the FDIC uses a performance score and a loss-severity score that are used to calculate an initial assessment rate. In calculating these scores, the FDIC uses a bank&#8217;s capital level and supervisory ratings and certain financial measures to assess an institution&#8217;s ability to withstand asset-related stress and funding-related stress. The FDIC has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the calculations. Continued increases in our FDIC insurance premiums could have an adverse effect on Pinnacle Bank&#8217;s and Pinnacle Financial&#8217;s results of operations. 

In November 2023, the FDIC issued a final rule to implement a special assessment to recover losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund ("DIF") incurred as a result of bank failures that occurred during the first half of 2023 and the FDIC's use of the systemic risk exception to cover certain deposits that were otherwise uninsured. The special assessment was based on estimated uninsured deposits as of December 31, 2022 (excluding the first $5.0 billion) and will be assessed at a quarterly rate of 3.36 basis points, over eight quarterly assessment periods, beginning in the first quarter of 2024. As a result of this final rule, we accrued $29.0 million ($21.8 million after tax) related to this assessment in the fourth quarter of 2023. This amount represents our current expectation of the full amount of the assessment based on our total uninsured deposits as of December 31, 2022. Under the final rule, the estimated loss pursuant to the systemic risk determination will be periodically adjusted, and the FDIC has retained the ability to cease collection early, extend the special assessment collection period and impose a final shortfall special assessment on a one-time basis. The extent to which any such additional future assessments will impact our future deposit insurance expense is currently uncertain. 

The FDIC may terminate its insurance of an institution's deposits if it finds that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. 

General Enforcement Authority of Regulators 

Bank holding companies (including those that have elected to be financial holding companies) and insured banks also may be subject to potential enforcement actions of varying levels of severity by the federal regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their business, or for violation of any law, rule, regulation, condition imposed in writing by any applicable agency or term of a written agreement with that agency. In more serious cases, enforcement actions may include the issuance of directives to increase capital; the issuance of formal and informal agreements; the imposition of civil monetary penalties; the issuance of a cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced; the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against officers, directors, and other institution-affiliated parties; the termination of the bank&#8217;s deposit insurance; the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the bank; and the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders based upon a judicial determination that the agency would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted. 

Capital Adequacy 

The Federal Reserve has established a risk-based and a leverage measure of capital adequacy for bank holding companies. Pinnacle Bank is also subject to risk-based and leverage capital requirements adopted by the FDIC, which are substantially similar to those adopted by the Federal Reserve for bank holding companies. The risk-based capital standards are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies, to account for off-balance-sheet exposure, and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets. Assets and off-balance-sheet items, such as letters of credit and unfunded loan commitments, are assigned to broad risk categories, each with appropriate risk weights. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance-sheet items. Tennessee state banks are required to have the capital structure that the TDFI deems adequate, and the Commissioner of the TDFI as well as federal regulators may require a state bank (or its holding company in the case of federal regulators) to increase its capital structure to the point deemed adequate by the Commissioner or such other federal regulator before granting approval of a branch application, merger application or charter amendment. 

The Dodd-Frank Act contains a number of provisions dealing with capital adequacy of insured depository institutions and their holding companies, and for the most part these provisions have resulted in insured depository institutions and their holding companies being subject to more stringent capital requirements than before passage of the act. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, federal regulators have established minimum Tier 1 leverage and risk-based capital requirements for, among other entities, banks and bank holding companies on a consolidated basis. These minimum requirements require that a bank holding company maintain a ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets, less goodwill, other intangible assets and other required deductions ("Tier 1 leverage ratio") of not less than 4% and a total capital ratio of not less than 8%. 

In July 2013, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC approved final rules that substantially amended the regulatory capital rules applicable to Pinnacle Bank and Pinnacle Financial, effective January 1, 2015. The final rules implement the regulatory capital reforms of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision reflected in "Basel III: A Global Regulatory Framework for More Resilient Banks and Banking Systems" (Basel III) and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. 

Under these rules, the leverage and risk-based capital ratios of bank holding companies like Pinnacle Financial may not be lower than the leverage and risk-based capital ratios for insured depository institutions like Pinnacle Bank. The final capital rules implementing Basel III include minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios for banks and their holding companies. Moreover, these rules refined the definition of what constitutes "capital" for purposes of calculating those ratios, including the definitions of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. Total capital consists of two components, Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. Tier 1 capital generally consists of common stock (plus related surplus) and retained earnings, minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries and noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus, less goodwill and other specified intangible assets and other regulatory deductions. Tier 2 capital generally consists of perpetual preferred stock and related surplus not meeting the Tier 1 capital definition, qualifying trust preferred securities and subordinated debt, qualifying mandatorily convertible debt securities, and a limited amount of the allowance for credit losses. 

The minimum capital level requirements applicable to bank holding companies and banks subject to the federal regulators' capital rules are: (i) a Tier 1 common equity (&#8220;CET1&#8221;) capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%; (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% for all institutions. The rules also established a "capital conservation buffer" of 2.5% (to consist of CET1 capital) above the regulatory minimum capital ratios that has resulted in the following minimum ratios: (i) a CET1 capital ratio of 7%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if capital levels fall below minimum levels plus the buffer amounts. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for any such actions. 

Under the Basel III capital rules, CET1 consists of common stock and paid in capital and retained earnings. CET1 is reduced by goodwill, certain intangible assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities, deferred tax assets that arise from tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards, net of any valuation allowance, and certain other items specified in the Basel III capital rules. The Basel III capital rules also provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and investments in non-consolidated financial institutions be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any such category exceeds 25% of CET1. 

The final rules allowed banks and their holding companies with less than $250 billion in assets a one-time opportunity to opt-out of a requirement to include unrealized gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in their capital calculation. Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank each opted out of this requirement. 

Pinnacle Financial must qualify as "well capitalized," among other requirements, in order for it to engage in certain acquisitions or be eligible for expedited treatment of certain regulatory applications, including those related to mergers and acquisitions. For Pinnacle Financial to qualify as "well capitalized," for these purposes it must have a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6% and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10% and not be subject to a written agreement, order or directive to maintain a specific capital level. 

Failure to meet statutorily mandated capital requirements or more restrictive ratios separately established for a depository institution or its holding company by its regulators could subject a bank or bank holding company to a variety of enforcement remedies, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on accepting or renewing brokered deposits, limitations on the rates of interest that the institution may pay on its deposits and other restrictions on its business. 

Additionally, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA") establishes a system of prompt corrective action (&#8220;PCA&#8221;) to resolve the problems of undercapitalized financial institutions. Under this system, the federal banking regulators have established five capital categories (well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized) into one of which all institutions are placed. Federal banking regulators are required to take various mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories. The severity of the action depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. Generally, subject to a narrow exception, the banking regulator must appoint a receiver or conservator within a specified period for an institution that is critically undercapitalized. The federal banking agencies have specified by regulation the relevant capital level for each category. 

Under FDIC regulations, a state regulated bank which is not a member of the Federal Reserve (a state non-member bank) like Pinnacle Bank is "well capitalized" under PCA if it has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5% or better, a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% or better, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% or better, a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or better, and is not subject to a regulatory agreement, order or directive to maintain a specific level for any capital measure. A state non-member bank is considered "adequately capitalized" if it has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4%, a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% or better, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0% and does not meet the definition of a well-capitalized bank. Lower levels of capital result 

in a bank being considered undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. State non-member banks are required to be "well capitalized" in order to take advantage of expedited procedures on certain applications, such as those related to the opening of branches and mergers, and to accept and renew brokered deposits without further regulatory approval. 

An institution that is categorized as undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking agency. In addition, a bank holding company must guarantee that a subsidiary depository institution meets its capital restoration plan, subject to various limitations. The controlling holding company's obligation to fund a capital restoration plan is limited to the lesser of 5% of an undercapitalized subsidiary's assets or the amount required to meet regulatory capital requirements. An undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets, making acquisitions, establishing any branches or engaging in any new line of business, except under an accepted capital restoration plan or with FDIC approval. The FDIC is required to resolve a bank when its ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets reaches 2%. The regulations also establish procedures for downgrading an institution into a lower capital category based on supervisory factors other than capital. 

The Basel III capital rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings that expand the risk-weighting categories from the four Basel I-derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. Specific changes to the rules impacting Pinnacle Financial&#8217;s and Pinnacle Bank&#8217;s determination of risk-weighted assets include, among other things: 

&#8226; applying a 150% risk weight instead of a 100% risk weight for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans; 

&#8226; assigning a 150% risk weight to the unsecured portion of non-residential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or otherwise on nonaccrual status; 

&#8226; providing for a 20% credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable (previously set at 0%); 

&#8226; providing for a risk weight, generally not less than 20% with certain exceptions, for securities lending transactions based on the risk weight category of the underlying collateral securing the transaction; 

&#8226; providing for a 600% risk weight on certain equity exposures; and 

&#8226; eliminating the 50% cap on the risk weight for OTC derivatives. 

In December 2017, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published the last version of the Basel III accord, generally referred to as &#8220;Basel IV&#8221; or the &#8220;Basel III Endgame.&#8221; The Basel Committee stated that a key objective of the revisions incorporated into the framework is to reduce excessive variability of risk-weighted assets (&#8220;RWA&#8221;), which will be accomplished by enhancing the robustness and risk sensitivity of the standardized approaches for credit risk and operational risk, which will facilitate the comparability of banks&#8217; capital ratios; constraining the use of internally modeled approaches; and complementing the risk-weighted capital ratio with a finalized leverage ratio and a revised and robust capital floor. In July 2023, federal banking regulators issued a joint agency proposal that sought to implement the final components of the Basel III Endgame as well as seeking to make changes aimed at addressing the underlying causes of the turmoil in the banking industry that was experienced in the first half of 2023 with the failure of certain larger financial institutions. The proposal seeks to revise the capital framework for banks with total assets of $100 billion or more in four main areas of credit risk, market risk, operational risk and credit valuation adjustment risk. The proposal also would require banks with total assets of $100 billion or more to include unrealized gains and losses from certain securities in their capital ratios, to comply with supplementary leverage ratio requirements and to comply with countercyclical capital buffer requirements, if activated. The comment period for these proposed changes ended in January 2024, with the final rules expected to be published later in 2024, and though the proposal applies only to banks with total assets of $100 billion or more, it&#8217;s unclear at this time whether any of these more stringent requirements will be imposed on Pinnacle Financial or Pinnacle Bank through the ongoing regulatory oversight process. 

In February 2019, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule (the &#8220;2019 CECL Rule&#8221;) that revised certain capital regulations to account for changes to credit loss accounting under U.S. GAAP. The 2019 CECL Rule included a transition option that allows banking organizations to phase in, over a three-year period, the day-one adverse effects of adopting a new accounting standard related to the measurement of current expected credit losses (&#8220;CECL&#8221;) on their regulatory capital ratios (three-year transition option). In March 2020, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that maintained the three-year transition option of the 2019 CECL Rule and also provided banking organizations that were required under U.S. GAAP (as of January 2020) to implement CECL before the end of 2020 the option to delay for two years an estimate of the effect of CECL on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period (five-year transition option). As permitted by the interim final rule issued on March 27, 2020 by the federal banking regulatory agencies, each of Pinnacle Bank and Pinnacle Financial has elected the option to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital of Pinnacle Financial's and Pinnacle Bank's adoption of ASU 2016-13, &#8220;Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments&#8221;, which was effective January 1, 2020. The initial impact of adoption of ASU 2016-13, as well as 25% of the quarterly increases in the allowance for credit losses subsequent to adoption of ASU 2016-13 (collectively the &#8220;transition adjustments&#8221;), was delayed until December 31, 2021. As of January 1, 2022, the cumulative amount of the transition adjustments of $68.0 million became fixed and will be phased out of the regulatory capital calculations evenly over a three year period, with 75% recognized in 2022, 50% 

recognized in 2023, and 25% recognized in 2024. Beginning on January 1, 2025, the temporary regulatory capital benefits will be fully reversed. 

At December 31, 2023, Pinnacle Bank's CET1 capital ratio was 11.1%, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 11.1%, total risk-based capital ratio was 12.0% and Tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.7%, compared to 10.9%, 10.9%, 11.6% and 10.1% at December 31, 2022, respectively. At December 31, 2023, Pinnacle Financial's CET1 capital ratio was 10.3% Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 10.8%, total risk-based capital ratio was 12.7% and Tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.4%, compared to 10.0%, 10.5%, 12.4% and 9.7% at December 31, 2022, respectively. All of these ratios exceeded regulatory minimums and those required by Basel III and FDICIA (including after application of any applicable capital conservation buffer) to be considered well capitalized. More information concerning Pinnacle Financial's and Pinnacle Bank's regulatory ratios at December 31, 2023 is included in Note 19 to the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Capital Planning 

Banking organizations must have appropriate capital planning processes, with proper oversight from the board of directors. Accordingly, pursuant to a separate, general supervisory letter from the Federal Reserve, bank holding companies are expected to conduct and document comprehensive capital adequacy analyses prior to the declaration of any dividends (on common stock, preferred stock, trust preferred securities or other Tier 1 capital instruments), capital redemptions or capital repurchases. Moreover, the federal banking agencies have adopted a joint agency policy statement, noting that the adequacy and effectiveness of a bank&#8217;s interest rate risk management process and the level of its interest rate exposures are critical factors in the evaluation of the bank&#8217;s capital adequacy. A bank with material weaknesses in its interest rate risk management process or high levels of interest rate exposure relative to its capital will be directed by the relevant federal banking agencies to take corrective actions. 

In January 2023, Pinnacle Financial&#8217;s board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $125.0 million of Pinnacle Financial&#8217;s outstanding common stock, which is scheduled to expire upon the earlier of Pinnacle Financial&#8217;s repurchase of shares of its outstanding common stock having an aggregate purchase price of $125.0 million and March 31, 2024. During 2023, Pinnacle Financial repurchased no shares of its common stock under such share repurchase program. In addition, in January 2024, Pinnacle Financial&#8217;s board of directors approved a subsequent repurchase program for up to $125.0 million. The new repurchase program will commence upon the expiration of the current program and is scheduled to expire upon the earlier of Pinnacle Financial&#8217;s repurchase of shares of its outstanding common stock having an aggregate purchase price of $125.0 million and March 31, 2025. Repurchases of shares of Pinnacle Financial&#8217;s common stock will be made in accordance with applicable laws and may be made at management&#8217;s discretion from time to time in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. 

Payment of Dividends 

Pinnacle Financial is a legal entity separate and distinct from Pinnacle Bank. Though Pinnacle Financial had cash and cash equivalents of $197.1 million as of December 31, 2023, the principal source of Pinnacle Financial's cash flow, including cash flow to pay interest to its holders of subordinated debentures and subordinated notes, and any dividends payable to common shareholders and holders of its preferred stock, are dividends that Pinnacle Bank pays to Pinnacle Financial as its sole shareholder. Under Tennessee law, Pinnacle Financial is not permitted to pay dividends if, after giving effect to such payment, it would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or its total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus any amounts needed to satisfy any preferential rights if it were dissolving. In addition, in deciding whether or not to declare a dividend of any particular size, Pinnacle Financial's board of directors must consider its and Pinnacle Bank's current and prospective capital, liquidity, and other needs. 

In addition to state law limitations on Pinnacle Financial's ability to pay dividends, the Federal Reserve imposes limitations on Pinnacle Financial's ability to pay dividends. As noted above, effective January 1, 2016, Federal Reserve regulations limit dividends, stock repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers if Pinnacle Financial's regulatory capital is below the level of regulatory minimums plus the applicable capital conservation buffer. Additionally, it is Federal Reserve policy that bank holding companies generally should pay dividends on common stock only out of net income available to common shareholders over the past year and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization's current and expected future capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Federal Reserve policy also provides that a bank holding company should inform the Federal Reserve reasonably in advance of declaring or paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the bank holding company's capital structure. See "Capital Adequacy" above. 

Statutory and regulatory limitations also apply to Pinnacle Bank's payment of dividends to Pinnacle Financial. Pinnacle Bank is required by Tennessee law to obtain the prior approval of the Commissioner of the TDFI for payments of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by its board of directors in any calendar year will exceed (1) the total of Pinnacle Bank's net income for that year, plus (2) Pinnacle Bank's retained net income for the preceding two years. As of December 31, 2023, Pinnacle Bank could pay dividends to Pinnacle Financial of up to $1.4 billion. Generally, federal regulatory policy encourages holding company debt to be serviced by subsidiary bank dividends or additional equity rather than debt issuances. Pinnacle Financial had available cash balances 

of approximately $197.1 million at December 31, 2023 that could be used to pay its obligations and support Pinnacle Bank. 

The payment of dividends by Pinnacle Bank and Pinnacle Financial may also be affected by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above statutory and regulatory requirements imposed on Pinnacle Bank or Pinnacle Financial by their regulators. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution's capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Under the FDICIA, a depository institution may not pay any dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. 

During the fourth quarter of 2013, Pinnacle Financial initiated a quarterly common stock dividend in the amount of $0.08 per share. The board of directors of Pinnacle Financial has increased the dividend amount per share over time. The most recent increase occurred on January 18, 2022, when the board of directors increased the dividend to $0.22 per share. During the year ended December 31, 2023, Pinnacle Financial paid $68.7 million in net dividends to its common shareholders. On January 16, 2024, our board of directors declared a $0.22 per share quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders which approximated $17.3 million in aggregate dividend payments and was paid on February 23, 2024 to common shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 2, 2024. 

During the second quarter of 2020, Pinnacle Financial issued 9.0 million depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of its 6.75% fixed rate non-cumulative, perpetual preferred stock, Series B (Series B Preferred Stock) in a registered public offering to both retail and institutional investors. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, Pinnacle Financial paid $15.2 million in dividends on its Series B Preferred Stock. On January 16, 2024, our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of approximately $3.8 million, or $16.88 per share (or $0.422 per depositary share), on the Series B Preferred Stock payable on March 1, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 15, 2024. 

The amount and timing of all future dividend payments, if any, including on the Series B Preferred Stock, is subject to our board's discretion and will depend on our earnings, capital position, financial condition and other factors, including, if necessary, our receipt of dividends from Pinnacle Bank, regulatory capital requirements, as they become known to us and receipt of any regulatory approvals that may become required as a result of our and our bank subsidiary's financial results. If we fail to pay dividends on our Series B Preferred Stock, we will be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock. 

Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates 

Both Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank are subject to the provisions of Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. Section 23A places limits on the amount of: 

&#8226; A bank's loans or extensions of credit, including purchases of assets subject to an agreement to repurchase, to or for the benefit of affiliates; 

&#8226; A bank's investment in affiliates; 

&#8226; Assets a bank may purchase from affiliates, except for real and personal property exempted by the Federal Reserve; 

&#8226; The amount of loans or extensions of credit to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of affiliates; 

&#8226; Transactions involving the borrowing or lending of securities and any derivative transaction that results in credit exposure to an affiliate; and 

&#8226; A bank's guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit issued on behalf of an affiliate. 

The total amount of the above transactions is limited in amount, as to any one affiliate, to 10% of a bank's capital and surplus and, as to all affiliates combined, to 20% of a bank's capital stock and surplus. In addition to the limitation on the amount of these transactions, each of the above transactions that is a credit transaction must also meet specified collateral requirements. Pinnacle Bank must also comply with other provisions designed to avoid the taking of low-quality assets. 

Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank are also subject to the provisions of Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act which, among other things, prohibits an institution from engaging in the above transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the institution or its subsidiaries, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies. 

Pinnacle Bank is also subject to restrictions on extensions of credit to its executive officers, directors, principal shareholders and their related interests. Among other requirements and limitations, these extensions of credit are subject to certain dollar value limitations, must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties, and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. 

Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending 

The Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) requires that, in connection with examinations of financial institutions within their respective jurisdictions, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC shall evaluate the record of each financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods consistent with safe and sound operations of the institutions. These facts are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions, and applications to open a branch or facility. Failure to 

adequately meet these criteria could impose additional requirements and limitations on Pinnacle Bank. Additionally, banks are required to publicly disclose the terms of various Community Reinvestment Act-related agreements. Pinnacle Bank received a satisfactory CRA rating from its primary federal regulator on its most recent CRA regulatory examination. 

In December 2019, the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#8220;OCC&#8221;) jointly proposed rules that would have significantly changed existing CRA regulations. In May 2020, the OCC issued its final CRA rule, effective October 1, 2020; however, in December 2021, the OCC revoked the newly issued rule and largely reverted to its prior CRA rule. On October 24, 2023, the OCC, Federal Reserve and FDIC issued a final rule that the regulators believe will strengthen and modernize regulations implementing the CRA. The stated key objectives of the rule are to (1) strengthen the achievement of the core purpose of the CRA, (2) adapt to changes in the banking industry, including the expanded role of mobile and online banking, (3) provide greater clarity and consistency in the application of CRA regulations, (4) tailor performance standards to account for differences in bank size, business models and local conditions, (5) tailor data collection and reporting requirements and use existing data whenever possible, (6) promote transparency and public engagement, (7) confirm that CRA and fair lending responsibilities are mutually reinforcing and (8) promote a consistent regulatory approach that applies to banks regulated by all three agencies. This final rule becomes effective on April 1, 2024 though compliance with a majority of the rules will not be required until January 1, 2026, and the data reporting requirements of the final rule will not take effect until January 1, 2027. Because of Pinnacle Bank&#8217;s asset size it will be evaluated for compliance with the new rule under each of the rule's four tests &#8211; the retail lending test, the retail services and products tests, a community development financing test and a community development services test. Among other things, the new rule expands those assessment areas where Pinnacle Bank&#8217;s activities will be tested for compliance with the rules to include areas where Pinnacle Bank (or its subsidiaries or entities in which it has made significant investments) may not have a physical presence but nonetheless engages in activity as a result of online banking activities. Pinnacle Financial is evaluating the impact of the changes within these new rules on its (and its subsidiaries&#8217; and other entities&#8217; in which it has made significant investments) operations and the potential impact to its and these other companies&#8217; financial condition, results of operations, and/or liquidity, which cannot be predicted at this time. In January 2024, multiple trade associations and others filed a lawsuit in the Northern District of Texas seeking to vacate the new CRA rules on the grounds that the regulators exceeded their statutory authority in adopting the rules and that the rules may curtail lending. The lawsuit also seeks an injunction that would stop the rules from going into effect until the case is decided. 

Pinnacle Bank is also subject to fair lending requirements and reporting obligations involving its home mortgage lending operations. Fair lending laws prohibit discrimination in the provision of banking services, and bank regulators have increasingly focused on the enforcement of these laws. Fair lending laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974 and the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which prohibit discrimination in credit and residential real estate transactions on the basis of prohibited factors including, among others, race, color, national origin, gender and religion. Pinnacle Bank may be liable, either through administrative enforcement or private civil actions, for policies that result in a disparate treatment of or have a disparate impact on a protected class of applicants or borrowers. If a pattern or practice of lending discrimination is alleged by a regulator, then that agency may refer the matter to the U.S. Department of Justice (&#8220;DOJ&#8221;) for investigation. Pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding, the DOJ and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;) have agreed to share information, coordinate investigations and generally commit to strengthen their coordination efforts. Pinnacle Bank is required to have a fair lending program that is of sufficient scope to monitor the inherent fair lending risk of the institution and that appropriately remediates issues which are identified. 

Enhanced Prudential Standards 

The Federal Reserve is required to monitor emerging risks to financial stability and enact enhanced supervision and prudential standards applicable to large bank holding companies and certain non-bank covered companies designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates that certain regulatory requirements applicable to these systemically important financial institutions be more stringent than those applicable to other financial institutions. In 2019, the Federal Reserve adopted new rules impacting certain capital and liquidity requirements and other enhanced prudential standards. The final rules assign all domestic bank holding companies with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets to one of four categories of tailored regulatory requirements. Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank are generally not impacted by these rules, though the enhanced prudential standards rules, as amended in 2019, require publicly traded bank holding companies, like Pinnacle Financial, with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets to establish risk committees. Prior to the amendment, the requirement to establish a risk committee was applicable to publicly traded bank holding companies with $10 billion or more in consolidated assets. We have established and currently maintain a risk committee of our board of directors. 

Resolution Planning 

The FDIC has required insured depository institutions (&#8220;IDIs&#8221;) with more than $50 billion in total consolidated assets to submit to the FDIC periodic plans for resolution in the event of the institution&#8217;s failure. In 2018, the FDIC issued a moratorium on resolution plans for IDIs with more than $50 billion in assets. The moratorium is still in effect for IDIs with more than $50 billion but less than $100 billion in assets. In August 2023, the FDIC proposed amendments to the resolution planning requirements for IDIs with $50 billion or more in total assets. The amendments would require IDIs with between $50 billion and $100 billion in assets to submit informational filings on a two-year cycle, with an interim supplement updating key information submitted in the off years. 

Cybersecurity and Data Privacy 

State and federal banking regulators have issued various policy statements and, in some cases, regulations, emphasizing the 

importance of technology risk management and supervision. In July 2023, the SEC adopted rules that require disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents, as well as cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance. The final rule applicable to the cybersecurity disclosure to be included in the Company&#8217;s (i) Current Reports on Form 8-K became effective on December 18, 2023 and (ii) Annual Report on Form 10-K became effective for any fiscal year ending on or after December 15, 2023. On November 18, 2021, the federal banking agencies issued a joint final rule that requires a banking organization to notify their primary federal regulator within 36 hours of becoming aware that a significant &#8220;computer-security incident&#8221; has occurred. In general, a banking organization must notify its primarily federal regulator for incidents that have materially disrupted, degraded or impaired - or are reasonably likely to materially disrupt, degrade or impair - (i) the ability of such banking organization to carry out banking operations and activities or deliver banking products and services, (ii) such banking organization&#8217;s results of operations, or (iii) the financial stability of the financial sector. The final rule also requires a bank service provider to notify each of its affected customers as soon as possible when it determines that it has experienced a computer-security incident that has caused, or is reasonably likely to cause, a material service disruption for four or more hours. Compliance with the final rule was required by May 1, 2022. This new rule and the earlier such policy statements and regulations indicate that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. A financial institution&#8217;s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution&#8217;s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. 

Federal statutes and regulations, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978, limit Pinnacle Financial&#8217;s and Pinnacle Bank&#8217;s ability to disclose non-public information about consumers, customers and employees to nonaffiliated third parties. Specifically, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires disclosure of our privacy policies and practices relating to sharing non-public information and enables retail customers to opt out of the institution&#8217;s ability to share information with unaffiliated third parties under certain circumstances. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also requires Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information and, if applicable state law is more protective of customer privacy than the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, financial institutions, including Pinnacle Bank, will be required to comply with such state law. In addition to their obligations to safeguard customer information under GLB Act regulations, financial institutions, like Pinnacle Bank, are subject to regulations that require the institutions when they become aware of an incident of unauthorized access to sensitive customer information, to conduct a reasonable investigation to promptly determine the likelihood that the information has been or will be misused. If the institution determines that misuse of the sensitive customer information has occurred or is reasonably possible, it should notify the affected customers as soon as possible. An increasing number of state laws and regulations have been enacted in recent years to implement privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations, including data breach notification and data privacy requirements. Other nations in which our customers do business, such as the European Union, have adopted similar requirements. This trend of state-level and international activity is expected to continue to expand, requiring continual monitoring of developments in the states and nations in which our customers are located and ongoing investments in our information systems and compliance capabilities. 

Other laws and regulations impact Pinnacle Financial&#8217;s and Pinnacle Bank&#8217;s ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-marketing purposes. These regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In connection with the regulations governing the privacy of consumer financial information, the federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have adopted guidelines for establishing information security standards and programs to protect such information. In addition, Pinnacle Bank has established a privacy policy that it believes promotes compliance with the federal requirements. 

Incentive Compensation Policies and Restrictions 

The federal banking agencies have issued guidance on sound incentive compensation policies that applies to all banking organizations supervised by the agencies (thereby including both Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank). Pursuant to the guidance, to be consistent with safety and soundness principles, a banking organization&#8217;s incentive compensation arrangements should: (1) provide employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and reward; (2) be compatible with effective controls and risk management; and (3) be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the banking organization&#8217;s board of directors. Monitoring methods and processes used by a banking organization should be commensurate with the size and complexity of the organization and its use of incentive compensation. 

The Dodd-Frank Act required the federal banking agencies and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines for specified regulated entities, such as us, having at least $1 billion in total assets, to prohibit incentive-based payment arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. In addition, these regulators must establish regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure to regulators of incentive-based compensation arrangements. Pursuant to SEC regulations and Nasdaq rules enacted in 2022, we adopted a "clawback" policy in 2023 with respect to the recovery of incentive-based compensation paid to current or former executive officers in the event of material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws. A copy of our clawback policy is included as Exhibit 97.1 to this Form 10-K. 

The Federal Reserve will review, as part of its standard, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as Pinnacle Financial, that are not &#8220;large, complex banking organizations.&#8221; These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization&#8217;s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization&#8217;s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization&#8217;s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization&#8217;s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. 

The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators&#8217; policies on executive compensation may continue to evolve in the near future. It cannot be determined at this time whether compliance with such policies will adversely affect our ability to hire, retain and motivate key employees. 

Other Consumer Laws and Regulations 

Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by Pinnacle Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. For example, under the Service Members Civil Relief Act, a lender is generally prohibited from charging an annual interest rate in excess of 6% on any obligations for which the borrower is a person on active duty with the United States military. 

Pinnacle Bank's loan operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the: 

&#8226; Federal Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms and costs to consumer borrowers, giving consumers the right to cancel certain credit transactions, and defining requirements for servicing consumer loans secured by a dwelling; 

&#8226; Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves; 

&#8226; Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; 

&#8226; Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; 

&#8226; Service Members Civil Relief Act, governing the repayment terms of, and property rights underlying, secured obligations of persons in active military service; 

&#8226; Rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing the federal laws; 

&#8226; Electronic Fund Transfers Act, which regulates fees and other terms of electronic funds transactions; 

&#8226; Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, which permanently extended the national credit reporting standards of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and permits consumers, including our customers, to opt out of information sharing among affiliated companies for marketing purposes and requires financial institutions, including banks, to notify a customer if the institution provides negative information about the customer to a national credit reporting agency or if the credit that is granted to the customer is on less favorable terms than those generally available; and 

&#8226; Real Estate Settlement and Procedures Act of 1974, which affords consumers greater protection pertaining to federally related mortgage loans by requiring, among other things, improved and streamlined loan estimate forms including clear summary information and improved disclosure of yield spread premiums. 

Pinnacle Bank's deposit operations are subject to the: 

&#8226; Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; 

&#8226; Electronic Fund Transfers Act and Regulation E issued by the Federal Reserve to implement that act, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers' rights and liabilities (including with respect to the permissibility of overdraft charges) arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services; 

&#8226; Truth in Savings Act, which requires depository institutions to disclose the terms of deposit accounts to consumers; 

&#8226; Expedited Funds Availability Act, which requires financial institutions to make deposited funds available according to specified time schedules and to disclose funds availability policies to consumers; and 

&#8226; Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act ("Check 21"), which is designed to foster innovation in the payments system and to enhance its efficiency by reducing some of the legal impediments to check truncation. Check 21 created a new negotiable instrument called a substitute check and permits, but does not require banks to truncate original checks, process check information electronically, and deliver substitute checks to banks that wish to continue receiving paper checks. 

Pinnacle Bank's loan and deposit operations are both subject to the Bank Secrecy Act (&#8220;BSA&#8221;) which governs how banks and other firms report certain currency transactions and maintain appropriate safeguards against "money laundering" activities as discussed in the section captioned &#8220;Anti-Terrorism Legislation and Anti-Money Laundering&#8221; below. 

Examination and enforcement by the state and federal banking agencies, including the CFPB (as described in more detail below), and other such enforcement authorities, for non-compliance with consumer protection laws and their implementing regulations have increased and become more intense. Due to these heightened regulatory concerns, including increased enforcement of the CRA by the 

federal banking agencies, and the powers and authority of the CFPB, Pinnacle Bank and its affiliates may incur additional compliance costs or be required to expend additional funds for investments in their local communities or other assessment areas. 

Anti-Terrorism Legislation and Anti-Money Laundering 

Pursuant to the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (&#8220;USA PATRIOT&#8221;) Act of 2001, as amended, financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships as well as enhanced due diligence and "know your customer" standards in their dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers. 

A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The BSA and its implementing regulations and parallel requirements of the federal banking regulators require Pinnacle Bank to maintain a risk-based anti-money laundering (&#8220;AML&#8221;) program reasonably designed to prevent and detect money laundering and terrorist financing and to comply with the recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the BSA, including the requirement to report suspicious activity. The USA PATRIOT Act substantially broadened the scope of AML laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations on financial institutions, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Financial institutions, including banks, are required under final rules implementing Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act to establish procedures for collecting standard information from customers opening new accounts and verifying the identity of these new account holders within a reasonable period of time. Financial institutions are also prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must take certain steps to assist government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and to report certain types of suspicious transactions. In May 2016, Treasury&#8217;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (&#8220;FinCEN&#8221;) issued rules under the BSA requiring financial institutions to identify the beneficial owners who own or control certain legal entity customers at the time an account is opened and to update their AML compliance programs to include risk-based procedures for conducting ongoing customer due diligence. We have implemented procedures designed to comply with these requirements. In January 2021, the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 ("AMLA"), which amends the BSA, was enacted as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021. Among other things, the AMLA codifies a risk-based approach to anti-money laundering compliance for financial institutions; requires the development of standards for evaluating technology and internal processes for BSA compliance; and expands enforcement and investigation-related authority, including increasing available sanctions for certain BSA violations and instituting BSA whistleblower incentives and protections. 

Pinnacle Bank currently has policies and procedures in place designed to comply with the USA PATRIOT Act and the AMLA, the BSA and the other regulations targeting terrorism and money laundering. Federal banking regulators are required, when reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger applications, to consider the effectiveness of the AML activities of the applicants. Material deficiencies in AML compliance, and non-compliance with related requirements such as the U.S. economic and trade sanctions regimes, can result in public enforcement actions by the bank regulatory agencies and other government agencies, including the imposition of civil money penalties and supervisory restrictions on growth and expansion. Such enforcement actions could also have serious financial, legal and reputational consequences for Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required. 

The Office of Foreign Assets Control 

The Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#8220;OFAC&#8221;), which is an office in the U.S. Department of the Treasury, is responsible for helping to ensure that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with &#8220;enemies&#8221; of the United States, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. OFAC publishes lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts; owned or controlled by, or acting on behalf of target countries, and narcotics traffickers. If a bank finds a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, it must freeze or block the transactions on the account. Pinnacle Bank has appointed a compliance officer to oversee the inspection of its accounts and the filing of any notifications. Pinnacle Bank actively checks high&#8209;risk OFAC areas such as new accounts, wire transfers and customer files. These checks are performed using software that is updated each time a modification is made to the lists provided by OFAC and other agencies of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious financial, legal and reputational consequences, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required. Regulatory authorities have imposed cease and desist orders and civil money penalties against institutions found to be violating these obligations. 

The Dodd-Frank Act 

New regulations and statutes are regularly proposed that contain wide-ranging proposals for altering the structures, regulations and competitive relationships of the nation's financial institutions. In 2010, the U.S. Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act, which includes significant consumer protection provisions related to, among other things, residential mortgage loans that have increased, and are likely to further increase, our regulatory compliance costs. The Dodd-Frank Act also imposes other restrictions on our operations, including restrictions on the types of investments that bank holding companies and banks can make. Failure to comply with the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act would negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition and could limit our growth or expansion activities. While we cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or 

regulations or their interpretations would have on us, such changes could be materially adverse to our investors. 

Interchange Fees . The Dodd-Frank Act included provisions (known as the "Durbin Amendment") which restrict interchange fees to those which are "reasonable and proportionate" for certain debit card issuers and limits the ability of networks and issuers to restrict debit card transaction routing. The Federal Reserve issued final rules implementing the Durbin Amendment on June 29, 2011. In the final rules, interchange fees for debit card transactions were capped at $0.21 plus five basis points (plus $0.01 for fraud loss) in order to be eligible for a safe harbor such that the fee is conclusively determined to be reasonable and proportionate. The interchange fee restrictions contained in the Durbin Amendment, and the rules promulgated thereunder, only apply to debit card issuers with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets, like Pinnacle Bank. The implications of the Durbin Amendment first became applicable to us on July 1, 2017. 

The Volcker Rul e Section 13 of the Bank Holding Company Act and its implementing regulations, commonly referred to as the &#8220;Volcker Rule,&#8221; prohibit banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading, and prohibits certain interests in, or relationships with, hedge funds or private equity funds. The Volcker Rule applies to Pinnacle Financial, Pinnacle Bank and their affiliates. 

In October 2019, the federal banking agencies responsible for implementing the Volcker Rule finalized amendments to their regulations to tailor the Volcker Rule&#8217;s compliance requirements to the size and scope of a banking entity&#8217;s trading activities, clarify certain key provisions in the Volcker Rule and modify the information that companies are required to provide these agencies. In June 2020, these agencies finalized additional modifications to their regulations expanding the ability of banking entities to make investments in certain types of private equity funds. These amendments became effective on October 1, 2020. 

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau . The Dodd-Frank Act also created the CFPB, which took over responsibility for enforcing the principal federal consumer protection laws, such as the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the Truth in Saving Act, among others, on July 21, 2011. We are subject to oversight by the CFPB. 

The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks including, among other things, the authority to prohibit "unfair, deceptive, or abusive" acts and practices. Abusive acts or practices are defined as those that (1) materially interfere with a consumer's ability to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service, or (2) take unreasonable advantage of a consumer's (a) lack of financial savvy, (b) inability to protect himself in the selection or use of consumer financial products or services, or (c) reasonable reliance on a covered entity to act in the consumer's interests. The CFPB has the authority to investigate possible violations of federal consumer financial law, hold hearings and commence civil litigation. The CFPB can issue cease-and-desist orders against banks and other entities that violate consumer financial laws. The CFPB may also institute a civil action against an entity in violation of federal consumer financial law in order to impose a civil penalty or an injunction. The CFPB has been active in bringing enforcement actions related to consumer financial protection laws and obtaining the forms of relief described above, and we expect the CFPB&#8217;s oversight and enforcement to continue to increase over the next few years, as was the case in 2022 when the CFPB, among other initiatives, focused on deposit and other service charge fee practices of banks causing many banks, including Pinnacle Bank, to lower or in certain cases eliminate certain fees it charges customers who overdraw their accounts or have checks or other items presented when the customer&#8217;s account does not have sufficient funds to cover those checks or other items. 

The rules issued by the CFPB will have a long-term impact on our business, including our mortgage loan origination and servicing activities and our service charge practices. Compliance with these rules has increased, and will continue to increase, our overall regulatory compliance costs. On July 1, 2017, the CFPB took over conducting on-site consumer examinations from the FDIC for all regulations that transferred under their supervision. 

Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act . On May 24, 2018, President Trump signed into law the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Growth Act&#8221;). The Growth Act alters some of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Certain of these provisions, to which we became subject once our total assets exceeded $10 billion, are set out below, along with the changes made to such provisions under the Growth Act. 

Under the Dodd-Frank Act, publicly traded bank holding companies with $10 billion or more in total assets like Pinnacle Financial were required to establish a risk committee responsible for oversight of enterprise-wide risk management practices. Pinnacle Financial established a risk committee on February 7, 2017. The Growth Act raised the minimum asset threshold triggering the requirement to establish a risk committee from $10 billion to $50 billion. As a result, Pinnacle Financial is no longer required to maintain its standalone risk committee though it has done so and expects it will continue to do so. 

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, any banking organization, including whether a bank holding company or a depository institution, with more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets and regulated by a federal financial regulatory agency was required to conduct annual company-run stress tests to ensure it had sufficient capital during periods of economic downturn. Pinnacle Financial&#8217;s and Pinnacle Bank&#8217;s first stress tests were due in July 2018. The Growth Act raised the asset threshold at which companies are required to conduct the stress tests from $10 billion to $250 billion. While we are no longer required to annually conduct stress tests under the Dodd-Frank Act, we have continued to perform, and expect to continue to perform, stress tests from time to time in connection with 

our capital planning process and to monitor our capital consistent with the safety and soundness expectations of the federal regulators. 

While the Economic Growth Act provides some regulatory relief for mid-sized bank holding companies like us, most provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations remain in place and will continue to result in additional operating and compliance costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. 

Securities Registration and Listing 

Pinnacle Financial&#8217;s securities are registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), and listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. As such, Pinnacle Financial is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading, corporate governance, and other requirements and restrictions of the Exchange Act, as well as the Marketplace Rules and other requirements promulgated by the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC. 

As a public company, Pinnacle Financial is also subject to the accounting oversight and corporate governance requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including, among other things, required executive certification of financial presentations, increased requirements for board audit committees and their members, and enhanced requirements relating to disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. 

Insurance Agencies 

Each of Miller Loughry Beach, HPB Insurance Group and AdvoCap Insurance Agency is subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under the laws of the various states in which it conducts its insurance agency business. These laws and regulations are primarily for the protection of policyholders. In all jurisdictions, the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities. Generally, those authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations. Licenses may be denied or revoked for various reasons, including for regulatory violations or upon conviction for certain crimes. Possible sanctions that may be imposed for violation of regulations include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in a particular business for a specified period of time, revocation of licenses, censures and fines. 

Effect of Governmental Monetary Policies 

Our earnings are affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies. The Federal Reserve's monetary policies have had, and are likely to continue to have, an important impact on the operating results of commercial banks through the Federal Reserve's statutory power to implement national monetary policy in order, among other things, to curb inflation or combat a recession. The Federal Reserve, through its monetary and fiscal policies, affects the levels of bank loans, investments and deposits through its control over the issuance of United States government securities, its regulation of the discount rate applicable to member banks and its influence over reserve requirements to which member banks are subject. We cannot predict the nature or impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies. 

Proposed Legislation and Regulatory Action 

New regulations and statutes are regularly proposed that contain wide-ranging provisions for altering the structures, regulations and competitive relationships of the nation&#8217;s financial institutions. We cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed regulation or statute will be adopted or the extent to which our business may be affected by any new regulation or statute or change in applicable rules or regulations. Even if modifications are enacted to existing or proposed regulations, including raising certain assets thresholds above those currently in place, we may continue to face enhanced scrutiny from our regulators who may expect us to continue to comply with the current, more stringent requirements as part of their safety and soundness and compliance examinations and general oversight of our operations. 

Both Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank as well as many of their subsidiaries and entities in which they have made investments are subject to extensive state and federal banking and other laws and regulations that impose restrictions on and provide for general regulatory oversight of Pinnacle Financial's and Pinnacle Bank's and these subsidiaries&#8217; operations. These laws and regulations are generally intended to protect depositors and borrowers, not shareholders.
