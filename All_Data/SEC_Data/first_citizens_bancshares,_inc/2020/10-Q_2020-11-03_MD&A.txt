 Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Management&#8217;s discussion and analysis (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;) of earnings and related financial data are presented to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of First Citizens BancShares, Inc. and Subsidiaries (&#8220;BancShares&#8221;). This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes presented within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q along with our financial statements and related MD&#38;A of financial condition and results of operations included in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Although certain amounts for prior years have been reclassified to conform to statement presentations for 2020, the reclassifications had no effect on shareholders&#8217; equity or net income as previously reported. Unless otherwise noted, the terms &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;BancShares&#8221; refer to the consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations for BancShares. 

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 

BancShares conducts its banking operations through its wholly-owned subsidiary First-Citizens Bank &#38; Trust Company (&#8220;FCB&#8221;), a state-chartered bank organized under the laws of the state of North Carolina. 

BancShares&#8217; earnings and cash flows are primarily derived from our commercial and retail banking activities. We gather deposits from retail and commercial customers and also secure funding through various non-deposit sources. We invest the liquidity generated from these funding sources in interest-earning assets, including loans and leases, investment securities and overnight investments. We also invest in bank premises, hardware, software, furniture and equipment used to conduct our commercial and retail banking business. We provide treasury services products, cardholder and merchant services, wealth management services and various other products and services typically offered by commercial banks. The fees and service charges generated from these products and services are primary sources of noninterest income which is an essential component of our total revenue. 

We are focused on expanding our position in legacy and target markets through organic growth and strategic acquisitions. We believe our franchise is positioned for continued growth as a result of our client centric banking principles, disciplined lending standards, and our people. 

Refer to our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our strategy. 

RECENT ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENTS 

During the first quarter of 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;) spread throughout the world, causing significant disruptions to the domestic and global economies which continue to date. In response to the outbreak, governments have imposed restrictions resulting in business shutdowns, regional quarantines, disruptions of supply chains, changes in consumer behavior and overall economic instability. This uncertainty has led to volatility in the financial markets. This impact was coupled with spikes in unemployment as a result of business shutdowns that continue to impact financial institutions operationally and financially. For a discussion of the risks we face with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic, the associated economic uncertainty, the steps taken to mitigate the pandemic and the resulting economic contraction, see "Item 1A &#8212; Risk Factors" in Part II of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which should be read in conjunction with the risk factors disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. 

During the third quarter of 2020, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Federal Open Market Committee (&#8220;FOMC&#8221;) maintained the federal funds rate at a target range of 0.00% to 0.25%. The FOMC cited the effects of COVID-19 on economic activity and the risks posed to the economic outlook. The FOMC expects to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the FOMC&#8217;s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2% and is on track to moderately exceed 2% for some time. 

On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security Act (the &#8220;CARES Act&#8221;) was passed. The bill was designed to provide short-term economic relief to individuals and businesses most impacted by the fallout of the pandemic. Key provisions include: for individuals, economic impact payments and enhanced unemployment benefits; for small businesses, access to loans and support through the Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;SBA-PPP&#8221;), direct aid and loans to the medical industry and other affected sectors, and certain tax benefits that can be used in conjunction with the other aid mentioned. While direct aid to financial services entities is not a primary goal of the provisions, financial institutions will function to transmit funds from the Federal Reserve, SBA and United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;) Treasury to the public. This was supplemented by the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act, which was signed into law on June 5, 2020 and amended provisions of the SBA-PPP including timing of the program and changes to forgiveness criteria. In addition, there were other regulatory actions taken that may impact our business including changes in credit reporting on customer forbearance, federally backed mortgage forbearance, potential legal lending limit relaxation and other economic stabilization efforts. Further legislation is expected as the government continues to mitigate the economic impact on the crisis.

BANCSHARES&#8217; COVID-19 CONTINUED MONITORING AND RESPONSE 

BancShares remains in a very strong capital and liquidity position providing stability in navigating the COVID-19 crisis. Our leadership team continues to ensure appropriate measures are in place to protect the welfare of our employees and soundness of the organization, while continuing to support our customers. Our branches have re-opened with enhanced safety protocols, and our corporate locations remain at limited occupancy due to current virus trends. 

Through September 30, 2020, over 94% of all COVID-19 related loan extensions have begun repayment. Delinquency trends among loans entering repayment are in line with the remainder of the portfolio. We have not seen significant declines in overall credit quality, though the impact of the SBA-PPP and payment extensions could be delaying signs of credit deterioration. 

During 2020, BancShares originated over 23,000 SBA-PPP loans with an outstanding balance of $3.11 billion at September 30, 2020. We have collected all $117.2 million in SBA-PPP related loan fees per the program terms. These fees and related costs were deferred and are being recognized in interest income over the life of the loans. We have begun accepting and processing applications for forgiveness, and subsequent to the third quarter, we have begun receiving forgiveness payments. We anticipate acceleration of the fee income as the volume of approved forgiveness applications and payments received from the SBA increase.

Strong Liquidity and Capital Position 

We maintain a strong level of liquidity. As of September 30, 2020, liquid assets (available cash and unencumbered high quality liquid assets at market value) totaled approximately $8.51 billion representing 17.5% of consolidated assets as of September 30, 2020. 

In addition to liquid assets, we had contingent sources of liquidity totaling approximately $11.37 billion in the form of Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) borrowing capacity, Federal Reserve Discount Window availability, federal funds lines and a committed line of credit. 

At September 30, 2020, BancShares&#8217; regulatory capital ratios were well in excess of Basel III capital requirements with a total risk-based capital ratio of 13.7%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 11.5%, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.4%, a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 7.8% and a capital conservation buffer of 5.5%, more than twice the required level of 2.5%. 

SIGNIFICANT EVENTS IN 2020 

On January 1, 2020 BancShares adopted Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which introduced a new credit loss methodology for the estimation of credit losses.The amendments in this ASU require loss estimates be determined over an asset&#8217;s lifetime and broaden the information that an entity must consider in developing its expected credit losses. BancShares adopted this ASU using the modified retrospective approach for all loans, leases, debt securities designated as held to maturity, and unfunded loan commitments. BancShares adopted this ASU using the prospective transition approach for PCD loans previously accounted for under ASC 310-30 and debt securities available for sale. Refer to Note A - Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation for additional information. 

Upon adoption, BancShares recorded a net decrease of $37.9 million in the Allowance for Credit Losses (&#8220;ACL&#8221;) which included a decrease of $56.9 million in the ACL on non-purchased credit deteriorated (&#8220;non-PCD&#8221;) loans, offset by an increase of $19.0 million in the ACL on purchased credit deteriorated (&#8220;PCD&#8221;) loans. The $56.9 million change in the ACL on non-PCD loans, as well as an $8.9 million increase in the reserve for unfunded commitments, net of deferred taxes, resulted in a net increase in retained earnings of $36.9 million. The $19.0 million increase in the ACL on PCD loans was a reclassification of the PCD credit discount and resulted in a gross up of loan balances by this same amount and did not have any effect on retained earnings. Impact to total capital and capital ratios was not significant and we did not elect the capital phase-in option allowable for regulatory reporting purposes.

On October 15, 2020, BancShares and CIT Group Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#8220;CIT&#8221;), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;) by and among BancShares, FCB, FC Merger Subsidiary IX, Inc., a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of FCB (&#8220;Merger Sub&#8221;), and CIT, the parent company of CIT Bank, N.A., a national banking association (&#8220;CIT Bank&#8221;).

(1) We adopted ASC Topic 326 (&#8220;CECL&#8221;) utilizing the modified retrospective approach. We did not restate selected financial data for the quarters prior to 2020 presented above. 

(2) Average loan and lease balances include PCD loans, non-PCD loans and leases, loans held for sale and nonaccrual loans and leases. 

(3) Loans originated in relation to the SBA-PPP ($3.11 billion as of September 30, 2020) do not have a recorded ACL. As of September 30, 2020, the ratio of ACL to total Non-PCD loans excluding SBA-PPP loans is 0.68% while the ratio of ACL to total loans excluding SBA-PPP loans is 0.75%. 

(4) Upon adoption of ASC 326, we dissolved pooling of PCI loans allowed under ASC 310-30. This increased the amount of nonaccrual loans as those nonaccrual loans within performing PCI pools were previously excluded from reporting. As of January 1, 2020, there were $47.0 million of nonaccrual loans released from performing PCI pools. Of these nonaccrual loans, $27.5 million were outstanding as of September 30, 2020.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Net Interest Income and Margin (Taxable-Equivalent Basis) 

Third Quarter 2020 compared to Third Quarter 2019 

The taxable-equivalent net interest income for the third quarter of 2020 totaled $354.3 million, an increase of $16.9 million, or 5.0%, compared to the third quarter of 2019. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to an increase of $21.3 million in interest earned on loans due to loan growth and lower interest expense on deposits of $8.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in interest earned on overnight investments of $6.4 million. Interest and fee income related to SBA-PPP loans totaled $29.8 million in the third quarter of 2020. 

The taxable-equivalent NIM was 3.06% in the third quarter of 2020, a decrease of 71 basis points from the same quarter in the prior year. The primary drivers of the margin decline were lower yields on interest-earning assets, partially offset by a decline in the rates paid on interest-bearing deposits, largely in time deposits and money market accounts, and borrowings. 

Average interest-earning assets increased by $10.32 billion to $45.62 billion, compared to the third quarter of 2019. The primary drivers for this change were higher average loan balances, which increased $5.72 billion, due to contributions from loans originated under the SBA-PPP as well as recent acquisitions and organic loan growth, higher average investment securities of $2.97 billion and higher average overnight investments of $1.63 billion. The yield on interest-earning assets decreased by 82 basis points to 3.24% when compared to the third quarter of 2019. The yield on loans and leases decreased to 4.06%, or by 55 basis points, primarily due to lower yields on commercial and home equity loans as a result of downward rate resets on variable rate loans and lower rates on originations. The yield on overnight investments and investment securities decreased by 199 basis points and 82 basis points, respectively. The yield decrease on overnight investments was primarily due to a lower federal funds rate, while lower yields on investment securities were primarily due to yield declines in government agency and mortgage-backed securities. 

Average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $5.04 billion to $25.59 billion, compared to the third quarter of 2019. This increase was primarily due to an increase in average interest-bearing deposit balances of $4.01 billion driven by contributions from organic deposit growth including SBA-PPP deposits, and recent acquisitions, as well as an increase in average long-term borrowings of $872.3 million. 

Table of Contents 

Rates on interest-bearing liabilities decreased by 18 basis points to 0.32%, primarily due to decreased rates paid on borrowings and time deposits, checking with interest deposits, and money market accounts. 

Nine Months of 2020 compared to Nine Months of 2019 

The taxable-equivalent net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, was $1.03 billion, an increase of $44.5 million, or 4.5%, compared to the same period of 2019. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to an increase of $78.7 million in interest earned on loans primarily due to loan growth, partially offset by a decrease in interest earned on overnight investments of $15.0 million as well as an increase in total interest expense of $12.0 million. Interest and fee income related to SBA-PPP loans totaled $47.9 million in the first nine months of 2020. 

The taxable-equivalent NIM was 3.23% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, a decrease of 57 basis points from the same period of 2019. The primary drivers of the margin decline were lower yields on interest-earning assets coupled with increased borrowings, partially offset by a decline in the rates paid on interest-bearing deposits, largely in time deposits and money market accounts. 

Average year-to-date interest-earning assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, increased by $7.68 billion to $42.15 billion, compared to the same period in 2019. This increase was primarily due to a $4.78 billion increase in average outstanding loans due the impact of growth from SBA-PPP loans, as well as recent acquisitions and organic loan growth. This increase was coupled with increases in average investment securities of $1.92 billion, primarily consisting of mortgage-backed securities, and average overnight investments of $974.8 million. The yield on interest-earning assets decreased by 57 basis points to 3.48% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. The yield on loans and leases decreased by 38 basis points primarily due to decreases in yields on commercial and residential loans. The yield on overnight investments and the investment securities portfolio decreased by 187 basis points and 62 basis points, respectively. The lower federal funds rate was the primary driver for the yield decrease on overnight investments, while the accelerated prepayments on mortgage-backed securities with reinvestment at lower yields were the primary drivers of the investment securities yield decline. 

Average year-to-date interest-bearing liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 increased by $4.18 billion to $24.39 billion, compared to the same period in 2019. This increase was primarily due to a $3.27 billion increase in average interest-bearing deposit balances driven by SBA-PPP related deposits, as well as recent acquisitions and organic growth. The rate paid on interest-bearing deposits decreased by 4 basis points due primarily to decreased rates on time deposits, checking with interest deposits and money market accounts. The rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities decreased by 1 basis points to 0.42% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to same period in 2019. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

BancShares recorded net provision expense of $4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $6.8 million for the same period in 2019. This was due to stabilization in the macroeconomic forecasts, limited movement in credit quality metrics and continued low net charge-offs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, BancShares recorded a net provision expense of $52.9 million, compared to $23.7 million for same period in 2019. This increase was primarily COVID-19 related reserve build of $36.1 million as loss estimates consider the potential impact of slower economic activity and elevated unemployment, as well as potential mitigants due to government stimulus and loan accommodations.

Table of Contents 

Noninterest income is an essential component of our total revenue and is critical to our profitability level. The primary sources of noninterest income consist of fees and service charges generated from deposit accounts, cardholder and merchant services, wealth management services, and mortgage lending and servicing. 

Noninterest income for the third quarter of 2020 was $120.6 million, compared to $100.9 million for the same period of 2019, an increase of $19.6 million, or 19.5%. The most significant components of the change were as follows: 

&#8226; Gains on sales of investment securities available for sale increased by $20.3 million. 

&#8226; Mortgage income increased by $5.7 million primarily due to origination volume brought about by lower mortgage rates. 

&#8226; Cardholder services income increased by $3.8 million primarily due to a decline in credit card reward redemptions driven by COVID-19, as well as an increase in transaction volume particularly by business customers. 

&#8226; Service charges on deposit accounts declined by $6.3 million primarily due to decreased customer activity and fees waived to aid our customers during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Noninterest income was $350.0 million for the first nine months of 2020, compared to $311.5 million for the same period of 2019, an increase of $38.5 million, or 12.4%. The most significant components of the change were as follows: 

&#8226; Gains on sales of investment securities available for sale increased by $48.1 million. 

&#8226; Mortgage income increased by $12.0 million primarily due to origination volume brought about by lower mortgage rates. The production-related income was partially offset by mortgage servicing rights impairment of $4.3 million recorded due to declining mortgage rates. 

&#8226; Cardholder services income increased $4.4 million primarily due to a decline in credit card reward redemptions driven by COVID-19, as well as an increase in transaction volume particularly by business customers. 

&#8226; Service charges on deposit accounts declined by $13.2 million primarily due to decreased customer activity and fees waived to aid our customers during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

&#8226; Other noninterest income decreased $9.8 million primarily due to acquired recoveries on PCD loans, formerly reported in noninterest income, now being recorded as a component of the allowance for credit losses.

The primary components of noninterest expense are salaries and related employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expense. 

Noninterest expense was $291.7 million during the third quarter of 2020, compared to $270.4 million for the same period in 2019, an increase of $21.2 million, or 7.9%. The most significant components of the change were as follows: 

&#8226; Personnel expense increased $12.9 million primarily due to an increase in salaries and wages as a result of merit increases and additional headcount from recent acquisitions. 

&#8226; Other noninterest expense increased $4.9 million primarily due to higher write-downs on OREO properties and increased pension costs due to a lower discount rate. 

&#8226; Processing fees paid to third parties increased $4.7 million primarily due to the expansion of digital banking offerings as well as processing fees related to recent acquisitions. 

Noninterest expense was $883.3 million for the first nine months of 2020, compared to $811.5 million for the same period in 2019, an increase of $71.8 million, or 8.9%. The most significant components of the change were as follows: 

&#8226; Personnel expense increased by $42.0 million primarily due to an increase in salaries and wages as a result of merit increases and additional headcount from recent acquisitions. 

&#8226; Processing fees paid to third parties increased $11.5 million primarily due to the expansion of digital banking offerings as well as processing fees related to recent acquisitions. 

&#8226; Other noninterest expense increased $10.5 million primarily due to higher provision related to unfunded loan commitments as a result of the potential economic impact of COVID-19 and increased pension costs due to a lower discount rate. 

&#8226; Merger-related expenses increased $2.4 million primarily due to costs related to Entegra. 

&#8226; Occupancy expense increased $2.2 million primarily due to cleaning and sanitizing efforts in branches and corporate buildings to combat the spread of COVID-19. 

&#8226; Telecommunications expense increased $2.2 million primarily due to equipment upgrades to increase network capacity to facilitate remote access as corporate employees continue to work from home. 

Income Taxes 

Income tax expense was $35.8 million and $35.4 million for the third quarter of 2020 and 2019, respectively, representing effective tax rates of 20.1% and 22.1% during the periods. Income tax expense was $89.5 million and $105.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, representing effective tax rates of 20.2% and 22.8% during the periods. 

The effective tax rates for the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 were favorably impacted by $3.5 million and $10.4 million, respectively, due to BancShares&#8217; decision in the second quarter to utilize an allowable alternative for computing its 2020 federal income tax liability. Without this alternative, the effective tax rate would have been approximately 22.0% and 22.6% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively. The allowable alternative provides BancShares the ability to use the federal income tax rate for certain current year deductible amounts related to prior year FDIC-assisted acquisitions that was applicable when these amounts were originally subjected to tax. 

We monitor and evaluate the potential impact of current events on the estimates used to establish income tax expenses and income tax liabilities. On a periodic basis, we evaluate our income tax positions based on current tax law, positions taken by various tax auditors within the jurisdictions where BancShares is required to file income tax returns, as well as potential or pending audits or assessments by tax auditors. 

INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS 

Interest-earning assets include investment securities, loans and leases, and overnight investments, all of which reflect varying interest rates based on the risk level and repricing characteristics of the underlying asset. Riskier investments typically carry a higher interest rate but expose us to higher levels of market risk. We strive to maintain a high level of interest-earning assets relative to total assets, while keeping non-earning assets at a minimum. 

Interest-earning assets totaled $45.96 billion and $37.23 billion at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The $8.73 billion increase was primarily composed of a $3.96 billion increase in loans and leases, a $2.69 billion increase in investment securities and a $2.03 billion increase in overnight investments.

Investment Securities 

The primary objective of the investment portfolio is to generate incremental income by deploying excess funds into securities with minimal liquidity and credit risk, and low to moderate interest rate risk. Other objectives include acting as a stable source of liquidity, serving as a tool for asset and liability management and maintaining an interest rate risk profile compatible with BancShares&#8217; objectives. Additionally, purchases of equities and corporate bonds in other financial institutions have been made largely under a long-term earnings optimization strategy. Changes in the total balance of our investment portfolio result from trends in balance sheet funding and market performance. Generally, when inflows arising from deposit and treasury services products exceed loan and lease demand, we invest excess funds into the securities portfolio and into overnight investments. Conversely, when loan demand exceeds growth in deposits and short-term borrowings, we allow overnight investments to decline and use proceeds from maturing securities and prepayments to fund loan demand. See Note C - Investments for additional disclosures. 

The carrying value of investment securities totaled $9.86 billion at September 30, 2020, an increase of $2.69 billion compared to December 31, 2019. The increase in the portfolio was primarily attributable to deposit growth outpacing loan growth for the period, resulting in investment securities purchases of $8.80 billion, partially offset by sales of $4.22 billion and maturities and paydowns of $2.04 billion. 

As part of the adoption of ASC 326, BancShares evaluated its portfolios of held to maturity and available for sale debt securities to determine the need to record a related allowance for credit losses. See Note A - Accounting Policies and Basis for Presentation for more detail on our policies and adoption. As of January 1, 2020, no allowance for credit losses was required for available for sale and held to maturity debt securities. 

Available for sale securities are reported at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;), net of deferred taxes. As of September 30, 2020, investment securities available for sale had a net pre-tax unrealized gain of $135.2 million, compared to a net pre-tax unrealized gain of $7.5 million as of December 31, 2019. Management evaluated the available for sale securities in an unrealized loss position and concluded that the unrealized losses relate to changes in interest rates relative to when the securities were purchased, and therefore, no allowance for credit losses was needed at September 30, 2020. 

BancShares&#8217; portfolio of held to maturity debt securities consists of mortgage-backed securities issued by government agencies and government sponsored entities. Given the consistently strong credit rating of the U.S. Treasury and the long history of no credit losses on debt securities issued by government agencies and government sponsored entities, no allowance for credit losses was needed at September 30, 2020.

Loans and Leases 

Loans for held for sale were $120.3 million at September 30, 2020, a net increase of $52.4 million since December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily due to originations of $775.9 million driven by low interest rates, partially offset by sales of $743.5 million. 

Loans and leases held for investment were $32.85 billion at September 30, 2020, a net increase of $3.96 billion, representing annualized growth of 18.3% since December 31, 2019. This increase was driven by a $4.03 billion net increase in the non-PCD portfolio offset by a $62.8 million net decrease in the PCD loan portfolio. The net increase in the non-PCD portfolio was due to $3.11 billion related to SBA-PPP loans as well as organic growth primarily in our commercial segments. The net decrease in PCD loans was primarily due to pay downs and pay-offs, partially offset by a $19.0 million increase from the adoption of ASC 326. Excluding 2020 loans related to SBA-PPP loans, total loans grew by 3.9% on an annualized basis. 

BancShares reports non-PCD and PCD loan portfolios separately, and the non-PCD portfolio is further divided into commercial and consumer segments. Non-PCD loans and leases at September 30, 2020 were $32.35 billion compared to $28.32 billion at December 31, 2019, representing 98.5% and 98.1% of total loans, respectively. PCD loans at September 30, 2020 were $495.9 million, compared to $558.7 million of PCI loans at December 31, 2019, representing 1.5% and 1.9% of loans, respectively. 

The discount related to acquired non-PCD loans and leases at September 30, 2020 and non-PCI loans and leases at December 31, 2019 was $23.0 million and $30.9 million, respectively. The discount related to PCD loans at September 30, 2020 and PCI loans at December 31, 2019 was $49.2 million and $88.2 million, respectively. The primary driver of the decrease in PCD discount is the adoption of ASC 326, which resulted in a reclassification of the credit portion of the loan discount to the ACL of $19.0 million. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, accretion income on purchased non-PCD loans and leases was $2.8 million and $3.6 million, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, interest and accretion income on purchased PCD loans and leases was $15.0 million and $16.5 million, respectively. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, accretion income on purchased non-PCD loans and leases was $7.8 million and $10.3 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, interest and accretion income on purchased PCD loans and leases was $48.0 million and $46.1 million, respectively.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES (&#8220;ACL&#8221;) 

The ACL was $223.9 million at September 30, 2020, representing a decrease of $1.2 million since December 31, 2019. The ACL as a percentage of total loans and leases was 0.68% at September 30, 2020, compared to 0.78% December 31, 2019. The ACL as a percentage of loans and leases excluding SBA-PPP loans, which have no recorded ACL, was 0.75% at September 30, 2020. 

Upon adoption of ASC 326 on January 1, 2020, BancShares recorded a net decrease of $37.9 million in the ACL which included a decrease of $56.9 million in the ACL on non-PCD loans, partially offset by an increase of $19.0 million in the ACL on PCD loans. The decrease in the ACL on non-PCD loans was primarily in the commercial segments as these portfolios have exhibited strong historical credit performance and have relatively short average lives. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the consumer segments due to their longer average lives. The increase in the ACL on PCD loans was primarily the result of reallocating credit discount from loan balances into ACL. 

The ACL is calculated using a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, charge-off and recovery activity, loan growth, changes in macroeconomic factors, collateral type, estimated loan life and changes in credit quality. For the period ended September 30, 2020 the primary reason for the ACL change since the adoption of ASC 326, was a $36.1 million reserve build due to the potential economic impact of COVID-19 and its estimated impact on credit losses. Forecasted economic conditions are developed using third party macroeconomic scenarios adjusted based on management&#8217;s expectations over a forecast period of two years. Assumptions revert to long term historic averages over a one year period. Significant macroeconomic factors used in estimating the expected losses include unemployment, gross domestic product, home price index and commercial real estate index. Our model results consider baseline, adverse and upside scenarios. To calculate the ACL, we utilized the baseline scenario, which includes improvements to the most significant assumptions and impact from government stimulus. This result was calibrated using management&#8217;s expectation of borrower performance based upon COVID-19 residual risk by industry and geography. These loss estimates were also influenced by BancShares strong credit quality, low net charge-offs and recent credit trends, which remained stable through the quarter ended September 30, 2020. 

At September 30, 2020, the ACL allocated to non-PCD loans and leases was $198.8 million, or 0.61% of non-PCD loans and leases, compared to $217.6 million, or 0.77%, at December 31, 2019. The ACL as a percentage of non-PCD loans and leases excluding SBA-PPP loans was 0.68 at September 30, 2020. The decrease of 16 basis points since December 31, 2019 was primarily due to the adoption of ASC 326, partially offset by the forecasted potential economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on expected credit losses. The adoption of ASC 326 resulted in a decrease of 18 basis points, while the COVID-19 impact resulted in an increase of 11 basis points. 

At September 30, 2020, the ACL for PCD loans totaled $25.1 million compared to $7.5 million at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due the adoption of ASC 326. 

Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $2.6 million during the third quarter of 2020, compared to $6.5 million during the third quarter of 2019. On an annualized basis, total net charge-offs as a percentage of total average loans and leases was 0.03% and 0.10% for the third quarter of 2020 and 2019, respectively. The net charge-off ratio was 0.07% and 0.10% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The ACL as of September 30, 2020, excluding SBA-PPP loans, covered approximately 9.4 times annualized year to date net charge-offs compared to 6.5 times at January 1, 2020 CECL adoption.

The reserve for unfunded loan commitments was $14.0 million and $1.1 million at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The increase was primarily due to increases in the scope of off-balance sheet exposures considered due to the provisions of ASC 326.

Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and leases and other real estate owned (&#8220;OREO&#8221;). At September 30, 2020, BancShares&#8217; nonperforming assets totaled $239.2 million, an increase of $71.0 million since December 31, 2019. 

Nonaccrual loans and leases at September 30, 2020 were $186.5 million, reflecting an increase of $64.8 million since December 31, 2019. Nonaccrual loans and leases as a percentage of total loans and leases was 0.57% and 0.42% at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Contributing to this increase was the dissolution of PCI loan pools under the adoption of ASC 326 as those nonaccrual loans within performing PCI pools were previously excluded from reporting. As of September 30, 2020, there were $27.5 million of nonaccrual loans that had been released from performing PCI pools. The remaining increase in nonaccrual loans was primarily due to increases within our acquired loan portfolios. The credit quality of the portfolio remains in line with our risk tolerances and management is actively monitoring any potential increases in portfolio risk due to COVID-19. At September 30, 2020, OREO totaled $52.8 million, representing an increase of $6.2 million since December 31, 2019 due primarily to additions of OREO through acquisitions of $9.3 million. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans was 0.73% as of September 30, 2020 compared to 0.58% as of December 31, 2019. The additional PCI nonaccrual loans and acquired OREO resulted in an increase of 11 basis points to the nonperforming assets ratio at September 30, 2020.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS 

We selectively agree to modify existing loan terms to provide relief to customers who are experiencing financial difficulties or other circumstances that could affect their ability to meet debt obligations. Typical modifications include short-term deferral of interest or modification of payment terms. Troubled debt restructurings (&#8220;TDRs&#8221;) not accruing interest at the time of restructure are included as nonperforming loans. TDRs accruing at the time of restructure and continuing to perform based on the restructured terms are considered performing loans. 

The Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus was published by banking regulators in April 2020 to clarify accounting and reporting expectations for loan modifications in determining TDR designation for borrowers experiencing COVID-19-related financial difficulty. BancShares applied this regulatory guidance during its TDR identification process for short-term loan forbearance agreements as a result of COVID-19, and in most cases, is not recording these as TDRs.

INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES 

Interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, securities sold under customer repurchase agreements, FHLB borrowings, subordinated debt, and other borrowings. Interest-bearing liabilities totaled $25.96 billion at September 30, 2020, compared to $22.83 billion at December 31, 2019. The $3.13 billion increase was due to an increase in interest-bearing deposits of $2.51 billion and an increase in total borrowings of $619.0 million. 

Deposits 

Due to our focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position, core deposit retention remains a key business objective. We believe traditional bank deposit products remain an attractive option for many customers but, as economic conditions improve, we recognize that our liquidity position could be adversely affected as bank deposits are withdrawn and invested elsewhere. Our ability to fund future loan growth is significantly dependent on our success at retaining existing deposits and generating new deposits at a reasonable cost. 

At September 30, 2020, total deposits were $42.25 billion, an increase of $7.82 billion, representing annualized growth of 30.3% since December 31, 2019. Excluding SBA-PPP deposits of $1.30 billion, total deposits increased $6.52 billion, or by 25.3% annualized, over the same time period. This organic growth primarily occurred in demand and money market accounts, partially offset by a decline in time deposits.

Borrowings 

At September 30, 2020, total borrowings were $1.95 billion compared to $1.33 billion at December 31, 2019. The $619.0 million increase was primarily due to a subordinated debt issuance that resulted in $341.0 million outstanding, an increase in securities sold under customer repurchase agreements of $250.9 million, and an increase in FHLB borrowings of $83.0 million, partially offset by a decrease in other borrowings of $55.9 million.

Subordinated debt included junior subordinated debentures representing obligations to the Trusts, which may be redeemed at par in whole or in part at any time. BancShares has guaranteed all obligations of the Trusts. 

SHAREHOLDERS&#8217; EQUITY AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY 

On March 4, 2020, BancShares completed its public offering of $350 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.375% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2030. On March 12, 2020, BancShares issued and sold an aggregate of 13,800,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of 5.375% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, par value $0.01 per share, with a liquidation preference of $25 per Depositary Share (equivalent to $1,000 per share of Series A Preferred Stock) for a total of $345 million. 

The capital raise provided liquidity for general corporate purposes, which may include, but is not limited to, providing capital to support our growth organically or through strategic acquisitions, financing investments and capital expenditures, for funding investments in FCB as regulatory capital, and redeeming or repurchasing our common stock. 

The table below shows Class A common stock repurchase activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. All Class A common stock repurchases completed in 2020 and 2019 were consummated under previously approved authorizations. There were no repurchases of Class B common stock or the preferred stock during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020.

We are committed to effectively managing our capital to protect our depositors, creditors and shareholders. We continually monitor the capital levels and ratios for BancShares and FCB to ensure they exceed the minimum requirements imposed by regulatory authorities and to ensure they are appropriate given growth projections, risk profile and potential changes in the regulatory or external environment. Failure to meet certain capital requirements may result in actions by regulatory agencies that could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;), the unrealized gains and losses on certain assets and liabilities, net of deferred taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders&#8217; equity. These amounts are excluded from shareholders&#8217; equity in the calculation of our capital ratios under current regulatory guidelines.

RISK MANAGEMENT 

Risk is inherent in any business. BancShares has defined a moderate risk appetite, a conservative approach to risk taking, with a philosophy that does not preclude higher risk business activities balanced with acceptable returns while meeting regulatory objectives. Through the comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management Framework and Risk Appetite Framework, senior management has primary responsibility for day-to-day management of the risks we face with accountability of and support from all associates. Senior management applies various strategies to reduce the risks to which BancShares activities may be exposed, with effective challenge and oversight by management committees. In addition, the Board of Directors strives to ensure that the business culture is integrated with the enterprise risk management program and that policies, procedures and metrics for identifying, assessing, measuring, monitoring and managing risk are part of the decision-making process. The Board of Directors&#8217; role in risk oversight is an integral part of our overall Enterprise Risk Management Framework and Risk Appetite Framework. The Board of Directors administers its risk oversight function primarily through the Board Risk Committee. 

Table of Contents 

The Board Risk Committee structure is designed to allow for information flow, effective challenge and timely escalation of risk-related issues. The Board Risk Committee is directed to monitor and advise the Board of Directors regarding risk exposures, including credit, market, capital, liquidity, operational, compliance, strategic and reputational risks; review, approve, and monitor adherence to the risk appetite and supporting risk tolerance levels via a series of established metrics; and evaluate, monitor and oversee the adequacy and effectiveness of the Risk Management Framework and Risk Appetite Framework. The Board Risk Committee also reviews: reports of examination by and communications from regulatory agencies; the results of internal and third party testing and qualitative and quantitative assessments related to risk management; and any other matters within the scope of the Committee&#8217;s oversight responsibilities. The Board Risk Committee monitors management&#8217;s response to certain risk-related regulatory and audit issues. In addition, the Board Risk Committee may coordinate with the Audit Committee and the Compensation, Nominations and Governance Committee for the review of financial statements and related risks, information security and other areas of joint responsibility. 

In combination with other risk management and monitoring practices, enterprise-wide stress testing activities are part of the Risk Management Framework and conducted within a defined framework. Stress tests are performed for various risks to ensure the financial institution can support continued operations during stressed periods. 

In response to COVID-19, BancShares assembled a cross-functional leadership team to identify and manage newly identified risks and provide effective risk oversight through this pandemic. New or elevated risks have been identified in multiple areas, including but not limited to, operational risk, credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, capital adequacy risk, compliance risk, and financial reporting risk. As such, we have incorporated changes to Item 1A. Risk Factors within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to capture these changes. These new or increased areas of risk are being actively managed by senior leadership, and have been incorporated into reporting for key management committees and regular updates are being provided to the Board of Directors. 

Credit risk management 

Credit risk is the risk of not collecting payments pursuant to the contractual terms of loans, leases and certain investment securities. Loans and leases we originate are underwritten in accordance with our credit policies and procedures and are subject to periodic ongoing reviews. Acquired loans, regardless of whether PCD or non-PCD, are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date and are subject to periodic reviews to identify any further credit deterioration. Our independent credit review function conducts risk reviews and analyses of both originated and acquired loans to ensure compliance with credit policies and to monitor asset quality trends and borrower financial strength. These reviews include portfolio analysis by geographic location, industry, collateral type and product. We strive to identify potential problem loans as early as possible, to record charge-offs or write-downs as appropriate and to maintain an adequate ACL that accounts for losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. 

We are actively monitoring our loan portfolio for areas of increased risk as a result of COVID-19. As of September 30, 2020, COVID-19 related loan extensions decreased to approximately $466.6 million in outstanding loan balances, representing approximately $13.4 million in payment deferrals. Through September 30, 2020, over 94% of all COVID-19 related loan extensions have begun repayment. Delinquency trends among loans entering repayment are in line with the remainder of the portfolio. We have not seen significant declines in overall credit quality, though the impact of the SBA-PPP and payment extensions could be delaying signs of credit deterioration. 

Additionally, we are participating in the SBA-PPP program, which provided much needed funds to our existing small business customers, and we continue to assess both the credit and operational risks this program presents. BancShares originated approximately 23,000 SBA-PPP loans with an outstanding balance of $3.11 billion at September 30, 2020. 

Our ACL estimate for the quarter ended September 30, 2020 included extensive reviews of the changes in credit risk associated with the loan portfolio and uncertainties around economic forecasts and the overall economic impact of COVID-19. Expected loss estimates within each portfolio considered the potential impact of slower economic activity with elevated unemployment, as well as potential mitigating impact from the government stimulus and loan modification programs. These loss estimates additionally considered BancShares industry and geography risk, historically strong credit quality and actual net losses incurred during prior periods of economic stress, as well as recent credit trends, which have not seen significant deterioration from COVID-19 as of September 30, 2020. 

Interest rate risk management 

Interest rate risk (&#8220;IRR&#8221;) results principally from: assets and liabilities maturing or repricing at different points in time, assets and liabilities repricing at the same point in time but in different amounts, and short-term and long-term interest rates changing in different magnitudes. 

Table of Contents 

We assess our short-term IRR by forecasting net interest income over 24 months under various interest rate scenarios and comparing those results to forecasted net interest income, assuming stable rates. IRR scenarios modeled include, but are not limited to, immediate, parallel rate shocks, interest rate ramps, changes in the shape of the yield curve and changes in the relationships of our rates to market rates. Market interest rates declined significantly from year-end driven by economic uncertainty brought on by COVID-19. Net interest income deterioration in down rate shocks will remain muted due to the low absolute value of market interest rates. Assumptions that incorporate customer migration from low rate deposit instruments to intermediate term fixed rate instruments as rates rise have been adjusted based on actual deposit behavior over the last 3 years during a rising rate cycle. 

Table 19 provides the impact on net interest income over 24 months resulting from various instantaneous interest rate shock scenarios as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. 

Table 19 

NET INTEREST INCOME SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS 

Estimated percentage (decrease) increase in net interest income Change in interest rate (basis points) September 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 -100 (3.44) % (8.00) % +100 8.37 1.30 +200 13.19 0.01 

The increased asset sensitivity in net interest income sensitivity metrics as of September 30, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 continues to be affected by the substantial influx of non-maturity deposits that began in the second quarter of 2020 and continued through the third quarter of 2020. 

Long-term interest rate risk exposure is measured using the economic value of equity (&#8220;EVE&#8221;) sensitivity analysis to study the impact of long-term cash flows on earnings and capital. EVE represents the difference between the sum of the present value of all asset cash flows and the sum of the present value of the liability cash flows. EVE sensitivity analysis involves discounting cash flows of balance sheet items under different interest rate scenarios. Cash flows will vary by interest rate scenario, resulting in variations in EVE. The base-case measurement and its sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve allow management to measure longer-term repricing and option risk in the balance sheet. 

Table 20 table presents the EVE profile as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. 

Table 20 

ECONOMIC VALUE OF EQUITY MODELING ANALYSIS 

Estimated percentage (decrease) increase in EVE Change in interest rate (basis points) September 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 -100 (23.93) % (8.25) % +100 12.97 (0.03) +200 16.73 (4.80) 

The economic value of equity metrics at September 30, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 were primarily affected by continued growth in non-maturity deposits of nearly $1.0 billion during the third quarter of 2020 on top of the $6.5 billion increase during the second quarter of 2020. During the third quarter, we implemented assumption changes as a result of an updated core deposit study. We do not typically utilize interest rate swaps, floors, collars or other derivative financial instruments to hedge our overall balance sheet interest rate sensitivity and risk. 

Liquidity risk management 

Liquidity risk is the risk that an institution will be unable to generate or obtain sufficient cash or its equivalents on a cost-effective basis to meet commitments as they fall due. The most common sources of liquidity risk arise from mismatches in the timing and value of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet cash inflows and outflows. In general, on-balance sheet mismatches generate liquidity risk when the effective maturity of assets exceeds the effective maturity of liabilities. A commonly cited example of a balance sheet liquidity mismatch is when long-term loans (assets) are funded with short-term borrowings (liabilities). Other forms of liquidity risk include market constraints on the ability to convert assets into cash at expected levels, an inability to access funding sources at sufficient levels at a reasonable cost, and changes in economic conditions or exposure to credit, market, operational, legal and reputation risks that can affect an institution&#8217;s liquidity risk profile. 

We utilize various limit-based measures to monitor, measure and control three different categories of liquidity risk: 

&#8226; Tactical - Measures the risk of a negative cash flow position whereby cash outflows exceed cash inflows over a short-term horizon out to nine weeks; 

Table of Contents 

&#8226; Structural - Measures the amount by which illiquid assets are supported by long-term funding; and 

&#8226; Contingent - Measures the risk of having insufficient liquidity sources to support cash needs under potential future stressed market conditions or having an inability to access wholesale funding sources in a timely and cost effective manner. 

We aim to maintain a diverse mix of liquidity sources to support the liquidity management function, while aiming to avoid funding concentrations by diversifying our external funding with respect to maturities, counterparties and nature. Our primary source of liquidity is our branch-generated retail deposit portfolio due to the generally stable balances and low cost. Additional sources include cash in excess of our reserve requirement at the Federal Reserve Bank, and various other corresponding bank accounts and unencumbered securities, which totaled $8.51 billion at September 30, 2020 compared to $3.57 billion at December 31, 2019. Another source of available funds was advances from the FHLB of Atlanta and Chicago. Outstanding FHLB advances were $655.2 million as of September 30, 2020, and we had sufficient collateral pledged to secure $7.54 billion of additional borrowings from the FHLB of Atlanta. Also, at September 30, 2020, $3.97 billion in non-PCD loans with a lendable collateral value of $3.21 billion were used to create additional borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank. We also maintain Federal Funds lines and other credit lines, which had $625.0 million of available capacity at September 30, 2020. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

Except as described below, there have been no significant changes in our Critical Accounting Estimates as described in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Allowance for credit losses - The allowance for credit losses on loans and leases replaces the allowance for loan and leases losses as a critical accounting estimate, as of January 1, 2020 with the adoption of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . 

The allowance for credit losses represents management&#8217;s best estimate of current expected credit losses over the life of the portfolio of loan and leases. Estimating credit losses requires judgment in determining loan specific attributes impacting the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay contractual obligations. Other factors such as economic forecasts used to determine a reasonable and supportable forecast, prepayment assumptions, the value of underlying collateral, and changes in size composition and risks within the portfolio are also considered. 

The allowance for credit losses is assessed at each balance sheet date and adjustments are recorded in the provision for credit losses. The allowance is estimated based on loan level characteristics using historical loss rates, a reasonable and supportable economic forecast with reversion to historical assumptions. Loan losses are estimated using the fair value of collateral for collateral-dependent loans, or when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty such that repayment of the loan is expected to be made through the operation or sale of the collateral. Loan balances considered uncollectible are charged-off against the ACL. Recoveries of amounts previously charged-off are credited to the ACL. 

PCD assets represent assets that are acquired with evidence of more than insignificant credit quality deterioration since origination at the acquisition date. At acquisition, the allowance for credit losses on PCD assets is booked directly the ACL. Any subsequent changes in the ACL on PCD assets is recorded through the provision for credit losses. 

Management believes that the ACL is adequate to absorb the expected life of loan credit losses on the portfolio of loans and leases as of the balance sheet date. Actual losses incurred may differ materially from our estimates. Particularly, the impact of COVID-19 on both borrower credit and the greater macroeconomic environment is uncertain and changes in the duration, spread and severity of the virus will affect our loss experience.
