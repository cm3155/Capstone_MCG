 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk 

RISK MANAGEMENT 

Risk is inherent in any business. BancShares has defined a moderate risk appetite, a conservative approach to risk taking, with a philosophy which does not preclude higher risk business activities balanced with acceptable returns while meeting regulatory objectives. Through the comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management Framework and Risk Appetite Framework, senior management has primary responsibility for day-to-day management of the risks we face with accountability of and support from all associates. Senior management applies various strategies to reduce the risks to which BancShares may be exposed, with effective challenge and oversight by management committees. In addition, the Board strives to ensure the business culture is integrated with the Enterprise Risk Management program and policies, procedures and metrics for identifying, assessing, monitoring and managing risk are part of the decision-making process. The Board&#8217;s role in risk oversight is an integral part of our overall Enterprise Risk Management Framework and Risk Appetite Framework. The Board administers its risk oversight function primarily through the Board Risk Committee. 

The Board Risk Committee structure is designed to allow for information flow, effective challenge and timely escalation of risk-related issues. The Board Risk Committee is directed to monitor and advise the Board of Directors regarding risk exposures, including Credit, Market, Capital, Liquidity, Operational, Compliance, Strategic and Reputational risks; review, approve, and monitor adherence to the Risk Appetite Statement and supporting risk tolerance levels via a series of established metrics; and evaluate, monitor and oversee the adequacy and effectiveness of the Risk Management Framework and Risk Appetite Framework. The Board Risk Committee also reviews: reports of examination by and communications from regulatory agencies; the results of internal and third party testing and qualitative and quantitative assessments related to risk management; and any other matters within the scope of the Committee&#8217;s oversight responsibilities. The Board Risk Committee monitors management&#8217;s response to certain risk-related regulatory and audit issues. In addition, the Board Risk Committee may coordinate with the Audit Committee and the Compensation, Nominations and Governance Committee for the review of financial statements and related risks, information security and other areas of joint responsibility. 

In combination with other risk management and monitoring practices, enterprise-wide stress testing activities are part of the Risk Management Framework and conducted within a defined framework. Stress tests are performed for various risks to ensure the financial institution can support continued operations during stressed periods. 

Enactment of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act in May 2018 significantly altered several provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including how stress tests are run. Bank holding companies with assets of less than $100 billion, such as BancShares, are no longer subject to company-run stress testing requirements in section 165(i)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act, including publishing a summary of results; however, BancShares will continue to monitor and stress test its capital and liquidity consistent with the safety and soundness expectations of the federal regulators. 

Credit risk management 

Credit risk is the risk of not collecting payments pursuant to the contractual terms of loans, leases and certain investment securities. Loans and leases we originate are underwritten in accordance with our credit policies and procedures and are subject to periodic ongoing reviews. Acquired loans, regardless of whether PCI or non-PCI, are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date and are subject to periodic reviews to identify any further credit deterioration. Our independent credit review function conducts risk reviews and analyses of both originated and acquired loans to ensure compliance with credit policies and to monitor asset quality trends and borrower financial strength. These reviews include portfolio analysis by geographic location, industry, collateral type and product. We strive to identify potential problem loans as early as possible, to record charge-offs or write-downs as appropriate and to maintain an adequate ALLL which accounts for losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. 

We maintain a well-diversified loan and lease portfolio and seek to minimize the risks associated with large concentrations within specific geographic areas, collateral types or industries. Despite our focus on diversification, several characteristics of our loan portfolio subject us to significant risk, such as our concentrations of real estate secured loans, revolving mortgage loans and medical- and dental-related loans. 

We have historically carried a significant concentration of real estate secured loans but actively mitigate exposure through underwriting policies which primarily rely on borrower cash flow rather than underlying collateral values. When we do rely on underlying real property values, we favor financing secured by owner-occupied real property and, as a result, a large percentage of our real estate secured loans are owner occupied. At December 31, 2019 , loans secured by real estate were $22.38 billion , or 77.48% , of total loans and leases compared to $19.57 billion , or 76.66% at December 31, 2018 , and $18.10 billion , or 76.70% , at December 31, 2017 . 

Similar to our branch footprint, the collateral of loans secured by real estate is concentrated within North Carolina and South Carolina . At December 31, 2019 , real estate located in North Carolina and South Carolina represented 37.2% and 16.0%, respectively, of all real estate used as collateral. 

Table 20 provides the geographic distribution of real estate collateral by state.

##TABLE_END

Among real estate secured loans, our revolving mortgage loans (&#8220;Home Equity Lines of Credit&#8221; or &#8220;HELOCs&#8221;) present a heightened risk due to long commitment periods during which the financial position of individual borrowers or collateral values may deteriorate significantly. In addition, a large percentage of our HELOCs are secured by junior liens. Substantial declines in collateral values could cause junior lien positions to become effectively unsecured. HELOCs secured by real estate were $2.38 billion , or 8.2% , of total loans at December 31, 2019 , compared to $2.59 billion , or 10.2% , at December 31, 2018 , and $2.77 billion , or 11.7% , at December 31, 2017 . 

Except for loans acquired through mergers and acquisitions, we have not purchased HELOCs in the secondary market, nor have we originated these loans to customers outside of our market areas. All originated HELOCs were underwritten by us based on our standard lending criteria. The HELOC portfolio consists of variable rate lines of credit which allow customer draws during a specified period of the line of credit, with a portion switching to an amortizing term following the draw period. Approximately 80.9% of the revolving mortgage portfolio relates to properties in North Carolina and South Carolina. Approximately 35.6% of the loan balances outstanding are secured by senior collateral positions while the remaining 64.4% are secured by junior liens. 

We actively monitor the portion of our HELOCs in the interest-only period and when they will mature. Approximately 86.5% of outstanding balances at December 31, 2019 , require interest-only payments, while the remaining require monthly payments equal to the greater of 1.5% of the outstanding balance, or $100. When HELOCs switch from interest-only to fully amortizing, including principal and interest, some borrowers may not be able to afford the higher monthly payments. We have not experienced a significant increase in defaults as a result of these increased payments. In the normal course of business, the bank will work with each borrower as they approach the revolving period maturity date to discuss options for refinance or repayment. 

Loans and leases to borrowers in medical, dental or related fields were $5.16 billion as of December 31, 2019 , which represents 17.9% of total loans and leases, compared to $4.98 billion or 19.5% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2018 , and $4.86 billion or 20.6% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2017 . The credit risk of this industry concentration is mitigated through our underwriting policies which emphasize reliance on adequate borrower cash flow rather than underlying collateral value and our preference for financing secured by owner-occupied real property. Except for this single concentration, no other industry represented more than 10% of total loans and leases outstanding at December 31, 2019 . 

Interest rate risk management 

Interest rate risk (&#8220;IRR&#8221;) results principally from: assets and liabilities maturing or repricing at different points in time, assets and liabilities repricing at the same point in time but in different amounts, and short-term and long-term interest rates changing in different magnitudes. 

We assess our short-term IRR by forecasting net interest income over 24 months under various interest rate scenarios and comparing those results to forecasted net interest income, assuming stable rates. IRR scenarios modeled, include, but are not limited to, immediate, parallel rate shocks, interest rate ramps, changes in the shape of the yield curve and changes in the relationships of our rates to market rates. 

Table 21 provides the impact on net interest income over 24 months resulting from various instantaneous interest rate shock scenarios as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 .

##TABLE_END

Net interest income sensitivity metrics at December 31, 2019 , compared to December 31, 2018 , were primarily affected by a reduction in the prepayment speed forecast for the loan portfolio due to rising market interest rates during the fourth quarter of 2019. This reduced the amount of principal available for repricing during moderate rising interest rate shocks. Conversely, the same protects interest income during down rate shocks. 

Long-term interest rate risk exposure is measured using the economic value of equity (&#8220;EVE&#8221;) sensitivity analysis to study the impact of long-term cash flows on earnings and capital. EVE represents the difference between the sum of the present value of all asset cash flows and the sum of the present value of the liability cash flows. EVE sensitivity analysis involves discounting cash flows under different interest rate scenarios. The base-case measurement and its sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve allow management to measure longer-term repricing and option risk in the balance sheet. 

Table 22 presents the EVE profile as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 .

##TABLE_END

The economic value of equity metrics at December 31, 2019 , compared to December 31, 2018 , saw declines when measured against moderate rising rate shocks due to several factors. Declining market interest rates relative to levels during the fourth quarter of 2018 generally allowed for an improvement in the valuation of the loan portfolio, however, a modest increase in the exposure to fixed rate loans, both organically and through acquisition, led to a decline in EVE metrics. Additionally, a reduction in short-term U.S. Treasury holdings and a comparable increase in agency mortgage-backed securities which enhanced yield and earnings as well as increased overall portfolio duration resulting in a further decline in EVE metrics. 

We do not typically utilize interest rate swaps, floors, collars or other derivative financial instruments to attempt to hedge our overall balance sheet rate sensitivity and interest rate risk.

Liquidity risk management 

Liquidity risk is the risk an institution is unable to generate or obtain sufficient cash or its equivalents on a cost-effective basis to meet commitments as they fall due. The most common sources of liquidity risk arise from mismatches in the timing and value of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet cash inflows and outflows. In general, on-balance sheet mismatches generate liquidity risk when the effective maturity of assets exceeds the effective maturity of liabilities. A commonly cited example of a balance sheet liquidity mismatch is when long-term loans (assets) are funded with short-term borrowings (liabilities). Other forms of liquidity risk include market constraints on the ability to convert assets into cash at expected levels, an inability to access funding sources at sufficient levels at a reasonable cost and changes in economic conditions or exposure to credit, market, operational, legal and reputation risks affecting an institution&#8217;s liquidity risk profile. 

We utilize various limit-based measures to monitor, measure and control liquidity risk across three different types of liquidity: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Tactical - Measures the risk of a negative cash flow position whereby cash outflows exceed cash inflows over a short-term horizon out to nine weeks; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Structural - Measures the amount by which illiquid assets are supported by long-term funding; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Contingent - Measures the risk of having insufficient liquidity sources to support cash needs under potential future stressed market conditions or having an inability to access wholesale funding sources in a timely and cost effective manner. 

##TABLE_END 

We aim to maintain a diverse mix of liquidity sources to support the liquidity management function, while aiming to avoid funding concentrations by diversifying our external funding with respect to maturities, counterparties and nature. Our primary source of liquidity is our retail deposit book due to the generally stable balances and low cost it offers. Additional sources include cash in excess of our reserve requirement at the Federal Reserve Bank and various other correspondent bank accounts and unencumbered securities, which totaled $3.57 billion at December 31, 2019 , compared to $3.11 billion at December 31, 2018 . Another source of available funds is advances from the FHLB of Atlanta. Outstanding FHLB advances were $572.2 million as of December 31, 2019 , and we had sufficient collateral pledged to secure $6.01 billion of additional borrowings. Further, in the current year, $3.68 billion in non-PCI loans with a lendable collateral value of $2.98 billion were used to create additional borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank. We also maintain Federal Funds and other credit lines, which had $582.7 million of available capacity at December 31, 2019 . 

FOURTH QUARTER ANALYSIS 

For the quarter ended December 31, 2019 , BancShares&#8217; consolidated net income was $101.9 million compared to $89.5 million for the corresponding quarter of 2018 , an increase of $12.4 million or 13.9% . Earnings per share were $9.55 for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to $7.62 for the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily the result of higher interest income, higher noninterest income, lower provision expense, and fewer shares outstanding due to share repurchases. These net income improvements were partially offset by higher interest, noninterest and income tax expenses. 

Net interest income totaled $327.1 million , an increase of $6.2 million , or 1.9% , compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 . The increase was primarily due to higher loan interest income of $20.3 million as a result of originated and acquired loan growth. This favorable impact was partially offset by an increase in interest expense on deposits of $13.4 million as a result of higher rates paid. 

The taxable-equivalent net interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 3.62% , a decrease of 20 basis points from 3.82% in the same quarter in the prior year. The margin decline was primarily due to higher interest expense on deposits as well as lower loan yields. 

Income tax expense totaled $29.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 , up from $26.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 . The effective tax rates were 22.55% and 22.82% during each of these respective periods. The increase in income tax expense was primarily a result of higher gross earnings. 

BancShares recorded a net provision expense of $7.7 million for loan and lease losses during the fourth quarter of 2019 , compared to $11.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 . The $3.9 million decrease was primarily driven by changes in portfolio mix and continued strong credit quality. 

Noninterest income was $104.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 , an increase of $22.4 million from the same period of 2018 . The increase was primarily driven by a $24.0 million increase in marketable equity securities gains as well as a $1.6 million increase in mortgage income. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $3.1 million in cardholder and merchant services income. 

Noninterest expense was $292.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 , an increase of $16.9 million from the same quarter last year, largely due to an increase in personnel expenses, primarily related to merit increases as well as personnel additions from acquisitions, along with a $5.1 million increase in merger-related expenses. These increases were partially offset by a $1.9 million decrease in collection and foreclosure-related expenses and a $1.7 million decrease in consulting expenses. 

Table 24 provides quarterly information for each quarter in 2019 and 2018 . Table 25 provides the taxable equivalent rate/volume variance analysis between the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2018 .

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of First Citizens BancShares, Inc. 

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of First Citizens BancShares, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders&#8217; equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (&#8220;PCAOB&#8221;), the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 26, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 

Basis for Opinion 

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matter 

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (ALLL) 

Management describes their accounting policies related to the ALLL in Note A of the consolidated financial statements ( Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (ALLL) ). Management also provides additional disclosure regarding the ALLL in Note E to the consolidated financial statements. General reserves for collective impairment are based on historical loss rates for each loan class by credit quality indicator and may be adjusted through a qualitative assessment to reflect current economic conditions and portfolio trends. The models utilized by Management in determining the ALLL are highly complex with various key inputs and assumptions. Judgment is required to determine the inputs and assumptions used and these can significantly impact the provision recognized. The most significant judgments include the loss rates which comprise the length of the historical charge-off period used, estimates of the probability of default, losses incurred given default, and loss emergence period applied, as well as qualitative reserves relating to changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio. Overall, there is a significant judgment required by management in developing these models. 

The ALLL represents a significant critical accounting estimate and management&#8217;s estimation of probable credit losses within the loan and lease portfolio at the balance sheet date. The amount of the allowance is based on management&#8217;s evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio, including the nature of the loan portfolio, credit concentrations, adequacy of collateral, debt service capacity, trends in historical loss experience, economic conditions, and specific impaired loans. 

The principal considerations for our determination of the ALLL as a critical audit matter are the complexity and subjectivity of the estimates and assumptions that management utilized in determining the loss rates and qualitative factors, particularly the nature and volume of the portfolio. This required a high degree of judgment in selecting the auditor procedures to evaluate management&#8217;s estimate and assumptions as it relates to the ALLL. 

The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls relating to management&#8217;s determination of the ALLL, including controls over the allowance models and the inputs utilized to support the reserve calculations. Controls tested around the model include review of the model calculations and analysis by management, monitoring over key performance indicators and other ratios, as well as the evaluation of factors impacting the qualitative assessment, such as changes in the factor related to the nature and volume of the portfolio. Additionally, we tested controls around the appropriateness of the loan grading policy and the consistency of application, including risk grade changes, as it relates to the loss factors and calculation of the quantitative reserve. 

##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

We evaluated the reasonableness of management&#8217;s judgment in determining qualitative loss factors, which included evaluating portfolio composition changes, economic factors, and other adjustments, and analyzing whether these inputs were appropriately applied based on available data. 

##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

We tested management&#8217;s assumptions in setting the qualitative factors, including the changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, comparing trends in key performance indicators to changes in the components of the ALLL reserve for reasonableness. 

##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

We evaluated the appropriateness of inputs and assumptions used by management in determining the loss rates, such as historical charge-offs, loss frequencies used in calculating the probability of default, historical loan migration to charge-off experience, and delinquencies rates, assessing whether such factors were reasonable for the purpose used.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of First Citizens BancShares, Inc. 

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

We have audited First Citizens BancShares, Inc. and Subsidiaries&#8217; (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, First Citizens BancShares, Inc. and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (&#8220;PCAOB&#8221;), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and our report dated February 26, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. 

Basis for Opinion 

The Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

As described in Management&#8217;s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, the scope of management&#8217;s assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 has excluded Biscayne Bancshares, Inc. (Biscayne Bancshares) acquired on April 2, 2019, First South Bancorp, Inc. (First South Bancorp) acquired on May 1, 2019 and Entegra Financial Corp. (Entegra) acquired on December 31, 2019. We have also excluded Biscayne Bancshares, First South Bancorp, and Entegra from the scope of our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Biscayne Bancshares, First South Bancorp, and Entegra represented 2.10 percent, 0.43 percent and 0.00 percent of consolidated revenue (total interest income and total noninterest income) for the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively, and 2.36 percent, 0.42 percent and 4.22 percent of consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2019, respectively. 

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

NOTE A 

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

Nature of Operations 

First Citizens BancShares, Inc. (&#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;BancShares,&#8221;) is a financial holding company organized under the laws of Delaware and conducts operations through its banking subsidiary, First-Citizens Bank &#38; Trust Company (&#8220;FCB,&#8221; or &#8220;the Bank&#8221;), which is headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina. BancShares and its subsidiaries operate 574 branches in 19 states predominantly located in the Southeast, Midwest and Southwest regions of the United States. BancShares seeks to meet the financial needs of individuals and commercial entities in its market areas through a wide range of retail and commercial banking services. Loan services include various types of commercial, business and consumer lending. Deposit services include checking, savings, money market and time deposit accounts. First Citizens Wealth Management provides holistic, goals-based advisory services encompassing a broad range of client deliverables. These deliverables include wealth planning, discretionary investment advisory services, insurance, brokerage, defined benefit and defined contribution services, private banking, trust, fiduciary, philanthropy and special asset services. 

Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation 

The accounting and reporting policies of BancShares and its subsidiaries are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and general practices within the banking industry. 

The consolidated financial statements of BancShares include the accounts of BancShares and its subsidiaries, certain partnership interests and variable interest entities. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated upon consolidation. BancShares operates with centralized management and combined reporting; thus, BancShares operates as one consolidated reportable segment. 

Variable interest entities (&#8220;VIE&#8221;) are legal entities that either do not have sufficient equity to finance their activities without the support from other parties or whose equity investors lack a controlling financial interest. FCB has investments in certain partnerships and limited liability entities that have been evaluated and determined to be VIEs. Consolidation of a VIE is appropriate if a reporting entity holds a controlling financial interest in the VIE and is the primary beneficiary. FCB is not the primary beneficiary and does not hold a controlling interest in the VIEs as it does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance. As such, assets and liabilities of these entities are not consolidated into the financial statements of BancShares. The recorded investment in these entities is reported within other assets. 

Reclassifications 

In certain instances, amounts reported in prior years&#8217; consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current financial statement presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on previously reported shareholders&#8217; equity or net income. 

During 2019, BancShares identified items in the prior period related to unsettled investment activity that had been reported as cash flows from operating activities and should have been presented as investing activities during 2018. BancShares corrected the previously presented cash flows for this activity and in doing so, decreased net cash flows from operating activities with an offsetting increase in net cash flows from investing activities. BancShares has evaluated the effect of the incorrect presentation, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and concluded that it was immaterial. 

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions impacting the amounts reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The estimates BancShares considers significant are the allowance for loan and lease losses, fair value measurements, and income taxes. 

FIRST CITIZENS BANCSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Business Combinations 

BancShares accounts for all business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Under this method of accounting, acquired assets and assumed liabilities are included with the acquirer&#8217;s accounts as of the date of acquisition, with any excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired recognized as either finite lived intangibles or capitalized as goodwill. In addition, acquisition related costs and restructuring costs are recognized as period expenses as incurred. See Note B , Business Combinations, for additional information. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits with banks and federal funds sold. Cash and cash equivalents have initial maturities of three months or less. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates its fair value due to its short-term nature. 

Debt Securities 

BancShares classifies debt securities as held to maturity or available for sale. Debt securities are classified as held to maturity when BancShares has the intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity and are reported at amortized cost. Other debt securities are classified as available for sale and reported at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of income taxes, reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;). Amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts for debt securities are included in interest income. Realized gains and losses from the sale of debt securities are determined by specific identification on a trade date basis and are included in noninterest income. 

BancShares evaluates each held to maturity and available for sale security in a loss position for other-than-temporary impairment (&#8220;OTTI&#8221;) at least quarterly. BancShares considers such factors as the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below amortized cost, long-term expectations and recent experience regarding principal and interest payments, BancShares &#8217; intent to sell, and whether it is more likely than not that it would be required to sell those securities before the anticipated recovery of the amortized cost. In situations where BancShares does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not BancShares will not be required to sell the security prior to recovery the credit component of an OTTI loss is recognized in earnings and the non-credit component is recognized in AOCI. 

Equity Securities 

Equity securities are recorded on a trade date basis and measured at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are determined by specific identification and are included in noninterest income. Non-marketable equity securities are securities with no readily determinable fair values and are measured at cost. BancShares evaluates its non-marketable equity securities for impairment and recoverability of the recorded investment by considering positive and negative evidence, including the profitability and asset quality of the issuer, dividend payment history and recent redemption experience. Impairment is assessed at each reporting period and if identified, is recognized in noninterest expense. Non-marketable equity securities were $ 12.5 million and $ 2.5 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, and are included in other assets. 

Other Securities 

Membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) network requires ownership of FHLB restricted stock. This stock is restricted as it may only be sold to the FHLB and all sales must be at par. Accordingly, the FHLB restricted stock is carried at cost, less any applicable impairment charges and is recorded within other assets. FHLB restricted stock was $ 43.0 million and $ 25.3 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 

Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Projects 

BancShares and FCB have investments in qualified affordable housing projects primarily for the purposes of fulfilling Community Reinvestment Act requirements and obtaining tax credits. These investments are accounted for using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met. Under the proportional amortization method, the initial cost of the investment is amortized in proportion to the tax credits and other tax benefits received, and the net investment performance is recognized in the income statement as a component of income tax expense. All of the investments held in qualified affordable housing projects qualify for the proportional amortization method and totaled $ 167.8 million and $ 147.3 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, and are included in other assets. 

FIRST CITIZENS BANCSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Loans Held For Sale 

BancShares elected to apply the fair value option for new originations of prime residential mortgage loans to be sold. Gains and losses on sales of mortgage loans are recognized within mortgage income. 

Loans and Leases 

BancShares&#8217; accounting methods for loans and leases depends on whether they are originated or purchased, and if purchased, whether or not the loans reflect credit deterioration at the date of acquisition. 

Non-Purchased Credit Impaired (&#8220;Non-PCI&#8221;) Loans 

Non-PCI loans consist of loans originated by BancShares or loans purchased from other institutions that do not reflect credit deterioration at acquisition. 

Originated loans for which management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future are classified as held for investment and carried at the principal amount outstanding net of any unearned income, charge-offs and unamortized fees and costs. Nonrefundable fees collected and certain direct costs incurred related to loan originations are deferred and recorded as an adjustment to loans outstanding. The net amount of the nonrefundable fees and costs is amortized to interest income over the contractual lives using methods that approximate a constant yield. 

Purchased loans which do not reflect credit deterioration at acquisition are classified as non-PCI loans. These loans are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. The difference between the fair value and the unpaid principal balance at the acquisition date is amortized or accreted to interest income over the contractual life of the loan using the effective interest method. 

Purchased Credit Impaired (&#8220;PCI&#8221;) Loans 

Purchased loans which reflect credit deterioration since origination, such that it is probable at acquisition that BancShares will be unable to collect all contractually required payments, are classified as PCI loans. PCI loans are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. If the timing and amount of the future cash flows can be reasonably estimated, any excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value are recognized as interest income over the life of the loans using the effective yield method. Subsequent to the acquisition date, increases in cash flows over those expected at the acquisition date are recognized prospectively as interest income. Decreases in expected cash flows due to credit deterioration are recognized by recording an allowance for loan losses. In the event of prepayment, the remaining unamortized amount is recognized in interest income. To the extent possible, PCI loans are aggregated into pools based upon common risk characteristics and each pool is accounted for as a single unit. 

The performance of all loans within the BancShares portfolio is subject to a number of external risks, including changes in the overall health of the economy, declines in real estate values, changes in the demand for products and services and personal events, such as death, disability or change in marital status. BancShares evaluates and reports its non-PCI and PCI loan portfolios separately, and each portfolio is further divided into commercial and non-commercial segments based on the type of borrower, purpose, collateral and/or our underlying credit management processes. Additionally, commercial and noncommercial loans are assigned to loan classes, which further disaggregate the loan portfolio. 

Non-PCI Commercial Loans &#38; Leases 

Non-PCI commercial loans, excluding purchased non-impaired loans, are underwritten based primarily upon the customer&#8217;s ability to generate the required cash flow to service the debt in accordance with the contractual terms and conditions of the loan agreement. Additionally, an understanding of the borrower&#8217;s business, including the experience and background of the principals is obtained prior to approval. To the extent the loan is secured by collateral, the likely value of the collateral and what level of strength the collateral brings to the transaction is also evaluated. If the principals or other parties provide personal guarantees, the relative financial strength and liquidity of each guarantor is also assessed. Acquired non-PCI commercial loans are evaluated using comparable methods and procedures as those originated by BancShares. 

Construction and land development - Construction and land development consists of loans to finance land for development of commercial or residential real property and construction of multifamily apartments or other commercial properties. These loans are highly dependent on the supply and demand for commercial real estate as well as the demand for newly constructed residential homes and lots acquired for development. Deterioration in demand could result in decreased collateral values, which could make repayments of outstanding loans difficult for customers. 

FIRST CITIZENS BANCSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Commercial mortgage - Commercial mortgage consists of loans to purchase or refinance owner-occupied or investment nonresidential properties. Commercial mortgages secured by owner-occupied properties are primarily dependent on the ability of borrowers to achieve business results consistent with those projected at loan origination. Commercial mortgages secured by investment properties include office buildings and other facilities rented or leased to unrelated parties. The primary risk associated with income producing commercial mortgage loans is the ability of the income-producing property that collateralizes the loan to produce adequate cash flow to service the debt. While these loans and leases are collateralized by real property in an effort to mitigate risk, it is possible the liquidation of collateral will not fully satisfy the obligation. 

Other commercial real estate - Other commercial real estate consists of loans secured by farmland (including residential farms and other improvements) and multifamily (five or more) residential properties. The performance of agricultural loans is highly dependent on favorable weather, reasonable costs for seed and fertilizer and the ability to successfully market the product at a profitable margin. The demand for these products is also dependent on macroeconomic conditions beyond the control of the borrower. The primary risk associated with multifamily loans is the ability of the income-producing property that collateralizes the loan to produce adequate cash flow to service the debt. High unemployment or generally weak economic conditions may result in borrowers having to provide rental rate concessions to achieve adequate occupancy rates. 

Commercial and industrial and lease financing - Commercial and industrial and lease financing consists of loans or lines of credit to finance accounts receivable, inventory or other general business needs, business credit cards, and lease financing agreements for equipment, vehicles, or other assets. The primary risk associated with commercial and industrial and lease financing loans is the ability of borrowers to achieve business results consistent with those projected at origination. Failure to achieve these projections presents risk the borrower will be unable to service the debt consistent with the contractual terms of the loan or lease. 

Other - Other consists of all other commercial loans not classified in one of the preceding classes. These typically include loans to nonprofit organizations such as churches, hospitals, educational and charitable organizations, and certain loans repurchased with government guarantees. 

Non-PCI Noncommercial Loans &#38; Leases 

Non-PCI noncommercial loans, excluding purchased non-impaired loans, are centrally underwritten using automated credit scoring and analysis tools. These credit scoring tools take into account factors such as payment history, credit utilization, length of credit history, types of credit currently in use and recent credit inquiries. To the extent the loan is secured by collateral, the likely value of such collateral is evaluated. Acquired non-PCI noncommercial loans are evaluated using comparable methods and procedures as those originated by BancShares. 

Residential mortgage - Residential mortgage consists of loans to purchase or refinance the borrower&#8217;s primary dwelling, second residence or vacation home and are often secured by 1-4 family residential property. Significant and rapid declines in real estate values can result in borrowers having debt levels in excess of the current market value of the collateral. 

Revolving mortgage - Revolving mortgage consists of home equity lines of credit secured by first or second liens on the borrower&#8217;s primary residence. These loans are often secured by second liens on the residential real estate and are particularly susceptible to declining collateral values as a substantial decline in value could render a second lien position effectively unsecured. 

Construction and land development - Construction and land development consists of loans to construct a borrower&#8217;s primary or secondary residence or vacant land upon which the owner intends to construct a dwelling at a future date. These loans are typically secured by undeveloped or partially developed land in anticipation of completing construction of a 1-4 family residential property. There is risk these construction and development projects can experience delays and cost overruns exceeding the borrower&#8217;s financial ability to complete the project. Such cost overruns can result in foreclosure of partially completed and unmarketable collateral. 

Consumer - Consumer loans consist of installment loans to finance purchases of vehicles, unsecured home improvements, student loans and revolving lines of credit that can be secured or unsecured, including personal credit cards. The value of the underlying collateral within this class is at risk of potential rapid depreciation which could result in unpaid balances in excess of the collateral.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

PCI Loans 

The segments and classes utilized to evaluate and report PCI loans is consistent with that of non-PCI loans. PCI loans were underwritten by other institutions, often with different lending standards and methods; however, the underwriting risks are generally consistent with the risks identified for non-PCI loans. Additionally, in some cases, collateral for PCI loans may be located in regions that previously experienced deterioration in real estate values and the underlying collateral may therefore not support full repayment of these loans. 

Nonperforming Assets and Troubled Debt Restructurings 

Nonperforming Assets (&#8220;NPA&#8221;) 

NPAs include nonaccrual loans and foreclosed property. Foreclosed property consists of real estate and other assets acquired as a result of loan defaults and is discussed below. 

All loans are classified as past due when the payment of principal and interest based upon contractual terms is greater than 30 days delinquent. Non-PCI loans are generally placed on nonaccrual when principal or interest becomes 90 days past due or when it is probable the principal or interest is not fully collectible. When non-PCI loans are placed on nonaccrual, all previously uncollected accrued interest is reversed from interest income and the ongoing accrual of interest is discontinued. All payments received thereafter are applied as a reduction of the remaining principal balance as long as doubt exists as to the ultimate collection of the principal. Non-PCI loans and leases are generally removed from nonaccrual status when they become current for a sustained period of time and there is no longer concern as to the collectability of principal and interest. Accretion of income for PCI loans is discontinued when we are unable to estimate the amount or timing of cash flows. PCI loans may begin or resume accretion of income when information becomes available allowing us to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows. The majority of PCI loans are pooled for accounting purposes and therefore, the NPA status is determined based upon the aggregate performance of the pool. 

Troubled Debt Restructurings (&#8220;TDR&#8221;) 

A loan is considered a TDR when both of the following occur: (1) a modification to a borrower&#8217;s debt agreement is made and (2) a concession is granted for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties that otherwise would not be granted. TDR concessions could include short-term deferrals of interest, modifications of payment terms, or (in certain limited instances) forgiveness of principal or interest. Loans restructured as a TDR are treated and reported as such for the remaining life of the loan. Modifications of pooled PCI loans are not designated as TDRs, whereas modifications of non-pooled PCI loans are designated as TDRs in the same manner as non-PCI loans. TDR loans can be nonaccrual or accrual, depending on the individual facts and circumstances of the borrower. In circumstances where a portion of the loan balance is charged-off, the remaining balance is typically classified as nonaccrual. 

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (&#8220;ALLL&#8221;) 

The ALLL represents management&#8217;s best estimate of inherent credit losses within the loan and lease portfolio at the balance sheet date. Management determines the ALLL based on an ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio. Estimates for loan losses are determined by analyzing quantitative and qualitative components, such as: economic conditions, historical loan losses, historical loan migration to charge-off experience, current trends in delinquencies and charge-offs, expected cash flows on PCI loans, current assessment of impaired loans, and changes in the size, composition and/or risk within the loan portfolio. Adjustments to the ALLL are recorded with a corresponding entry to provision for loan and lease losses. Loan balances considered uncollectible are charged-off against the ALLL. Recoveries of amounts previously charged-off are generally credited to the ALLL. 

A primary component of determining the allowance on non-PCI loans collectively evaluated is the actual loss history of the various loan classes. Loan loss factors are based on historical experience and may be adjusted for significant factors, that in management&#8217;s judgment, affect the collectability of principal and interest at the balance sheet date. In accordance with our allowance methodology, loan loss factors are monitored quarterly and may be adjusted based on changes in the level of historical net charge-offs and updates by management, such as the number of periods included in the calculation of loss factors, loss severity, loss emergence period and portfolio attrition. 

For the non-PCI commercial segment, management incorporates historical net loss data to develop the applicable loan loss factors. General reserves for collective impairment are based on incurred loss estimates for the loan class based on average loss rates by credit quality indicators, which are estimated using historical loss experience and credit risk rating migrations. Credit quality indicators include borrower classification codes and facility risk ratings. Incurred loss estimates may be adjusted through a qualitative assessment to reflect current economic conditions and portfolio trends including credit quality, concentrations, aging of the portfolio and significant policy and underwriting changes.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

For the non-PCI noncommercial segment, management incorporates specific loan class and delinquency status trends into the loan loss factors. General reserve estimates of incurred losses are based on historical loss experience and the migration of loans through the various delinquency pools applied to the current risk mix. 

Non-PCI loans are considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that a borrower will be unable to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Generally, management considers the following loans to be impaired: all TDR loans and all loan relationships which are on nonaccrual or 90+ days past due and greater than $500,000. Non-PCI impaired loans greater than $500,000 are evaluated individually for impairment while others are evaluated collectively. 

The impairment assessment and determination of the related specific reserve for each impaired loan is based on the loan&#8217;s characteristics. Impairment measurement for loans dependent on borrower cash flow for repayment is based on the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the interest rate implicit in the original loan agreement. Impairment measurement for most real estate loans, particularly when a loan is considered to be a probable foreclosure, is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. Collateral is appraised and market value (appropriately adjusted for an assessment of the sales and marketing costs) is used to calculate a fair value estimate. A specific valuation allowance is established or partial charge-off is recorded for the difference between the excess recorded investment in the loan and the loan&#8217;s estimated fair value less costs to sell. 

The ALLL for PCI loans is estimated based on the expected cash flows over the life of the loan. BancShares continues to estimate and update cash flows expected to be collected on individual loans or pools of loans sharing common risk characteristics. BancShares compares the carrying value of all PCI loans to the present value at each balance sheet date. If the present value is less than the carrying value, the shortfall reduces the remaining credit discount and if it is in excess of the remaining credit discount, an ALLL is recorded through the recognition of provision expense. The ALLL for PCI loans with subsequent increases in expected cash flows to be collected is reduced and any remaining excess is recorded as an adjustment to the accretable yield over the loan&#8217;s or pool&#8217;s remaining life. 

Reserve for Unfunded Commitments 

The reserve for unfunded commitments represents the estimated probable losses related to standby letters of credit and other commitments to extend credit. The reserve is calculated in a manner similar to the loans evaluated collectively for impairment, while also considering the applicable regulatory capital credit conversion factors for these off-balance sheet instruments as well as the estimated exposure upon default. The reserve for unfunded commitments is presented within other liabilities, distinct from the ALLL, and adjustments to the reserve for unfunded commitments are included in other noninterest expense and represent an immaterial balance. 

Other Real Estate Owned (&#8220;OREO&#8221;) 

OREO includes foreclosed real estate property and closed branch properties and is initially recorded at the asset&#8217;s estimated fair value less cost to sell. Any excess in the recorded investment in the loan over the estimated fair value less costs to sell is charged-off against the ALLL at the time of foreclosure. If the estimated value of the OREO exceeds the recorded investment of the loan, the difference is recorded as a gain within other income. 

OREO is subsequently carried at the lower of cost or market value less estimated selling costs and is evaluated at least annually. The periodic evaluations are generally based on the appraised value of the property and may include additional adjustments based upon management&#8217;s review of the valuation estimate and specific knowledge of the property. Routine maintenance costs, income and expenses related to the operation of the foreclosed asset, subsequent declines in market value and net gains or losses on disposal are included in collection and foreclosure-related expense. 

Payable to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) for Shared-Loss Agreements 

The purchase and assumption agreements for certain FDIC-assisted transactions include payments that may be owed to the FDIC at the termination of the shared-loss agreements . The payment is due to the FDIC if actual cumulative losses on acquired covered assets are lower than the cumulative losses originally estimated by the FDIC at the time of acquisition. The liability is calculated by discounting estimated future payments and is reported as FDIC shared-loss payable. The ultimate settlement amount of the payment is dependent upon the performance of the underlying covered loans, recoveries, the passage of time and actual claims submitted to the FDIC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Premises and Equipment 

Premises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Land is carried at cost. Depreciation expense is generally computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements and capitalized leases are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the lease terms or the estimated useful lives of the assets. 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired entity over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated at least annually for impairment during the third quarter, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment exists. 

Other acquired intangible assets with finite lives, such as core deposit intangibles, are initially recorded at fair value and are amortized on an accelerated basis typically between five to twelve years over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment exists. 

Mortgage Servicing Rights (&#8220;MSR&#8221;) 

The right to provide servicing under various loan servicing contracts is either retained in connection with a loan sale or acquired in a business combination. MSRs are initially recorded at fair value and amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, the future net servicing income of the underlying loan. At each reporting period, MSRs are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to the carrying value. 

Fair Values 

The fair value of financial instruments and the methods and assumptions used in estimating fair value amounts and financial assets and liabilities for which fair value was elected are detailed in Note P , Estimated Fair Values. 

Income Taxes 

Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach as prescribed in ASC 740, Income Taxes . Under this method, a deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the currently enacted tax rates applicable to the period in which the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of existing assets and liabilities are expected to be reported in BancShares&#8217; income tax returns. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period which includes the enactment date. 

The potential impact of current events on the estimates used to establish income tax expenses and income tax liabilities is continually monitored and evaluated. Income tax positions based on current tax law, positions taken by various tax auditors within the jurisdictions where income tax returns are filed, as well as potential or pending audits or assessments by such tax auditors are evaluated on a periodic basis. 

BancShares has unrecognized tax benefits related to the uncertain portion of tax positions BancShares has taken or expects to take. A liability may be created or an amount refundable may be reduced for the amount of unrecognized tax benefits. These uncertainties result from the application of complex tax laws, rules, regulations and interpretations, primarily in state taxing jurisdictions. Unrecognized tax benefits are assessed quarterly and may be adjusted through current income tax expense in future periods based on changing facts and circumstances, completion of examinations by taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations. Estimated penalties and interest on uncertain tax positions are recognized in income tax expense. 

BancShares files a consolidated federal income tax return and various combined and separate company state tax returns. See Note O , Income Taxes, for additional disclosures. 

Per Share Data 

Net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of both classes of common shares outstanding during each period. BancShares had no potential dilutive common shares outstanding in any period and did not report diluted net income per share. 

Cash dividends per share apply to both Class A and Class B common stock. Shares of Class A common stock carry one vote per share, while shares of Class B common stock carry 16 votes per share.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Defined Benefit Pension Plans 

BancShares maintains noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain qualifying employees. The calculation of the obligations and related expenses under the plans require the use of actuarial valuation methods and assumptions. Actuarial assumptions used in the determination of future values of plan assets and liabilities are subject to management judgment and may differ significantly if different assumptions are used. All assumptions are reviewed annually for appropriateness. The discount rate assumption used to measure the plan obligations is based on a yield curve developed from high-quality corporate bonds across a full maturity spectrum. The projected cash flows of the pension plans are discounted based on this yield curve, and a single discount rate is calculated to achieve the same present value. The assumed rate of future compensation increases is based on actual experience and future salary expectations. We also estimate a long-term rate of return on pension plan assets used to estimate the future value of plan assets. In developing the long-term rate of return, we consider such factors as the actual return earned on plan assets, historical returns on the various asset classes in the plans and projections of future returns on various asset classes. Refer to Note Q , Employee Benefit Plans, for disclosures related to BancShares&#8217; defined benefit pension plans. 

Leases 

BancShares leases certain branch locations, administrative offices and equipment. Operating lease ROU assets are included in other assets and the associated lease obligations are included in other liabilities. Finance leases are included in premises and equipment and other borrowings. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets; we instead recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 

ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our corresponding obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating and finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The operating and finance lease ROU asset also includes initial direct costs and pre-paid lease payments made, excluding lease incentives. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, BancShares uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is determined using secured rates for new FHLB advances under similar terms as the lease at inception. We utilize the implicit or incremental borrowing rate at the effective date of a modification not accounted for as a separate contract or a change in the lease terms to determine the present value of lease payments. For operating leases commencing prior to January 1, 2019, BancShares used the incremental borrowing rate as of that date. 

Most leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from 1 to 25 years . The exercise of lease renewal options is at our sole discretion. When it is reasonably certain we will exercise our option to renew or extend the lease term, the option is included in calculating the value of the ROU asset and lease liability. The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term, unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option reasonably certain of exercise. 

We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. We do not lease any properties or facilities from any related party. As of December 31, 2019 , there were no leases that have not yet commenced that would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Note R, Leases, for additional disclosures. 

Revenue Recognition 

BancShares generally acts in a principal capacity, on its own behalf, in its contracts with customers. In these transactions, we recognize revenues and the related costs to generate those revenues on a gross basis. In certain, circumstances, we act in an agent capacity, on behalf of the customers with other entities, and recognize revenues and the related costs to provide our services on a net basis. Business lines where BancShares acts as an agent include cardholder and merchant services, insurance, and brokerage. Descriptions of our noninterest revenue-generating activities are broadly segregated as follows: 

Cardholder and Merchant Services - These represent interchange fees from customer debit and credit card transactions earned when a cardholder engages in a transaction with a merchant as well as fees charged to merchants for providing them the ability to accept and process the debit and credit card transaction. Revenue is recognized when the performance obligation has been satisfied, which is upon completion of the card transaction. Additionally, as FCB is acting as an agent for the customer and transaction processor, costs associated with cardholder and merchant services transactions are netted against the fee income. 

FIRST CITIZENS BANCSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Service charges on deposit accounts - These deposit account-related fees represent monthly account maintenance and transaction-based service fees such as overdraft fees, stop payment fees and charges for issuing cashier&#8217;s checks and money orders. For account maintenance services, revenue is recognized at the end of the statement period when our performance obligation has been satisfied. All other revenues from transaction-based services are recognized at a point in time when the performance obligation has been completed. 

Wealth management services - These primarily represent sales commissions on various product offerings, transaction fees and trust and asset management fees. The performance obligation for wealth management services is the provision of services to place annuity products issued by the counterparty to investors and the provision of services to manage the client&#8217;s assets, including brokerage custodial and other management services. Revenue from wealth management services is recognized over the period in which services are performed, and is based on a percentage of the value of the assets under management/administration. 

Other service charges and fees - These include, but are not limited to, check cashing fees, international banking fees, internet banking fees, wire transfer fees and safe deposit fees. The performance obligation is fulfilled and revenue is recognized, at the point in time the requested service is provided to the customer. 

Insurance commissions - These represent commissions earned on the issuance of insurance products and services. The performance obligation is generally satisfied upon the issuance of the insurance policy and revenue is recognized when the commission payment is remitted by the insurance carrier or policy holder depending on whether the billing is performed by BancShares or the carrier. 

ATM income - These represent fees imposed on customers and non-customers for engaging in an ATM transaction. Revenue is recognized at the time of the transaction as the performance obligation of rendering the ATM service has been met. 

Other - This consists of several forms of recurring revenue such as FHLB dividends and income earned on changes in the cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance. The remaining miscellaneous income includes recoveries on PCI loans previously charged-off and other immaterial transactions where revenue is recognized when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. Refer to Note N, Other Noninterest Income and Other Noninterest Expense, for additional disclosures on other noninterest income. 

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 

Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) 

This ASU increases transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The key difference between prior standards and this ASU is the requirement for lessees to recognize all lease contracts on their balance sheet. This ASU requires lessees to classify leases as either operating or finance leases, which are substantially similar to the previous operating and capital leases classifications. The distinction between these two classifications under the new standard does not relate to balance sheet treatment, but relates to treatment in the statements of income and cash flows. Lessor guidance remains largely unchanged with the exception of how a lessor determines the appropriate lease classification for each lease to better align the lessor guidance with revised lessee classification guidance. 

We adopted this standard, as of January 1, 2019, using the effective date method that allows for entities to initially apply the new leases standard at the adoption date. In addition, we made several policy elections permitted under the transition guidance, which among other things, allowed us to carry forward the historical lease classification. We determined that most renewal options would not be reasonably determinable in estimating the expected lease term. 

We made the policy election available under Topic 842 to combine lease and non-lease components and applied this practical expedient to leases in effect prior to the date of adoption. We will continue to apply the practical expedient to all leases entered into going forward. 

The adoption of the new standard had an impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 1, 2019, with the recording of operating Right-of-Use (&#8220;ROU&#8221;) assets and operating lease liabilities of $ 70.7 million and $ 71.8 million , respectively. The operating lease liability included a $ 1.1 million fair value adjustment for leases assumed in the acquisition of HomeBancorp, Inc. (&#8220;HomeBancorp&#8221;). In addition, at the adoption date we had finance lease ROU assets and finance lease liabilities, previously classified as capital leases, of $ 8.8 million and $ 8.3 million , respectively. BancShares did not have a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at commencement. BancShares has no related party lease agreements. This ASU did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note R, Leases, for additional disclosures.

FASB ASU 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer&#8217;s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract 

This ASU aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include internal-use software license). This ASU requires entities to use the guidance in FASB ASC 350-40, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal Use Software , to determine whether to capitalize or expense implementation costs related to the service contract. This ASU also requires entities to (1) expense capitalized implementation costs of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract over the term of the hosting arrangement (2) present the expense related to the capitalized implementation costs in the same line item on the income statement as fees associated with the hosting element of the arrangement (3) classify payments for capitalized implementation costs in the statement of cash flows in the same manner as payments made for fees associated with the hosting element (4) present the capitalized implementation costs in the same balance sheet line item that a prepayment for the fees associated with the hosting arrangement would be presented. 

The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. BancShares adopted this standard effective July 1, 2019 on a prospective basis. As of December 31, 2019, $ 5.7 million of deferred implementation costs net of accumulated amortization related to cloud computing arrangements were recorded in other assets. These costs are expensed over the fixed, noncancellable term of the arrangement and are recorded to processing fees paid to third parties, consistent with the line item of the income statement where fees paid for the associated hosted service are recorded. 

FASB ASU 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments 

In 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities that simplified the application of hedge accounting in certain situations and allowed an entity to make a one-time election to reclassify a prepayable debt security from held to maturity to available for sale if the debt security is eligible to be hedged in accordance with ASC 815-20-25-12A (last-of-layer method). In April of 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-04, which clarifies certain aspects of Topic 815, including an extension on the ability to elect to transfer securities under ASU 2017-12. 

BancShares adopted ASU 2017-12 effective January 1, 2019, though the standard was immaterial to BancShares upon adoption and no transfer of securities from held to maturity to available for sale was made. BancShares adopted ASU 2019-04 as of November 1, 2019 on a prospective basis and elected to reclassify eligible debt securities from held to maturity to available for sale. The book value of securities transferred was $ 2.08 billion with a fair value of $ 2.15 billion . The transfer resulted in a $ 72.5 million reclassification of unrealized losses that were previously frozen in accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of a transfer to held to maturity in the second quarter of 2018. This also resulted in recording an additional unrealized gain on the available for sale securities of $ 1.6 million and offset by a $ 16.7 million unwind of deferred tax assets, resulting in an increase to total assets and equity of $ 57.4 million .

This ASU also added specific disclosure requirements for fair value measurements for public entities including the requirement to disclose the changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements and the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. 

The amendments in this ASU are effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and all interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted upon issuance of the ASU. Entities are permitted to early adopt amendments that remove or modify disclosures and delay the adoption of the additional disclosures until their effective date. BancShares will adopt all applicable amendments and update the disclosures as appropriate during the first quarter of 2020. 

FASB ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment 

This ASU eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under Step 2, an entity had to perform procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities (including unrecognized assets and liabilities) following the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Instead, under the amendments in this ASU, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit&#8217;s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally, an entity should consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. An entity still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. This ASU eliminates the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative test. 

This ASU will be effective for BancShares&#8217; annual or interim goodwill impairment tests for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We expect to adopt the guidance for our annual impairment test in fiscal year 2020. BancShares does not anticipate any impact to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations as a result of the adoption. 

FASB ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments 

This ASU introduces a new credit loss methodology which requires earlier recognition of credit losses, replacing multiple existing impairment methods in current GAAP, which generally require a loss to be incurred before it is recognized. The amendments in this ASU require loss estimates be determined over the lifetime of the asset and broaden the information an entity must consider in developing its expected credit losses. The ASU does not specify a method for measuring expected credit losses and allows an entity to apply methods that reasonably reflect its expectations of the credit loss estimate based on the entity&#8217;s size, complexity and risk profile. 

For BancShares, the standard will apply to loans, unfunded loan commitments and debt securities. A cross-functional team co-led by Corporate Finance and Risk Management was established to implement the new standard. We have completed initial current expected credit loss (&#8220;CECL&#8221;) models and accounting interpretations. We continue to refine and test our models, estimation techniques, operational processes and controls to be used in preparing CECL loss estimates and related financial statement disclosures. We have also evaluated our debt securities portfolio to determine the impact of adoption of CECL. Given the majority of our debt securities are issued by government sponsored entities, we expect very minimal, if any, impact at adoption. 

FIRST CITIZENS BANCSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

The CECL calculated losses on the loan portfolio are derived using estimated probability of default and loss given default models based on historical loss experience, borrower characteristics, forecasts of relevant economic conditions and other factors. We are using a two-year reasonable and supportable forecast period that incorporates one economic forecast, with a 12-month straight-line reversion period to historical averages. The outstanding loans are bifurcated between commercial and non-commercial loan portfolios and then further segmented into pools with similar risk characteristics. The commercial portfolio, comprising the majority of our total loans, consists primarily of loans with short contractual maturities and is expected to result in a reduction to the allowance for credit losses. This reduction is expected to be partially offset by an increase in the allowance for credit losses on the non-commercial portfolio as these assets have longer contractual maturities, as well as an increase in reserves for the acquired loan portfolios. Additionally, the reserve for unfunded commitments is expected to increase due to the change in scope under ASU 2016-13. 

BancShares continues to evaluate the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements but expects the aggregate allowance for credit losses to decrease 15 % to 20 % with an initial increase to retained earnings of $ 32 - $ 42 million . The allowance associated with PCD loans did not have an impact on retained earnings as the CECL reserve is essentially replacing the existing non-accretable discount. The release of existing reserves due to the implementation of CECL will result in an increase to total risk-based capital and a decrease in Tier 1 Capital. The changes to capital are not expected to be significant. 

The amendments in this ASU are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. BancShares adopted the guidance in the first quarter of 2020 using a modified retrospective approach with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. 

NOTE B 

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS 

FCB has evaluated the financial statement significance for all business combinations completed during 2019 and 2018 . FCB has concluded the completed business combinations noted below are not material to BancShares&#8217; consolidated financial statements, individually or in aggregate, and therefore, pro forma financial data has not been included. 

Each transaction was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Fair values are preliminary and subject to refinement for up to one year after the closing date of the acquisition as additional information regarding closing date fair value becomes available. As of December 31, 2019, there have been no refinements to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 

As part of the accounting for each acquisition, we perform an analysis of the acquired bank&#8217;s loan portfolio. Based on such credit factors as past due status, nonaccrual status, life-to-date charge-offs and other quantitative and qualitative considerations, the acquired loans were separated into PCI loans with evidence of credit deterioration since origination, which are accounted for under ASC 310-30, and non-PCI loans that do not meet this criteria, which are accounted for under ASC 310-20. 

Community Financial Holding Co. Inc. 

On February 1, 2020, FCB completed the merger of Duluth, Georgia-based Community Financial Holding Co. Inc. (&#8220;Community Financial&#8221;) and its bank subsidiary, Gwinnett Community Bank. Under the terms of the agreement, total cash consideration of $ 2.3 million was paid to the shareholders of Community Financial. The merger allows FCB to expand its presence and enhance banking efforts in Georgia. As of December 31, 2019, Community Financial reported $ 224.0 million in consolidated assets, $ 136.9 million in loans, and $ 211.8 million in deposits. 

Entegra Financial Corp. 

On December 31, 2019, FCB completed the merger of Franklin, North Carolina-based Entegra Financial Corp. (&#8220;Entegra&#8221;) and its bank subsidiary, Entegra Bank. Under the terms of the agreement, cash consideration of $ 30.18 per share was paid to the shareholders of Entegra for each share of common stock totaling approximately $ 222.8 million . The merger allows FCB to expand its presence and enhance banking efforts in western North Carolina.

The fair value of the assets acquired was $ 1.68 billion , including $ 953.7 million in non-PCI loans, $ 77.5 million in PCI loans and $ 4.5 million in a core deposit intangible. Liabilities assumed were $ 1.51 billion , of which $ 1.33 billion were deposits. As a result of the transaction, FCB recorded $ 52.6 million of goodwill. The amount of goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired. The premium paid reflects the increased market share and related synergies expected to result from the acquisition. None of the goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes as the merger was accounted for as a qualified stock purchase. 

FCB was required to agree to divest certain branches, other assets and liabilities in order to obtain regulatory approval for the transaction.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

As described in Note A, Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, on November 1, 2019, as part of the adoption of ASU 2019-04, mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost of $ 2.08 billion were transferred from investment securities held to maturity to the available for sale portfolio. At the time of the transfer, the securities had a fair value of $ 2.15 billion . The transfer resulted in a reclassification of unrealized losses of $ 72.5 million , or $ 55.8 million net of tax, previously frozen in AOCI as a result of the initial transfer to held to maturity. FCB still has the intent and ability to hold the remainder of the held to maturity portfolio to maturity. 

On May 1, 2018, mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost of $ 2.49 billion were transferred from investment securities available for sale to the held to maturity portfolio. At the time of transfer, the mortgage-backed securities had a fair value of $ 2.38 billion and a weighted average contractual maturity of 13 years . The unrealized loss on these securities at the date of transfer was $ 109.5 million , or $ 84.3 million net of tax, and was reported as a component of AOCI. This unrealized loss was accreted over the remaining expected life of the securities as an adjustment of yield and was partially offset by the amortization of the corresponding discount on the transferred securities. 

Investments in mortgage-backed securities represent securities issued by the Government National Mortgage Association, Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. Investments in government agency securities represent securities issued by the United States Small Business Administration. Investments in corporate bonds and marketable equity securities represent positions in securities of other financial institutions. Other held to maturity investments include certificates of deposit with other financial institutions. 

BancShares holds approximately 298,000 shares of Visa Class B common stock with a cost basis of zero. BancShares&#8217; Visa Class B shares are not considered to have a readily determinable fair value and are recorded with no fair value. 

The following table provides the amortized cost and fair value by contractual maturity. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities on certain securities because borrowers and issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties. Residential and commercial mortgage-backed and government agency securities are stated separately as they are not due at a single maturity date.

##TABLE_END

As of December 31, 2019 , there were 91 investment securities available for sale with continuous losses for more than 12 months of which 90 are government sponsored, enterprise-issued mortgage-backed securities or government agency securities and 1 is a corporate bond. 

None of the unrealized losses identified as of December 31, 2019 or December 31, 2018 relate to the marketability of the securities or the issuer&#8217;s ability to honor redemption obligations. Rather, the unrealized losses related to changes in interest rates and spreads relative to when the investment securities were purchased. BancShares has the ability and intent to retain these securities for a period of time sufficient to recover all unrealized losses. Therefore, none of the losses on these securities were deemed to be OTTI. 

Investment securities having an aggregate carrying value of $ 3.93 billion at December 31, 2019 and $ 4.03 billion at December 31, 2018 , were pledged as collateral to secure public funds on deposit and certain short-term borrowings, and for other purposes as required by law. 

NOTE D 

LOANS AND LEASES 

BancShares&#8217; accounting methods for loans and leases differ depending on whether they are non-PCI or PCI. Loans originated by BancShares and loans performing under their contractual obligations at acquisition are classified as Non-PCI. Loans reflecting credit deterioration since origination such that it is probable at acquisition that BancShares will be unable to collect all contractually required payments are classified as PCI. Additionally, acquired loans are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition, with no corresponding allowance for loan and lease losses. See Note A , Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, for additional information on non-PCI and PCI loans and leases.

##TABLE_END

At December 31, 2019 , $ 9.41 billion in non-PCI loans with a lendable collateral value of $ 6.57 billion were used to secure $ 563.7 million in FHLB of Atlanta advances, resulting in additional borrowing capacity of $ 6.01 billion . At December 31, 2018 , $ 9.12 billion in non-PCI loans with a lendable collateral value of $ 6.36 billion were used to secure $ 175.2 million in FHLB of Atlanta advances, resulting in additional borrowing capacity of $ 6.18 billion . 

At December 31, 2019 , $ 3.68 billion in non-PCI loans with a lendable collateral value of $ 2.98 billion were used to secure additional borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank (&#8220;FRB&#8221;). At December 31, 2018 , $ 2.94 billion in non-PCI loans with a lendable collateral value of $ 2.19 billion were used to secure additional borrowing capacity at the FRB. 

Certain residential real estate loans are originated to be sold to investors and are recorded in loans held for sale at fair value. Loans held for sale totaled $ 67.9 million and $ 45.5 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. We may change our strategy for certain portfolio loans and sell them in the secondary market. At such time, portfolio loans are transferred to loans held for sale at fair value. 

During 2019 , total proceeds from sales of residential mortgage loans were $ 756.0 million of which $ 731.8 million related to sales of loans held for sale. The remaining $ 24.2 million related to sales of portfolio loans, which resulted in a gain of $ 299 thousand . During 2018 , total proceeds from sales of residential mortgage loans were $ 618.1 million , of which $ 608.5 million related to sales of loans held for sale. The remaining $ 9.6 million related to sales of portfolio loans, which were sold at par. 

Net deferred fees on originated non-PCI loans and leases, including unearned income as well as unamortized costs, were $ 927 thousand and $ 79 thousand at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The unamortized discounts related to purchased non-PCI loans was $ 30.9 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 33.3 million at December 31, 2018 . During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , accretion income on purchased non-PCI loans and leases was $ 13.2 million and $ 12.8 million , respectively. 

Loans and leases to borrowers in medical, dental or related fields were $ 5.16 billion as of December 31, 2019 , which represents 17.9 % of total loans and leases, compared to $ 4.98 billion or 19.5 % of total loans and leases at December 31, 2018 . The credit risk of this industry concentration is mitigated through our underwriting policies, which emphasize reliance on adequate borrower cash flow, rather than underlying collateral value, and our preference for financing secured by owner-occupied real property. Except for this single concentration, no other industry represented more than 10% of total loans and leases outstanding at December 31, 2019 .

Credit quality indicators 

Loans and leases are monitored for credit quality on a recurring basis. Commercial and noncommercial loans and leases have different credit quality indicators as a result of the unique characteristics of the loan segments being evaluated. The credit quality indicators for non-PCI and PCI commercial loans and leases are developed through a review of individual borrowers on an ongoing basis. Commercial loans are evaluated periodically with more frequent evaluations done on criticized loans. The indicators as of the date presented are based on the most recent assessment performed and are defined below: 

Pass &#8211; A pass rated asset is not adversely classified because it does not display any of the characteristics for adverse classification. 

Special mention &#8211; A special mention asset has potential weaknesses which deserve management&#8217;s close attention. If left uncorrected, such potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects or collateral position at some future date. Special mention assets are not adversely classified and do not warrant adverse classification. 

Substandard &#8211; A substandard asset is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets classified as substandard generally have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. These assets are characterized by the distinct possibility of loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 

Doubtful &#8211; An asset classified as doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in an asset classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values. 

Loss &#8211; Assets classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value it is inappropriate to be carried as an asset. This classification is not necessarily equivalent to any potential for recovery or salvage value, but rather it is not appropriate to defer a full charge-off even though partial recovery may be affected in the future. 

Ungraded &#8211; Ungraded loans represent loans not included in the individual credit grading process due to their relatively small balances or borrower type. The majority of ungraded loans at December 31, 2019 and 2018, relate to business credit cards. Business credit card loans are subject to automatic charge-off when they become 120 days past due in the same manner as unsecured consumer lines of credit. The remaining balance is comprised of a small amount of commercial mortgage, lease financing and other commercial real estate loans. 

The credit quality indicators for non-PCI and PCI noncommercial loans are based on delinquency status of the borrower as of the date presented. As the borrower becomes more delinquent, the likelihood of loss increases.

##TABLE_END

The carrying value of PCI loans on the cost recovery method was $ 2.9 million and $ 3.3 million at December 31, 2019 , and 2018 , respectively. The recorded investment of PCI loans on nonaccrual status was $ 6.7 million and $ 1.3 million at December 31, 2019 , and 2018 , respectively. PCI loans 90 days past due and still accruing were $ 24.3 million and $ 37.0 million at December 31, 2019 , and 2018 , respectively. 

For PCI loans, improved credit loss expectations generally result in the reclassification of nonaccretable difference to accretable yield. Changes in expected cash flows not related to credit improvements or deterioration do not affect the nonaccretable difference.

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

BancShares accounts for certain loan modifications or restructurings as TDRs. In general, the modification or restructuring of a loan is considered a TDR if, for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties, a concession is granted to the borrower that creditors would not otherwise consider. Concessions may relate to the contractual interest rate, maturity date, payment structure or other actions. The majority of TDRs are included in the special mention, substandard or doubtful credit quality indicators, which results in more elevated loss expectations when projecting the expected cash flows used to determine the allowance for loan losses associated with these loans. The lower the credit quality indicator, the lower the estimated expected cash flows and the greater the allowance recorded. All TDRs are individually evaluated for impairment through review of collateral values or analysis of cash flows at least annually. 

The following table provides a summary of total TDRs by accrual status. Total TDRs at December 31, 2019 , were $ 171.2 million , of which $ 154.0 million were non-PCI and $ 17.2 million were PCI. Total TDRs at December 31, 2018 , were $ 156.1 million , of which $ 137.9 million were non-PCI and $ 18.2 million were PCI. Total TDRs at December 31, 2017 , were $ 164.6 million , of which $ 146.1 million were non-PCI and $ 18.5 million were PCI.

Other Intangible Assets 

Other intangible assets include mortgage servicing rights on loans sold to third parties with servicing retained, core deposit intangibles which represent the estimated fair value of acquired core deposits and other customer relationships, and other servicing rights acquired. 

Mortgage Servicing Rights (&#8220;MSRs&#8221;) 

Our portfolio of residential mortgage loans serviced for third parties was $3.38 billion , $2.95 billion and $ 2.81 billion as of December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The majority of these loans were originated by BancShares and sold to third parties on a non-recourse basis with servicing rights retained. At December 31, 2019 , a portion of the MSRs were related to Entegra originations prior to acquisition. These retained servicing rights are recorded as a servicing asset and reported in other intangible assets. The mortgage servicing rights are initially recorded at fair value and then carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair market value. The amortization expense related to mortgage servicing rights is included as a reduction of mortgage income. 

The activity of the mortgage servicing asset for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 is presented in the following table:

##TABLE_END

Contractually specified mortgage servicing fees, late fees and ancillary fees earned for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , were $ 7.9 million , $ 7.5 million and $ 7.1 million , respectively, and reported in mortgage income. 

BancShares recorded valuation allowance provision expense of $ 222 thousand , no provision expense, and a $ 4 thousand provision reversal in the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Valuation of mortgage servicing rights is performed using a pooling methodology. Similar loans are pooled together and evaluated on a discounted earnings basis to determine the present value of future earnings. 

Key economic assumptions used to value mortgage servicing rights as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , were as follows:

##TABLE_END

FIRST CITIZENS BANCSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

The discount rate is based on the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate plus 700 basis points for conventional fixed loans and 800 basis points for all other loans. The 700 and 800 basis points are used as a risk premium when calculating the discount rate. The prepayment rate is derived from the Public Securities Association Standard Prepayment model, which compared to actual prepayment rates annually for reasonableness. The average cost to service a loan is based on the number of loans serviced and the total costs to service the loans. 

Core Deposit Intangibles 

&#160; 

Core deposit intangibles represent the estimated fair value of core deposits and other customer relationships acquired. They are being amortized on an accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives. The weighted average useful life of core deposit intangibles acquired in 2019 is 10.2 years . 

The following information relates to core deposit intangible assets, which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives:

Repurchase Agreements 

BancShares utilizes securities sold under agreements to repurchase to facilitate the needs of customers and secure wholesale funding needs. Repurchase agreements are transactions whereby BancShares offers to sell to a counterparty an undivided interest in an eligible security at an agreed upon purchase price, and which obligates BancShares to repurchase the security at an agreed upon date, repurchase price and interest rate. These agreements are recorded at the amount of cash received in connection with the transaction and are reflected as securities sold under customer repurchase agreements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

BancShares monitors collateral levels on a continuous basis and maintains records of each transaction specifically describing the applicable security and the counterparty&#8217;s fractional interest in that security, and segregates the security from general assets in accordance with regulations governing custodial holdings of securities. The primary risk with repurchase agreements is market risk associated with the investments securing the transactions, as additional collateral may be required based on fair value changes of the underlying investments. Securities pledged as collateral under repurchase agreements are maintained with safekeeping agents. The carrying value of available for sale investment securities pledged as collateral under repurchase agreements was $ 477.6 million and $ 598.6 million at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively. 

BancShares held securities sold under agreements to repurchase of $ 443.0 million at December 31, 2019 , with overnight and continuous remaining contractual maturities collateralized by government agency securities and $ 543.9 million at December 31, 2018 , with overnight and continuous remaining contractual maturities collateralized by U.S Treasury securities.

NOTE L 

SHAREHOLDERS&#8217; EQUITY, DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS AND OTHER REGULATORY MATTERS 

BancShares and FCB are required to meet minimum capital requirements set forth by regulatory authorities. Certain activities such as, the ability to undertake new business initiatives, including acquisitions, the access to and cost of funding for new business initiatives, the ability to pay dividends, the ability to repurchase shares or other capital instruments, the level of deposit insurance costs, and the level and nature of regulatory oversight depend, in large part, on a financial institution&#8217;s capital strength. 

Bank regulatory agencies approved regulatory capital guidelines (&#8220;Basel III&#8221;) aimed at strengthening existing capital requirements for banking organizations. Basel III became effective for BancShares on January 1, 2015. Under Basel III, requirements include a common equity Tier 1 ratio minimum of 4.50 % , Tier 1 risk-based capital minimum of 6.00 % , total risk-based capital ratio minimum of 8.00 % and Tier 1 leverage capital ratio minimum of 4.00 % . Failure to meet minimum capital requirements may result in certain actions by regulators that could have a direct, material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 

Basel III also introduced a capital conservation buffer in addition to the regulatory minimum capital requirements which was phased in annually over four years beginning January 1, 2016, at 0.625 % of risk-weighted assets and increasing each subsequent year by an additional 0.625 % . At January 1, 2018, the capital conservation buffer was 1.875 % . As fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the capital conservation buffer is 2.50 % . 

&#160; 

Based on the most recent notifications from its regulators, BancShares and FCB is well-capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. As of December 31, 2019 , BancShares and FCB met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject and were not aware of any conditions or events that would affect each entity&#8217;s well-capitalized status. 

&#160; 

Following is an analysis of capital ratios under Basel III guidelines for BancShares and FCB as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 :

Payment of dividends is made at the discretion of the Board of Directors and is contingent upon satisfactory earnings as well as projected future capital needs. BancShares&#8217; principal source of liquidity for payment of shareholder dividends is the dividend it receives from FCB. 

BancShares and FCB are subject to various requirements imposed by state and federal banking statutes and regulations, including regulations requiring the maintenance of reserve balances at the Federal Reserve Bank. Banks are allowed to reduce the required balances by the amount of vault cash. For 2019 , the requirements averaged $ 730.7 million .

OTHER NONINTEREST INCOME AND OTHER NONINTEREST EXPENSE 

Other noninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $18.4 million , $19.7 million and $29.1 million , respectively. The most significant item in other noninterest income was recoveries on PCI loans previously charged-off. BancShares records the portion of recoveries related to loans and leases written off prior to the closing of an acquisition as noninterest income rather than as an adjustment to the allowance for loan losses. These recoveries were $ 17.4 million , $ 16.6 million and $ 21.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Charge-offs on PCI loans are recorded against the discount recognized on the date of acquisition versus through the allowance for loan losses unless an allowance was established subsequent to the acquisition date due to declining expected cash flow. Other noninterest income also includes FHLB dividends and other various income items.

At December 31, 2019 , $ 48.3 million of existing gross deferred tax assets related to federal net operating loss carryforwards and $ 24.6 million to state net operating loss carryforwards which expire in years beginning in 2024. The net operating losses were obtained through various acquisitions and are subject to the annual limitations set forth by Internal Revenue Code Section 382. No valuation allowance was necessary as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, to reduce BancShares&#8217; gross deferred tax asset to the amount more likely than not to be realized. 

BancShares regularly adjusts its net deferred tax asset as a result of changes in tax rates in the state where it files tax returns. These changes in tax rates did not have a material impact on tax expense in 2019, 2018, or 2017. 

BancShares&#8217; and its subsidiaries&#8217; federal income tax returns for 2016 through 2018 remain open for examination. Generally, BancShares is no longer subject to examination by state and local taxing authorities for taxable years prior to 2014. 

The following table provides a rollforward of BancShares&#8217; gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, during the years ended December 31 , 2019 , 2018 and 2017 :

All of the unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect BancShares&#8217; effective tax rate. 

BancShares has unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain state tax positions in North Carolina and other state jurisdictions resulting from tax filings submitted to the states. No tax benefit has been recorded for these uncertain tax positions in the consolidated financial statements. BancShares does not expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly during 2020. 

BancShares recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. For the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , BancShares recorded $ 429 thousand , $ 564 thousand and $ 450 thousand , respectively which primarily represent accrued interest.

NOTE P 

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES 

Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. BancShares estimates fair value using discounted cash flows or other valuation techniques when there is no active market for a financial instrument. Inputs used in these valuation techniques are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties and require significant judgment. Therefore, the derived fair value estimates presented below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts BancShares would realize in a current market exchange. 

Assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value according to a fair value hierarchy comprised of three levels. The levels are based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. The level within the fair value hierarchy for an asset or liability is based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement with Level 1 inputs considered highest and Level 3 inputs considered lowest. A brief description of each input level follows: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices observable for the assets or liabilities and market corroborated inputs. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. These unobservable inputs and assumptions reflect estimates market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. 

##TABLE_END BancShares&#8217; management reviews any changes to its valuation methodologies to ensure they are appropriate and supportable, and refines valuation methodologies as more market-based data becomes available. Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognized at the end of the reporting period. 

The methodologies used to estimate the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities are discussed below. 

Investment securities available for sale . The fair value of U.S. Treasury, government agency, mortgage-backed and municipal securities and a portion of our corporate bonds are generally estimated using a third party pricing service. The third party provider evaluates securities based on comparable investments with trades and market data and will utilize pricing models which use a variety of inputs, such as benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids and offers as needed. These securities are generally classified as Level 2. The remaining corporate bonds held are generally measured at fair value based on indicative bids from broker-dealers using inputs that are not directly observable. These securities are considered Level 3. 

Marketable equity securities. Equity securities are measured at fair value using observable closing prices. The valuation also considers the amount of market activity by examining the trade volume of each security. Equity securities are classified as Level 1 if they are traded in an active market and as Level 2 if the observable closing price is from a less than active market. 

Loans held for sale. Certain residential real estate loans originated to be sold to investors are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices for similar types of loans. Accordingly, the inputs used to calculate fair value of originated residential real estate loans held for sale are considered Level 2 inputs. Portfolio loans subsequently transferred to held for sale to be sold in the secondary market are transferred at fair value. The fair value of the transferred portfolio loans is based on quoted prices and considered Level 1 inputs. 

Net loans and leases (Non-PCI and PCI). Fair value is estimated based on discounted future cash flows using the current interest rates at which loans with similar terms would be made to borrowers of similar credit quality. The inputs used in the fair value measurements for loans and leases are considered Level 3 inputs. 

FHLB stock . The carrying amount of FHLB stock is a reasonable estimate of fair value, as these securities are not readily marketable and are evaluated for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the par value. BancShares considers positive and negative evidence, including the profitability and asset quality of the issuer, dividend payment history and recent redemption experience, when determining the ultimate recoverability of the par value. BancShares investment in FHLB stock is ultimately recoverable at par. The inputs used in the fair value measurement for the FHLB stock are considered Level 2 inputs. 

FIRST CITIZENS BANCSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Mortgage and other servicing rights. Mortgage and other servicing rights are carried at the lower of amortized cost or market and are, therefore, carried at fair value only when fair value is less than the amortized cost. The fair value of mortgage and other servicing rights is performed using a pooling methodology. Similar loans are pooled together and a model which relies on discount rates, estimates of prepayment rates and the weighted average cost to service the loans is used to determine the fair value. The inputs used in the fair value measurement for mortgage and other servicing rights are considered Level 3 inputs. 

Deposits. For non-time deposits, carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value. The fair value of time deposits is estimated by discounting future cash flows using the interest rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. The inputs used in the fair value measurement for deposits are considered Level 2 inputs. 

Borrowings. For borrowings, the fair values are determined based on recent trades or sales of the actual security if available. Otherwise, fair values are estimated by discounting future cash flows using current interest rates for similar financial instruments. The inputs used in the fair value measurement for FHLB borrowings, subordinated debentures, and other borrowings are considered Level 2 inputs. 

Payable to the FDIC for shared-loss agreements. The fair value of the payable to the FDIC for shared-loss agreements is determined by the projected cash flows based on expected payments to the FDIC in accordance with the shared-loss agreements. Cash flows are discounted using current discount rates to reflect the timing of the estimated amounts due to the FDIC. The inputs used in the fair value measurement for the payable to the FDIC are considered Level 3 inputs. 

Off-balance-sheet commitments and contingencies. Carrying amounts are reasonable estimates of the fair values for such financial instruments. Carrying amounts include unamortized fee income and, in some cases, reserves for any credit losses from those financial instruments. These amounts are not material to BancShares&#8217; financial position. 

For all other financial assets and financial liabilities, the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of the fair value as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 . The carrying value and fair value for these assets and liabilities are equivalent because they are relatively short-term in nature and there is no interest rate or credit risk that would cause the fair value to differ from the carrying value. Cash and due from banks is classified on the fair value hierarchy as Level 1. Overnight investments, income earned not collected and accrued interest payable are considered Level 2. 

The table presents the carrying values and estimated fair values for financial instruments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. ##TABLE_START &#160;

The transfers were due to the availability of additional observable inputs for those securities. During the year ended December 31, 2018 , $ 65.3 million of corporate bonds available for sale were transferred from Level 2 to Level 3. The transfers were due to a lack of observable inputs and trade activity for those securities.

Fair Value Option 

BancShares has elected the fair value option for residential real estate loans originated to be sold. This election reduces certain timing differences in the Consolidated Statements of Income and better aligns with the management of the portfolio from a business perspective. The changes in fair value are recorded as a component of mortgage income and were gains of $ 289 thousand , $ 50 thousand and $ 2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively.

No originated loans held for sale were 90 or more days past due or on nonaccrual status as of December 31, 2019 or December 31, 2018 . 

Certain other assets are adjusted to their fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including impaired loans, OREO and goodwill, which are periodically tested for impairment, and mortgage servicing rights, which are carried at the lower of amortized cost or market. Non-impaired loans held for investment, deposits, and borrowings are not reported at fair value. 

Impaired loans are considered to be at fair value if an associated allowance adjustment or current period charge-off has been recorded. The value of impaired loans is determined by either collateral valuations or discounted present value of the expected cash flow calculations. Collateral values are determined using appraisals or other third-party value estimates of the subject property with discounts generally between 6 % and 11 % applied for estimated selling costs and other external factors that may impact the marketability of the property. Expected cash flows are determined using expected payment information at the individual loan level, discounted using the effective interest rate. The effective interest rate for the majority of impaired loans generally ranges between 3 % and 7 %. 

OREO acquired or written down in the previous 12 months is considered to be at fair value, which uses asset valuations. Asset values are determined using appraisals or other third-party value estimates of the subject property with discounts generally between 6 % and 11 % applied for estimated selling costs and other external factors that may impact the marketability of the property. Changes to the value of the assets between scheduled valuation dates are monitored through continued communication with brokers and monthly reviews by the asset manager assigned to each asset. If there are any significant changes in the market or the subject property, valuations are adjusted or new appraisals ordered to ensure the reported values reflect the most current information. 

Mortgage servicing rights are carried at the lower of cost or market and are, therefore, carried at fair value only when fair value is less than amortized cost. The fair value of mortgage servicing rights is performed using a pooling methodology. Similar loans are pooled together and a discounted cash flow model, which takes into consideration discount rates, prepayment rates, and the weighted average cost to service the loans, are used to determine the fair value.

NOTE Q 

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 

FCB sponsors benefit plans for its qualifying employees and former First Citizens Bancorporation, Inc. employees (&#8220;legacy Bancorporation&#8221;) including noncontributory defined benefit pension plans, a 401(k) savings plan and an enhanced 401(k) savings plan. These plans are qualified under the Internal Revenue Code. FCB also maintains agreements with certain executives providing supplemental benefits paid upon death or separation from service at an agreed-upon age. 

Defined Benefit Pension Plans 

BancShares employees who were hired prior to April 1, 2007 and qualified under length of service and other requirements are covered by the BancShares pension plan, which was closed to new participants as of April 1, 2007. Discretionary contributions of $ 71 thousand were made to the BancShares pension plan in 2019 , while discretionary contributions of $ 50.0 million were made in 2018 . 

Certain legacy Bancorporation employees who qualified under length of service and other requirements are covered by the Bancorporation pension plan, which was closed to new participants as of September 1, 2007. Discretionary contributions of $ 3.5 million were made to the Bancorporation pension plan for 2019 , while no discretionary contributions were made for 2018 . 

&#160; 

Participants in the noncontributory defined benefit pension plans (&#8220;the Plans&#8221;) were fully vested in the Plans after five years of service. Retirement benefits are based on years of service and highest annual compensation for five consecutive years during the last ten years of employment. FCB makes contributions to the Plans in amounts between the minimum required for funding and the maximum amount deductible for federal income tax purposes. Management evaluates the need for its pension plan contributions on a periodic basis based upon numerous factors including, but not limited to, the pension plan funded status, returns on plan assets, discount rates and the current economic environment. 

Due to the Plans having the same terms in both form and substance, the following tables and disclosures will report the Plans in total.

##TABLE_END

The estimated discount rate, which represents the interest rate that could be obtained for a suitable investment used to fund the benefit obligations, is based on a yield curve developed from high-quality corporate bonds across a full maturity spectrum. The projected cash flows of the pension plans are discounted based on this yield curve and a single discount rate is calculated to achieve the same present value. 

The weighted average expected long-term rate of return on the Plans&#8217; assets represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on the Plans&#8217; assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. In developing the expected rate of return, historical and current returns, as well as investment allocation strategies, on the Plans&#8217; assets are considered. 

Plan Assets 

For the Plans, our primary total return objective is to achieve returns over the long term that will fund retirement liabilities and provide desired plan benefits in a manner that satisfies the fiduciary requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The Plans&#8217; assets have a long-term time horizon that runs concurrent with the average life expectancy of the participants. As such, the Plans can assume a time horizon that extends well beyond a full market cycle and can assume a reasonable level of risk. It is expected, however, that both professional investment management and sufficient portfolio diversification will smooth volatility and help to generate a reasonable consistency of return. The investments are broadly diversified across global, economic and market risk factors in an attempt to reduce volatility and target multiple return sources. Within approved guidelines and restrictions, the investment manager has discretion over the timing and selection of individual investments. The Plans&#8217; assets are currently held by the FCB trust department.

401(k) Savings Plans 

Certain employees enrolled in the defined benefit plan are also eligible to participate in a 401(k) savings plan through deferral of portions of their salary. For employees who participate in the 401(k) savings plan who also continue to accrue additional years of service under the defined benefit plan, FCB makes a matching contribution equal to 100 % of the first 3 % and 50 % of the next 3 % of the participant&#8217;s deferral up to and including a maximum contribution of 4.5 % of the participant&#8217;s eligible compensation. The matching contribution immediately vests. 

FIRST CITIZENS BANCSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

&#160; 

At the end of 2007, current employees were given the option to continue to accrue additional years of service under the defined benefit plans or to elect to join an enhanced 401(k) savings plan. Under the enhanced 401(k) savings plan, FCB matches up to 100 % of the participant&#8217;s deferrals not to exceed 6 % of the participant&#8217;s eligible compensation. The matching contribution immediately vests. In addition to the employer match of the employee contributions, the enhanced 401(k) savings plan provides a required employer non-elective contribution equal to 3 % of the compensation of a participant who remains employed at the end of the calendar year. This employer contribution vests after three years of service. Employees who elected to enroll in the enhanced 401(k) savings plan discontinued the accrual of additional years of service under the defined benefit plans and became enrolled in the enhanced 401(k) savings plan effective January 1, 2008 . Eligible employees hired after January 1, 2008 , are eligible to participate in the enhanced 401(k) savings plan. FCB recognized expense related to contributions to the 401(k) plans of $ 30.8 million , $ 28.6 million and $ 25.3 million during 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. 

Additional Benefits for Executives, Directors, and Officers of Acquired Entities 

&#160; 

FCB has entered into contractual agreements with certain executives providing payments for a period of no more than ten years following separation from service occurring no earlier than an agreed-upon age. These agreements also provide a death benefit in the event a participant dies prior to separation from service or during the payment period following separation from service. FCB has also assumed liability for contractual obligations to directors and officers of previously acquired entities.

The incentive compensation programs were designed to motivate employees through a balanced approach of risk and reward for their contributions toward FCB&#8217;s success. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the accrued liability for incentive compensation was $ 57.0 million and $ 46.4 million , respectively.

The following table presents lease costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 . Variable lease cost primarily represents variable payments such as common area maintenance and utilities recognized in the period in which the expense was incurred. Certain of our lease agreements also include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. While lease liabilities are not remeasured as a result of these changes, these adjustments are treated as variable lease costs and recognized in the period in which the expense is incurred.

The amounts presented exclude loans to Related Persons for credit card lines of $15,000 or less, overdraft lines of $5,000 or less and intercompany transactions between BancShares and FCB. 

Unfunded loan commitments available to Related Persons were $ 2.6 million and $ 4.3 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 

During the year ended December 31, 2019 , BancShares repurchased 100,000 shares of its outstanding Class A common stock at an average price of $ 464.90 per share from Ella Anna Holding, as trustee of her revocable trust. Mrs. Holding is the widow of BancShares&#8217; former Executive Vice Chairman, Frank B. Holding, and the mother of Frank B. Holding, Jr. and Hope H. Bryant, BancShares&#8217; Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chairman, respectively. Pursuant to the existing share repurchase authorization, the Board&#8217;s independent Audit Committee reviewed and approved the repurchase of up to 250,000 shares held by Mrs. Holding on or before April 30, 2020, pursuant to BancShares&#8217; related person transaction policy. 

NOTE T 

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

To meet the financing needs of its customers, BancShares and its subsidiaries have financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve elements of credit, interest rate or liquidity risk. 

Commitments to extend credit are legally binding agreements to lend to customers. These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of fees. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future liquidity requirements. Established credit standards control the credit risk exposure associated with these commitments. In some cases, BancShares requires collateral be pledged to secure the commitment, including cash deposits, securities and other assets. 

Standby letters of credit are commitments guaranteeing performance of a customer to a third party. These commitments are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, and their fair value is not material. To mitigate its risk, BancShares&#8217; credit policies govern the issuance of standby letters of credit. The credit risk related to the issuance of these letters of credit is essentially the same as those involved in extending loans to clients and, therefore, these letters of credit are collateralized when necessary. 

The following table presents the commitments to extend credit and unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 :

##TABLE_END

BancShares and FCB have investments in qualified affordable housing projects primarily for the purposes of fulfilling Community Reinvestment Act requirements and obtaining tax credits. Unfunded commitments to fund future investments in affordable housing projects totaled $ 70.0 million and $ 68.0 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, and were recorded within other liabilities. 

BancShares and various subsidiaries have been named as defendants in legal actions arising from their normal business activities in which damages in various amounts are claimed. BancShares is also exposed to litigation risk relating to the prior business activities of banks from which assets were acquired and liabilities assumed in merger transactions. Although the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to such matters cannot be determined, in the opinion of management, any such liability will not have a material effect on BancShares&#8217; consolidated financial statements.
