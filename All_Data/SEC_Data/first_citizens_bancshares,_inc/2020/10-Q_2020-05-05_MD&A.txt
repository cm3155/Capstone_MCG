Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Management&#8217;s discussion and analysis (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;) of earnings and related financial data are presented to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of First Citizens BancShares, Inc. and Subsidiaries (&#8220;BancShares&#8221;). This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes presented within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q along with our financial statements and related MD&#38;A of financial condition and results of operations included in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Although certain amounts for prior years have been reclassified to conform to statement presentations for 2020 , the reclassifications had no effect on shareholders&#8217; equity or net income as previously reported. Unless otherwise noted, the terms &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;BancShares&#8221; refer to the consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations for BancShares. 

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 

BancShares conducts its banking operations through its wholly-owned subsidiary First-Citizens Bank &#38; Trust Company (&#8220;FCB&#8221;), a state-chartered bank organized under the laws of the state of North Carolina. 

BancShares&#8217; earnings and cash flows are primarily derived from our commercial and retail banking activities. We gather deposits from retail and commercial customers and also secure funding through various non-deposit sources. We invest the liquidity generated from these funding sources in interest-earning assets, including loans and leases, investment securities and overnight investments. We also invest in bank premises, hardware, software, furniture and equipment used to conduct our commercial and retail banking business. We provide treasury services products, cardholder and merchant services, wealth management services and various other products and services typically offered by commercial banks. The fees and service charges generated from these products and services are primary sources of noninterest income which is an essential component of our total revenue. 

We are focused on expanding our position in legacy and target markets through organic growth and strategic acquisitions. We believe our franchise is positioned for continued growth as a result of our client centric banking principles, disciplined lending standards, and our people. 

Refer to our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our strategy. 

RECENT ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENTS 

During the first quarter of 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;) spread throughout the world, causing significant disruptions to the domestic and global economies. In response to the outbreak, governments have imposed restrictions resulting in business shutdowns, regional quarantines, disruptions of supply chains and overall economic instability. This uncertainty has led to volatility in the financial markets, including significant declines in the United States (&#8220;US&#8221;) equity markets. This impact was coupled with spikes in unemployment as a result of business shutdowns that may indicate future labor disruptions or a potential recession. 

During the first quarter of 2020, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Federal Open Market Committee (&#8220;FOMC&#8221;) lowered the federal funds rate by 150 basis points to a target range of 0.00% to 0.25%. The FOMC cited the effects of COVID-19 on economic activity and the risks posed to the economic outlook. The FOMC expects to maintain this target range until it is confident the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals. 

On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security Act (the &#8220;CARES Act&#8221;) was passed. The bill was designed to provide short-term economic relief to individuals and businesses most impacted by the fallout of the pandemic. Key provisions include: for individuals, economic impact payments and enhanced unemployment benefits; for small businesses, access to loans and support through the Small Business Administration (&#8220;SBA&#8221;), direct aid and loans to the medical industry and other affected sectors, and certain tax benefits that can be used in conjunction with the other aid mentioned. While direct aid to financial services entities is not a primary goal of the provisions, financial institutions will function to transmit funds from the Federal Reserve, SBA and US Treasury to the public. In addition, there were other regulatory actions taken that may impact our business including troubled debt restructuring recognition relief, changes in credit reporting on customer forbearance, federally backed mortgage forbearance, potential legal lending limit relaxation and other economic stabilization efforts. 

BANCSHARES&#8217; COVID-19 CRISIS PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE 

BancShares&#8217; strong capital and liquidity positions, along with a history of sound risk management, provide flexibility and stability to navigate this crisis. At the onset, BancShares assembled a cross-functional leadership team to ensure business continuity, protect the safety of our associates, and support our customers and communities. Our continued investment in technology allowed our team to respond to customers without interruption. Digital account openings and virtual logins increased approximately 25% from pre-COVID-19 levels and we have successfully deployed a remote work strategy for numerous associates. Our leadership team, with the help of all our dedicated associates, has been working diligently to ensure our high standards of customer service continue while also protecting the safety and soundness of our organization and the health and welfare of our stakeholders. 

Supporting Our Associates 

&#8226; 

More than 90% of associates at our corporate locations are working remotely. 

&#8226; 

Branches transitioned to drive-thru and lobby by appointment only service to limit exposure to our associates and our customers. 

&#8226; 

Increased access to employee assistance programs, including emotional support and assistance with childcare and eldercare services. 

&#8226; 

Offering paid leave and medical treatment for associates with COVID-19-related illnesses. 

&#8226; 

Established an internal COVID-19 platform to provide daily communication across the company. 

Supporting Our Customers 

&#8226; 

Ensuring the majority of our branches remain operational for our customers with appropriate safety protocols. 

&#8226; 

Waiving early withdrawal penalties on certificates of deposit when customers need the funds for relief. 

&#8226; 

Offering 90-day payment deferrals for qualified borrowers with no late fees. 

&#8226; 

Increasing access to funds through our traditional lending products and offering special unsecured loans for up to 24 months with a low fixed interest rate and no payments for 90 days. 

&#8226; 

Participating in the Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;SBA-PPP&#8221;) . 

Diversified Loan Portfolio and Ongoing Monitoring of Credit Risk 

While we understand that helping our customers through this trying time may defer a full understanding of the impact of COVID-19, we are actively monitoring our loan portfolio for areas of increased risk. As of May 4, 2020, we have approved or processed loan payment extensions on approximately $6.5 billion in loans (approximately $200 million in deferred payments) for customers in good standing who have been affected by COVID-19. BancShares has a well-diversified loan portfolio by geography and industry, however, extensions have been concentrated in industries impacted the most by the pandemic which includes our dental and medical portfolios, as well as the hospitality industry. The risk profile is somewhat mitigated as our typical customer&#8217;s dental or medical practice is well established and actively managed. Social distancing requirements had an immediate impact on both of these industries; however, they should also see immediate demand for services once those restrictions are lessened. Through April 24, 2020, we have not seen significant shifts in credit line utilization or overall declines in credit quality. BancShares continues to have solid credit performance that has matched or exceeded its peer group net charge-off ratios over time. 

We are actively participating in the SBA-PPP program, which will provide much needed funds to our small business customers. In March, we put together a detailed and comprehensive framework to enable us to accept applications from our customers to help them in this time of need. We processed approximately 5,000 SBA-PPP loan applications, securing funding for our customers of approximately $1.8 billion, during the initial round of funding for this program. As of May 4, 2020, we have processed approximately 18,000 additional loan applications for the second phase of this program, representing additional funding of approximately $1.6 billion. 

Strong Liquidity Position and Low Cost Funding Sources 

We maintain a strong level of liquidity, which positions us well to adapt to stresses posed by this environment. As of March 31, 2020, we had liquid assets (available cash and unencumbered high quality liquid assets at market value) totaling approximately $5.5 billion. This represented 13.2% of consolidated assets as of March 31, 2020. 

In addition to liquid assets, we had contingent sources of liquidity totaling approximately $11.3 billion in the form of Federal Home Loan Bank borrowing capacity, Federal Reserve Discount Window availability, fed funds lines and a committed line of credit. 

Our funding base is composed of 94.8% deposits, of which 38.7% are demand deposit accounts. Of our total deposits, 97.7% are core deposits. As of March 31, 2020, our loan to deposit ratio was 83.7% and our cost of total deposits was 0.28%. 

Strong Capital Position 

In accordance with our capital plan, we operate with a level of capital above regulatory established well-capitalized limits. This plan considers an assessment of internal and external risk factors and is further informed by combined idiosyncratic and market-stressed scenarios. 

At March 31, 2020, BancShares&#8217; regulatory capital ratios were well in excess of Basel III capital requirements to withstand these market-stressed scenarios with a total risk-based capital ratio of 13.7%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 11.4%, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.4%, a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9.0%, and a capital conservation buffer of 5.4%, over twice the required level of 2.5%. 

SIGNIFICANT EVENTS IN 2020 

On January 1, 2020 BancShares adopted Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which introduced a new credit loss methodology for the estimation of credit losses.The amendments in this ASU require loss estimates be determined over an asset&#8217;s lifetime and broaden the information that an entity must consider in developing its expected credit losses. BancShares adopted this ASU using the modified retrospective approach for all loans, leases, debt securities designated as held to maturity, and unfunded loan commitments. BancShares adopted this ASU using the prospective transition approach for PCD loans previously accounted for under ASC 310-30 and debt securities available for sale. Refer to Note A - Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation for additional information. 

Upon adoption, BancShares recorded a net decrease of $37.9 million in the Allowance for Credit Losses (&#8220;ACL&#8221;) which included a decrease of $56.9 million in the ACL on non-purchased credit deteriorated (&#8220;non-PCD&#8221;) loans, offset by an increase of $19.0 million in the ACL on purchased credit deteriorated (&#8220;PCD&#8221;) loans. The $56.9 million change in the ACL on non-PCD loans, as well as an $8.9 million increase in the reserve for unfunded commitments, net of deferred taxes, resulted in an increase in retained earnings of $36.9 million . The $19.0 million increase in the ACL on PCD loans resulted in a gross up of loan balances by this same amount and did not have any effect on retained earnings. Impact to total capital and capital ratios was not significant and we did not elect the capital phase-in option allowable for regulatory reporting purposes. 

On February 1, 2020, FCB completed the merger of Duluth, Georgia-based Community Financial Holding Co. Inc. and its bank subsidiary, Gwinnett Community Bank, into FCB. 

On April 17, 2020, FCB completed the sale of three branches to Select Bank &#38; Trust Company (&#8220;Select Bank&#8221;), which were originally acquired from Entegra Bank on December 31, 2019.

(1) We adopted ASC Topic 326 utilizing the modified retrospective approach. We did not restate selected financial data for the quarters prior to 2020 presented above. 

(2) Average loan and lease balances include PCD loans, non-PCD loans and leases, loans held for sale and nonaccrual loans and leases. 

(3) Upon adoption of ASC 326, we dissolved pooling of PCI loans allowed under ASC 310-10. This increased the amount of nonaccrual loans as those nonaccrual loans within performing PCI pools were previously excluded from reporting. As of January 1, 2020, there were $47.0 million of nonaccrual loans released from performing PCI pools. 

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS 

Community Financial Holding Co. Inc. 

On February 1, 2020, FCB completed the merger of Duluth, Georgia-based Community Financial Holding Co. Inc. (&#8220;Community Financial&#8221;) and its bank subsidiary, Gwinnett Community Bank, into FCB. Under the terms of the agreement, total cash consideration of $2.3 million was paid to the shareholders of Community Financial. The merger allows FCB to expand its presence and enhance banking efforts in Georgia. The merger contributed $222.1 million in consolidated assets, which included $686 thousand of goodwill, $134.0 million in loans, and $209.3 million in deposits. 

See Note B - Business Combinations for additional disclosures. 

Entegra Financial Corp. 

On April 17, 2020, FCB and Select Bank completed the sale of three North Carolina branches located in Highlands, Sylva and Franklin. FCB was required to divest these branches, other assets and liabilities in order to obtain regulatory approval for the merger of Franklin, North Carolina-based Entegra Entegra and its bank subsidiary, Entegra Bank, completed in the fourth quarter of 2019. The assets and liabilities of the branches divested are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and in the related Unaudited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements within loans and leases, premises and equipment and total deposits with a fair value of $108.8 million, $1.9 million, and $185.3 million, respectively as of March 31, 2020. The Select Bank purchase price, of the divested branches, included an 8% premium for deposits acquired that was applied against goodwill generated as part of the merger with Entegra Bank. FCB completed the transaction with Select Bank on April 17, 2020. 

FDIC-Assisted Transactions 

BancShares completed fourteen FDIC-assisted transactions between 2009 and 2017. Nine of the fourteen FDIC-assisted transactions included shared-loss agreements which, for their terms, protect us from a substantial portion of the credit and asset quality risk we would otherwise incur. As of March 31, 2020 , shared-loss protection remains for single family residential loans acquired in the amount of $42.4 million . 

The shared-loss agreement for two of the FDIC-assisted transactions include a provision related to a payment that may be owed to the FDIC at the termination of the agreement (the &#8220;clawback liability&#8221;) . As of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , the estimated clawback liability was $14.7 million and $112.4 million , respectively. BancShares issued a payment to the FDIC in the first quarter of 2020 for $99.5 million related to one of the transactions. The remaining clawback liability payment date is March 2021.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Net Interest Income and Margin (Taxable-Equivalent Basis) 

First Quarter 2020 compared to First Quarter 2019 

Net interest income for the first quarter of 2020 totaled $338.4 million , an increase of $17.9 million , or 5.6% , compared to the first quarter of 2019 . The taxable-equivalent NIM was 3.55% in the first quarter of 2020 , a decrease of 31 basis points from the same quarter in the prior year. 

The increase in net interest income was primarily due to an increase of $34.6 million in interest earned on loans from loan growth, partially offset by increases in interest expense on deposits of $11.3 million and borrowings of $3.4 million. The primary drivers of the margin decline were an increase in the rates paid on interest-bearing deposits, largely in time deposits and money market accounts, and a decline in the yield on interest earning assets. 

Average interest-earning assets increased by $4.57 billion to $38.00 billion , compared to the first quarter of 2019 . The primary drivers for this change were higher average loan balances which increased $3.58 billion , due to contributions from both recent acquisitions and organic loan growth, particularly within the commercial and residential mortgage portfolios, higher average investment securities of $662.5 million and higher average overnight investments of $327.6 million . The yield on interest-earning assets decreased by 18 basis points to 3.88 % when compared to the first quarter of 2019 . The yield on loans and leases decreased to 4.46 %, or by 13 basis points, primarily due to lower yields on commercial and home equity loans mostly due to downward rate resets on variable rate loans and lower rates on originations. The yield on overnight investments and investment securities decreased by 106 basis points and 22 basis points, respectively. The yield decrease on overnight investments was primarily due to a lower federal funds rate, while lower yields on government agency and mortgage-backed securities were the primary reasons for the investment securities yield decline. 

Average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $3.50 billion to $23.15 billion , compared to the first quarter of 2019 . This increase was primarily due to an increase in average interest-bearing deposit balances of $2.79 billion driven by contributions from recent acquisitions and organic deposit growth, as well as an increase in average long-term borrowings of $616.9 million due to due to sub debt issuance and higher other borrowings in the quarter. 

Rates on interest-bearing liabilities increased by 20 basis points to 0.54 %, primarily due to increased rates paid on time deposits and money market accounts. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

BancShares recorded net provision expense of $28.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to $11.8 million , for the same period in 2019. The increase in the current period was primarily due to conditions related to COVID-19 and the potential impact on BancShares&#8217; portfolio loan losses. Loss estimates consider the potential impact of slower economic activity and increasing unemployment, as well as potential mitigating effects from the government stimulus and loan modification programs. The increase in provision was mostly related to commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate.

Noninterest income is an essential component of our total revenue and is critical to our ability to sustain adequate profitability levels. The primary sources of noninterest income consist of fees and service charges generated from deposit accounts, cardholder and merchant services, wealth management services, and mortgage lending and servicing. 

Noninterest income for the first quarter of 2020 was $64.0 million , compared to $103.7 million for the same period of 2019 , a decrease of $39.7 million , or 38.3% . The most significant components of the change were as follows: 

&#8226; 

A decline in the market value of our equity securities portfolio resulted in a $62.7 million reduction in noninterest income. 

&#8226; 

Realized gains on investment securities available for sale were $19.8 million for the first quarter of 2020, while no gains were recognized in the first quarter of 2019. 

&#8226; 

Mortgage income increased by $1.6 million primarily due to favorable interest rate movements and increased origination volume. Noninterest income related to increased production was partially offset by a mortgage servicing rights impairment of $3.0 million recorded due to declining mortgage rates and an expected increase in prepayment activity. 

&#8226; 

Cardholder services increased by $1.5 million primarily due to volume increases and higher fee income. 

&#8226; 

Wealth management services increased by $1.4 million primarily due to an increase in average managed assets.

The primary components of noninterest expense are salaries and related employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expense. 

Noninterest expense was $300.0 million during the first quarter of 2020 , compared to $267.7 million for the same period in 2019 , an increase of $32.3 million , or 12.1% . The most significant components of the change were as follows: 

&#8226; 

Personnel expense increased $18.8 million primarily due to an increase in salaries and wages as a result of net staff additions, including personnel from acquisitions (impact of $5.8 million), and merit increases. 

&#8226; 

Other noninterest expense increased by $4.0 million primarily due to an increase in pension costs. 

&#8226; 

Processing fees paid to third parties increased $3.3 million primarily due to the expansion of digital banking offerings. 

&#8226; 

Merger-related expenses increased by $2.5 million due to an increase in acquisition activity, particularly related to the acquisitions of Entegra and Community Financial. 

&#8226; 

Equipment expense increased by $1.1 million primarily due to higher depreciation on hardware and software additions. 

Income Taxes 

Income tax expense was $16.9 million and $33.4 million for the first quarter of 2020 and first quarter of 2019 , respectively, representing effective tax rates of 22.8% and 23.1% during the periods. 

We monitor and evaluate the potential impact of current events on the estimates used to establish income tax expenses and income tax liabilities. On a periodic basis, we evaluate our income tax positions based on current tax law, positions taken by various tax auditors within the jurisdictions where BancShares is required to file income tax returns, as well as potential or pending audits or assessments by tax auditors. 

INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS 

Interest-earning assets include investment securities, loans and leases, and overnight investments, all of which reflect varying interest rates based on the risk level and repricing characteristics of the underlying asset. Riskier investments typically carry a higher interest rate but expose us to higher levels of market risk. We strive to maintain a high level of interest-earning assets relative to total assets, while keeping non-earning assets at a minimum. 

Interest-earning assets totaled $38.85 billion and $37.23 billion at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. The $1.62 billion increase was primarily composed of a $1.67 billion increase in investment securities and a $359.5 million increase in loans and leases, partially offset by a $419.3 million decrease in overnight investments. 

Investment Securities 

The primary objective of the investment portfolio is to generate incremental income by deploying excess funds into securities with minimal liquidity and credit risk, and low to moderate interest rate risk. Other objectives include acting as a stable source of liquidity, serving as a tool for asset and liability management and maintaining an interest rate risk profile compatible with BancShares&#8217; objectives. Additionally, purchases of equities and corporate bonds in other financial institutions have been made largely under a long-term earnings optimization strategy. Changes in the total balance of our investment portfolio result from trends in balance sheet funding and market performance. Generally, when inflows arising from deposit and treasury services products exceed loan and lease demand, we invest excess funds into the securities portfolio and into overnight investments. Conversely, when loan demand exceeds growth in deposits and short-term borrowings, we allow overnight investments to decline and use proceeds from maturing securities and prepayments to fund loan demand. See Note C - Investments for additional disclosures. 

The fair value of investment securities totaled $8.85 billion at March 31, 2020 , an increase of $1.67 billion compared to December 31, 2019 . The increase in the portfolio was primarily attributable to investment securities purchases of $5.32 billion , partially offset by sales of $3.16 billion and maturities/paydowns of $587.1 million . 

As of March 31, 2020 , investment securities available for sale had a net pre-tax unrealized gain of $132.6 million , compared to a net pre-tax unrealized gain of $7.5 million as of December 31, 2019 . After evaluating the available for sale securities with unrealized losses, management concluded that the unrealized losses relate to changes in interest rates relative to when the securities were purchased, and therefore, no allowance for credit losses was needed at March 31, 2020 . Available for sale securities are reported at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;), net of deferred taxes. 

As part of the adoption of ASC 326, BancShares evaluated its portfolios of held to maturity and available for sale debt securities to determine the need to record a related allowance for credit losses. See Note A - Accounting Policies and Basis for Presentation for more detail on our policies and adoption. As of March 31, 2020 and January 1, 2020, no allowance for credit losses was required for available for sale and held to maturity debt securities

Loans and Leases 

Loans and leases were $29.24 billion at March 31, 2020 , a net increase of $359.5 million , representing annualized growth of 5.0% since December 31, 2019 . This increase was driven by a $357.8 million net increase in the non-PCD portfolio as well as a $1.6 million net increase in the PCD loan portfolio. The net increase in the non-PCD portfolio was due to organic growth primarily in our commercial segments as well as $111.1 million in loans acquired from Community Financial. The net increase in PCD loans was primarily due to $24.2 million in loans from Community Financial as well as the adoption of ASC 326 resulting in a $19.0 million increase, partially offset by a $22.5 million decrease in loans from prior acquisitions. Excluding 2020 acquired loans, total loans grew by 3.1% on an annualized basis. 

BancShares reports non-PCD and PCD loan portfolios separately, and the non-PCD portfolio is further divided into commercial and consumer segments. Non-PCD loans and leases at March 31, 2020 were $28.68 billion compared to non-PCI loans of $28.32 billion at December 31, 2019 , representing 98.1% of total loans at both period ends. PCD loans at March 31, 2020 were $560.4 million , compared to $558.7 million of PCI loans at December 31, 2019 , representing 1.9% of loans at both period ends. 

The discount related to acquired non-PCD loans and leases at March 31, 2020 and PCI loans and leases at December 31, 2019 was $28.3 million and $30.9 million , respectively. The discount related to PCD loans at March 31, 2020 and PCI loans and leases at December 31, 2019 was $61.6 million and $88.2 million , respectively. The primary driver of the decrease in PCD discount is the adoption of ASC 326, which resulted in a reclassification of the credit portion of the loan discount to the ACL of $19.0 million. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 , accretion income on purchased non-PCD loans and leases was $2.5 million and $3.2 million , respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 , interest and accretion income on purchased PCD loans and leases was $18.5 million and $17.8 million, respectively.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 

The ACL was $209.3 million at March 31, 2020 , representing a decrease of $19.5 million since December 31, 2019 . The ACL as a percentage of total loans and leases was 0.72% at March 31, 2020 , compared to 0.85% December 31, 2019 . 

Upon adoption of ASC 326, BancShares recorded a net decrease of $37.9 million in the ACL which included a decrease of $56.9 million in the ACL on non-PCD loans, partially offset by an increase of $19.0 million in the ACL on PCD loans. The decrease in the ACL on non-PCD loans was primarily in the commercial segments as these portfolios have exhibited strong historical credit performance and have relatively short average lives. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the consumer segments due to their longer average lives. The increase in the ACL on PCD loans was primarily the result of reallocating credit discount from loan balances into ACL. 

The ACL is calculated using a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, charge-off and recovery activity, loan growth, changes in macroeconomic factors, collateral type, estimated loan life and changes in credit quality. For the quarter ended March 31, 2020 the primary reason for the ACL change since the adoption of ASC 326, was a $21.5 million increase due to the potential economic impact of COVID-19 and its estimated impact on credit losses during the quarter. Within our forecast period of 24 months , forecasts varied widely for key macroeconomic variables (unemployment, gross domestic product, home price index, and commercial real estate index) used in the ACL models. Expected loss estimates considered the potential impact of slower economic activity with increasing unemployment, as well as potential mitigating impacts from the government stimulus and loan modification programs. These loss estimates were also influenced by BancShares strong credit quality, historically low net charge-offs and recent credit trends, which remained stable through the quarter ended March 31, 2020. 

At March 31, 2020 , the ACL allocated to non-PCD loans and leases was $182.3 million , or 0.64% of non-PCD loans and leases, compared to $217.6 million , or 0.77% , at December 31, 2019 . The decrease of 13 basis points since December 31, 2019 was primarily due to the adoption of ASC 326, partially offset by the forecasted potential economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on expected credit losses. 

At March 31, 2020 , the ACL for PCD loans totaled $26.9 million compared to $7.5 million at December 31, 2019 . The increase was primarily due the adoption of ASC 326. 

Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $7.5 million during the first quarter of 2020 , compared to $6.7 million during the first quarter of 2019 . On an annualized basis, total net charge-offs as a percentage of total average loans and leases was 0.10% and 0.11% for the first quarter of 2020 and 2019 , respectively.

The reserve for unfunded loan commitments was $10.5 million and $1.1 million at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. The increase in the reserve was primarily due to increases in the scope of off-balance sheet exposures considered in this estimate due to the provisions of ASC 326.

NONPERFORMING ASSETS 

Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and leases and other real estate owned (&#8220;OREO&#8221;). At March 31, 2020 , BancShares&#8217; nonperforming assets totaled $230.3 million , an increase of $79.1 million since December 31, 2019 . 

Nonaccrual loans and leases at March 31, 2020 were $174.6 million , reflecting an increase of $52.9 million since December 31, 2019 . The increase was primarily due to the dissolution of PCI loan pools under the adoption of ASC 326 as those nonaccrual loans within performing PCI pools were previously excluded from reporting. As of January 1, 2020, there were $47.0 million of nonaccrual loans released from performing PCI pools, including $24.2 million of loans that were greater than 90 days past due. The credit quality of the portfolio remains in line with our risk tolerances and management has not identified material increases in portfolio risk. At March 31, 2020 , OREO totaled $55.7 million , representing an increase of $9.1 million since December 31, 2019 primarily due to additions from Community Financial of $9.8 million . The additional PCI nonaccrual loans and acquired OREO resulted in an increase of 18 basis points to the nonperforming assets ratio at March 31, 2020 .

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (&#8220;TDR&#8221;) 

We selectively agree to modify existing loan terms to provide relief to customers who are experiencing financial difficulties or other circumstances that could affect their ability to meet debt obligations. Typical modifications include short-term deferral of interest or modification of payment terms. TDRs not accruing interest at the time of restructure are included as nonperforming loans. TDRs accruing at the time of restructure and continuing to perform based on the restructured terms are considered performing loans.

Recent legislation and regulatory requirements have allowed for relief on determination of TDRs for new loan modifications and forbearances for borrowers experiencing COVID-19-related financial difficulty on loans that were current as of December 31, 2019. BancShares has elected to adopt this guidance and did not identify new TDRs as a result of COVID-19-related modifications beginning in March 31, 2020 for borrowers that were current at the time of requested modification. 

INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES 

Interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, securities sold under customer repurchase agreements, FHLB borrowings, subordinated debentures, and other borrowings. Interest-bearing liabilities totaled $23.60 billion at March 31, 2020 , compared to $22.83 billion at December 31, 2019 . The $769.2 million increase was due to an increase in total borrowings of $615.6 million and an increase in interest-bearing deposits of $153.5 million. 

Deposits 

Due to our focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position, core deposit retention remains a key business objective. We believe traditional bank deposit products remain an attractive option for many customers but, as economic conditions improve, we recognize that our liquidity position could be adversely affected as bank deposits are withdrawn and invested elsewhere. Our ability to fund future loan growth is significantly dependent on our success at retaining existing deposits and generating new deposits at a reasonable cost. 

At March 31, 2020 , total deposits were $35.35 billion , an increase of $915.5 million , representing annualized growth of 10.7% since December 31, 2019 . Excluding acquired deposits totaling $218.0 million , deposits increased $697.5 million , or by 8.1% annualized, over the same time period. This organic growth was primarily the result of increases in demand and money market accounts partially offset by a decline in time deposits.

Borrowings 

At March 31, 2020 , total borrowings were $1.94 billion compared to $1.33 billion at December 31, 2019 . The $615.6 million increase was primarily due to a subordinated debt issuance of $340.7 million in the first quarter of 2020, an increase in FHLB borrowings of $220.5 million and an increase in securities sold under customer repurchase agreements of $97.4 million , partially offset by a decrease in other borrowings of $43.0 million .

Subordinated debentures included junior subordinated debentures representing obligations to the Trusts, which may be redeemed at par in whole or in part at any time. BancShares has guaranteed all obligations of the Trusts. 

SHAREHOLDERS&#8217; EQUITY AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY 

On March 4, 2020, BancShares completed its public offering of $350 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.375% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2030. On March 12, 2020, BancShares issued and sold an aggregate of 13,800,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of 5.375% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, par value $0.01 per share, with a liquidation preference of $25 per Depositary Share (equivalent to $1,000 per share of Series A Preferred Stock) for a total of $345 million. 

The capital raise provides liquidity for general corporate purposes, which may include, but is not limited to, providing capital to support our growth organically or through strategic acquisitions, financing investments and capital expenditures, for funding investments in FCB as regulatory capital, and redeeming or repurchasing our common stock. 

During the first quarter of 2020, BancShares repurchased 349,390 shares of Class A common stock for $159.7 million at an average cost per share of $457.05 . During the three months ended March 31, 2019 , BancShares repurchased a total of 243,000 shares of Class A common stock for $100.7 million at an average cost per share of $414.58 . All Class A common stock repurchases completed in 2019 and 2018 were consummated under previously approved authorizations. 

Subsequent to quarter-end through April 30, 2020 , BancShares repurchased an additional 111,700 shares of Class A common stock for $37.3 million at an average cost per share of $333.71 . 

On April 28, 2020, the Board authorized share repurchases of up to 500,000 of BancShares&#8217; Class A common stock for the period May 1, 2020 through July 31, 2020. This authority will supersede all previously approved authorities.

We are committed to effectively managing our capital to protect our depositors, creditors and shareholders. We continually monitor the capital levels and ratios for BancShares and FCB to ensure they exceed the minimum requirements imposed by regulatory authorities and to ensure they are appropriate given growth projections, risk profile and potential changes in the regulatory or external environment. Failure to meet certain capital requirements may result in actions by regulatory agencies that could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;), the unrealized gains and losses on certain assets and liabilities, net of deferred taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders&#8217; equity. These amounts are excluded from shareholders&#8217; equity in the calculation of our capital ratios under current regulatory guidelines.

As of March 31, 2020 , BancShares and FCB continued to exceed minimum capital standards and remained well-capitalized under Basel III guidelines. Trust preferred capital securities continue to be a component of total risk-based capital. 

BancShares and FCB had capital conservation buffers of 5.65% and 5.20% , respectively, at March 31, 2020 , which exceeded the 2.50% requirement and, therefore, result in no limit on distributions. 

RISK MANAGEMENT 

Risk is inherent in any business. BancShares has defined a moderate risk appetite, a conservative approach to risk taking, with a philosophy that does not preclude higher risk business activities balanced with acceptable returns while meeting regulatory objectives. Through the comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management Framework and Risk Appetite Framework, senior management has primary responsibility for day-to-day management of the risks we face with accountability of and support from all associates. Senior management applies various strategies to reduce the risks to which BancShares activities may be exposed, with effective challenge and oversight by management committees. In addition, the Board of Directors strives to ensure that the business culture is integrated with the enterprise risk management program and that policies, procedures and metrics for identifying, assessing, measuring, monitoring and managing risk are part of the decision-making process. The Board of Directors&#8217; role in risk oversight is an integral part of our overall Enterprise Risk Management Framework and Risk Appetite Framework. The Board of Directors administers its risk oversight function primarily through the Board Risk Committee. 

The Board Risk Committee structure is designed to allow for information flow, effective challenge and timely escalation of risk-related issues. The Board Risk Committee is directed to monitor and advise the Board of Directors regarding risk exposures, including credit, market, capital, liquidity, operational, compliance, strategic and reputational risks; review, approve, and monitor adherence to the risk appetite and supporting risk tolerance levels via a series of established metrics; and evaluate, monitor and oversee the adequacy and effectiveness of the Risk Management Framework and Risk Appetite Framework. The Board Risk Committee also reviews: reports of examination by and communications from regulatory agencies; the results of internal and third party testing and qualitative and quantitative assessments related to risk management; and any other matters within the scope of the Committee&#8217;s oversight responsibilities. The Board Risk Committee monitors management&#8217;s response to certain risk-related regulatory and audit issues. In addition, the Board Risk Committee may coordinate with the Audit Committee and the Compensation, Nominations and Governance Committee for the review of financial statements and related risks, information security and other areas of joint responsibility. 

In combination with other risk management and monitoring practices, enterprise-wide stress testing activities are part of the Risk Management Framework and conducted within a defined framework. Stress tests are performed for various risks to ensure the financial institution can support continued operations during stressed periods. 

In response to COVID-19, BancShares assembled a cross-functional leadership team to identify and manage newly identified risks and provide effective risk oversight through this pandemic. New or elevated risks have been identified in multiple areas, including but not limited to, operational risk, credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, capital adequacy risk, compliance risk, and financial reporting risk. As such, we have incorporated changes to Item 1A. Risk Factors within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to capture these changes. These new or increased areas of risk are being actively managed by senior leadership, and have been incorporated into reporting for key management committees and regular updates are being provided to the Board of Directors. 

Credit risk management 

Credit risk is the risk of not collecting payments pursuant to the contractual terms of loans, leases and certain investment securities. Loans and leases we originate are underwritten in accordance with our credit policies and procedures and are subject to periodic ongoing reviews. Acquired loans, regardless of whether PCD or non-PCD, are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date and are subject to periodic reviews to identify any further credit deterioration. Our independent credit review function conducts risk reviews and analyses of both originated and acquired loans to ensure compliance with credit policies and to monitor asset quality trends and borrower financial strength. These reviews include portfolio analysis by geographic location, industry, collateral type and product. We strive to identify potential problem loans as early as possible, to record charge-offs or write-downs as appropriate and to maintain an adequate ACL that accounts for losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. 

We are actively monitoring our loan portfolio for areas of increased risk as a result of COVID-19. As of May 4, 2020, we have approved or processed loan payment extensions on approximately $6.5 billion in loans (approximately $200 million in deferred payments) for customers in good standing who have been affected by COVID-19. BancShares has a well-diversified loan portfolio, by geography and industry, however, extensions have been concentrated in industries impacted the most by the pandemic, which include our dental and medical portfolios, as well as the hospitality industry. The risk profile is somewhat mitigated as our typical customer&#8217;s dental or medical practice is well established and actively managed. Social distancing requirements had an immediate impact on both of these industries; however, they should also see immediate demand for services once those restrictions are lessened. Through May 4, 2020, we have not seen significant shifts in credit line utilization or overall declines in credit quality. BancShares continues to have solid credit performance that has matched or exceeded its peer group. 

Additionally, we are participating in the SBA-PPP program, which will provide much needed funds to our existing small business customers and continue to assess both the credit and operational risks this program presents. We processed approximately 5,000 SBA-PPP loan applications, securing funding for our customers of approximately $1.8 billion, during the initial round of funding for this program. As of May 4, 2020, we have processed approximately 18,000 additional loan applications for the second phase of this program, representing additional funding of approximately $1.6 billion. 

Our ACL estimate for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 included extensive reviews of the changes in credit risk associated with the loan portfolio and uncertainties around economic forecasts and the overall economic impact of COVID-19. Expected loss estimates within each portfolio considered the potential impact of slower economic activity with increasing unemployment, as well as potential mitigating impacts from the government stimulus and loan modification programs. These loss estimates additionally considered BancShares historically strong credit quality and actual net losses incurred during prior periods of economic stress, as well as recent credit trends, which have not seen deterioration from COVID-19 as of March 31, 2020. 

Interest rate risk management 

Interest rate risk (&#8220;IRR&#8221;) results principally from: assets and liabilities maturing or repricing at different points in time, assets and liabilities repricing at the same point in time but in different amounts, and short-term and long-term interest rates changing in different magnitudes. 

We assess our short-term IRR by forecasting net interest income over 24 months under various interest rate scenarios and comparing those results to forecasted net interest income, assuming stable rates. IRR scenarios modeled, include, but are not limited to, immediate, parallel rate shocks, interest rate ramps, changes in the shape of the yield curve and changes in the relationships of our rates to market rates. Market interest rates declined significantly from year-end driven by economic uncertainty brought on by COVID-19. Net interest income deterioration in down rate shocks will remain muted due to the low absolute value of market interest rates. Assumptions that incorporate customer migration from low rate deposit instruments to intermediate term fixed rate instruments as rates rise have been adjusted based on actual deposit behavior over the last 3 years during a rising rate cycle. 

Table 16 provides the impact on net interest income over 24 months resulting from various instantaneous interest rate shock scenarios as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 .

Net interest income sensitivity metrics at March 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 were primarily affected by a reduction in both the number of offerings and promotional rates paid on time deposits. Additionally, as market interest rates have fallen in 2020, prepayment speeds have increased leading to an increase in loan interest income under positive rate shocks. 

Long-term interest rate risk exposure is measured using the economic value of equity (&#8220;EVE&#8221;) sensitivity analysis to study the impact of long-term cash flows on earnings and capital. EVE represents the difference between the sum of the present value of all asset cash flows and the sum of the present value of the liability cash flows. EVE sensitivity analysis involves discounting cash flows of balance sheet items under different interest rate scenarios. Cash flows will vary by interest rate scenario, resulting in variations in EVE. The base-case measurement and its sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve allow management to measure longer-term repricing and option risk in the balance sheet. 

Table 17 table presents the EVE profile as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 .

The economic value of equity metrics at March 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 were primarily affected by strong growth in non-interest demand deposits coupled with adjustments to assumptions related to customer migration. 

We do not typically utilize interest rate swaps, floors, collars or other derivative financial instruments to hedge our overall balance sheet interest rate sensitivity and risk. 

Liquidity risk management 

Liquidity risk is the risk that an institution will be unable to generate or obtain sufficient cash or its equivalents on a cost-effective basis to meet commitments as they fall due. The most common sources of liquidity risk arise from mismatches in the timing and value of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet cash inflows and outflows. In general, on-balance sheet mismatches generate liquidity risk when the effective maturity of assets exceeds the effective maturity of liabilities. A commonly cited example of a balance sheet liquidity mismatch is when long-term loans (assets) are funded with short-term borrowings (liabilities). Other forms of liquidity risk include market constraints on the ability to convert assets into cash at expected levels, an inability to access funding sources at sufficient levels at a reasonable cost, and changes in economic conditions or exposure to credit, market, operational, legal and reputation risks that can affect an institution&#8217;s liquidity risk profile. 

We utilize various limit-based measures to monitor, measure and control three different categories of liquidity risk: 

&#8226; 

Tactical - Measures the risk of a negative cash flow position whereby cash outflows exceed cash inflows over a short-term horizon out to nine weeks; 

&#8226; 

Structural - Measures the amount by which illiquid assets are supported by long-term funding; and 

&#8226; 

Contingent - Measures the risk of having insufficient liquidity sources to support cash needs under potential future stressed market conditions or having an inability to access wholesale funding sources in a timely and cost effective manner. 

We aim to maintain a diverse mix of liquidity sources to support the liquidity management function, while aiming to avoid funding concentrations by diversifying our external funding with respect to maturities, counterparties and nature. Our primary source of liquidity is our retail deposit book due to the generally stable balances and low cost it offers. Additional sources include cash in excess of our reserve requirement at the Federal Reserve Bank, and various other corresponding bank accounts and unencumbered securities, which totaled $5.45 billion at March 31, 2020 compared to $3.57 billion at December 31, 2019 . Another source of available funds was advances from the FHLB of Atlanta and Chicago. Outstanding FHLB advances were $792.7 million as of March 31, 2020 , and we had sufficient collateral pledged to secure $7.43 billion of additional borrowings from the FHLB of Atlanta. Also, at March 31, 2020 , $3.88 billion in non-PCD loans with a lendable collateral value of $3.15 billion were used to create additional borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank. We also maintain Federal Funds lines and other credit lines, which had $623.0 million of available capacity at March 31, 2020 . 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

Except as described below, there have been no significant changes in our Critical Accounting Estimates as described in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10&#8209;K. 

Allowance for credit losses - The allowance for credit losses on loans and leases replaces the allowance for loan and leases losses as a critical accounting estimate, as of January 1, 2020 with the adoption of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . 

The allowance for credit losses represents management&#8217;s best estimate of current expected credit losses over the life of the portfolio of loan and leases. Estimating credit losses requires judgment in determining loan specific attributes impacting the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay contractual obligations. Other factors such as economic forecasts used to determine a reasonable and supportable forecast, prepayment assumptions, the value of underlying collateral, and changes in size composition and risks within the portfolio are also considered. 

The allowance for credit losses is assessed at each balance sheet date and adjustments are recorded in the provision for credit losses. The allowance is estimated based on loan level characteristics using historical loss rates, a reasonable and supportable economic forecast with reversion to historical assumptions. Loan losses are estimated using the fair value of collateral for collateral-dependent loans, or when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty such that repayment of the loan is expected to be made through the operation or sale of the collateral. Loan balances considered uncollectible are charged-off against the ACL. Recoveries of amounts previously charged-off are credited to the ACL. 

PCD assets represent assets that are acquired with evidence of more than insignificant credit quality deterioration since origination at the acquisition date. At acquisition, the allowance for credit losses on PCD assets is booked directly the ACL. Any subsequent changes in the ACL on PCD assets is recorded through the provision for credit losses. 

Management believes that the ACL is adequate to absorb the expected life of loan credit losses on the portfolio of loans and leases as of the balance sheet date. Actual losses incurred may differ materially from our estimates. Particularly, the impact of COVID-19 on both borrower credit and the greater macroeconomic environment is uncertain and changes in the duration, spread and severity of the virus will affect our loss experience.
