 Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Management&#8217;s discussion and analysis (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;) of earnings and related financial data is presented to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of First Citizens BancShares, Inc. (the &#8220;Parent Company&#8221; and, when including all of its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; or &#8220;BancShares&#8221;) and its banking subsidiary, First-Citizens Bank &#38; Trust Company (&#8220;FCB&#8221;). Unless otherwise noted, the terms &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; and &#8220;BancShares&#8221; in this section refer to the consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations for BancShares. 

This MD&#38;A is expected to provide our investors with a view of BancShares&#8217; financial condition and results of operations from our management&#8217;s perspective. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes presented within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q along with our financial statements and related MD&#38;A of financial condition and results of operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 (the &#8220;2021 Form 10-K&#8221;). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Although certain amounts for prior years have been reclassified to conform to statement presentations for 2022, the reclassifications had no effect on stockholders&#8217; equity or net income as previously reported. 

Throughout this MD&#38;A we reference specific "Notes" to our financial statements. These are Notes to the consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements. 

Management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in its analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of BancShares. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measurements" for a reconciliation of these financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with GAAP. 

On January 3, 2022, BancShares completed its largest acquisition to date with the merger with CIT Group Inc. (&#8220;CIT&#8221;) and its subsidiary CIT Bank, N.A., a national banking association (&#8220;CIT Bank&#8221;), pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;) (such acquisition, the &#8220;CIT Merger&#8221;). CIT had consolidated total assets of approximately $53.2 billion as of December 31, 2021. The CIT Merger is described further below and in Note 2 &#8212; Business Combinations. Financial data for periods prior to the CIT Merger does not include any CIT related data, and therefore is not directly comparable to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. 

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 

The Parent Company is a bank holding company ("BHC") and Financial Holding Company (&#8220;FHC&#8221;). BancShares is regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System under the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. BancShares is also registered under the BHC laws of North Carolina and is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks (&#8220;NCCOB&#8221;). BancShares conducts its banking operations through its wholly-owned subsidiary FCB, a state-chartered bank organized under the laws of the state of North Carolina. FCB is regulated by the NCCOB. In addition, FCB, as an insured depository institution, is supervised by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;). 

BancShares&#8217; earnings and cash flows are primarily derived from its commercial and retail banking activities. Changes in interest rates, credit quality, economic trends and the capital markets are primary factors that drive the performance of BancShares. We expanded our products and services with the CIT Merger, and now have leased assets, primarily rail-related, and offer factoring services. We gather deposits from retail and commercial customers and also secure funding through various non-deposit sources. We invest the liquidity generated from these funding sources in interest-earning assets, including loans and leases, investment securities and interest-earning deposits at banks. We also invest in bank premises, hardware, software, furniture and equipment used to conduct our commercial and retail banking business. We provide treasury services products, cardholder and merchant services, wealth management services and various other products and services typically offered by banks. The fees and service charges generated from these products and services are primary sources of noninterest income, which is an essential component of our total revenue. 

We are focused on expanding our position in legacy and target markets through organic growth and strategic acquisitions. We believe our franchise is positioned for continued growth as a result of our client centric banking principles, disciplined lending standards, and our people. 

Refer to our 2021 Form 10-K for further discussion of our strategy. 

Significant Events in 2022 

CIT Merger 

As discussed in detail in Note 2 &#8212; Business Combinations, the CIT Merger closed on January 3, 2022. 

Significant items related to the CIT Merger are as follows: 

&#8226; The fair value of total assets acquired was $53.8 billion, which mainly consisted of approximately $32.7 billion of loans, $7.8 billion of operating lease equipment and approximately $6.6 billion of investment securities. Loans consisted of commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans and finance leases, which are included in our Commercial Banking segment, and consumer loans (primarily residential mortgages), which are in our General Banking segment, as further discussed below. Acquired rail assets were mostly operating lease equipment and reported in the new Rail segment. 

&#8226; The fair value of deposits acquired was $39.4 billion that included deposits derived from online banking and Home Owner&#8217;s Association (&#8220;HOA&#8221;) deposits related to Community Association Banking (&#8220;CAB&#8221;), and commercial deposits. The transaction also included approximately 80 bank branches, about 60 of which were in Southern California and the remaining primarily in the Southwest, Midwest and Southeast. 

&#8226; FCB assumed certain issued and outstanding series of CIT debt securities with a fair value of $4.5 billion in connection with the CIT Merger. On February 24, 2022, BancShares redeemed approximately $2.9 billion of senior unsecured notes that were assumed in the CIT Merger as part of a liability management transaction. 

&#8226; FCB recorded a preliminary gain on acquisition of $431 million, representing the excess of the net assets acquired over the purchase price, and recorded a $143 million core deposit intangible and a $52 million intangible liability f or net below market lessor lease contract rental rates related to the rail portfolio. 

Share Repurchase Program 

On July 26, 2022, our Board of Directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) authorized a share repurchase program for up to 1,500,000 shares of BancShares&#8217; Class A Common Stock for the period commencing August 1, 2022 through July 28, 2023. Under the authorized share repurchase program, shares of Class A Common Stock were authorized to be repurchased from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including through a Rule 10b5-1 plan. During the three months ended September 30, 2022, we purchased 1,027,414 shares of Class A Common Stock, and subsequent to September 30, 2022, we purchased an additional 472,586 shares of Class A Common Stock, thereby completing the share repurchase program. See Part II, Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details on these purchases. 

Segment Updates 

As of December 31, 2021, BancShares managed its business and reported its financial results as a single segment. BancShares began reporting multiple segments during the first quarter of 2022. BancShares now has three operating segments: General Banking, Commercial Banking, and Rail, and a non-operating segment, Corporate. BancShares conformed the comparative prior periods presented to reflect the new segments. The substantial majority of BancShares&#8217; operations for historical periods prior to completion of the CIT Merger are included in the General Banking segment. The Commercial Banking and Rail segments primarily relate to operations acquired in the CIT Merger. 

Information about our segments is included in Note 22 &#8212; Business Segment Information and in the section entitled &#8220;Results by Business Segments&#8221; later in this MD&#38;A. 

Financial Performance Summary 

The following table summarizes the BancShares&#8217; results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, unless otherwise noted. Refer to the section entitled &#8220;Non-GAAP Financial Measurements&#8221; at the end of this MD&#38;A for a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 

Additionally, due to the CIT Merger, current quarter and year-to-date activity and ending and average balances are not comparable to the 2021 periods. Beginning with the second quarter of 2022, we presented a linked quarter comparison in the discussions of our consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial position, as permitted by applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. We believe this provides relevant information to our investors relating to our performance due to the inclusion of the CIT Merger in both quarters. Further discussions are included in the remaining sections of this MD&#38;A.

Third Quarter Income Statement Highlights 

For the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022 (&#8220;linked quarter&#8221; comparisons): 

&#8226; Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $315 million, an increase of $60 million, or 23% compared to the linked quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher net interest income, partially offset by higher provision for credit losses and operating expenses. Net income available to common stockholders for the three months ended September 30, 2022 totaled $303 million, an increase of $65 million, or 27% compared to the linked quarter. Net income per diluted common share for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $19.25, an increase of 30% over the linked quarter. 

&#8226; Return on average assets for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was 1.16%, compared to 0.95% for the three months ended June 30, 2022. 

&#8226; Net interest income (&#8220;NII&#8221;) for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $795 million, an increase of $95 million, or 13% compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022. This was primarily due to loan growth, higher yields on loans and overnight investments, and higher purchase accounting accretion, partially offset by higher costs on interest-bearing deposits and borrowings. The net interest margin (&#8220;NIM&#8221;) for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was 3.40%, an increase of 36 bps from 3.04% for the three months ended June 30, 2022, reflecting the rising interest rate environment that increased yields on our earning assets, partially offset by a higher rate paid on interest-bearing deposits and borrowings. 

&#8226; Provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $60 million compared to a provision of $42 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. The increase reflects moderate deterioration in the macroeconomic forecast used in the CECL forecasting process and loan portfolio growth, partially offset by benefits from improved credit quality and portfolio mix. The net charge-off ratio for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was 0.10%, down from 0.13% for the three months ended June 30, 2022. 

&#8226; Noninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $433 million, compared to $424 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. The increase included higher rental income on operating lease equipment, higher capital markets fees revenue, and various other miscellaneous income items, partially offset by lower service charges on deposit accounts. 

&#8226; Noninterest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $760 million, compared to $745 million in the three months ended June 30, 2022. The increase of $15 million primarily reflects higher personnel costs and higher marketing expenses due to digital marketing efforts, partially offset by lower FDIC insurance expense and professional fees. 

&#8226; Select items in the current and linked quarters include: 

&#8226; For the three months ended September 30, 2022: 

&#8226; A settlement gain related to returned equipment in other non-interest income of $5 million. 

&#8226; Impairment charge in noninterest expense of $5 million related to the closure of an office facility. 

&#8226; CIT Merger-related expenses of $33 million in noninterest expense. 

&#8226; For the three months ended June 30, 2022: 

&#8226; Gain on sale of corporate aircraft acquired in the CIT Merger of $6 million in other noninterest income. 

&#8226; CIT Merger-related expenses of $34 million in noninterest expense. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021: 

&#8226; Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $315 million, an increase of $191 million, or 154% compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021. Net income available to common stockholders for the three months ended September 30, 2022 totaled $303 million, an increase of $184 million, or 154% compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021. Net income per diluted common share for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $19.25, an increase of 58% over the three months ended September 30, 2021. 

&#8226; Select items for the three months ended September 30, 2022 are mentioned above. 

&#8226; Return on average assets for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was 1.16%, compared to 0.88% in the same quarter in 2021. 

&#8226; NII was $795 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, an increase of $448 million, or 129% compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021. This was primarily due to the CIT Merger, as well as subsequent loan growth and rising interest rates, partially offset by a decline in interest income on SBA-PPP loans. NIM was 3.40% for the three months ended September 30, 2022, an increase of 79 bps from 2.61% for the three months ended September 30, 2021, reflecting higher interest rate environment and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the CIT Merger. 

&#8226; Provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $60 million, compared to a benefit of $1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021, primarily due to the CIT Merger, as well as moderate deterioration in the macroeconomic forecast used in the CECL forecasting process and loan growth, compared to a reserve release in the third quarter of 2021. The net charge-off ratio for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was 0.10%, up from 0.06% for the three months ended September 30, 2021. 

&#8226; Noninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $433 million, compared to $124 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The largest component of the increase was rental income on operating leases totaling $219 million. The remaining increase was driven primarily by the added activity due to the CIT Merger. 

&#8226; Noninterest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $760 million, compared to $314 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The increase is associated with higher expenses for the combined company, led by higher salaries and benefit costs of $157 million due to the increase in employees and certain new costs, such as $139 million of depreciation and maintenance costs associated with the operating lease portfolio. 

Year to Date Income Statement Highlights 

&#8226; Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $841 million, an increase of $417 million, or 98% compared to the same period in 2021. Net income available to common stockholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 totaled $805 million, an increase of $395 million, or 96% compared to the same period in 2021. Net income per diluted common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $50.70, an increase 21% over the same period in 2021. The increases are primarily attributed to the CIT Merger. 

&#8226; Return on average assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was 1.03%, compared to 1.05% in the same period in 2021. 

&#8226; NII for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $2,144 million, an increase of $1,111 million, or 108% compared to the same period in 2021. This was primarily due to the CIT Merger, as well as loan growth and a higher interest rate environment, partially offset by a decline in interest income on SBA-PPP loans. NIM for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was 3.06%, an increase of 37 bps from 2.69% for the same period in 2021. 

&#8226; Provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $566 million, compared to a benefit of $32 million for the same period in 2021. The provision in 2022 included the day 2 CECL provision of $513 million, and reflects the CIT Merger, as well as moderate deterioration in the macroeconomic forecast used in the CECL forecasting process and loan growth. The net charge-off ratio for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was 0.11%, up from 0.04% for the same period in 2021. 

&#8226; Noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $1,707 million, compared to $394 million for the same period in 2021. The nine months ended September 30, 2022 includes a preliminary gain on acquisition of $431 million and rental income on operating leases of $640 million. The remaining increase was primarily driven by the added activity due to the CIT Merger. 

&#8226; Noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $2,315 million, compared to $911 million for the same period in 2021. The increase is primarily associated with the CIT Merger, including higher salaries and benefit costs of $478 million due to the increase in employees, $399 million of depreciation and maintenance costs associated with the operating lease portfolio and higher merger-related costs of $182 million. 

&#8226; Select items for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 are as follows: 

&#8226; Current expected credit losses (&#8220;CECL&#8221;) day 2 provision for loans and leases and unfunded commitments of $513 million. 

&#8226; Preliminary gain on acquisition of $431 million in noninterest income, representing the excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the purchase price. 

&#8226; Gain on sale of corporate aircraft acquired in the CIT Merger of $6 million in other noninterest income. 

&#8226; Gain on debt redemptions in noninterest income of $6 million from $2.9 billion of borrowings assumed in the CIT Merger. 

&#8226; Merger-related expenses of $202 million in noninterest expenses. 

&#8226; A reduction in other noninterest expense of $27 million related to the termination of certain legacy CIT retiree benefits, reflecting amounts previously accrued. 

Balance Sheet Highlights 

&#8226; Total loans and leases at September 30, 2022 were $69.8 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion or 12.0% annualized, from June 30, 2022. We continued to see growth in our branch network, as well as growth in our commercial bank from a number of our industry verticals, such as healthcare and technology, and small business lending, and growth in both commercial mortgage loans and consumer mortgage loans. Total loans and leases increased $37.4 billion from December 31, 2021, primarily reflecting the addition of $32.7 billion from the CIT Merger. 

&#8226; Total deposits at September 30, 2022 were $87.6 billion, a decrease of $1.8 billion or 7.9% annualized, from June 30, 2022. Total deposits declined during the second quarter and continued lower in the third quarter, reflecting the most rate sensitive customers moving funds in response to increases in the target federal funds rate. The decline in total deposits as compared to June 30, 2022 was primarily concentrated in acquired branches and commercial banking, partially offset by growth in our Direct Bank. Total deposits increased $36.1 billion from December 31, 2021, reflecting the addition of $39.4 billion from the CIT Merger, partially offset by the noted declines. 

&#8226; At September 30, 2022, BancShares remained well capitalized with a total risk-based capital ratio of 13.46%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital of 11.36%, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.37% and a leverage ratio of 9.31%. 

Recent Economic and Industry Developments 

Throughout 2022, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Federal Open Market Committee (&#8220;FOMC&#8221;) has significantly raised its target for the federal funds rate in an effort to combat rising inflation. The FOMC raised interest rates at its March, May, June, July and September meetings by 25, 50, 75, 75 and 75 basis points, respectively. With the latest increase at the September meeting, the FOMC raised their benchmark federal funds rate to a range between 3.00% - 3.25%. Possible further increases could be made at their remaining meetings in November and December 2022. The FOMC&#8217;s efforts to control inflation has increased concerns over the possibility of a recession within the next twelve months. In addition, geopolitical events, including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and related events, are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity. The timing and impact of inflation, continued volatility in the stock market, rising interest rates and possible recession will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

NET INTEREST INCOME AND NET INTEREST MARGIN 

NII is the difference between interest income earned on assets such as loans, leases, securities and cash, and interest expense incurred on liabilities such as deposits and borrowings and is included as a line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income. NII for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $795 million, up from $700 million in the three months ended June 30, 2022, and up from $347 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. NII for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $2.14 billion, an increase of $1.11 billion, or 108% from $1.03 billion in the same period in 2021. 

NII is affected by changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The following table presents the average balance sheet and related rates, along with disaggregated quarter-over-quarter changes in NII between volume (level of lending, investing or borrowing) and rate (rates charged to customers, received on investments or incurred on borrowings). Volume change is calculated as change in volume times the previous rate, while rate change is calculated as change in rate times the previous volume. The rate/volume change, change in rate times change in volume, is allocated between volume change and rate change at the ratio each component bears to the absolute value of their total. Tax equivalent net interest income was not materially different from NII, therefore we present NII in our analysis.

Third Quarter 2022 compared to Second Quarter 2022 

&#8226; NII for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $795 million, an increase of $95 million compared to the second quarter of 2022. This was primarily due to higher yields on loans and overnight investments, loan growth and higher purchase accounting accretion, partially offset by higher costs on interest-bearing deposit and borrowings. 

&#9702; Interest income earned on loans and leases for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $785 million, an increase of $130 million compared to the second quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher yields and growth in the average loans and leases balance from $65.3 billion in the previous quarter to $67.7 billion in the current quarter. In addition, the third quarter benefited from higher purchase accounting accretion, an increase of $15 million, partially offset by lower SBA PPP income, down $3 million. 

&#9702; Interest income earned on investment securities for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $90 million, an increase of $1 million compared to the second quarter of 2022. The slight increase was primarily due to higher reinvestment rates. 

&#9702; Interest income earned on interest earning deposits at banks for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $31 million, an increase of $18 million, reflecting higher Fed Funds rates that offset the decline in the average balance. 

&#9702; Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $78 million, an increase of $36 million compared to the second quarter of 2022, as higher deposit rates were partially offset by lower balances, with the decline primarily concentrated in higher cost money market accounts. Interest expense on borrowings for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $33 million, an increase of $18 million compared to the second quarter of 2022, driven by higher FHLB borrowings to fund our loan growth. 

&#8226; NIM for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was 3.40%, an increase of 36 bps from the second quarter of 2022, due to the impact of the items noted above, including higher earning asset yields, strong loan growth and higher purchase accounting accretion, partially offset by higher interest-bearing deposit and borrowing costs and higher borrowings. 

&#8226; Average interest-earning assets for the three months ended September 30, 2022 were $92.5 billion. This is an increase from $92.1 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2022, reflecting an increase in average loans and leases presented above of $2.4 billion, which offset a decline in lower yielding average interest-earning cash deposits of $1.9 billion. 

&#8226; Average interest-bearing liabilities for the three months ended September 30, 2022 were $67.2 billion, essentially unchanged from the three months ended June 30, 2022, reflecting higher FHLB borrowings that offset lower deposits. The average rate on interest-bearing liabilities for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was 0.65%. This is an increase of 31 bps compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022, reflecting the higher interest rate environment and shift in funding mix as the declines in interest-bearing deposits were replaced by increased borrowings to fund loan growth. Total deposits had declined during the second quarter and continued lower in the third quarter, reflecting the most rate sensitive customers moving funds in response to increases in the federal funds rate. The decline in total deposits compared to June 30, 2022 was primarily concentrated in acquired branches and commercial banking, partially offset by growth in our Direct Bank. 

Third Quarter 2022 compared to Third Quarter 2021 

&#8226; NII for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $795 million, an increase of $448 million compared to the third quarter of 2021, primarily due to the CIT Merger, as well as subsequent loan growth and rising interest rates, partially offset by a decline in interest income on SBA-PPP loans. 

&#9702; Interest income earned on loans and leases for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $785 million, an increase of $465 million compared to the third quarter of 2021. The increase was primarily due to the addition of $32.7 billion of loans acquired in the CIT Merger, along with organic growth in loans, partially offset by lower SBA-PPP interest income. SBA-PPP loans contributed $2 million of interest income during the third quarter of 2022 compared to $20 million in the third quarter of 2021. 

&#9702; Interest income earned on investment securities for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $90 million, an increase of $50 million compared to the third quarter of 2021. The increase was due to the addition of $6.6 billion of investment securities acquired in the CIT Merger partially offset by maturities, and a higher portfolio yield. 

&#9702; Interest income earned on interest-earning deposits at banks for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $31 million, an increase of $28 million compared to the third quarter of 2021, reflecting higher interest rates, which offset the decline in balance. 

&#9702; Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $78 million, an increase of $70 million compared to third quarter of 2021. The increase was primarily due to the additional interest-bearing deposits acquired in the CIT Merger, which carried a higher average rate than legacy FCB interest-bearing deposits, and due to increases in rates paid on deposits. Interest expense on borrowings for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $33 million, an increase of $25 million compared to the third quarter of 2021. The increase was primarily due to the assumed borrowings in the CIT Merger along with the noted increase in FHLB borrowings and higher rate environment. 

&#8226; NIM was 3.40% for the three months ended September 30, 2022, an increase of 79 bps from the third quarter of 2021, primarily reflective of the higher interest rate environment and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the CIT Merger. 

&#8226; Average interest-earning assets for the three months ended September 30, 2022 were $92.5 billion, an increase of $40.2 billion compared to the third quarter of 2021. This increase was primary due to the added interest-earning assets from the CIT Merger. 

&#8226; Average interest-bearing liabilities for the three months ended September 30, 2022 were $67.2 billion, an increase of $37.5 billion compared to the third quarter of 2021. The increase was primarily due to the addition of deposits and borrowings from the CIT Merger. Rates on interest-bearing liabilities for the three months ended September 30, 2022 were 0.65%. This increase of 45 bps from the third quarter of 2021 was primarily due to the higher rates on the deposits and borrowings acquired in the CIT Merger. 

Year to Date 2022 compared to 2021 

&#8226; NII for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $2.14 billion, an increase of $1.11 billion compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to the CIT Merger, as well as loan growth and a higher interest rate environment, partially offset by a decline in interest income on SBA-PPP loans. 

&#9702; Interest income earned on loans and leases for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $2.06 billion, an increase of $1.09 billion compared to the same period in 2021. The increase was primarily volume driven due to the addition of $32.7 billion of loans acquired in the CIT Merger, along with organic growth in loans, partially offset by lower SBA-PPP interest income. SBA-PPP loans contributed $16 million of interest income during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $78 million in the same period in 2021. 

&#9702; Interest income earned on investment securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $262 million, an increase of $156 million compared to the same period in 2021. The increase was primarily due to the addition of $6.6 billion of investment securities acquired in the CIT Merger and a higher portfolio yield. 

&#9702; Interest income earned on interest-earning deposits at banks for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $50 million, an increase of $43 million compared to the same period in 2021, reflecting higher interest rates. 

&#9702; Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $159 million, an increase of $134 million compared to the same period in 2021. The increase was primarily due to the additional interest-bearing deposits acquired in the CIT Merger, which carried a higher average rate than legacy FCB deposits, and was also impacted by the rising interest rate environment. Interest expense on borrowings for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $70 million, an increase of $48 million compared to the same period in 2021. The increase was primarily due to the assumed borrowings in the CIT Merger. Utilizing excess cash, we redeemed approximately $2.9 billion of the $4.5 billion assumed debt during the first quarter. 

&#8226; NIM for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was 3.06%, an increase of 37 bps from the same period in 2021, reflective of the higher interest rate environment and the impacts from the CIT Merger. 

&#8226; Average interest-earning assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 were $93.2 billion, compared to $50.9 billion in 2021. The change was primarily due to the interest-earning assets acquired in the CIT Merger. 

&#8226; Average interest-bearing liabilities for nine months ended September 30, 2022 were $68.5 billion. This is an increase from $28.8 billion in the same period in 2021, primarily due to the addition of deposits and borrowings from the CIT Merger. Rates on interest-bearing liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 were 0.45%. This increase of 24 bps from the same period in 2021 was primarily due to the higher rates on the deposits and borrowings acquired in the CIT Merger. 

The following table details the average interest earning assets by category.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES 

BancShares provides an amount for expected credit losses within the loan and lease portfolio and for unfunded commitments that is based on factors discussed in the Critical Accounting Estimates section of our 2021 Form 10-K. The provision is recorded to bring the ACL and reserve for unfunded commitments to a level deemed appropriate to cover losses expected in the portfolios. 

The provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $60 million, compared to a provision of $42 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and a benefit of $1 million for the same quarter in 2021. The provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $566 million, compared to a benefit of $32 million in the same period of 2021. 

The increase in the provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily due to moderate deterioration in the macroeconomic forecast used in the CECL forecasting process. The provision for credit losses included $10 million related to the provision for unfunded commitments, which is up from $6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. The ACL is further discussed in Risk Management - Credit Risk below. 

The increases in the provision for credit losses compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 were primarily related to the impact of the CIT Merger and the moderate deterioration in the macroeconomic forecast used in the CECL forecasting process, while the prior year benefited from reserve releases. The nine months ended September 30, 2022 provision for credit losses includes the initial ACL for Non-Purchased Credit Deteriorated (&#8220;Non-PCD&#8221;) loans and leases acquired in the CIT Merger, which was established through an increase of $454 million to the provision for credit losses (the &#8220;Initial Non-PCD Provision&#8221;). Also, the provision for credit losses included $59 million related to unfunded commitments on the Merger Date related to off balance sheet exposures acquired at the time of the CIT Merger. 

NONINTEREST INCOME 

Noninterest Income 

Noninterest income is an essential component of our total revenue. The primary sources of noninterest income consist of rental income on operating leases, fee income and other service charges, wealth management services, fees and service charges generated from deposit accounts, cardholder and merchant services, factoring commissions and mortgage lending and servicing.

Rental Income on Operating Leases 

Rental income from equipment we lease for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $219 million, an increase of $6 million compared to three months ended June 30, 2022. Rental income is generated primarily in the Rail segment and to a lesser extent, in the Commercial Banking segment. Revenue is generally dictated by the size of the portfolio, utilization of the railcars, re-pricing of equipment upon lease maturities and pricing on new equipment leases. Re-pricing refers to the rental rate in the renewed equipment contract compared to the prior contract. Refer to the Rail discussion in the section entitled &#8220;Results by Business Segment&#8221; of this MD&#38;A for further details. 

Other Noninterest Income 

Other noninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $214 million, compared to $211 million in the three months ended June 30, 2022 and $124 million for the same period in 2021. Other noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $1.07 billion, compared to $394 million in the same period of 2021. The increases for the comparable 2021 periods were primarily due to the additional activity related to the CIT Merger, both complimentary to existing BancShares services and products, as well as new items such as factoring services and gain on sale of leasing equipment, along with the preliminary estimated gain of $431 million on acquisition related to the CIT Merger. See Note 2 &#8212; Business Combinations for details. 

The linked quarter comparison to the three months ended June 30, 2022 reflects increases and decreases among various noninterest income accounts. The more significant variances follow: 

&#8226; Fee income and other service charges, consisting of items such as capital market-related fees, fees for lines and letters of credit, and servicing fees, increased by $5 million, primarily reflecting higher capital market fees. 

&#8226; Service charges on deposit accounts decreased by $7 million. While the volume of transactions was up, the decline reflected lower rates we are charging our customers, for items such as overdraft fees. As previously disclosed, in January we announced our intent to eliminate our nonsufficient funds (&#8220;NSF&#8221;) fees and lower our overdraft fees from $36 to $10 on consumer accounts beginning mid-year 2022. 

&#8226; Other noninterest income primarily consisted of bank owned life insurance (&#8220;BOLI&#8221;) income, gain on sale of loans and OREO. Other noninterest income also includes derivative-related gains and losses and other various income items. Other noninterest income increased by $11 million, which included a $5 million settlement gain related to returned equipment, a $4 million recovery on a restructured transaction, a $2 million reserve release on prior loan sales, and a net $2 million derivative gain. The prior quarter included a $6 million gain on sale of a corporate aircraft acquired in the CIT Merger.

Depreciation on Operating Lease Equipment 

Depreciation expense is driven by rail equipment and small and large ticket equipment we own and lease to others. The decrease in expense from the prior quarter reflects higher adjustments to residual values that were recorded in the prior quarter. Operating lease activity is in the Rail and Commercial Banking segments. The useful lives of rail equipment is generally longer in duration, 40-50 years, whereas small and large ticket equipment is generally 3-10 years. Refer to the Rail discussion in the section entitled &#8220;Results by Business Segments&#8221; of this MD&#38;A for further details. 

Maintenance and Other Operating Lease Expenses 

Rail provides railcars primarily pursuant to full-service lease contracts under which Rail as lessor is responsible for railcar maintenance and repair. Maintenance and other operating lease expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and June 30, 2022 were $52 million and $47 million, respectively, and $142 million for nine months ended September 30, 2022. Maintenance and other operating lease expenses relate to equipment ownership and leasing costs associated with the Rail portfolio and tend to be variable. The increase from the prior quarter reflects higher repair costs for railcars put back on lease and inflationary pressures. Refer to the Rail discussion in the section entitled &#8220;Results by Business Segments&#8221; of this MD&#38;A for further details. 

Operating Expenses 

The primary components of operating expenses are salaries and related employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expense. 

Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2022 were $621 million, compared to $609 million in the three months ended June 30, 2022 and $314 million for the same period in 2021. Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 were $1.92 billion compared to $911 million in the same period of 2021. The increases compared to the same periods in 2021 were primarily driven by the CIT Merger, of which significant drivers included higher employee headcount, more branches and office space, additional technology systems and merger-related expenses. Other expense for nine months ended September 30, 2022 included a $27 million reversal of an accrual related to legacy CIT postretirement plans that were terminated after the Merger Date. See Note 21 &#8212; Employee Benefit Plans. 

Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2022 increased by $12 million compared to the linked quarter, primarily comprised of the following: 

&#8226; Salaries and benefits increased by $10 million, primarily reflecting higher salary expense due to new hires, promotions and other salary adjustments, higher costs for temporary workers, and higher revenue-based incentive compensation, partially offset by lower employee benefit costs. The staff additions were the result of building out teams to support our move to large bank compliance, as well as to backfill vacancies. 

&#8226; A $4 million decrease in FDIC insurance expense. 

&#8226; Marketing costs increased by $6 million, reflecting the timing of our advertising relating to marketing efforts for the Direct Bank. 

&#8226; Other expenses consisted of other insurance and taxes (other than income tax), foreclosure, collection and other OREO-related expenses, consulting, telecommunications and other miscellaneous expenses including travel, postage, supplies, and appraisal expense. Changes in these items were not material, while a select item included an impairment charge of $5 million related to the closure of an office facility, and the prior quarter included a legal settlement accrual.

The effective tax rate (&#8220;ETR&#8221;) was 22.9% in the three months ended September 30, 2022, compared to 24.2% for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 21.5% for the same period in 2021. The increase in effective rate from 21.5% in the year ago quarter to 22.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily driven by the increase in state and local taxes resulting from the CIT Merger. The decrease in the ETR from 24.2% for the three months ended June 30, 2022 to 22.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily driven by the effects of changes from enacted state tax laws. The decrease in the ETR from 22.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to 13.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was driven by the non-taxable nature of the preliminary bargain purchase gain arising from the CIT Merger. 

The ETR each quarter is impacted by a number of factors, including the relative mix of domestic and international earnings, effects of changes in enacted tax laws, adjustments to valuation allowances, and discrete items. The ETR in future periods may vary from the actual 2022 ETR due to changes in these factors. 

We monitor and evaluate the potential impact of current events on the estimates used to establish income tax expense and income tax liabilities. On a periodic basis, we evaluate our income tax positions based on current tax law, positions taken by various tax auditors within the jurisdictions where BancShares is required to file income tax returns, as well as potential or pending audits or assessments by tax auditors. 

See Note 20 &#8212; Income Taxes for additional information. 

RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT 

Prior to the CIT Merger, BancShares operated with centralized management and combined reporting and, therefore, BancShares operated as one consolidated reportable segment. In connection with the CIT Merger, we made changes to reflect the inclusion of CIT operations and to reflect how we manage the combined business. As summarized in the sections below, BancShares now reports financial results in three operating segments: General Banking, Commercial Banking, and Rail, and a non-operating segment, Corporate. We conformed prior period comparisons to this new segment presentation. Based on the approach for segment disclosures, the substantial majority of BancShares&#8217; operations for historical periods prior to the CIT Merger are reflected in the General Banking segment. See Note 22 &#8212; Business Segments for related disclosures on the segments. 

Results in our business segments reflect our funds transfer policy and allocation of expenses. Unallocated balances and, when applicable, certain select items, are reflected in Corporate. 

General Banking 

General Banking delivers services to individuals and businesses through an extensive branch network, digital banking, telephone banking and various ATM networks, including a full suite of deposit products, loans (primarily residential mortgages and commercial loans), and various fee-based services. General Banking also provides a variety of wealth management products and services to individuals and institutional clients, including brokerage, investment advisory, and trust services; and deposit, cash management and lending to HOA and property management companies. As part of the CIT Merger, CAB products were added that will drive the associated HOA deposit channel. Revenue is primarily generated from interest earned on residential mortgages, small business loans and fees for banking services.

Results for the 2022 periods reflect the additional activity from the CIT Merger, which were not included in 2021 income statements. 

Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2022 decreased compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022, reflecting higher NII, mostly due to growth in the loan portfolio, offset by lower noninterest income, higher noninterest expenses and higher taxes. Noninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2022 decreased compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022, reflecting lower service charges on deposits. Noninterest expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2022 increased compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022, reflecting items discussed previously in the section entitled &#8220;Noninterest Expenses&#8221; of this MD&#38;A. Net income compared to the 2021 periods was relatively unchanged as higher NII and noninterest income was essentially offset by higher expense levels, resulting from the increased size due to the CIT Merger. 

Loans and leases at September 30, 2022 increased from June 30, 2022 reflecting strong demand through our branch network. Growth was primarily concentrated in commercial and business loans. Our consumer mortgage loans also grew, reflecting lower prepayments and originating loans that were held on-balance sheet. Compared to September 30, 2021, loans and leases increased reflecting the additional residential mortgages and consumer loans acquired in the CIT Merger, partially offset by run-off of SBA-PPP loans. 

Deposits include deposits from the branch, online and CAB channels. The additional branches acquired in the CIT Merger were mostly in California. Deposits at September 30, 2022 were down from June 30, 2022, driven by lower money market accounts, partially offset by an increase in savings accounts. While deposits were down in our branch network, deposits from our direct banking grew. The increase compared to September 30, 2021 reflects deposits acquired in the CIT Merger. See consolidated discussions in the sections entitled &#8220;Net Interest Income,&#8221; &#8220;Net Interest Margin&#8221; and &#8220;Balance Sheet Analysis&#8212;Deposits&#8221; of this MD&#38;A for additional information. 

Commercial Banking 

Commercial Banking provides lending, leasing and other financial and advisory services, primarily to small and middle-market companies across various industries. Commercial Banking also provides asset-based lending, factoring, receivables management products and supply chain financing. Revenue is primarily generated from interest earned on loans, rents on equipment leased, fees and other revenue from lending and leasing activities and banking services, along with capital markets transactions and commissions earned on factoring and related activities. 

We provide factoring, receivable management, and secured financing to businesses (our clients, who are generally manufacturers or importers of goods) that operate in several industries, including apparel, textile, furniture, home furnishings and consumer electronics. Factoring entails the assumption of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable arising from the sale of goods by our clients to their customers (generally retailers) that have been factored (i.e., sold or assigned to the factor).

Results for the 2022 periods primarily reflect activity from the former CIT businesses, which were not included in 2021 periods. 

Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was essentially unchanged compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022, reflecting higher NII and noninterest income, which offset higher provision for credit losses and noninterest expenses. The provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2022 reflects moderate deterioration in the macroeconomic forecasts and loan portfolio growth. For the three months ended September 30, and June 30, 2022, noninterest income included rental income on operating lease equipment of $54 million and $53 million, respectively, and $155 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Noninterest expense includes operating expenses and depreciation on operating lease equipment. Noninterest expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2022 increased compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022, reflecting items discussed previously in the section entitled &#8220;Noninterest Expense&#8221; of this MD&#38;A. Depreciation on operating lease equipment totaled $43 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and $42 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 ($125 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022). 

Loans and leases at September 30, 2022 increased from June 30, 2022, reflecting growth in a number of our industry verticals, such as healthcare and technology, and small business lending, while middle market banking was down. The increase in loans and leases and deposits for the 2022 periods compared to 2021 was driven by those acquired in the CIT Merger. 

Rail 

Rail offers customized leasing and financing solutions on a fleet of railcars and locomotives to railroads and shippers throughout North America. Railcar types include covered hopper cars used to ship grain and agricultural products, plastic pellets, sand, and cement; tank cars for energy products and chemicals; gondolas for coal, steel coil and mill service products; open hopper cars for coal and aggregates; boxcars for paper and auto parts, and center beams and flat cars for lumber. Revenues are primarily generated from operating lease income.

See the &#8220;Non-GAAP Financial Measures&#8221; section for a reconciliation from the GAAP measure (segment net income) to the non-GAAP measure (net revenue on operating leases). 

Net income and net revenue on operating leases are utilized to measure the profitability of our Rail segment. N et revenue on operating leases reflects rental income on operating lease equipment less depreciation, maintenance and other operating lease expenses. Maintenance and other operating lease expenses relate to equipment ownership and leasing costs associated with the Rail portfolio and tend to be variable. Due to the nature of our portfolio, which is essentially all operating lease equipment, certain financial measures commonly used by banks, such as NII, are not as meaningful for this business. NII is not used because it includes the impact of debt costs of our operating lease assets but excludes the associated rental income. 

Net income and net revenue on operating leases for the three months ended September 30, 2022 were $30 million and $69 million, respectively, both up from the three months ended June 30, 2022. Depreciation is recognized on railcars, and the prior quarter included higher costs driven by adjustments to residual values. Maintenance and other operating lease expenses increased from the prior quarter, reflecting higher costs for railcars put back on lease and inflationary pressures. Other noninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2022 reflects a $5 million settlement gain related to returned equipment. 

Our fleet is diverse and the average re-pricing of equipment upon lease maturities was 105% of the average prior or expiring lease rate during the quarter. Our railcar utilization, including commitments to lease, at September 30, 2022 was 96.2%, unchanged from June 30, 2022. 

Portfolio 

Rail customers include all of the U.S. and Canadian Class I railroads (i.e., railroads with annual revenues of approximately $500 million and greater), other railroads, as well as manufacturers and commodity shippers. Our total operating lease fleet at September 30, 2022 consisted of approximately 118,500 railcars, down slightly from June 30, 2022. The following table reflects the proportion of railcars by type based on units and net investment, respectively:

Corporate 

Certain items that are not allocated to operating segments are included in the Corporate segment. Some of the more significant and recurring items include interest income on investment securities, a portion of interest expense primarily related to corporate funding costs (including brokered deposits), income on BOLI (other noninterest income), merger-related expenses, as well as certain unallocated costs and intangible asset amortization expense (operating expenses). Corporate also includes certain significant items that are infrequent, such as the Initial Non-PCD Provision for loans and leases and unfunded commitments, and the preliminary gain on acquisition, both of which related to the CIT Merger.

Results for 2022 were driven by impacts from the CIT Merger. Results for the three months ended September 30, 2022 benefited from higher NII reflecting higher interest income. Included in noninterest expenses for the 2022 periods were $33 million, $34 million and $202 million of merger-related expenses, for the three months ended September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022 and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively. In addition to these items, the nine months ended September 30, 2022 also included a provision for credit losses of $513 million related to the Initial Non-PCD Provision, a preliminary gain on acquisition of $431 million and a benefit of approximately $27 million related to the termination of certain legacy CIT retiree benefit plans in noninterest expenses. 

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS 

INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS 

Interest-earning assets include interest-bearing cash, investment securities, assets held for sale and loans and leases, all of which reflect varying interest rates based on the risk level and repricing characteristics of the underlying asset. Higher risk investments typically carry a higher interest rate but expose us to higher levels of market and/or credit risk. We strive to maintain a high level of interest-earning assets relative to total assets, while keeping non-earning assets at a minimum. 

Interest-earning Deposits at Banks 

Interest-earning deposits at banks at September 30, 2022 totaled $6.2 billion. This was down from $6.5 billion at June 30, 2022 and $9.1 billion at December 31, 2021. These declines related to lower deposits, loan growth, and the timing of investment maturities. While the CIT Merger added approximately $2.9 billion of interest-earning deposits at banks as of the Merger Date, that amount was offset by the use of cash for the redemption of approximately $2.9 billion of assumed debt from the CIT Merger in February. 

Investment Securities 

The primary objective of the investment portfolio is to generate incremental income by deploying excess funds into securities that have minimal liquidity risk and low to moderate interest rate risk and credit risk. Other objectives include acting as a stable source of liquidity, serving as a tool for asset and liability management and maintaining an interest rate risk profile compatible with BancShares&#8217; objectives. Additionally, purchases of equities and corporate bonds in other financial institutions have been made largely under a long-term earnings optimization strategy. Changes in the total balance of our investment securities portfolio result from trends in balance sheet funding and market performance. Generally, when inflows arising from deposit and treasury services products exceed loan and lease demand, we invest excess funds into the securities portfolio or into overnight investments. Conversely, when loan demand exceeds growth in deposits and short-term borrowings, we allow any overnight investments to decline and use proceeds from maturing securities and prepayments to fund loan demand. See Note 1 &#8212; Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation and Note 3 &#8212; Investments for additional disclosures regarding investment securities. 

The carrying value of investment securities at September 30, 2022 totaled $18.8 billion. This was down from $19.1 billion at June 30, 2022, reflecting investment security purchases of $0.5 billion, maturities and paydowns of $0.5 billion, and the remaining due to change in fair value. The increase from $13.1 billion at December 31, 2021 primarily reflected the CIT Merger, which added $6.6 billion. The remaining year to date activity in the portfolio included investment securities purchases of $1.8 billion, partially offset by maturities and paydowns of $1.7 billion, and fair value changes. 

Available for sale securities are reported at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are included as a component of AOCI, net of deferred taxes. As of September 30, 2022, investment securities available for sale had a net pre-tax unrealized loss of $995 million, compared to a net pre-tax unrealized loss of $647 million as of June 30, 2022 and $12 million as of December 31, 2021. The fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. The fair value of the investment securities portfolio generally decreases when interest rates increase or when credit spreads widen. Management evaluated the available for sale securities in an unrealized loss position and concluded that the unrealized losses related to changes in interest rates relative to when the securities were purchased, and therefore BancShares management determined that no ACL was needed at September 30, 2022. 

BancShares&#8217; portfolio of held to maturity debt securities consists of mortgage-backed securities issued by government agencies and government sponsored entities, U.S. Treasury notes, unsecured bonds issued by government agencies and government sponsored entities, securities issued by the World Bank and FDIC guaranteed CDs with other financial institutions. Given the consistently strong credit rating of the U.S. Treasury, the World Bank and the long history of no credit losses on debt securities issued by government agencies and government sponsored entities, BancShares management determined that no ACL was needed at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

The expected life will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers have the right to prepay the underlying loans. 

Assets Held for Sale 

Assets held for sale at September 30, 2022 were $21 million, of which $18 million related to loans and the remainder to non-interest earning operating lease equipment. Assets held for sale totaled $38 million at June 30, 2022 and $99 million at December 31, 2021. The declines were primarily due to loan sales. 

Certain residential real estate loans and commercial loans are originated to be sold to investors or lenders, respectively, and are recorded in assets held for sale at fair value. In addition, BancShares may change its strategy for certain portfolio loans and decide to sell them in the secondary market. At that time, portfolio loans are transferred to loans held for sale at fair value. 

Loans and Leases 

Loans and leases held for investment at September 30, 2022 were $69.8 billion, an increase from $67.7 billion, at June 30, 2022. Our commercial loans were up $1.5 billion from June 30, 2022. We continued to see strong loan growth in our branch network, as well as commercial banking. The increase in our branch network loans was driven by higher commercial loans. In commercial banking, growth was in a number of our industry verticals, such as healthcare and technology, and small business lending, while middle market banking was down. We also had growth in consumer mortgage loans. Our consumer loans were up $0.6 billion from June 30, 2022. Total loans and leases increased from $32.4 billion at December 31, 2021, reflecting the addition of $32.7 billion from the CIT Merger and the above noted activity, partially offset by a reduction in SBA-PPP loans. 

Upon completion of the CIT Merger, we re-evaluated our loan classes to reflect the risk characteristics of the combined portfolio. BancShares reports its commercial loan portfolio in the following classes: commercial construction, owner occupied commercial mortgage, non-owner occupied commercial mortgage, commercial and industrial, and leases. The consumer portfolio includes residential mortgage, revolving mortgage, consumer auto and consumer other. Commercial loans at September 30, 2022 were $53.0 billion compared to $51.5 billion at June 30, 2022 and $22.6 billion at December 31, 2021, representing 76%, 76% and 70% of total loans and leases, respectively. Consumer loans at September 30, 2022 were $16.8 billion, compared to $16.3 billion at June 30, 2022 and $9.8 billion at December 31, 2021, representing 24%, 24% and 30% of total loans and leases, respectively.

INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES 

Interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, securities sold under customer repurchase agreements, FHLB borrowings, subordinated debt, and other borrowings. Interest-bearing liabilities at September 30, 2022 totaled $69.3 billion, compared to $67.1 billion at June 30, 2022 and $31.8 billion at December 31, 2021. As discussed further below, the increase from June 30, 2022 reflects lower deposits offset by higher FHLB borrowings. The increase from December 31, 2021 was mostly due to deposits and borrowings from the CIT Merger, partially offset by current year activity that included post-merger decline in deposits, the redemption of assumed debt during the first quarter, and higher FHLB borrowings. See Note 2 &#8212; Business Combinations for details on deposits and borrowings associated with the CIT Merger. 

Deposits 

Total deposits at September 30, 2022 were $87.6 billion, a decrease of $1.8 billion compared to June 30, 2022 and an increase of $36.1 billion compared to December 31, 2021. Interest-bearing deposits totaled $61.0 billion, $62.7 billion and $30.0 billion at September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Noninterest-bearing deposits totaled $26.6 billion, $26.6 billion and $21.4 billion at September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. During the quarter deposits in our branch network and commercial customers were down, partially offset by our growth in direct banking deposits. Total deposits declined during the second quarter and continued lower in the third quarter, reflecting the most rate sensitive customers moving funds in response to increases in the federal funds rate. The decline in total deposits compared to June 30, 2022 was driven by lower money market accounts, partially offset by an increase in savings accounts. 

The reduction in deposits since the CIT Merger have been primarily concentrated in acquired higher cost channels, including legacy OneWest branches and the Direct Bank. These declines were partially offset by growth in noninterest-bearing deposits, primarily from our branch network. The increase in total deposits as compared to December 31, 2021 was driven by the $39.4 billion of deposits acquired in the CIT Merger, partially offset by the noted declines. As part of the CIT Merger, we acquired CIT&#8217;s online banking platform and an HOA deposit channel.

We strive to maintain a strong liquidity position, and therefore a focus on core deposit retention remains a key business objective. We believe traditional bank deposit products remain an attractive option for many customers. As economic conditions change, we recognize that our liquidity position could be adversely affected if bank deposits are withdrawn. Our ability to fund future loan growth is significantly dependent on our success in retaining existing deposits and generating new deposits at a reasonable cost. 

Where information is not readily available to determine the amount of insured deposits, the amount of uninsured deposits is estimated, consistent with the methodologies and assumptions utilized in providing information to the Bank&#8217;s regulators. We estimate total uninsured deposits were $31.0 billion and $23.0 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Table 19 provides the expected maturity of time deposits in excess of $250,000, the FDIC insurance limit, as of September 30, 2022.

Borrowings 

Total borrowings at September 30, 2022 were $8.3 billion, compared to $4.5 billion at June 30, 2022 and $1.8 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase from June 30, 2022 primarily reflected third quarter FHLB borrowings of $4.5 billion, partially offset by repayments of $0.5 billion. Of the net new FHLB borrowings remaining at September 30, 2022, $2.6 billion and $1.6 billion were short-term and long-term, respectively. The increase in borrowings in the third quarter was to replace declines in interest-bearing deposits and support the loan growth. In addition, during the third quarter we repaid a $61 million senior unsecured term loan that matured. The increase from December 31, 2021 also reflected $4.5 billion of debt assumed in the CIT Merger, partially offset by a debt redemption of approximately $2.9 billion in February.

RISK MANAGEMENT 

BancShares provided detail risk management information in our 2021 Form 10-K. The following is a summary of those disclosures or updates to those disclosures, primarily due to the CIT Merger. 

Risk is inherent in any business. BancShares has defined a moderate risk appetite, a balanced approach to risk taking, with a philosophy which does not preclude higher risk business activities commensurate with acceptable returns while meeting regulatory objectives. Through the comprehensive Risk Management Framework and Risk Appetite Framework, senior management has primary responsibility for day-to-day management of the risks we face with accountability of and support from all associates. Senior management applies various strategies to reduce the risks to which BancShares may be exposed, with effective challenge and oversight by management committees. In addition, the Board strives to ensure the business culture is integrated with the Risk Management program and policies, procedures and metrics for identifying, assessing, monitoring and managing risk are part of the decision-making process. The Board&#8217;s role in risk oversight is an integral part of our overall Risk Management Framework and Risk Appetite Framework. The Board administers its risk oversight function primarily through the Board Risk Committee. 

The Board Risk Committee structure is designed to allow for information flow, effective challenge and timely escalation of risk-related issues. The Board Risk Committee is directed to monitor and advise the full Board regarding risk exposures, including Credit, Market, Capital, Liquidity, Operational, Compliance, Asset, Strategic and Reputational risks; review, approve, and monitor adherence to the Risk Appetite Statement and supporting risk tolerance levels via a series of established metrics; and evaluate, monitor and oversee the adequacy and effectiveness of the Risk Management Framework and Risk Appetite Framework. The Board Risk Committee also reviews reports of examination by and communications from regulatory agencies, the results of internal and third party testing and qualitative and quantitative assessments related to risk management, and any other matters within the scope of the Board Risk Committee&#8217;s oversight responsibilities. The Board Risk Committee monitors management&#8217;s response to certain risk-related regulatory and audit issues. In addition, the Board Risk Committee may coordinate with the Audit Committee and the Compensation, Nominations and Governance Committee for the review of financial statements and related risks, compensation risk management and other areas of joint responsibility. 

In combination with other risk management and monitoring practices, enterprise-wide stress testing activities are part of the Risk Management Framework and conducted within a defined framework. Stress tests are performed for various risks to ensure the financial institution can support continued operations during stressed periods. 

BancShares is subject to a variety of risks that may arise through its business activities. As identified in our 2021 Form 10-K, our primary risks are credit, market, capital, liquidity, operational, compliance, strategic and reputational risks. Due to the CIT Merger, further below we added asset risk (due to the operating lease portfolio) as a primary risk and enhanced our credit risk to highlight counterparty risk (due to the increased use of derivatives). 

Given several factors including but not limited to positive internal and external trends, positive risk metrics, effective incident, oversight and monitoring, the Company returned to business as usual operations and lifted internal COVID-19 related restrictions in early April. BancShares will continue to comply with any state and local orders that are in place. Monitoring of associated credit and operational risks has now been integrated into normal risk monitoring activities. 

Since the filing of our 2021 Form 10-K, BancShares has been assessing the emerging impacts of the rising international tensions that could impact the economy and exacerbate headwinds of rising inflation, elevated market volatility, global supply chain disruptions, and recessionary pressures as well as operational risks such as those associated with potential cyber-attacks for FCB and third parties upon whom it relies. Assessments have not identified material impacts to date, but those assessments will remain ongoing as the condition continues to exist. 

CREDIT RISK 

Credit risk is the risk of not collecting payments pursuant to the contractual terms of loans, leases and certain investment securities. Loans and leases we originate are underwritten in accordance with our credit policies and procedures and are subject to periodic ongoing reviews. Acquired loans, regardless of whether PCD or non-PCD, are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date and are subject to periodic reviews to identify any further credit deterioration. Our independent credit review function conducts risk reviews and analyses of both originated and acquired loans to ensure compliance with credit policies and to monitor asset quality trends and borrower financial strength. These reviews include portfolio analysis by geographic location, industry, collateral type and product. We strive to identify potential problem loans as early as possible, to record charge-offs or write-downs as appropriate and to maintain an appropriate ACL that accounts for expected losses over the life of the loan and lease portfolios. 

Commercial Lending and Leasing 

Commercial loans and leases acquired in the CIT Merger, which are primarily within the Commercial Banking segment, are graded according to a rating system that was used by CIT prior to the merger with respect to probability of obligor default (&#8220;PD&#8221;) and loss given default (severity) based on various risk factors. The PD and severity are derived through historical observations of default and subsequent losses within each risk grading. When these loans and leases were graded at underwriting, or when updated periodically, a model is run to generate a preliminary risk rating. The model incorporates both internal and external historical default and loss data to develop loss rates for each risk rating. The preliminary risk rating assigned by the model can be adjusted as a result of borrower specific facts that in management&#8217;s judgment warrant a modification of the modeled risk rating to arrive at the final approved risk ratings. 

For small-ticket lending and leasing portfolio acquired in the CIT Merger, automated credit scoring models for origination (scorecards) and re-grading (auto re-grade algorithms) are also employed. These are supplemented by business rules and expert judgment. Adjustments to credit scorecards, auto re-grading algorithms, business rules and lending programs may be made periodically based on these evaluations. A credit approval hierarchy is enforced to ensure that an underwriter with the appropriate level of authority reviews applications. 

Consumer Lending 

Consumer lending begins with an evaluation of a consumer borrower&#8217;s credit profile against published standards. Credit decisions are made after analyzing quantitative and qualitative factors, including borrower&#8217;s ability to repay the loan, collateral values, and considering the transaction from a judgmental perspective. 

Consumer products use traditional and measurable standards to document and assess the creditworthiness of a loan applicant. Credit standards follow industry standard documentation requirements. Performance is largely evaluated based on an acceptable pay history along with a quarterly assessment which incorporates current market conditions. Non-traditional loans may also be monitored by way of a quarterly review of the borrower&#8217;s refreshed credit score. Loans are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due or more, except for government guaranteed loans. When warranted, an additional review of the underlying collateral&#8217;s loan-to-value may be conducted. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The ACL is calculated using a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, charge-off and recovery activity, loan growth, changes in macroeconomic factors, collateral type, estimated loan life and changes in credit quality. Forecasted economic conditions are developed using third party macroeconomic scenarios and may be adjusted based on management&#8217;s expectations over the lives of the portfolios. Significant macroeconomic factors used in estimating the expected losses include unemployment, GDP, home price index, commercial real estate index, corporate profits, and credit spreads. 

The ACL at September 30, 2022 was $882 million, compared to $850 million at June 30, 2022 and $178 million at December 31, 2021. The ACL as a percentage of total loans and leases at September 30, 2022 was 1.26%, compared to 1.26% at June 30, 2022 and 0.55% at December 31, 2021. 

The ACL at September 30, 2022 increased compared to June 30, 2022 primarily due to moderate deterioration in the macroeconomic forecasts related to GDP, interest rates, home prices, and commercial real estate prices. In contemplation of additional uncertainty, primarily based on the elevated levels of inflation and its impact on other macroeconomic variables such as interest rates, which could in turn impact home prices, commercial real estate values, and other variables, we do not believe the current baseline scenario fully incorporates the potential downside impacts of future macroeconomic deterioration, so an additional weighting on the downside scenario was incorporated into the estimate. In the three months ended September 30, 2022, the ACL on commercial loans increased $26 million and the ACL on consumer portfolios increased $6 million. 

Compared to December 31, 2021, the increase in the ACL at September 30, 2022 on commercial portfolios was $686 million and $18 million on the consumer portfolios. The increases were primarily due to the impact of the CIT Merger, as well as the above noted moderate deterioration in the macroeconomic forecasts and loan growth. The initial ACL for PCD loans and leases acquired in the CIT Merger (the &#8220;Initial PCD ACL&#8221;) of $272 million was established through the PCD Gross-Up and there was no corresponding increase to the provision for credit losses. The PCD Gross-Up is discussed further in Note 2 &#8212; Business Combinations. The initial ACL for Non-PCD loans and leases acquired in the CIT Merger was established through a corresponding increase of $454 million to the provision for credit losses for the &#8220;Initial Non-PCD Provision&#8221;. In addition to the impact on the ACL from the CIT Merger, revisions to the CECL macroeconomic forecasts during 2022 impacted the ACL. The loss estimates were also influenced by BancShares&#8217; strong credit quality and low net charge-offs. 

While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ACL is dependent upon factors that are inherently difficult to predict, the most significant being the factors in the economic scenarios. ACL estimates in these scenarios ranged from approximately $630 million to approximately $1.1 billion. BancShares management determined that an ACL of $882 million was appropriate as of September 30, 2022.

The $12 million reflects second quarter adjustment to the original amount recorded on the Merger Date, with an equal adjustment to the UPB of PCD loans.

Net charge-offs during the three months ended September 30, 2022 were $18 million, compared to $22 million during the second quarter of 2022 and $5 million during the third quarter of 2021. On an annualized basis, the net charge-off ratio was 0.10%, 0.13% and 0.06% for the three months ended September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively. Net charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 were $55 million (net charge-off ratio of 0.11%) and $10 million (net charge-off ratio of 0.04%), respectively. The increase in net charge-offs compared to the 2021 periods reflects the impact from the loans acquired in the CIT Merger.

The reserve for unfunded loan commitments was $91 million, $81 million and $12 million at September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The increase of $10 million compared to June 30, 2022 was driven by moderate deterioration in the macroeconomic forecasts. The 2022 increases from December 31, 2021 were primarily driven by the additional commitments from the CIT Merger. The additional off-balance sheet commitments primarily reflect loan commitments or lines of credit and DPAs. See Note 23 &#8212; Commitments and Contingencies for information relating to off-balance sheet commitments and Note 5 &#8212; Allowance for Credit Losses for a roll forward of the ACL for unfunded commitments. 

Credit Metrics 

Non-performing Assets 

Non-performing assets include non-accrual loans and leases and OREO. Non-performing assets at September 30, 2022 totaled $508 million, compared to $558 million at June 30, 2022 and $161 million at December 31, 2021. 

The following table presents total nonperforming assets.

Non-accrual loans and leases at September 30, 2022 were $454 million, a decrease of $59 million from June 30, 2022 and an increase of $333 million since December 31, 2021. Non-accrual loans and leases as a percentage of total loans and leases was 0.65%, 0.76% and 0.37% at September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The increase from December 31, 2021 was primarily driven by the CIT Merger. 

OREO at September 30, 2022 totaled $54 million, representing an increase of $9 million from June 30, 2022 and $14 million since December 31, 2021. Non-performing assets as a percentage of total loans, leases and OREO at September 30, 2022 was 0.73% compared to 0.83% at June 30, 2022 and 0.49% at December 31, 2021. 

Past Due Accounts 

The percentage of loans 30 days or more past due at September 30, 2022 was 0.72% of loans, compared to 0.78% at June 30, 2022 and 0.43% at December 31, 2021. Delinquency status of loans is presented in Note 4 &#8212; Loans and Leases. 

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

We selectively agree to modify existing loan terms to provide relief to customers who are experiencing financial difficulties or other circumstances that could affect their ability to meet debt obligations. Typical modifications include short-term deferral of interest or modification of payment terms. TDRs not accruing interest at the time of restructure are included as nonperforming loans. TDRs accruing at the time of restructure and continuing to perform based on the restructured terms are considered performing loans. 

The Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus was published by banking regulators in April 2020 to clarify accounting and reporting expectations for loan modifications in determining TDR designation for borrowers experiencing COVID-19-related financial difficulty. BancShares applied this regulatory guidance during its TDR identification process for short-term loan forbearance agreements as a result of COVID-19, and in most cases, did not record these as TDRs.

Counterparty Risk 

We enter into interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange forward contracts as part of our overall risk management practices and also on behalf of our clients. We establish risk metrics and evaluate and manage the counterparty risk associated with these derivative instruments in accordance with the comprehensive Risk Management Framework and Risk Appetite Framework. 

Counterparty credit exposure or counterparty risk is a primary risk of derivative instruments, relating to the ability of a counterparty to perform its financial obligations under the derivative contract. We seek to control credit risk of derivative agreements through counterparty credit approvals, pre-established exposure limits and monitoring procedures, which are integrated with our cash and issuer related credit processes. 

The Chief Credit Officer, or delegate, approves each counterparty and establishes exposure limits based on credit analysis of each counterparty. Derivative agreements for BancShares&#8217; risk management purposes and for the hedging of client transactions are executed with major financial institutions and are settled through the major clearing exchanges, which are rated investment grade by nationally recognized statistical rating agencies. Credit exposure is mitigated via the exchange of collateral between the counterparties covering mark-to-market valuations. Client related derivative transactions, which are primarily related to lending activities, are incorporated into our loan underwriting and reporting processes. 

ASSET RISK 

Asset risk is a form of price risk and is a primary risk of our leasing businesses related to the risk to earning of capital arising from changes in the value of owned leasing equipment. Reflecting the addition of operating lease equipment and additional asset-based lending from the CIT Merger, we are subject to increased asset risk. Asset risk in our leasing business is evaluated and managed in the divisions and overseen by risk management processes. In our asset-based lending business, we also use residual value guarantees to mitigate or partially mitigate exposure to end of lease residual value exposure on certain of our finance leases. Our business process consists of: (1) setting residual values at transaction inception, (2) systematic periodic residual value reviews, and (3) monitoring levels of residual realizations. Residual realizations, by business and product, are reviewed as part of the quarterly financial and asset quality review. Reviews for impairment are performed at least annually. 

In combination with other risk management and monitoring practices, asset risk is monitored through reviews of the equipment markets including utilization rates and traffic flows, the evaluation of supply and demand dynamics, the impact of new technologies and changes in regulatory requirements on different types of equipment. At a high level, demand for equipment is correlated with GDP growth trends for the markets the equipment serves, as well as the more immediate conditions of those markets. Cyclicality in the economy and shifts in trade flows due to specific events represent risks to the earnings that can be realized by these businesses. For instance, in the Rail business, BancShares seeks to mitigate these risks by maintaining a relatively young fleet of assets, which can bolster attractive lease and utilization rates. 

MARKET RISK 

Interest rate risk management 

BancShares is exposed to the risk that changes in market conditions or government policy may affect interest rates and negatively impact earnings. The risk arises from the nature of BancShares&#8217; business activities, the composition of BancShares&#8217; balance sheet, and changes in the level or shape of the yield curve. BancShares manages this inherent risk strategically based on prescribed guidelines and approved limits. 

Interest rate risk can arise from many of the BancShares&#8217; business activities, such as lending, leasing, investing, deposit taking, derivatives, and funding activities. We evaluate and monitor interest rate risk primarily through two metrics. 

&#8226; Net Interest Income Sensitivity (&#8220;NII Sensitivity&#8221;) measures the net impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates on forecasted NII; and 

&#8226; Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity (&#8220;EVE Sensitivity&#8221;) measures the net impact of these hypothetical changes on the value of equity by assessing the economic value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments. 

BancShares uses a holistic process to measure and monitor both short term and long term risks which includes, but is not limited to, gradual and immediate parallel rate shocks, changes in the shape of the yield curve, and changes in the relationship of various yield curves. NII Sensitivity generally focuses on shorter term earnings risk, while EVE Sensitivity assesses the longer-term risk of the existing balance sheet. 

Our exposure to NII Sensitivity is guided by the Risk Appetite Framework and a range of risk metrics and BancShares may utilize tools across the balance sheet to adjust its interest rate risk exposures, including through business line actions and actions within the investment, funding and derivative activities. 

The composition of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities generally results in a net asset-sensitive position for NII Sensitivity, whereby our assets will reprice faster than our liabilities, which is generally concentrated at the short end of the yield curve. 

Our funding sources consist primarily of non-maturity deposits and time deposits. We also support our funding needs through wholesale funding sources (including unsecured and secured borrowings). 

The deposit rates we offer are influenced by market conditions and competitive factors. Market rates are the key drivers of deposit costs and we continue to optimize deposit costs by improving our deposit mix. Changes in interest rates, expected funding needs, as well as actions by competitors, can affect our deposit taking activities and deposit pricing. We believe our targeted non-maturity deposit customer retention is strong and we remain focused on optimizing our mix of deposits. We regularly assess the effect of deposit rate changes on our balances and seek to achieve optimal alignment between assets and liabilities. 

Table 28 below summarizes the results of 12-month NII Sensitivity simulations produced our asset/liability management system. These simulations assume static balance sheet replacement with like products and implied forward market rates, but also incorporates additional assumptions, such as, but not limited to prepayment estimates, pricing estimates and deposit behaviors. The below simulations assume an immediate 25, 100 and 200 bps parallel increase and 25 and 100 bps decrease from the market-based forward curve for September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022, and December 2021. 

Table 28 

Net Interest Income Sensitivity Simulation Analysis 

Estimated (Decrease) Increase in NII Change in interest rate (bps) September 30, 2022 June 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 -100 (3.63) % (5.34) % (5.77) % -25 (0.80) % (1.25) % (1.15) % +25 0.91 % 1.34 % 1.05 % +100 3.44 % 5.17 % 3.21 % +200 6.81 % 10.20 % 6.30 % 

NII Sensitivity metrics at September 30, 2022, compared to June 30, 2022, were primarily affected by a reduction in cash as well as liability management actions which included borrowing FHLB advances to support loan growth and to offset deposit runoff. BancShares continues to have an asset sensitive interest rate risk profile and the potential exposure to forecasted earnings is largely driven by the composition of the balance sheet (primarily due to floating rate commercial loans and cash), as well as estimates of modest future deposit betas. Approximately 45% of our loans have floating contractual reference rates, indexed primarily to 1-month London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;), 3-month LIBOR, Prime and Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;). Deposit betas for the combined company are modeled to have a portfolio average of approximately 20%-25% over the forecast horizon. Impacts to NII Sensitivity may change due to actual results differing from modeled expectations. 

As noted above, EVE Sensitivity supplements NII simulations as it estimates risk exposures beyond a twelve-month horizon. EVE Sensitivity measures the change in value of the economic value of equity driven by changes in assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet instruments in response to a change in interest rates. EVE Sensitivity is calculated by estimating the change in the net present value of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet items under various rate movements. 

Table 29 presents the EVE profile as of September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021. 

Table 29 

Economic Value of Equity Modeling Analysis 

Estimated (Decrease) Increase in EVE Change in interest rate (bps) September 30, 2022 June 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 -100 (5.39) % (7.17) % (13.68) % -25 (1.21) % (1.67) % &#8212; % +100 4.29 % 5.92 % 6.10 % +200 3.54 % 7.21 % 5.93 % 

The economic value of equity metrics at September 30, 2022 compared to June 30, 2022 were primarily affected by balance sheet composition changes as well as increasing market interest rates. 

In addition to the above reported sensitivities, a wide variety of potential interest rate scenarios are simulated within our asset/liability management system. Scenarios that impact management volumes, specific risk events, or the sensitivity to key assumptions are also evaluated. 

We use results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate and implement asset and liability management strategies, in coordination with the Asset Liability Committee, to achieve the desired risk profile, while managing our objectives for market risk and other strategic objectives. Specifically, we may manage our interest rate risk position through certain pricing strategies and product design for loans and deposits, our investment portfolio, funding portfolio, or by using off balance sheet derivatives to mitigate earnings volatility. 

The above sensitivities provide an estimate of our interest rate sensitivity; however, they do not account for potential changes in credit quality, size, mix, or changes in the competition for business in the industries we serve. They also do not account for other business developments and other actions. Accordingly, we can give no assurance that actual results would not differ materially from the estimated outcomes of our simulations. Further, the range of such simulations is not intended to represent our current view of the expected range of future interest rate movements.

Reference Rate Reform 

The administrator of LIBOR has announced that publication of the most commonly used tenors of U.S. Dollar LIBOR will cease to be provided or cease to be representative after June 30, 2023. The U.S. federal banking agencies had also issued guidance strongly encouraging banking organizations to cease using the U.S. Dollar LIBOR as a reference rate in &#8220;new&#8221; contracts by December 31, 2021 at the latest. Accordingly, prior to the CIT Merger, FCB and CIT had ceased originating new products using LIBOR by the end of 2021. 

In April 2018, the FRB of New York commenced publication of SOFR, which has been recommended as an alternative to U.S. Dollar LIBOR by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a group of market and official sector participants. On March 15, 2022, the U.S. Congress adopted, as part of the Consolidated Appropriation Act of 2022, the Adjustable Interest (LIBOR) Act, which provides certain statutory requirements and guidance for the selection and use of alternative reference rates in legacy financial contracts governed by U.S. law that do not provide for the use of a clearly defined or practicable alternative reference rate. On July 19, 2022, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on a proposed regulation to implement the LIBOR Act, as required by its terms. The LIBOR Act requires implementing regulations be in place within 180 days of its enactment. BancShares anticipates using the safe harbors that are expected in the final regulations. 

BancShares holds instruments such as loans, investments, derivative products, and other financial instruments that use LIBOR as a benchmark rate. However, BancShares&#8217; LIBOR exposure is primarily to tenures other than one week and two-month USD LIBOR. 

LIBOR is a benchmark interest rate for most of our floating rate loans and our Series B Preferred Stock, as well as certain liabilities and off-balance sheet exposures. We continue to monitor industry and regulatory developments and have a well-established transition program in place to manage the implementation of alternative reference rates as the market transitions away from LIBOR. Coordination is being handled by a cross-functional project team governed by executive sponsors. Its mission is to work with our businesses to ensure a smooth transition for BancShares and its customers to an appropriate LIBOR alternative. Certain financial markets and products have already migrated to alternatives. The project team ensures that BancShares is ready to move quickly and efficiently as consensus around LIBOR alternatives emerge. BancShares has processes in place to complete its review of the population of legal contracts impacted by the LIBOR transition, and updates to our operational systems and processes are substantially in place. 

BancShares is utilizing SOFR as our preferred replacement index for LIBOR. However, we are positioned to accommodate other alternative reference rates (e.g., credit sensitive rates) in response to how the market evolves. 

For a further discussion of risks BancShares faces in connection with the replacement of LIBOR on its operations, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Market Risks&#8212; We may be adversely impacted by the transition from LIBOR as a reference rate .&#8221; in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2021 Form 10-K. 

LIQUIDITY RISK 

Our liquidity risk management and monitoring process is designed to ensure the availability of adequate cash and collateral resources and funding capacity to meet our obligations. Our overall liquidity management strategy is intended to ensure appropriate liquidity to meet expected and contingent funding needs under both normal and stressed environments. Consistent with this strategy, we maintain sufficient amounts of Available Cash and High Quality Liquid Securities (&#8220;HQLS&#8221;). Additional sources of liquidity include FHLB borrowing capacity, committed credit facilities, repurchase agreements, brokered CD issuances, unsecured debt issuances, and cash collections generated by portfolio asset sales to third parties. 

We utilize a series of measurement tools to assess and monitor the level and adequacy of our liquidity position, liquidity conditions and trends. We measure and forecast liquidity and liquidity risks under different hypothetical scenarios and across different horizons. We use a liquidity stress testing framework to better understand the range of potential risks and their impacts to which BancShares is exposed. Stress test results inform our business strategy, risk appetite, levels of liquid assets, and contingency funding plans. Also included among our liquidity measurement tools are key risk indicators that assist in identifying potential liquidity risk and stress events. 

BancShares maintains a framework to establish liquidity risk tolerances, monitoring, and breach escalation protocol to alert management of potential funding and liquidity risks and to initiate mitigating actions as appropriate. Further, BancShares maintains a contingent funding plan which details protocols and potential actions to be taken under liquidity stress conditions. 

Liquidity includes Available Cash and HQLS. At September 30, 2022 we had $19.2 billion of total Liquid Assets (17.5% of total assets) and $11.7 billion of contingent liquidity sources available.

We fund our operations through deposits and borrowings. Our primary source of liquidity is our branch-generated deposit portfolio due to the generally stable balances and low cost. Deposits totaled $87.6 billion, $89.3 billion and $51.4 billion at September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. As needed, we use borrowings to diversify the funding of our business operations. Borrowings totaled $8.3 billion, $4.5 billion and $1.8 billion at September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Borrowings primarily consist of FHLB advances, senior unsecured notes, securities sold under customer repurchase agreements, and subordinated notes. 

A source of available funds is advances from the FHLB of Atlanta. We may pledge assets for secured borrowing transactions, which include borrowings from the FHLB and/or FRB, or for other purposes as required or permitted by law. The debt issued in conjunction with these transactions is collateralized by certain discrete receivables, securities, loans, leases and/or underlying equipment. Certain related cash balances are restricted. 

FHLB Advances

(1) A letter of credit was established with the FHLB to collateralize public funds. 

The increase in advances from June 30, 2022 primarily reflected third quarter FHLB borrowings of $4.5 billion, partially offset by repayments of $0.5 billion, and in June 2022, we had borrowed $1.65 billion. We do not expect FHLB advances to grow materially as a percentage of total funding as our long-term strategy is to rely on deposits as our core funding source. 

Under borrowing arrangements with the FRB of Richmond, FCB has access to an additional $4.5 billion on a secured basis. There were no outstanding borrowings with the FRB Discount Window at September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021. 

Commitments and Contractual Obligations 

Table 34 identifies significant obligations and commitments as of September 30, 2022, representing required and potential cash outflows. See Note 23 &#8212; Commitments and Contingencies for additional information regarding commitments. Financing commitments, letters of credit and deferred purchase commitments are presented at contractual amounts and do not necessarily reflect future cash outflows as many are expected to expire unused or partially used.

CAPITAL 

Capital requirements applicable to BancShares are discussed in Item 1. Business &#8212; Regulation, subsections &#8220;Regulatory Considerations&#8221; of our 2021 Form 10-K. 

BancShares maintains a comprehensive capital adequacy process. BancShares establishes internal capital risk limits and warning thresholds, which utilize Risk-Based and Leverage-Based Capital calculations, internal and external early warning indicators, its capital planning process, and stress testing to evaluate BancShares' capital adequacy for multiple types of risk in both normal and stressed environments. The capital management framework requires contingency plans be defined and may be employed at management&#8217;s discretion. 

Share Repurchase Program 

On July 26, 2022, the Board authorized a share repurchase program for up to 1,500,000 shares of BancShares&#8217; Class A Common Stock for the period commencing August 1, 2022 through July 28, 2023. Under the authorized share repurchase program, shares of BancShares&#8217; Class A Common Stock were authorized to be repurchased from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including through a Rule 10b5-1 plan. During the three months ended September 30, 2022, we purchased 1,027,414 shares of Class A Common Stock, and subsequent to September 30, 2022, we purchased an additional 472,586 shares of Class A Common Stock, thereby completing the share repurchase program. See Part II, Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details on purchases. 

Common and Preferred Stock Dividends 

On October 25, 2022, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend increase on the Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock to $0.75 per common share from $0.47 per common share. The dividends are payable on December 15, 2022 to shareholders of record as of November 30, 2022. 

On October 25, 2022, our Board of Directors also declared dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock. The dividends are payable on December 15, 2022 to shareholders of record as of November 30, 2022. Dividend payment information on our Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock is disclosed in Note 16 &#8212; Stockholders&#8217; Equity. 

Capital Composition and Ratios 

In connection with the consummation of the CIT Merger, the Parent Company issued approximately 6.1 million shares of its Class A Common Stock. Additionally, shares of CIT Series A Preferred Stock and CIT Series B Preferred Stock were automatically converted into the right to receive shares of BancShares Series B Preferred Stock and BancShares Series C Preferred Stock, respectively. In connection with the consummation of the CIT Merger, the Parent Company issued (a) 325,000 shares of BancShares Series B Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, resulting in a total liquidation preference of $325 million, and (b) 8 million shares of BancShares Series C Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $25 per share, resulting in a total liquidation preference of $200 million. 

The table below shows activities that caused the change in outstanding Class A Common Stock for the quarter.

We also had 1,005,185 Class B Common Stock outstanding at September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

We are committed to effectively managing our capital to protect our depositors, creditors and stockholders. We continually monitor the capital levels and ratios for BancShares and FCB to ensure they exceed the minimum requirements imposed by regulatory authorities and to ensure they are appropriate given growth projections, risk profile and potential changes in the regulatory or external environment. Failure to meet certain capital requirements may result in actions by regulatory agencies that could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In accordance with GAAP, the unrealized gains and losses on certain assets and liabilities, net of deferred taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders&#8217; equity. These amounts are excluded from regulatory in the calculation of our regulatory capital ratios under current regulatory guidelines.

A s of September 30, 2022, BancShares and FCB continued to exceed minimum capital standards and remained well-capitalized under Basel III guidelines. At September 30, 2022, BancShares and FCB had risk-based capital ratio conservation buffers of 5.36% and 5.26%, respectively, which are in excess of the fully phased in Basel III conservation buffer of 2.50%. At December 31, 2021, BancShares and FCB had risk-based capital ratio conservation buffers were 6.35% and 5.85%, respectively. The capital ratio conservation buffers represent the excess of the regulatory capital ratio over the Basel III minimum. Additional Tier 1 capital for BancShares includes perpetual preferred stock. Additional Tier 2 capital for BancShares and FCB primarily consists of qualifying ACL and qualifying subordinated debt. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

Accounting policies related to the ACL are considered critical accounting estimates as described in our 2021 Form 10-K. The ACL as of September 30, 2022 is discussed in Note 5 &#8212; Allowance for Credit Losses and the Credit Risk discussion in the section entitled &#8220;Risk Management&#8221; above. 

Fair values of loans acquired in and the core deposit intangibles associated with the CIT Merger are considered critical accounting estimates. The determination of estimated fair values required management to make certain estimates about discount rates, future expected cash flows, market conditions at the time of the merger and other future events that are highly subjective in nature and may require adjustments. The fair values for these items are further discussed in Note 2 &#8212; Business Combinations. 

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

The following accounting pronouncements were issued by the FASB but are not yet effective for BancShares. Standard Summary of Guidance 

Effect on BancShares&#8217; Financial Statements 

ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting 

Issued March 2020 

ASU 2021-01 - Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope 

Issued January 2021 

The amendments in these updates apply only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. 

Allows entities to prospectively apply certain optional expedients for contract modifications and removes the requirements to remeasure contract modifications or de-designate hedging relationships. In addition, potential sources of ineffectiveness as a result of reference rate reform may be disregarded when performing certain effectiveness assessments. 

ASU 2021-01 refines the scope of ASC 848 and clarifies which optional expedients may be applied to derivative instruments that do not reference LIBOR or a reference rate that is expected to be discontinued, but that are being modified in connection with the market-wide transition to new reference rates. 

Guidance in these ASUs are effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. 

The amendments are effective for all entities at issuance date of March 12, 2020, and once adopted will apply to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into on or before December 31, 2022. BancShares is in the process of evaluating the optional expedients as applicable for eligible contract modifications and any hedge relationships. However, we do not expect the guidance to have a material impact on the financial statements. ASU 2022-01, Fair Value Hedging - Portfolio Layer Method 

Issued March 2022 

The amendments in this Update allow entities to designate multiple hedged layers of a single closed portfolio, and expands the scope of the portfolio layer method to include non-prepayable financial assets. Provides additional guidance on the accounting for and disclosure of hedge basis adjustments under the portfolio layer method. In addition, as of the adoption date the Update permits reclassification of debt securities from the held-to-maturity category to the available-for-sale category if the entity intends to include those securities in a portfolio designated in a portfolio layer method hedge. Also provides 30 days post adoption to reclassify securities and include them in a hedged closed portfolio. Effective for BancShares as of January 1, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. 

The guidance on hedging multiple layers in a closed portfolio is applied prospectively. The guidance on the accounting for fair value basis adjustments is applied on a modified retrospective basis. 

BancShares is currently evaluating timing of adoption of this guidance and the impact of the guidance on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 

ASU 2022-02, Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures 

Issued March 2022 

The amendments in this ASU eliminate the recognition and measurement guidance for TDRs for creditors that have adopted the CECL model and enhances disclosure requirements for loan refinancings and restructurings made with borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. 

The guidance also requires disclosure of current-period gross write-offs by year of origination in the vintage disclosure. 

Effective for BancShares as of January 1, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. 

Provides the option to early adopt the amendments related to TDRs separately from the amendments related to vintage disclosures. 

Allows adoption using either a prospective or modified retrospective transition methods. Under prospective method, entities are permitted to apply this guidance to modifications occurring after the first day of the fiscal year of adoption. If the modified retrospective transition method is elected, a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings is recorded in the period of adoption to recognize any change in the ACL that had been recognized for receivables previously modified in a TDR. 

BancShares is currently evaluating the transition methods along with the impact on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures, and plans to adopt the ASU at the effective date. 

GLOSSARY OF KEY TERMS 

To assist the users of this document, we have added the following Glossary of key terms: 

Allowance for Credit Losses (&#8220;ACL&#8221;) reflects the estimated credit losses over the full remaining expected life of the portfolio. See CECL below. 

Assets Held for Sale include loans and operating lease equipment that we no longer have the intent or ability to hold until maturity. As applicable, assets held for sale could also include a component of goodwill associated with portfolios or businesses held for sale. 

Available Cash consists of the unrestricted portions of &#8216;Cash and due from banks&#8217; and &#8216;Interest-bearing deposits at banks&#8217;, excluding cash not accessible for liquidity, such as vault cash and deposits in transit. 

Available for sale is a classification that pertains to debt securities. We classify debt securities as available for sale when they are not considered trading securities, securities carried at fair value, or held-to-maturity securities. Available for sale securities are included in investment securities in the balance sheet. 

Average Interest-Earning Assets is a measure that is the sum of average loans and leases (as defined below, less the credit balances of factoring clients), loans and leases held for sale, interest-bearing cash, and investment securities. Average interest earning assets is computed using daily balances of Interest-Earning Assets . We use this average for certain key profitability ratios, including NIM (as defined below) for the respective period. 

Average Loans and Leases is computed using daily balances and is used to measure the rate of return on loans and leases (finance leases) and the rate of net charge-offs, for the respective period. 

Capital Conservation Buffer (&#8220;CCB&#8221;) is the excess 2.5% of each of the capital tiers that banks are required to hold in accordance with Basel III rules, above the minimum CET 1 Capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital requirements, designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. 

Common Equity Tier 1 ("CET1"), Additional Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital, Tier 2 Capital, and Total Capital are regulatory capital measures as defined in the capital adequacy guidelines issued by the Federal Reserve. CET1 is common stockholders' equity reduced by capital deductions such as goodwill, intangible assets and DTAs that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and adjusted by elements of other comprehensive income and other items. Tier 1 Capital is Common Equity Tier 1 Capital plus other Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments, including non-cumulative preferred stock. Total Capital consists of Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital, which includes subordinated debt, and qualifying allowance for credit losses and other reserves. 

Current Expected Credit Losses (&#8220;CECL&#8221;) is a forward-looking &#8220;expected loss&#8221; model used to estimate credit losses over the full remaining expected life of the portfolio. Estimates under the CECL model are based on relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts regarding the collectability of reported amounts. Generally, the model requires that an ACL be estimated and recognized for financial assets measured at amortized cost within its scope. 

Delinquent Loan categorization occurs when payment is not received when contractually due. Delinquent loan trends are used as a gauge of potential portfolio degradation or improvement. 

Derivative Contract is a contract whose value is derived from a specified asset or an index, such as an interest rate. As the value of that asset or index changes, so does the value of the derivative contract. 

Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity ("EVE Sensitivity") measures the net impact of hypothetical changes on the value of equity by assessing the economic value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments. 

Finance leases - lessor is an agreement in which the party who owns the property (lessor), which is BancShares as part of our finance business, permits another party (lessee), which is our customer, to use the property with substantially all of the economic benefits and risks of asset ownership passed to the lessee. Finance leases are commonly known as sales-type leases and direct finance leases and are included in the consolidated balance sheet in the line &#8220;Loans and leases.&#8221; 

High Quality Liquid Securities (&#8220;HQLS&#8221;) consist of readily-marketable, unpledged securities, as well as securities pledged but not drawn against at the FHLB and available for sale, and generally is comprised of Treasury and Agency securities held outright or via reverse repurchase agreements. 

Impaired Loan is a loan for which, based on current information and events, it is probable that BancShares will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. 

Interest income includes interest earned on loans, interest-bearing cash balances, debt investments and dividends on investments. 

Liquid Assets includes Available Cash and HQLS. 

Loans and Leases include loans, finance lease receivables, and factoring receivables, and do not include amounts contained within assets held for sale (unless otherwise noted) or operating leases. 

Loan-to-Value Ratio ("LTV") is a calculation of a loan's collateral coverage that is used in underwriting and assessing risk in our lending portfolio. LTV is calculated as the total loan obligations (unpaid principal balance) secured by collateral divided by the fair value of the collateral. 

Net Interest Income (&#8220;NII&#8221;) reflects interest and fees on loans, interest on interest-bearing cash, and interest/dividends on investments less interest expense on deposits and borrowings. When divided by average interest earning assets, the quotient is defined as Net Interest Margin ("NIM"). 

Net Interest Income Sensitivity ("NII Sensitivity") measures the net impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates on forecasted NII. 

Net Operating Loss Carryforward / Carryback ("NOLs") is a tax concept, whereby tax losses in one year can be used to offset taxable income in other years. The rules pertaining to the number of years allowed for the carryback or carryforward of an NOL varies by jurisdiction. 

Non-accrual Loans include loans greater than or equal to $500,000 that are individually evaluated and determined to be impaired, as well as loans less than $500,000 that are delinquent (generally for 90 days or more), unless it is both well secured and in the process of collection. Non-accrual loans also include loans with revenue recognition on a cash basis because of deterioration in the financial position of the borrower. 

Non-performing Assets include Non-accrual Loans , OREO, and repossessed assets. 

Operating leases - lessor is a lease in which BancShares retains ownership of the asset (operating lease equipment, net), collects rental payments, recognizes depreciation on the asset, and retains the risks of ownership, including obsolescence. 

Other Noninterest Income includes (1) fee income and other revenue, (2) wealth management services, (3) gains and losses on leasing equipment, net, (4) Service charges on deposit accounts, (5) factoring commissions, (6) cardholder services, net, (7) merchant services, (8) realized gains and losses on investment securities available for sale, net, (9) marketable equity securities gains and losses, net, (10) gain on acquisition, (11) gain and losses on extinguishments of debt, and (12) other income. 

Other Real Estate Owned ("OREO") is a term applied to real estate properties owned by a financial institution and are considered non-performing assets. 

Pledged Assets are those required under the collateral maintenance requirement in connection with borrowing availability at the FHLB, which are comprised primarily of consumer and commercial real estate loans and also include certain HQLS that are available for secured funding at the FHLB. 

Purchase Accounting Adjustments (&#8220;PAA&#8221;) reflect the fair value adjustments to acquired assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination. 

Purchased Credit Deteriorated (&#8220;PCD&#8221;) financial assets are acquired individual financial assets (or acquired groups of financial assets with similar risk characteristics) that as of the date of acquisition, have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination, as determined by an acquirer&#8217;s assessment. 

Regulatory Credit Classifications used by BancShares are as follows: 

&#8226; Pass &#8212; A pass rated asset is not adversely classified because it does not display any of the characteristics for adverse classification; 

&#8226; Special Mention &#8212; A special mention asset has potential weaknesses which deserve management&#8217;s close attention. If left uncorrected, such potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects or collateral position at some future date. Special mention assets are not adversely classified and do not warrant adverse classification; 

&#8226; Substandard &#8212; A substandard asset is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets classified as substandard generally have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. These assets are characterized by the distinct possibility of loss if the deficiencies are not corrected; 

&#8226; Doubtful &#8212; An asset classified as doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in an asset classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values; and 

&#8226; Loss &#8212; Assets classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value it is inappropriate to be carried as an asset. This classification is not necessarily equivalent to any potential for recovery or salvage value, but rather it is not appropriate to defer a full charge-off even though partial recovery may be affected in the future. 

Classified assets are rated as substandard, doubtful or loss based on the criteria outlined above. Classified assets can be accruing or on non-accrual depending on the evaluation of the relevant factors. Classified loans plus special mention loans are considered criticized loans. 

Residual Values for finance leases represent the estimated value of equipment at the end of its lease term. For operating lease equipment, it is the value to which the asset is depreciated at the end of lease term or at the end of estimated useful life. 

Right of Use Asset (&#8220;ROU Asset&#8221;) represents our right, as lessee, to use underlying assets for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the leases. 

Risk Weighted Assets ("RWA") is the denominator to which CET1, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital is compared to derive the respective risk based regulatory ratios. RWA is comprised of both on-balance sheet assets and certain off-balance sheet items (for example loan commitments, purchase commitments or derivative contracts). RWA items are adjusted by certain risk-weightings as defined by the regulators, which are based upon, among other things, the relative credit risk of the counterparty. 

Troubled Debt Restructuring ("TDR") occurs when a lender, for economic or legal reasons, grants a concession to the borrower related to the borrower's financial difficulties that it would not otherwise consider. 

Variable Interest Entity ("VIE") is a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or any other legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets. These entities: lack sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties; have equity owners who either do not have voting rights or lack the ability to make significant decisions affecting the entity's operations; and/or have equity owners that do not have an obligation to absorb the entity's losses or the right to receive the entity's returns. 

Yield-related Fees are collected in connection with our assumption of underwriting risk in certain transactions in addition to interest income. We recognize yield-related origination fees in interest income over the life of the lending transaction and recognize yield-related prepayment fees when the loan is prepaid. 

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASUREMENTS 

BancShares provides certain non-GAAP information in reporting its financial results to give investors additional data to evaluate its operations. A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company&#8217;s historical or future financial performance or financial position that may either exclude or include amounts or is adjusted in some way to the effect of including or excluding amounts, as compared to the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP financial statements. BancShares believes that non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial information, can provide transparency about, or an alternate means of assessing, its operating results and financial position to its investors, analysts and management. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not superior to or a substitute for, GAAP measures presented in BancShares&#8217; consolidated financial statements and other publicly filed reports. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other institutions. 

Whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure we will generally define and present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, along with a reconciliation between the U.S. GAAP financial measure and the non-GAAP financial measure. We describe each of these measures below and explain why we believe the measure to be useful. 

The following table provides a reconciliation of net income (GAAP) to net revenue on operating leases (non-GAAP) for the Rail Segment. 

Net Revenue on Operating Leases for Rail Segment 

Net revenue on operating leases within the Rail segment is calculated as gross revenue earned on rail car leases less depreciation and maintenance. This metric allows us to monitor the performance and profitability of the rail leases after deducting direct expenses. 

The table below presents a reconciliation of net income to net revenue on operating leases.
