 Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Management&#8217;s discussion and analysis (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;) of earnings and related financial data is presented to assist in understanding BancShares&#8217; financial condition and results of operations. Unless otherwise noted, the terms &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; and &#8220;BancShares&#8221; in this MD&#38;A refer to our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. 

This MD&#38;A is expected to provide our investors with a view of our financial condition and results of operations from our management&#8217;s perspective. This MD&#38;A should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Throughout this MD&#38;A, references to a specific &#8220;Note&#8221; refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Although certain amounts for prior years have been reclassified to conform to statement presentations for 2022, the reclassifications had no effect on stockholders&#8217; equity or net income as previously reported. Refer to further detail in Note 1 &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation. 

Management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in its analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of BancShares. See the "Non-GAAP Financial Measurements" section of this MD&#38;A for a reconciliation of these financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with GAAP. 

On January 3, 2022, we completed the CIT Merger, our largest acquisition to date. CIT had consolidated total assets of approximately $53.24 billion as of December 31, 2021. The CIT Merger is described further below in the &#8220;Significant Events in 2022&#8221; section of this MD&#38;A and in Note 2 &#8212; Business Combinations. 

BancShares&#8217; financial data for periods prior to the CIT Merger does not include CIT, and therefore may not be directly comparable to data as of or for the year ended December 31, 2022. The CIT Merger is a primary reason for many of the increases in 2022 compared to 2021 as discussed below in the &#8220;Results of Operations&#8221; and &#8220;Balance Sheet&#8221; sections of this MD&#38;A. 

Year-over-year comparisons of the financial results for 2021 and 2020 are contained in Item 7. of BancShares&#8217; Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ending December 31, 2021 filed with the SEC on February 25, 2022 and available through FCB&#8217;s investor relations website www.ir.firstcitizens.com or the SEC&#8217;s EDGAR database.

Significant Events in 2022 

CIT Merger 

The CIT Merger closed on January 3, 2022 as further discussed in Note 2 &#8212; Business Combinations. Significant items related to the CIT Merger are as follows: 

&#8226; The fair value of total assets acquired was $53.78 billion, which mainly consisted of approximately $32.71 billion of loans, approximately $7.84 billion of operating lease equipment and approximately $6.56 billion of investment securities. Loans consisted of commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans and finance leases, which are included in our Commercial Banking segment, and consumer loans (primarily residential mortgages), which are in our General Banking segment. Acquired rail assets were mostly operating lease equipment and reported in the Rail segment. 

&#8226; The fair value of deposits acquired was approximately $39.43 billion, which included deposits derived from the Digital Bank, Homeowners&#8217; Association (&#8220;HOA&#8221;) deposits related to Community Association Banking (&#8220;CAB&#8221;), and commercial deposits. The transaction also included approximately 80 bank branches, about 60 of which were in Southern California, and the remaining primarily in the Southwest, Midwest and Southeast. 

&#8226; FCB assumed certain issued and outstanding series of CIT debt securities with a fair value of approximately $4.54 billion in connection with the CIT Merger. On February 24, 2022, BancShares redeemed approximately $2.90 billion of senior unsecured notes that were assumed in the CIT Merger. 

&#8226; BancShares recorded a gain on acquisition of $431 million, representing the excess of the net assets acquired over the purchase price, core deposit intangibles of $143 million, and an intangible liability of $52 million for net below market lessor lease contract rental rates related to the rail portfolio. 

Share Repurchase Program 

On July 26, 2022, our Board authorized a share repurchase program for up to 1,500,000 shares of BancShares&#8217; Class A common stock for the period commencing August 1, 2022 through July 28, 2023. All shares under the program were repurchased during 2022, thereby completing the share repurchase program. See Item 5. Market for Registrant&#8217;s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details on these purchases.

Year to Date Income Statement Highlights 

&#8226; Net income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $1.10 billion, an increase of $551 million, or 101% compared to 2021. Net income available to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $1.05 billion, an increase of $519 million, or 98% compared to 2021. Net income per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $67.40, an increase of 25% compared to 2021. The increases were primarily due to the CIT Merger. 

&#8226; Return on average assets for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 1.01%, compared to 1.00% for 2021. 

&#8226; Net interest income (&#8220;NII&#8221;) for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $2.95 billion, an increase of $1.56 billion, or 112% compared to 2021. This increase was primarily due to the CIT Merger, loan growth and higher yields on interest-earning assets, partially offset by higher rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and a decline in interest income on SBA-PPP loans. 

&#8226; Net interest margin (&#8220;NIM&#8221;) for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 3.14%, an increase of 48 bps compared to 2.66% in 2021. The increase in NIM was primarily due to the increase in yield on interest-earning assets, partially offset by an increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. 

&#8226; Provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $645 million, compared to a benefit of $37 million in 2021. The provision for credit losses in 2022 included a provision of $513 million for non-purchased credit deteriorated (&#8220;Non-PCD&#8221;) loans, leases and unfunded commitments acquired in the CIT Merger (the &#8220;Day 2 provision for credit losses&#8221;). The 2022 provision for credit losses reflects the CIT Merger, loan growth, and deterioration in the economic outlook, partially offset by a change in portfolio mix. The net charge-off ratio for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 0.12%, compared to 0.03% for 2021. 

&#8226; Noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $2.14 billion, an increase of $1.63 billion compared to $508 million for 2021. The year ended December 31, 2022 includes a gain on acquisition of $431 million. The remaining increase was primarily due to the added activity from the CIT Merger, including rental income on operating lease equipment of $864 million. 

&#8226; Noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $3.08 billion, an increase of $1.84 billion compared to $1.23 billion for 2021. The increase was primarily associated with the CIT Merger, including higher salaries and benefits of $637 million primarily due to the increase in employees, $534 million of depreciation and maintenance costs associated with operating lease equipment and an increase in merger-related expenses of $202 million. 

&#8226; Select significant items for the year ended December 31, 2022 follow: 

&#8226; Day 2 provision for credit losses of $513 million; 

&#8226; Gain on acquisition of $431 million in noninterest income, representing the excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the purchase price; 

&#8226; Merger-related expenses of $231 million in noninterest expense; 

&#8226; A reduction of $27 million in other noninterest expense related to the termination of certain post retirement plans assumed in the CIT Merger; and 

&#8226; Income tax expense of $55 million related to the strategic decision to exit $1.25 billion of BOLI policies as discussed further below in the &#8220;Fourth Quarter Analysis&#8221; section of this MD&#38;A. 

Balance Sheet Highlights 

&#8226; Total loans and leases at December 31, 2022 were $70.78 billion, an increase of $38.41 billion from December 31, 2021, primarily reflecting the addition of $32.71 billion from the CIT Merger. In addition, during 2022 we continued to see growth in our branch network, as well as growth in our Commercial Banking segment from a number of our industry verticals, such as healthcare and technology, equipment financing, and growth in both commercial and consumer mortgage loans. 

&#8226; Total deposits at December 31, 2022 were $89.41 billion, an increase of $38.00 billion from December 31, 2021, reflecting the addition of $39.43 billion from the CIT Merger. Total deposits declined during the second and third quarters of 2022, reflecting the most rate sensitive customers moving funds in response to increases in the target federal funds rate. This decline in total deposits was primarily concentrated in branches acquired in the CIT Merger and the Commercial Banking segment. Deposits increased during the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily related to the Direct Bank, and the Corporate segment which includes brokered deposits. In the fourth quarter of 2022, increases in savings and time deposit accounts offset declines in noninterest-bearing demand accounts and money market accounts. 

&#8226; At December 31, 2022, BancShares remained well-capitalized with a total risk-based capital ratio of 13.18%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 11.06%, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.08% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 8.99%. 

Recent Economic and Industry Developments 

Throughout 2022, the FOMC significantly raised its target for the federal funds rate in an effort to combat rising inflation. The FOMC raised interest rates at its respective meetings during 2022, as follows: 

Table 2 

FOMC 2022 Interest Rate Increases 

##TABLE_START Month 25 basis point increase 50 basis point increase 75 basis point increase March X May, December X June, July, September, November X ##TABLE_END

With the latest increase of 25 basis points at the January 2023 meeting, the FOMC raised their benchmark federal funds rate to a range between 4.50% - 4.75% and signaled possible further increases in 2023. The FOMC&#8217;s effort to control inflation has increased concerns over the possibility of a recession within the next twelve months. In addition, geopolitical events, including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and related events, are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity. The timing and impact of inflation, continued volatility in the stock market, rising interest rates and possible recession will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

NET INTEREST INCOME AND NET INTEREST MARGIN 

NII is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities. NII is affected by changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The following table presents the average balances, yields on interest-earning assets, rates on interest-bearing liabilities, and year-over-year changes in NII due to changes in: (i) volume (average balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities) and (ii) yields or rates. 

&#8226; The change in NII due to volume is calculated as the change in average balance multiplied by the yield or rate from the prior year. 

&#8226; The change in NII due to yield or rate is calculated as the change in yield or rate multiplied by the average balance from the prior year. 

&#8226; The change in NII due to rate/volume change (i.e. portfolio mix) is calculated as the change in rate multiplied by the change in volume. This component is allocated between the changes in NII due to volume and yield or rate based on the ratio each component bears to the absolute value of their total. 

&#8226; Tax equivalent net interest income was not materially different from NII, therefore we present NII in our analysis.

Year to Date 2022 compared to 2021 

&#8226; NII for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $2.95 billion, an increase of $1.56 billion, or 112% compared to 2021. This increase was primarily due to the CIT Merger, loan growth and higher yields on interest-earning assets, partially offset by higher rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and a decline in interest income on SBA-PPP loans. 

&#9702; Interest income earned on loans and leases for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $2.95 billion, an increase of $1.66 billion compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to the addition of $32.71 billion of loans and leases acquired in the CIT Merger, loan growth throughout the year as discussed further in the &#8220;Balance Sheet&#8221; section of this MD&#38;A, and a higher yield, reflective of the higher rate environment. 

&#9702; Interest income earned on investment securities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $354 million, an increase of $209 million compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to the addition of $6.56 billion of investment securities acquired in the CIT Merger and a higher yield, reflective of the higher rate environment. 

&#9702; Interest income earned on interest-earning deposits at banks for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $106 million, an increase of $95 million compared to 2021, primarily reflecting higher interest rates. 

&#9702; Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $335 million, an increase of $302 million compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to the additional interest-bearing deposits assumed in the CIT Merger, which carried a higher average rate than legacy FCB deposits, the rising interest rate environment, and the need to offer competitive rates to maintain deposit levels. 

&#9702; Interest expense on borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $132 million, an increase of $104 million compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher interest rates, additional FHLB borrowings, and the assumed borrowings in the CIT Merger. During the first quarter of 2022, we redeemed approximately $2.90 billion of the $4.54 billion debt assumed in the CIT Merger. 

&#8226; NIM for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 3.14%, an increase of 48 bps from 2021, primarily due to the increase in yield on interest-earning assets, partially offset by an increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. 

&#8226; Average interest-earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $93.53 billion, compared to $51.82 billion in 2021. The change was primarily due to the interest-earning assets of $42.34 billion acquired in the CIT Merger and the loan growth during the year. 

&#8226; Average interest-bearing liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $68.89 billion. This was an increase from $29.35 billion in 2021, primarily due to the addition of deposits and borrowings from the CIT Merger. In addition, we increased FHLB borrowings during 2022 to supplement funding due to the decrease in deposits during the second and third quarters. With the growth in deposits in the fourth quarter, we were able to rebalance our funding mix of deposits and borrowings and reduced our FHLB borrowings. The rate paid on average interest-bearing liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 0.68%. This 47 bps increase was primarily due to the impact of the higher rate environment on both deposits and borrowings, and the higher costs of deposits and borrowings assumed in the CIT Merger. 

The following table includes average interest earning assets by category.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES 

The provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $645 million, which included $551 million for loans and leases and $94 million for unfunded commitments, compared to a benefit of $37 million in 2021. The increase in 2022 was primarily due to the Day 2 provision for credit losses of $513 million, which was composed of a provision for loans and leases of $454 million (the &#8220;Day 2 provision for loans and leases&#8221;) and a provision for unfunded commitments of $59 million (the &#8220;Day 2 provision for unfunded commitments&#8221;), related to the CIT Merger. Loan growth during 2022 and deterioration in the economic outlook also contributed to the increase as further discussed in the &#8220;Credit Risk Management - ACL&#8221; section of this MD&#38;A. The ACL is further discussed in the &#8220;Critical Accounting Estimates&#8221; and &#8220;Credit Risk Management - ACL&#8221; sections of this MD&#38;A and in Note 5 &#8212; Allowance for Credit Losses. 

NONINTEREST INCOME 

Noninterest Income 

Noninterest income is an essential component of our total revenue. The primary sources of noninterest income consist of rental income on operating leases, fee income and other service charges, wealth management services, fees and service charges generated from deposit accounts, cardholder and merchant services, factoring commissions and mortgage lending and servicing.

Rental Income on Operating Leases 

Rental income from equipment we lease for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $864 million. Rental income is a new revenue source for BancShares in 2022 due to the CIT Merger. Rental income is generated primarily in the Rail segment and, to a lesser extent, in the Commercial Banking segment. Revenue is generally dictated by the size of the portfolio, utilization of the railcars, re-pricing of equipment renewed upon lease maturities and pricing on new leases. Re-pricing refers to the rental rate in the renewed equipment contract compared to the prior contract. Refer to the Rail discussion in the &#8220;Results by Business Segment&#8221; section of this MD&#38;A for further details. 

Other Noninterest Income 

Other noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $1.27 billion, compared to $508 million in 2021. The $431 million gain on acquisition related to the CIT Merger was a significant component of the increase as further discussed in Note 2 &#8212; Business Combinations. The remaining increase was primarily due to the additional activity related to the CIT Merger, both complimentary to existing BancShares services and products, as well as expanding offerings with new items such as factoring services. 

The comparison for the year ended December 31, 2022 to the year ended December 31, 2021 reflects increases and decreases among various noninterest income accounts. The more significant variances are explained below. 

&#8226; Fee income and other service charges, consisting of items such as capital market-related fees, fees for lines and letters of credit, and servicing fees, increased by $121 million, primarily reflecting the added CIT activity. 

&#8226; Wealth management services increased by $13 million, primarily due to increases in advisory and transactions fees and assets under management. 

&#8226; Service charges on deposit accounts increased by $5 million. While the volume of transactions was higher compared to 2021, the modest increase in service charges on deposit accounts was reflective of our eliminating NSF fees and lowering overdraft fees on consumer accounts beginning mid-year 2022. 

&#8226; Factoring commissions totaled $104 million during 2022 on factoring volume of $26.13 billion. 

&#8226; Cardholder services increased by $15 million and merchant services increased by $2 million, primarily due to increases in the volume of transactions processed. 

&#8226; Insurance commissions increased by $31 million, reflecting activity related to the CIT Merger. 

&#8226; Realized gains on sale of investment securities decreased by $33 million. 

&#8226; The fair market value adjustment on marketable equity securities resulted in a $37 million decline in noninterest income, reflecting lower stock prices on equity securities. 

&#8226; BOLI income increased by $29 million due to the added policies with the CIT Merger. However, management decided in late 2022 to surrender $1.25 billion of BOLI policies early, and redeploy that cash into higher earning assets. Therefore, BOLI income going forward will be lower than the 2022 level. A portion of the proceeds were collected in December, with the remainder expected to be received throughout 2023. Income tax expense of $55 million was recognized related to the early surrender of the BOLI policies. See Note 21 &#8212; Income Taxes and Note 10 &#8212; Other Assets. 

&#8226; Gain on sale of leasing equipment totaled $15 million during 2022, primarily related to equipment sold in the Commercial Banking segment. 

&#8226; The gain on extinguishment of debt primarily related to the redemption of approximately $2.90 billion of borrowings assumed in the CIT Merger, resulting in a $7 million gain. 

&#8226; Other noninterest income consisted of items such as gain on sales of other assets including OREO, fixed assets and loans and non-marketable securities. The year ended December 31, 2022 included: $18 million of property tax income, net gain of $15 million related derivatives and foreign currency exchange, $14 million gain on sale of OREO property, $6 million gain on sale of a corporate aircraft acquired in the CIT Merger, and $5 million settlement gain related to returned leasing equipment.

Depreciation on Operating Lease Equipment 

Depreciation expense on operating lease equipment is primarily related to rail equipment and small and large ticket equipment we own and lease to others. Periodically, depreciation expense could include adjustments to residual values. Operating lease activity is in the Rail and Commercial Banking segments. The useful lives of rail equipment is generally longer in duration, 40-50 years, whereas small and large ticket equipment is generally 3-10 years. Refer to the Rail discussion in the section entitled &#8220;Results by Business Segments&#8221; of this MD&#38;A for further details. 

Maintenance and Other Operating Lease Expenses 

Our Rail segment provides railcars primarily pursuant to full-service lease contracts under which Rail as lessor is responsible for railcar maintenance and repair. Maintenance and other operating lease expenses is recorded when incurred and totaled $189 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Maintenance and other operating lease expenses relate to equipment ownership and leasing costs associated with the Rail portfolio and tend to be variable. Maintenance and other operating lease expenses includes repair costs for railcars put back on lease and storage costs for cars coming off lease. Refer to the Rail discussion in the section entitled &#8220;Results by Business Segments&#8221; of this MD&#38;A for further details. 

Operating Expenses 

The primary components of operating expenses are salaries and related employee benefits, occupancy, and equipment expense. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $2.54 billion, an increase of $1.31 billion compared to $1.23 billion in 2021. The increase was primarily related to the CIT Merger due to factors such as higher employee headcount, higher merger-related expenses, more branches and office space, and additional technology systems as further described below. 

&#8226; Salaries and benefits increased by $637 million, primarily reflecting higher salary expense due to the CIT Merger, as well as new hires, promotions and other salary adjustments, higher costs for temporary workers, and higher revenue-based incentive compensation, partially offset by lower employee benefit costs. The staff additions were the result of building out teams to support our move to large bank compliance, as well as to backfill vacancies. 

&#8226; Net occupancy expense increased $77 million, reflecting added branches and office space from the CIT Merger. Net occupancy expense includes rent expense on leased office space and depreciation on buildings we own. 

&#8226; Equipment expense increased $97 million, primarily reflecting the additional costs for the IT systems from the CIT Merger. 

&#8226; Professional fees increased $37 million, primarily reflecting higher levels of accounting, consulting and legal costs associated with being a larger company. 

&#8226; Third-party processing fees increased $43 million, primarily as a result of the CIT Merger and our continued investments in digital and technology to support revenue-generating businesses and improve internal processes. 

&#8226; FDIC insurance expense increased $17 million, reflecting the additional deposits acquired in the CIT Merger. 

&#8226; Marketing expense increased by $43 million, which includes marketing efforts related to the Direct Bank. 

&#8226; Merger-related expenses increased by $202 million, and includes severance, retention, consulting and legal costs. 

&#8226; Intangible amortization increased $11 million, as a result of additional amortization on core deposit intangibles related to the CIT Merger. See Note 2 &#8212; Business Combinations for additional information. 

&#8226; Other noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $237 million, an increase of $143 million. The increase was primarily related to the impacts of the CIT Merger. Other expenses included costs related to insurance and other taxes (e.g. property tax), telecommunications, travel, consulting, foreclosure, collections, and appraisals. Some of the larger expense categories for the year ended December 31, 2022 included: insurance and taxes of $40 million, telecommunication expenses of $23 million, property tax expenses of $20 million and travel expenses of $17 million. 

INCOME TAXES

Income Tax Data 

##TABLE_START dollars in millions Year ended December 31 2022 2021 2020 Income before income taxes $ 1,362 $ 701 $ 618 Income taxes 264 154 126 Effective tax rate 19.4 % 22.0 % 20.4 % ##TABLE_END

BancShares&#8217; global effective tax rate (&#8220;ETR&#8221;) was 19.4%, 22.0% and 20.4% for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in the income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 from the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to the non-taxable nature of the bargain purchase gain from the CIT Merger, partially offset by the surrender of certain BOLI policies. In the fourth quarter, BancShares made a strategic decision to exit $1.25 billion of BOLI policies. The surrender of the policies resulted in a total tax charge of $55 million. 

The ETR is impacted by a number of factors, including the relative mix of domestic and international earnings, effects of changes in enacted tax laws, adjustments to valuation allowances, and discrete items. The ETR in future periods may vary from the actual 2022 ETR due to changes in these factors. 

BancShares monitors and evaluates the potential impact of current events on the estimates used to establish income tax expense and income tax liabilities. On a periodic basis, we evaluate our income tax positions based on current tax law, positions taken by various tax auditors within the jurisdictions where BancShares is required to file income tax returns, as well as potential or pending audits or assessments by tax auditors. 

BancShares has determined that the Inflation Reduction Act signed into law on August 16, 2022 effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022 is not expected to have a material impact on BancShares&#8217; Consolidated Balance Sheets, Statements of Income, and Statements of Changes of Cash Flows. 

See Note 21 &#8212; Income Taxes for additional information. 

RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT 

Prior to the CIT Merger, BancShares operated with centralized management and combined reporting and, therefore, BancShares operated as one consolidated reportable segment. BancShares began reporting multiple segments during the first quarter of 2022 and now reports General Banking, Commercial Banking, Rail, and Corporate segments. We conformed the comparative prior periods presented to reflect the new segments. The substantial majority of BancShares&#8217; operations for historical periods prior to completion of the CIT Merger are included in the General Banking segment. The Commercial Banking and Rail segments primarily relate to operations acquired in the CIT Merger. 

For detailed descriptions of each of the segment&#8217;s products and services, refer to Item 1. Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 23 &#8212; Business Segments. Results in our segments reflect our funds transfer policy and allocation of expenses. Items not allocated to any of the three operating segments and, when applicable, certain select items, are reflected in the Corporate segment. 

General Banking 

The General Banking segment delivers products and services to consumers and businesses through our extensive network of branches and various digital channels. We offer a full suite of deposit products, loans, cash management, wealth, payments and various other fee-based services.

Results for 2022 include additional activity from the CIT Merger. 

The increase in net income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was due to higher NII and noninterest income, partially offset by higher provision for credit losses and noninterest expense. NII increased due to the added earning assets from the CIT Merger, as well as solid loan growth during the year. The increase in the provision for credit losses reflects the higher loans and leases, due to the CIT Merger and growth, as well as moderate deterioration in the macroeconomic forecasts. Noninterest expense increased reflecting the CIT Merger, and items discussed in the consolidated section entitled &#8220;Noninterest Expenses&#8221; of this MD&#38;A. 

The increase in loans and leases at December 31, 2022 reflected the additional residential mortgages and consumer loans acquired in the CIT Merger, partially offset by run-off of SBA-PPP loans. Subsequent to the CIT Merger, loans and leases increased, reflecting strong demand through our branch network. Growth was primarily concentrated in commercial and business loans. Our consumer mortgage loans grew modestly, reflecting lower prepayments and originating loans (primarily adjustable rate mortgage products) that were held on-balance sheet. 

Deposits include deposits from the branch, Direct Bank, and CAB channels. The additional branches acquired in the CIT Merger were mostly in California. The increase in deposits at December 31, 2022 was reflective of deposits acquired in the CIT Merger. Subsequent to the CIT Merger, deposits declined during the second and third quarters, reflecting lower money market accounts, partially offset by an increase in savings accounts. Deposits grew in the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due to growth in savings accounts and time deposits, partially offset by a decline in noninterest checking. 

For further information, refer to the discussions in the &#8220;Net Interest Income,&#8221; &#8220;Net Interest Margin&#8221; and &#8220;Balance Sheet Analysis&#8212;Interest-Bearing Liabilities&#8212;Deposits&#8221; sections of this MD&#38;A. 

Commercial Banking 

The Commercial Banking segment provides a range of lending, leasing, capital markets, asset management and other financial and advisory services primarily to small and middle market companies in a wide range of industries.

Results for 2022 primarily reflected activity from the legacy CIT commercial businesses. 

The increase in net income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was due to higher NII and noninterest income, partially offset by higher provision for credit losses and noninterest expense. The provision for credit losses reflects moderate deterioration in the macroeconomic forecasts and loan portfolio growth. Net interest income increased due to the added earning assets from the CIT Merger, as well as solid loan growth during the year. Noninterest income included rental income on operating lease equipment acquired in the CIT Merger of $212 million. Noninterest expense included operating expenses, and depreciation on operating lease equipment of $169 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 included items discussed previously in the &#8220;Noninterest Expense&#8221; section of this MD&#38;A. 

The increases in loans and leases and deposits at December 31, 2022 were primarily due to those acquired in the CIT Merger. Subsequent to the CIT Merger, loans and leases increased, reflecting growth related to equipment finance, as well as from a number of our industry verticals, such as healthcare and technology. This segment also includes our factoring business acquired in the CIT Merger. 

For further information, refer to the discussions in the &#8220;Net Interest Income,&#8221; &#8220;Net Interest Margin&#8221; and &#8220;Balance Sheet Analysis&#8212;Interest-Bearing Liabilities&#8212;Deposits&#8221; sections of this MD&#38;A. 

Rail 

Our Rail segment offers customized leasing and financing solutions on a fleet of railcars and locomotives to railroads and shippers throughout North America. Railcar types include covered hopper cars used to ship grain and agricultural products, plastic pellets, sand, and cement; tank cars for energy products and chemicals; gondolas for coal, steel coil and mill service products; open hopper cars for coal and aggregates; boxcars for paper and auto parts, and center beams and flat cars for lumber. Revenues are primarily generated from rental income on operating leases.

See the &#8220;Non-GAAP Financial Measures&#8221; section of this MD&#38;A for a reconciliation from the GAAP measure (segment net income) to the non-GAAP measure (adjusted rental income on operating lease equipment). 

Net income and adjusted rental income on operating lease equipment are utilized to measure the profitability of our Rail segment. Adjusted rental income on operating lease equipment reflects rental income on operating lease equipment less depreciation, maintenance and other operating lease expenses. Maintenance and other operating lease expenses relate to equipment ownership and leasing costs associated with the Rail portfolio and tend to be variable. Due to the nature of our portfolio, which is essentially all operating lease equipment, certain financial measures commonly used by banks, such as NII, are not as meaningful for this segment. NII is not used because it includes the impact of debt costs funding our operating lease assets but excludes the associated net rental income. 

Net income and adjusted rental income on operating lease equipment for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $112 million and $287 million, respectively. Railcar depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated service life of the asset. Maintenance and other operating lease expenses reflect costs for railcars put back on lease. Other noninterest income included a $5 million settlement gain related to returned lease equipment. 

Our fleet is diverse and the average re-pricing of equipment upon lease maturities was 130% of the average prior or expiring lease rate during the fourth quarter. Our railcar utilization, including commitments to lease, at December 31, 2022 was 97.7%. 

Portfolio 

Rail customers include all of the U.S. and Canadian Class I railroads (i.e., railroads with annual revenues of approximately $500 million and greater), other railroads, as well as manufacturers and commodity shippers. Our total operating lease fleet at December 31, 2022 consisted of approximately 119,200 railcars, up slightly from approximately 118,700 railcars acquired in the CIT Merger. The following table reflects the proportion of railcars by type based on units and net investment, respectively:

Results for the year ended December 31, 2022 were primarily due to impacts from the CIT Merger, as well as net benefit from rising rates on NII. Merger-related items included the Day 2 provision for credit losses of $513 million, a gain on acquisition of $431 million in noninterest income, $231 million of merger-related expenses, a reduction of $27 million in other noninterest expense related to the termination of certain post retirement plans assumed in the CIT Merger, and income tax expense of $55 million related to the strategic decision to surrender $1.25 billion of BOLI policies. The income tax rate also reflects the impact of the non-taxable gain on acquisition. 

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS 

INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS 

Interest-earning assets include interest-earning deposits at banks, investment securities, assets held for sale and loans and leases, all of which reflect varying interest rates based on the risk level and repricing characteristics of the underlying asset. Higher risk investments typically carry a higher interest rate, but expose us to higher levels of market and/or credit risk. We strive to maintain a high level of interest-earning assets relative to total assets, while keeping non-earning assets at a minimum. 

Interest-earning Deposits at Banks 

Interest-earning deposits at banks at December 31, 2022 totaled $5.03 billion. This was a decrease from $9.12 billion at December 31, 2021. The decline related to loan growth, the decline in total deposits, and $1.24 billion used for share repurchases. While the CIT Merger added approximately $2.87 billion of interest-earning deposits at banks as of the Merger Date, that amount was offset by the use of cash for the redemption in February of approximately $2.90 billion of debt assumed in the CIT Merger. 

Investment Securities 

The primary objective of the investment portfolio is to generate incremental income by deploying excess funds into securities that have minimal liquidity risk and low to moderate interest rate risk and credit risk. Other objectives include acting as a stable source of liquidity, serving as a tool for asset and liability management and maintaining an interest rate risk profile compatible with BancShares&#8217; objectives. Additionally, purchases of equities and corporate bonds in other financial institutions have been made under a long-term earnings optimization strategy. Changes in the total balance of our investment securities portfolio result from trends in balance sheet funding and market performance. Generally, when inflows arising from deposit and treasury services products exceed loan and lease demand, we invest excess funds into the securities portfolio or into interest-earning deposits at banks. Conversely, when loan demand exceeds growth in deposits and short-term borrowings, we allow interest-earning deposits at banks to decline and use proceeds from maturing securities and prepayments to fund loan growth. See Note 1 &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation and Note 3 &#8212; Investment Securities for additional disclosures regarding investment securities. 

The carrying value of investment securities at December 31, 2022 totaled $19.37 billion. The increase from $13.11 billion at December 31, 2021 primarily reflected the CIT Merger, which added $6.56 billion. The remaining activity during 2022 included purchases of $2.74 billion, maturities and paydowns of $2.07 billion, and other non-cash items, such as fair value changes and amortization. 

BancShares&#8217; portfolio of investment securities available for sale consists of mortgage-backed securities issued by government agencies and government sponsored entities, U.S. Treasury notes, unsecured bonds issued by government agencies and government sponsored entities and corporate bonds. Investment securities available for sale are reported at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are included as a component of AOCI, net of deferred taxes. As of December 31, 2022, investment securities available for sale had a net pre-tax unrealized loss of $972 million, compared to a net pre-tax unrealized loss of $12 million as of December 31, 2021. The fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. The fair value of the investment securities portfolio generally decreases when interest rates increase or when credit spreads widen. Management evaluated the investment securities available for sale in an unrealized loss position and concluded that the unrealized losses related to changes in interest rates relative to when the securities were purchased, and that no ACL for investment securities available for sale was needed at December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

BancShares&#8217; portfolio of investment securities held to maturity consists of similar mortgage-backed securities, U.S. Treasury Notes and government agency securities described above, as well as securities issued by the Supranational Entities and Multilateral Development Banks and FDIC guaranteed CDs with other financial institutions. Given the consistently strong credit rating of the U.S. Treasury, the Supranational Entities and Multilateral Development Banks and the long history of no credit losses on debt securities issued by government agencies and government sponsored entities, BancShares management determined that no ACL was needed for investment securities held to maturity at December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

Table 15 presents the major categories of investment securities at December 31, 2022, and 2021.

(1) Residential mortgage-backed and commercial mortgage-backed securities, which are not due at a single maturity date, have been included in maturity groupings based on the contractual maturity at December 31, 2022. The expected life will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers have the right to prepay the underlying loans. 

Assets Held for Sale 

Certain residential mortgage loans and commercial loans are originated with the intent to be sold to investors or lenders, respectively, and are recorded in assets held for sale at fair value. In addition, BancShares may change its strategy for certain loans initially held for investment and decide to sell them in the secondary market. At that time, portfolio loans are transferred to loans held for sale at fair value. 

Assets held for sale at December 31, 2022 were $60 million, a decrease of $39 million compared to $99 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease is primarily related to the sale of residential mortgage loans held for sale during 2022, partially offset by the increase in commercial loans held for sale.

Loans and Leases 

Loans and leases held for investment at December 31, 2022 were $70.78 billion, an increase of $38.41 billion from $32.37 billion at December 31, 2021, primarily reflecting the addition of $32.71 billion from the CIT Merger. In addition, during 2022 we continued to see loan growth in our branch network, as well as growth in our Commercial Banking segment related to equipment finance, as well as from a number of our industry verticals, such as healthcare and technology, and growth in both commercial mortgage loans and consumer mortgage loans. 

Upon completion of the CIT Merger, we re-evaluated our loan classes to reflect the risk characteristics of the combined portfolio. BancShares reports its commercial loan portfolio in the following classes: commercial construction, owner occupied commercial mortgage, non-owner occupied commercial mortgage, commercial and industrial, and leases. The consumer portfolio includes residential mortgage, revolving mortgage, consumer auto and consumer other. Commercial loans at December 31, 2022 were $53.46 billion compared to $22.59 billion at December 31, 2021, representing 76% and 70% of total loans and leases, respectively. Consumer loans at December 31, 2022 were $17.33 billion, compared to $9.79 billion at December 31, 2021, representing 24% and 30% of total loans and leases, respectively.

The unamortized discount related to acquired loans was $118 million and $40 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as further discussed in Note 4 &#8212; Loans and Leases. 

OPERATING LEASE EQUIPMENT, NET 

As detailed in the following table, our operating lease portfolio is mostly comprised of rail assets. The operating lease portfolios were acquired in the CIT Merger. See the Rail segment discussion in the section entitled &#8220;Results by Business Segment&#8221; of this MD&#38;A for further details on the rail portfolio.

INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES 

Interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, securities sold under customer repurchase agreements, FHLB borrowings, subordinated debt, and other borrowings. Interest-bearing liabilities at December 31, 2022 totaled $71.13 billion, compared to $31.79 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase from December 31, 2021 was mostly due to deposits and borrowings from the CIT Merger and higher FHLB borrowings, partially offset by current year activity that included a decline in total deposits and the redemption of assumed debt during the first quarter. See Note 2 &#8212; Business Combinations for details on deposits and borrowings associated with the CIT Merger. 

Deposits 

Total deposits at December 31, 2022 were $89.41 billion, an increase of $38.00 billion compared to December 31, 2021, reflecting the addition of $39.43 billion from the CIT Merger. Total deposits declined during the second quarter and third quarters of 2022, reflecting the most rate sensitive customers moving funds in response to increases in the target federal funds rate. This decline in total deposits was primarily concentrated in branches acquired in the CIT Merger and the Commercial Banking segment. Deposits increased during the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily related to the Direct Bank and the Corporate segment which includes brokered deposits. In the fourth quarter of 2022, increases in savings and time deposit accounts offset declines in noninterest-bearing demand accounts and money market accounts. 

Interest-bearing deposits totaled $64.49 billion and $30.00 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Noninterest-bearing deposits totaled $24.92 billion and $21.41 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

The reduction in deposits since the CIT Merger were primarily concentrated in acquired higher cost channels. As part of the CIT Merger, we acquired the Digital Bank and an HOA deposit channel.

We strive to maintain a strong liquidity position, and therefore a focus on deposit retention remains a key business objective. We believe traditional bank deposit products remain an attractive option for many customers. As economic conditions change, we recognize that our liquidity position could be adversely affected if bank deposits are withdrawn. Our ability to fund future loan growth is significantly dependent on our success in retaining existing deposits and generating new deposits at a reasonable cost. 

Where information is not readily available to determine the amount of insured deposits, the amount of uninsured deposits is estimated, consistent with the methodologies and assumptions utilized in providing information to our regulators. We estimate total uninsured deposits were $29.13 billion and $22.95 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Table 21 provides the expected maturity of time deposits in excess of $250,000, the FDIC insurance limit, as of December 31, 2022.

Borrowings 

Total borrowings at December 31, 2022 were $6.65 billion, compared to $1.78 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase from December 31, 2021 reflected $4.54 billion of debt assumed in the CIT Merger, partially offset by a debt redemption of approximately $2.90 billion in February of 2022. The increase also reflected higher FHLB borrowings, which replaced net declines in interest-bearing deposits in the second and third quarters of 2022, and helped fund loan growth. We made net repayments of FHLB borrowings in the fourth quarter of 2022 following an increase in deposits. FHLB borrowings were $4.25 billion at December 31, 2022, including $1.75 billion in short-term borrowings and $2.50 billion in long-term borrowings. Total FHLB borrowings increased $3.61 billion compared to $645 million at December 31, 2021. Refer to the &#8220;Liquidity Risk&#8221; section below for more information on FHLB borrowings.

RISK MANAGEMENT 

Risk is inherent in any business. BancShares has defined a moderate risk appetite, a balanced approach to risk taking, with a philosophy which does not preclude higher risk business activities commensurate with acceptable returns while meeting regulatory objectives. Through the comprehensive Risk Management Framework and Risk Appetite Framework and Statement, senior management has primary responsibility for day-to-day management of the risks we face with accountability of and support from all associates. Senior management applies various strategies to reduce the risks to which BancShares may be exposed, with effective challenge and oversight by management committees. Our Board strives to ensure that risk management is a part of our business culture and that our policies and procedures for identifying, assessing, monitoring, and managing risk are part of the decision-making process. The Board&#8217;s role in risk oversight is an integral part of our overall Risk Management Framework and Risk Appetite Framework. The Board administers its risk oversight function primarily through its Risk Committee. 

The Risk Committee structure is designed to allow for information flow, effective challenge and timely escalation of risk-related issues. The Risk Committee is directed to monitor and advise the full Board regarding risk exposures, including Credit, Market, Capital, Liquidity, Operational, Compliance, Asset, Strategic and Reputational risks; review, approve, and monitor adherence to the Risk Appetite Statement and supporting risk tolerance levels via a series of established metrics; and evaluate, monitor and oversee the adequacy and effectiveness of the Risk Management Framework and Risk Appetite Framework and Statement. The Risk Committee also reviews reports of examination by and communications from regulatory agencies, the results of internal and third party testing and qualitative and quantitative assessments related to risk management, and any other matters within the scope of the Risk Committee&#8217;s oversight responsibilities. The Risk Committee monitors management&#8217;s response to certain risk-related regulatory and audit issues. In addition, the Risk Committee may coordinate with the Audit Committee and the Compensation, Nominations and Governance Committee for the review of financial statements and related risks, compensation risk management and other areas of joint responsibility. 

In combination with other risk management and monitoring practices, enterprise-wide stress testing activities are conducted within a defined framework. Stress tests are performed for various risks to ensure the financial institution can support continued operations during stressed periods. 

BancShares monitors and stress tests its capital and liquidity consistent with the safety and soundness expectations of the federal regulators. Refer to the &#8220;Regulatory Considerations&#8221; section of Item 1. Business included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. 

BancShares returned to business as usual operations and lifted internal COVID-19 related restrictions in early April of 2022. Monitoring of associated credit and operational risks is integrated into normal risk monitoring activities. 

BancShares has been assessing the emerging impacts of the international tensions that could impact the economy and exacerbate headwinds of rising inflation, elevated market volatility, global supply chain disruptions, and recessionary pressures as well as operational risks such as those associated with potential cyberattacks for FCB and third parties upon whom it relies. Assessments have not identified material impacts to date, but those assessments will remain ongoing as the condition continues to exist. BancShares is also assessing the potential risk of an economic slowdown or recession that could create increased credit and market risk having downstream impacts on earnings, capital, and/or liquidity. Economic data has been mixed and markets have experienced elevated levels of volatility in 2022. Key indicators will continue to be monitored and impacts assessed as part of our ongoing risk management framework. 

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT 

Credit risk is the risk of not collecting payments pursuant to the contractual terms of loans, leases and certain investment securities. Loans and leases we originate are underwritten in accordance with our credit policies and procedures and are subject to periodic ongoing reviews. Acquired loans, regardless of whether PCD or Non-PCD, are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date and are subject to periodic reviews to identify any further credit deterioration. Our independent credit review function conducts risk reviews and analyses of both originated and acquired loans to ensure compliance with credit policies and to monitor asset quality trends and borrower financial strength. These reviews include portfolio analysis by geographic location, industry, collateral type and product. We strive to identify potential problem loans as early as possible, to record charge-offs or write-downs as appropriate and to maintain an appropriate ACL that accounts for expected losses over the life of the loan and lease portfolios. 

Our ACL estimate as of December 31, 2022, included extensive reviews of the changes in credit risk associated with the uncertainties around economic forecasts. These loss estimates additionally considered BancShares industry risk, historically strong credit quality and actual net losses incurred during prior periods of economic stress, as well as recent credit trends, which have not seen significant deterioration as of December 31, 2022. Our ACL methodology is discussed further in Note 1 &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation. 

Commercial Lending and Leasing 

BancShares employs a dual ratings system where each commercial loan is assigned a probability of default (&#8220;PD&#8221;) and loss given default (&#8220;LGD&#8221;) rating using scorecards developed to rate each type of transaction incorporating assessments of both quantitative and qualitative factors. When commercial loans and leases are graded during underwriting, or when updated periodically thereafter, a model is run to generate a preliminary risk rating. These models incorporate both internal and external historical default and loss data to develop loss rates for each risk rating. The preliminary risk rating assigned by the model can be adjusted as a result of borrower specific facts and circumstances, that in management&#8217;s judgment, warrant a modification of the modeled risk rating to arrive at the final approved risk ratings. 

Consumer Lending 

Consumer lending begins with an evaluation of a consumer borrower&#8217;s credit profile against published standards. Credit decisions are made after analyzing quantitative and qualitative factors, including borrower&#8217;s ability to repay the loan, collateral values, and considering the transaction from a judgmental perspective. 

Consumer products use traditional and measurable standards to document and assess the creditworthiness of a loan applicant. Credit standards follow industry standard documentation requirements. Performance is largely evaluated based on an acceptable pay history along with a quarterly assessment which incorporates current market conditions. Loans may also be monitored during quarterly reviews of the borrower&#8217;s refreshed credit score. When warranted, an additional review of the loan-to-value of the underlying collateral may be conducted. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The ACL at December 31, 2022 was $922 million, an increase of $744 million compared to $178 million at December 31, 2021. The ACL as a percentage of total loans and leases at December 31, 2022 was 1.30%, compared to 0.55% at December 31, 2021. The increase in the ACL is primarily due to the impact of the CIT Merger, including the initial ACL for PCD loans and leases (the &#8220;Initial PCD ACL&#8221;) of $272 million and the Day 2 provision for loans and leases of $454 million related to Non-PCD loans and leases. The increase was also related to loan growth and deterioration in the economic outlook that impacts the macroeconomic variables utilized by our ACL models, including gross domestic product (&#8220;GDP&#8221;), home price index, commercial real estate index, corporate profits, and credit spreads. In contemplation of additional uncertainty, primarily based on the elevated levels of inflation and its impact on other macroeconomic variables such as interest rates, which could in turn impact home prices, commercial real estate values, and other variables, we do not believe the current baseline scenario fully incorporates the potential downside impacts of future macroeconomic deterioration, so an additional weighting on the downside scenario was incorporated into the estimate. Our ACL methodology is discussed in Note 1 &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation. 

The ACL for commercial and consumer loans and leases increased $709 million and $35 million, respectively, at December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021. The main reasons for the increases are addressed in the paragraph above.

(1) The Initial PCD ACL related to the CIT Merger was $272 million, net of an additional $243 million for loans that CIT charged-off prior to the Merger Date (whether full or partial), which met BancShares&#8217; charge-off policy at the Merger Date. 

Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $79 million (net charge-off ratio of 0.12%) and $10 million (net charge-off ratio of 0.03%), respectively. The increase in net charge-offs in 2022 was primarily related to the Commercial Banking segment.

The reserve for unfunded loan commitments was $106 million at December 31, 2022, an increase of $94 million compared to $12 million at December 31, 2021. The increase is primarily due to the Day 2 provision for unfunded commitments of $59 million related to the CIT Merger. The increase is also due to an increase in off-balance sheet commitments and deterioration in the economic outlook that impacts the macroeconomic variables utilized by our ACL models. The additional off-balance sheet commitments primarily reflect loan commitments or lines of credit, and DPAs associated with factoring. See Note 24 &#8212; Commitments and Contingencies for information relating to off-balance sheet commitments and Note 5 &#8212; Allowance for Credit Losses for a roll forward of the ACL for unfunded commitments.

Credit Metrics 

Non-performing Assets 

Non-performing assets include non-accrual loans and leases and OREO. Non-performing assets at December 31, 2022 totaled $674 million, compared to $161 million at December 31, 2021. The increase from December 31, 2021 was mostly due to the non-owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio acquired in the CIT Merger. 

Nonperforming assets include both Non-PCD and PCD loans. Non-PCD loans are generally placed on nonaccrual when principal or interest becomes 90 days past due or when it is probable that principal or interest is not fully collectable. When Non-PCD loans are placed on nonaccrual, all previously uncollected accrued interest is reversed from interest income and the ongoing accrual of interest is discontinued. Non-PCD loans and leases are generally removed from nonaccrual status when they become current for a sustained period of time as to both principal and interest and there is no longer concern as to the collectability of principal and interest. Accretion of income for PCD loans is discontinued when we are unable to estimate the amount or timing of cash flows. PCD loans may begin or resume accretion of income when information becomes available that allows us to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows. 

OREO includes foreclosed property and branch facilities that we have closed but not sold. Net book values of OREO are reviewed at least annually to evaluate reasonableness of the carrying value. The level of review is dependent on the value and type of the collateral, with higher value and more complex properties receiving a more detailed review. Changes to the value of the assets between scheduled valuation dates are monitored through communication with brokers and monthly reviews by the asset manager assigned to each asset. The asset manager uses the information gathered from brokers and other market sources to identify any significant changes in the market or the subject property as they occur. Valuations are then adjusted or new appraisals are ordered to ensure the reported values reflect the most current information. 

Since OREO is carried at the lower of cost or market value, less estimated selling costs, book value adjustments are only recorded when fair values have declined. Decisions regarding write-downs are based on factors including appraisals, previous offers received on the property, market conditions and the number of days the property has been on the market. 

The following table presents total nonperforming assets.

Non-accrual loans and leases at December 31, 2022 were $627 million, an increase of $506 million since December 31, 2021. The increases in non-accrual loans from December 31, 2021 was primarily due to non-owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio and other loans acquired in the CIT Merger. The commercial non-accruals increased during the fourth quarter as a result of an increase in the non-owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio, and more specifically related to general office exposure in the Commercial Banking segment. See Note 4 &#8212; Loans and Leases for tabular presentation of non-accrual loans by loan class. Non-accrual loans and leases as a percentage of total loans and leases was 0.89% and 0.37% at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. OREO at December 31, 2022 totaled $47 million, representing an increase of $7 million since December 31, 2021. Non-performing assets as a percentage of total loans, leases and OREO at December 31, 2022 was 0.95% compared to 0.49% at December 31, 2021. 

Past Due Accounts 

The percentage of loans 30 days or more past due at December 31, 2022 was 1.22% of loans, compared to 0.43% at December 31, 2021. Delinquency status of loans is presented in Note 4 &#8212; Loans and Leases. 

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

A loan is considered a troubled debt restructuring (&#8220;TDR&#8221;) when both of the following occur: (1) a modification to a borrower&#8217;s debt agreement is made and (2) a concession is granted for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties that otherwise would not be granted. TDR concessions could include deferrals of interest, modifications of payment terms, or, in certain limited instances, forgiveness of principal or interest. Acquired loans are classified as TDRs if a modification is made subsequent to acquisition. We further classify TDRs as performing and nonperforming. Performing TDRs accrue interest at the time of restructure and continue to perform based on the restructured terms. Nonperforming TDRs do not accrue interest and are included with other nonperforming assets within nonaccrual loans and leases in Table 26 above. 

We selectively agree to modify existing loan terms to provide relief to customers who are experiencing financial difficulties or other circumstances that could affect their ability to meet debt obligations. Typical modifications include short-term deferral of interest or modification of payment terms. TDRs not accruing interest at the time of restructure are included as nonperforming loans. TDRs accruing at the time of restructure and continuing to perform based on the restructured terms are considered performing loans. 

The Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus was published by banking regulators in April 2020 to clarify accounting and reporting expectations for loan modifications in determining TDR designation for borrowers experiencing COVID-19-related financial difficulty. BancShares applied this regulatory guidance during its TDR identification process for short-term loan forbearance agreements as a result of COVID-19, and in most cases, did not record these as TDRs. Beginning January 1, 2022, this guidance was no longer applied.

Concentration Risk 

We maintain a well-diversified loan and lease portfolio and seek to minimize the risks associated with large concentrations within specific geographic areas, collateral types or industries. Despite our focus on diversification, several characteristics of our loan portfolio subject us to risk, such as our concentrations of real estate secured loans, revolving mortgage loans and healthcare-related loans. 

Commercial Concentrations

We have historically carried a concentration of real estate secured loans, but actively mitigate exposure through underwriting policies, which primarily rely on borrower cash flow rather than underlying collateral values. When we do rely on underlying real property values, we favor financing secured by owner-occupied real property and, as a result, a large percentage of our real estate secured loans are owner occupied. At December 31, 2022, commercial loans secured by real estate were $27.18 billion, or 51%, of commercial loans and leases compared to $16.38 billion, or 73% at December 31, 2021. The change primarily reflects the impact of the CIT Merger and respective loans acquired. 

Loans and leases to borrowers in medical, dental or other healthcare fields were $8.15 billion as of December 31, 2022, which represents 15.2% of commercial loans and leases, compared to $7.00 billion or 31.0% of commercial loans and leases at December 31, 2021. The credit risk of this industry concentration is mitigated through our underwriting policies which emphasize reliance on adequate borrower cash flow rather than underlying collateral value and our preference for financing secured by owner-occupied real property. 

Consumer Concentrations 

Loan concentrations may exist when multiple borrowers could be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. The following table summarizes state concentrations greater than 5.0% based on property address.

Among consumer real estate secured loans, our revolving mortgage loans (&#8220;Home Equity Lines of Credit&#8221; or &#8220;HELOCs&#8221;) present a heightened risk due to long commitment periods during which the financial position of individual borrowers or collateral values may deteriorate significantly. In addition, a large percentage of our HELOCs are secured by junior liens. Substantial declines in collateral values could cause junior lien positions to become effectively unsecured. HELOCs secured by real estate were $1.95 billion, or 11%, of total consumer loans at December 31, 2022, compared to $1.82 billion, or 19%, at December 31, 2021. The CIT Merger had minimal impact on the outstanding balance, as the acquired consumer portfolio was primarily residential mortgages. 

Except for loans acquired through mergers and acquisitions, we have not purchased HELOCs in the secondary market, nor have we originated these loans to customers outside of our market areas. All originated HELOCs were underwritten by us based on our standard lending criteria. The HELOC portfolio consists of variable rate lines of credit which allow customer draws during a specified period of the line of credit, with a portion switching to an amortizing term following the draw period. Approximately 81.8% of the revolving mortgage portfolio relates to properties in North Carolina and South Carolina. Approximately 32.3% of the loan balances outstanding are secured by senior collateral positions while the remaining 67.7% are secured by junior liens. 

We actively monitor the portion of our HELOCs in the interest-only period and when they will mature. When HELOCs switch from interest-only to fully amortizing, including principal and interest, some borrowers may not be able to afford the higher monthly payments. We have not experienced a significant increase in defaults as a result of these increased payments. In the normal course of business, we will work with each borrower as they approach the revolving period maturity date to discuss options for refinance or repayment. 

Counterparty Risk 

We enter into interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange forward contracts as part of our overall risk management practices and also on behalf of our clients. We establish risk metrics and evaluate and manage the counterparty risk associated with these derivative instruments in accordance with the comprehensive Risk Management Framework and Risk Appetite Framework and Statement. 

Counterparty credit exposure or counterparty risk is a primary risk of derivative instruments, relating to the ability of a counterparty to perform its financial obligations under the derivative contract. We seek to control credit risk of derivative agreements through counterparty credit approvals, pre-established exposure limits and monitoring procedures, which are integrated with our cash and issuer related credit processes. 

The applicable Chief Credit Officer, or delegate, approves each counterparty and establishes exposure limits based on credit analysis of each counterparty. Derivative agreements for BancShares&#8217; risk management purposes and for the hedging of client transactions are executed with major financial institutions and are settled through the major clearing exchanges, which are rated investment grade by nationally recognized statistical rating agencies. Credit exposure is mitigated via the exchange of collateral between the counterparties covering mark-to-market valuations. Client related derivative transactions, which are primarily related to lending activities, are incorporated into our loan underwriting and reporting processes. 

ASSET RISK 

Asset risk is a form of price risk and is a primary risk of our leasing businesses related to the risk to earning of capital arising from changes in the value of owned leasing equipment. Reflecting the addition of operating lease equipment and additional asset-based lending from the CIT Merger, we are subject to increased asset risk. Asset risk in our leasing business is evaluated and managed in the divisions and overseen by risk management processes. In our asset-based lending business, we also use residual value guarantees to mitigate or partially mitigate exposure to end of lease residual value exposure on certain of our finance leases. Our business process consists of: (1) setting residual values at transaction inception, (2) systematic periodic residual value reviews, and (3) monitoring levels of residual realizations. Residual realizations, by business and product, are reviewed as part of the quarterly financial and asset quality review. Reviews for impairment are performed at least annually. 

In combination with other risk management and monitoring practices, asset risk is monitored through reviews of the equipment markets including utilization rates and traffic flows, the evaluation of supply and demand dynamics, the impact of new technologies and changes in regulatory requirements on different types of equipment. At a high level, demand for equipment is correlated with GDP growth trends for the markets the equipment serves, as well as the more immediate conditions of those markets. Cyclicality in the economy and shifts in trade flows due to specific events represent risks to the earnings that can be realized by these businesses. For instance, in the Rail business, BancShares seeks to mitigate these risks by maintaining a relatively young fleet of assets, which can bolster attractive lease and utilization rates. 

MARKET RISK 

Interest rate risk management 

BancShares is exposed to the risk that changes in market conditions may affect interest rates and negatively impact earnings. The risk arises from the nature of BancShares&#8217; business activities, the composition of BancShares&#8217; balance sheet, and changes in the level or shape of the yield curve. BancShares manages this inherent risk strategically based on prescribed guidelines and approved limits. 

Interest rate risk can arise from many of the BancShares&#8217; business activities, such as lending, leasing, investing, deposit taking, derivatives, and funding activities. We evaluate and monitor interest rate risk primarily through two metrics. 

&#8226; Net Interest Income Sensitivity (&#8220;NII Sensitivity&#8221;) measures the net impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates on forecasted NII; and 

&#8226; Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity (&#8220;EVE Sensitivity&#8221;) measures the net impact of these hypothetical changes on the value of equity by assessing the economic value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments. 

BancShares uses a holistic process to measure and monitor both short term and long term risks which includes, but is not limited to, gradual and immediate parallel rate shocks, changes in the shape of the yield curve, and changes in the relationship of various yield curves. NII Sensitivity generally focuses on shorter term earnings risk, while EVE Sensitivity assesses the longer-term risk of the existing balance sheet. 

Our exposure to NII Sensitivity is guided by the Risk Appetite Framework and Statement and a range of risk metrics and BancShares may utilize tools across the balance sheet to adjust its interest rate risk exposures, including through business line actions and actions within the investment, funding and derivative portfolios. 

The composition of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities generally results in a net asset-sensitive position for NII Sensitivity, whereby our assets will reprice faster than our liabilities, which is generally concentrated at the short end of the yield curve. 

Our funding sources consist primarily of deposits and we also support our funding needs through wholesale funding sources (including unsecured and secured borrowings). 

The deposit rates we offer are influenced by market conditions and competitive factors. Market rates are the key drivers of deposit costs and we continue to optimize deposit costs by improving our deposit mix. Changes in interest rates, expected funding needs, as well as actions by competitors, can affect our deposit taking activities and deposit pricing. We believe our targeted non-maturity deposit customer retention is strong and we remain focused on optimizing our mix of deposits. We regularly assess the effect of deposit rate changes on our balances and seek to achieve optimal alignment between assets and liabilities. 

The following table below summarizes the results of 12-month NII Sensitivity simulations produced by our asset/liability management system. These simulations assume static balance sheet replacement with like products and implied forward market rates, but also incorporates additional assumptions, such as, but not limited to prepayment estimates, pricing estimates and deposit behaviors. The below simulations assume an immediate 25, 100 and 200 bps parallel increase and 25 and 100 bps decrease from the market-based forward curve for December 31, 2022 and 2021.

NII Sensitivity metrics at December 31, 2022, compared to December 31, 2021, were primarily affected by a reduction in cash as well as liability management actions which included borrowing FHLB advances to support loan growth and to offset deposit runoff. BancShares continues to have an asset sensitive interest rate risk profile and the potential exposure to forecasted earnings is largely due to the composition of the balance sheet (primarily due to floating rate commercial loans and cash), as well as estimates of modest cumulative future deposit betas. Approximately 45% of our loans have floating contractual reference rates, indexed primarily to 1-month LIBOR, 3-month LIBOR, Prime and SOFR. Deposit betas for the combined company are modeled to have a portfolio average of approximately 25% over the forecast horizon. Impacts to NII Sensitivity may change due to actual results differing from modeled expectations. 

As noted above, EVE Sensitivity supplements NII simulations as it estimates risk exposures beyond a twelve-month horizon. EVE Sensitivity measures the change in value of the economic value of equity reflecting changes in assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet instruments in response to a change in interest rates. EVE Sensitivity is calculated by estimating the change in the net present value of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet items under various rate movements. 

The following table presents the EVE profile as of December 31, 2022, and 2021. 

Table 32 

Economic Value of Equity Modeling Analysis 

##TABLE_START Estimated (Decrease) Increase in EVE Change in interest rate (bps) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 -100 (5.3) % (13.7) % -25 (1.2) % &#8212; % +100 4.1 % 6.1 % +200 3.0 % 5.9 % ##TABLE_END

The economic value of equity metrics at December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021 were primarily affected by balance sheet composition changes as well as increasing market interest rates. 

In addition to the above reported sensitivities, a wide variety of potential interest rate scenarios are simulated within our asset/liability management system. Scenarios that impact management volumes, specific risk events, or the sensitivity to key assumptions are also evaluated. 

We use results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate and implement asset and liability management strategies, in coordination with the Asset Liability Committee, to achieve the desired risk profile, while managing our objectives for market risk and other strategic objectives. Specifically, we may manage our interest rate risk position through certain pricing strategies and product design for loans and deposits, our investment portfolio, funding portfolio, or by using off balance sheet derivatives to mitigate earnings volatility. 

The above sensitivities provide an estimate of our interest rate sensitivity; however, they do not account for potential changes in credit quality, size, mix, or changes in the competition for business in the industries we serve. They also do not account for other business developments and other actions. Accordingly, we can give no assurance that actual results would not differ materially from the estimated outcomes of our simulations. Further, the range of such simulations is not intended to represent our current view of the expected range of future interest rate movements.

Reference Rate Reform 

The administrator of LIBOR has announced that publication of the most commonly used tenors of U.S. Dollar LIBOR will cease to be provided or cease to be representative after June 30, 2023. The U.S. federal banking agencies had also issued guidance strongly encouraging banking organizations to cease using the U.S. Dollar LIBOR as a reference rate in &#8220;new&#8221; contracts by December 31, 2021 at the latest. Accordingly, prior to the CIT Merger, FCB and CIT had ceased originating new products using LIBOR by the end of 2021. 

In April 2018, the FRB of New York commenced publication of SOFR, which has been recommended as an alternative to U.S. Dollar LIBOR by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a group of market and official sector participants. On March 15, 2022, the U.S. Congress adopted, as part of the Consolidated Appropriation Act of 2022, the Adjustable Interest (LIBOR) Act, which provides certain statutory requirements and guidance for the selection and use of alternative reference rates in legacy financial contracts governed by U.S. law that do not provide for the use of a clearly defined or practicable alternative reference rate. On July 19, 2022, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on a proposed regulation to implement the LIBOR Act, as required by its terms. The LIBOR Act requires implementing regulations be in place within 180 days of its enactment. The final rule was approved by the FRB on December 16, 2022 and will become effective 30 days after it is published in the Federal Register. BancShares anticipates using Board-selected benchmark replacements to take advantage of the safe harbors that are afforded in the rule. 

BancShares holds instruments such as loans, investments, derivative products, and other financial instruments that use LIBOR as a benchmark rate. However, BancShares&#8217; LIBOR exposure is primarily to tenures other than one week and two-month USD LIBOR. 

LIBOR is a benchmark interest rate for most of our floating rate loans and our Series B Preferred Stock, as well as certain liabilities and off-balance sheet exposures. We continue to monitor industry and regulatory developments and have a well-established transition program in place to manage the implementation of alternative reference rates as the market transitions away from LIBOR. Coordination is being handled by a cross-functional project team governed by executive sponsors. Its mission is to work with our businesses to ensure a smooth transition for BancShares and its customers to an appropriate LIBOR alternative. Certain financial markets and products have already migrated to alternatives. The project team ensures that BancShares is ready to move quickly and efficiently as consensus around LIBOR alternatives emerge. BancShares has processes in place to complete its review of the population of legal contracts impacted by the LIBOR transition, and updates to our operational systems and processes are substantially in place. 

BancShares is utilizing SOFR as our preferred replacement index for LIBOR. As loans mature and new originations occur a larger percentage of BancShares&#8217; variable-rate loans are expected to reference SOFR in response to the discontinuation of LIBOR. However, we are positioned to accommodate other alternative reference rates (e.g., credit sensitive rates) in response to how the market evolves. Further, BancShares plans to move to SOFR for its Series B Preferred Stock since the dividends for the Series B Preferred Stock after June 15, 2022 are based on a floating rate tied to three-month LIBOR. 

For a further discussion of risks BancShares faces in connection with the replacement of LIBOR on its operations, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Market Risks&#8212; We may be adversely impacted by the transition from LIBOR as a reference rate .&#8221; in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

LIQUIDITY RISK 

Our liquidity risk management and monitoring process is designed to ensure the availability of adequate cash and collateral resources and funding capacity to meet our obligations. Our overall liquidity management strategy is intended to ensure appropriate liquidity to meet expected and contingent funding needs under both normal and stressed environments. Consistent with this strategy, we maintain sufficient amounts of Available Cash and High Quality Liquid Securities (&#8220;HQLS&#8221;). Additional sources of liquidity include FHLB borrowing capacity, committed credit facilities, repurchase agreements, brokered CD issuances, unsecured debt issuances, and cash collections generated by portfolio asset sales to third parties. 

We utilize a series of measurement tools to assess and monitor the level and adequacy of our liquidity position, liquidity conditions and trends. We measure and forecast liquidity and liquidity risks under different hypothetical scenarios and across different horizons. We use a liquidity stress testing framework to better understand the range of potential risks and their impacts to which BancShares is exposed. Stress test results inform our business strategy, risk appetite, levels of liquid assets, and contingency funding plans. Also included among our liquidity measurement tools are key risk indicators that assist in identifying potential liquidity risk and stress events. 

BancShares maintains a framework to establish liquidity risk tolerances, monitoring, and breach escalation protocol to alert management of potential funding and liquidity risks and to initiate mitigating actions as appropriate. Further, BancShares maintains a contingent funding plan which details protocols and potential actions to be taken under liquidity stress conditions. 

Liquidity includes Available Cash and HQLS. At December 31, 2022 we had $18.24 billion of total Liquid Assets (16.7% of total assets) and $13.52 billion of contingent liquidity sources available.

We fund our operations through deposits and borrowings. Our primary source of liquidity is our branch-generated deposit portfolio due to the generally stable balances and low cost. Deposits totaled $89.41 billion and $51.41 billion at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. As needed, we use borrowings to diversify the funding of our business operations. Borrowings totaled $6.65 billion and $1.78 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Borrowings primarily consist of FHLB advances, senior unsecured notes, securities sold under customer repurchase agreements, and subordinated notes. 

A source of available funds is advances from the FHLB of Atlanta. We may pledge assets for secured borrowing transactions, which include borrowings from the FHLB and/or FRB, or for other purposes as required or permitted by law. The debt issued in conjunction with these transactions is collateralized by certain discrete receivables, securities, loans, leases and/or underlying equipment. Certain related cash balances are restricted.

(1) Letters of credit were established with the FHLB to collateralize public funds. 

The increase in advances from December 31, 2021 reflected FHLB borrowings of $6.15 billion, partially offset by repayments of $2.55 billion. FHLB borrowings remaining at December 31, 2022 consisted of $1.75 billion short-term and $2.50 billion long-term. We grew FHLB advances during 2022 to supplement funding due to the decrease in deposits and increase in loans. With the growth in deposits in the fourth quarter of 2022, we were able to rebalance our funding and we repaid $1.75 billion of the outstanding FHLB advances in January 2023 and an additional $600 million in February 2023. 

Under borrowing arrangements with the FRB of Richmond, FCB has access to an additional $4.20 billion on a secured basis. There were no outstanding borrowings with the FRB Discount Window at December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

Commitments and Contractual Obligations

CRA Investment Commitment 

As part of the CIT Merger, BancShares adopted a community benefit plan, developed in collaboration with representatives of community reinvestment organizations. See further discussion on CRA, including details on investment commitments, in the subsection &#8220;Subsidiary Bank - FCB&#8221; in Item 1. Business &#8212; Regulatory Considerations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

CAPITAL 

Capital requirements applicable to BancShares are discussed in &#8220;Regulatory Considerations&#8221; section in Item 1. Business of this Annual Report of Form 10-K. 

BancShares maintains a comprehensive capital adequacy process. BancShares establishes internal capital risk limits and warning thresholds, which utilize Risk-Based and Leverage-Based Capital calculations, internal and external early warning indicators, its capital planning process, and stress testing to evaluate BancShares' capital adequacy for multiple types of risk in both normal and stressed environments. The capital management framework requires contingency plans be defined and may be employed at management&#8217;s discretion. 

Share Repurchase Program 

On July 26, 2022, the Board authorized a share repurchase program for up to 1,500,000 shares of BancShares&#8217; Class A common stock for the period commencing August 1, 2022 through July 28, 2023. We purchased 1,027,414 shares of Class A common stock during the third quarter of 2022, and we repurchased the remaining 472,586 shares of Class A common stock during the fourth quarter of 2022, thereby completing the share repurchase program. See Item 5. Market for Registrant&#8217;s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details on purchases. 

Common and Preferred Stock Dividends 

During the first three quarters of 2022, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.47 on the Class A common stock and Class B common stock. On October 25, 2022, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend increase on the Class A common stock and Class B common stock to $0.75 per common share. The fourth quarter dividends were paid on December 15, 2022. On January 24, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend on the Class A common stock and Class B common stock of $0.75 per common share. The dividends are payable on March 15, 2023 to stockholders of record as of February 28, 2023. 

On January 24, 2023, our Board of Directors also declared dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock. The dividends are payable on March 15, 2023. Dividend payment information on our Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock is disclosed in Note 17 &#8212; Stockholders&#8217; Equity. 

Capital Composition and Ratios 

In connection with the consummation of the CIT Merger, the Parent Company issued approximately 6.1 million shares of its Class A common stock. Additionally, shares of CIT Series A Preferred Stock were automatically converted into the right to receive shares of BancShares Series B Preferred Stock and shares of CIT Series B Preferred Stock were automatically converted into the right to receive shares of BancShares Series C Preferred Stock. In connection with the consummation of the CIT Merger, the Parent Company issued (a) 325,000 shares of BancShares Series B Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, resulting in a total liquidation preference of $325 million, and (b) 8 million shares of BancShares Series C Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $25 per share, resulting in a total liquidation preference of $200 million. 

The table below shows activities that caused the change in outstanding shares of Class A common stock for the year.

We also had 1,005,185 shares of Class B common stock outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

We are committed to effectively managing our capital to protect our depositors, creditors and stockholders. We continually monitor the capital levels and ratios for BancShares and FCB to ensure they exceed the minimum requirements imposed by regulatory authorities and to ensure they are appropriate given growth projections, risk profile and potential changes in the regulatory or external environment. Failure to meet certain capital requirements may result in actions by regulatory agencies that could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In accordance with GAAP, the unrealized gains and losses on certain assets and liabilities, net of deferred taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders&#8217; equity. These amounts are excluded from regulatory in the calculation of our regulatory capital ratios under current regulatory guidelines.

At December 31, 2022, BancShares and FCB had risk-based capital ratio conservation buffers of 5.06% and 4.99%, respectively, which are in excess of the Basel III conservation buffer of 2.50%. At December 31, 2021, BancShares and FCB had risk-based capital ratio conservation buffers of 6.35% and 5.85%, respectively. The capital ratio conservation buffers represent the excess of the regulatory capital ratio as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 over the Basel III minimum for the ratio that is the binding constraint. Additional Tier 1 capital for BancShares includes preferred stock discussed further in Note 17 &#8212; Stockholders&#8217; Equity. Additional Tier 2 capital for BancShares and FCB primarily consists of qualifying ACL and qualifying subordinated debt. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

The accounting and reporting policies of BancShares are in accordance with GAAP and are described in Note 1 &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to exercise judgment in determining many of the estimates and assumptions utilized to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses. Our financial position and results of operations could be materially affected by changes to these estimates and assumptions. 

We consider accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if (i) the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and (ii) different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial statements. Accounting estimates related to BancShares&#8217; ACL and certain purchase accounting fair value estimates for the CIT Merger related to loans, core deposit intangibles, and operating lease equipment in the Rail segment (&#8220;Rail Assets&#8221;) are considered to be critical accounting estimates because considerable judgment and estimation is applied by management. 

ACL 

The ACL represents management&#8217;s best estimate of credit losses expected over the life of the loan or lease, adjusted for expected contractual payments and the impact of prepayment expectations. Estimates for loan and lease losses are determined by analyzing quantitative and qualitative components present as of the evaluation date. The ACL is calculated based on a variety of considerations, including, but not limited to actual net loss history of the various loan and lease pools, delinquency trends, changes in forecasted economic conditions, loan growth, estimated loan life, and changes in portfolio credit quality. Loans and leases are segregated into pools with similar risk characteristics and each have a model that is utilized to estimate the ACL. The ACL models utilize economic variables, including unemployment, GDP, home price index, commercial real estate index, corporate profits, and credit spreads. These economic variables are based on macroeconomic scenario forecasts with a forecast horizon that covers the lives of the loan portfolios. 

While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of our ACL is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control which are inherently difficult to predict, the most significant being the macroeconomic scenario forecasts that determine the economic variables utilized in the ACL models. Due to the inherent uncertainty in the macroeconomic forecasts, BancShares utilizes baseline, upside, and downside macroeconomic scenarios and weights the scenarios based on review of variable forecasts for each scenario and comparison to expectations. At December 31, 2022, ACL estimates in these scenarios ranged from approximately $685 million when weighting the upside scenario 100%, to approximately $1.23 billion when weighting the downside scenario 100%. BancShares management determined that an ACL of $922 million was appropriate as of December 31, 2022. 

Current economic conditions and forecasts can change which could affect the anticipated amount of estimated credit losses and therefore the appropriateness of the ACL. It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one economic factor or input might affect the overall ACL because a wide variety of factors and inputs are considered in estimating the ACL and changes in those factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all product types. Additionally, changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others. 

Accounting policies related to the ACL are discussed in Note 1 &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation. For more information regarding the ACL, refer to the Credit Risk Management &#8212; ACL section of this MD&#38;A and Note 5 &#8212; Allowance for Credit Losses. 

Purchase Accounting Fair Value Estimates 

Acquired assets and liabilities in a business combination are recorded at their fair values as of the date of acquisition. The determination of estimated fair values required management to make certain estimates about discount rates, future expected cash flows, market conditions at the time of the merger and other future events that are highly subjective in nature and may require adjustments. The fair values for these items are further discussed in Note 2 &#8212; Business Combinations. 

Fair values of acquired loans and leases, core deposit intangibles recorded and Rail Assets associated with the CIT Merger are considered critical accounting estimates and discussed further below. 

Loans and Leases 

Fair values for loans acquired in the CIT Merger were based on a discounted cash flow methodology that forecasts expected credit and prepayment adjusted cash flows, which were discounted using market-based discount rates. This approach also considered factors including the type of loan and related collateral, fixed or variable interest rate, remaining term, credit quality ratings or scores, and amortization status. 

Selected larger, impaired loans were specifically reviewed to evaluate fair value. Loans with similar risk characteristics were pooled together when applying various valuation techniques. The discount rates used for loans were based on an evaluation of current market rates for new originations of comparable loans and required rates of return for market participants to purchase similar assets, including adjustments for liquidity and credit quality when necessary. In our valuation analysis, the discount rate had the most significant impact on the valuation. An increase of 0.25% to the discount rates used to derive the fair value of the loans at the time of the merger would have reduced the approximate fair value by $201 million, whereas a decrease of 0.25% to the discount rates would have increased the fair value by approximately $202 million. 

Core Deposit Intangibles 

Certain core deposits were acquired as part of the CIT Merger, which provide an additional source of funds for BancShares. Core deposit intangibles represent the costs saved by BancShares by acquiring the core deposits rather than sourcing the funds elsewhere. The core deposit intangibles were recorded at fair value of $143 million. See Note 1 &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation for further accounting policy information and Note 8 &#8212; Goodwill and Other Intangibles. 

Core deposit intangibles were valued using the income approach, after-tax cost savings method. This method estimates the fair value by discounting to present value the favorable funding spread attributable to the core deposit balances over their estimated average remaining life. The favorable funding spread is calculated as the difference in the alternative cost of funds and the net deposit cost. The discounted cash flow methodology considered discount rate, client attrition rates, cost of the deposit base, reserve requirements, net maintenance cost, and an estimate of the cost associated with alternative funding sources. In our valuation analysis, the discount rate had the most significant impact on the valuation. An increase of 0.25% to the discount rates used to derive the core deposit intangibles at the Merger Date would have decreased core deposit intangibles by approximately $6 million, whereas a decrease to the discount rates of 0.25% would have increased core deposit intangibles by approximately $8 million. 

Rail Assets 

Our Rail Assets consist of railcars and locomotives. Fair values for acquired Rail Assets were based primarily on a cost approach under an in-use premise. The sales approach was used to value Rail Assets when market information was available. A discount was recorded for Rail Assets to reduce the carrying value to fair value. Rail Assets are discussed further in the Rail discussion in the section entitled &#8220;Results by Business Segment&#8221; of this MD&#38;A. 

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

The following ASUs issued by the FASB were adopted by BancShares as of January 1, 2023. There were no other recent accounting pronouncements issued but not yet adopted by BancShares as of January 1, 2023. 

##TABLE_START Standard Summary of Guidance 

Effect on BancShares&#8217; Financial Statements 

ASU 2022-01, Fair Value Hedging - Portfolio Layer Method 

Issued March 2022 

The amendments in this Update allow entities to designate multiple hedged layers of a single closed portfolio, and expands the scope of the portfolio layer method to include non-prepayable financial assets. Provides additional guidance on the accounting for and disclosure of hedge basis adjustments under the portfolio layer method. In addition, as of the adoption date the Update permits reclassification of debt securities from the held-to-maturity category to the available-for-sale category if the entity intends to include those securities in a portfolio designated in a portfolio layer method hedge. BancShares adopted ASU 2022-01 as of January 1, 2023. Adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on BancShares&#8217; consolidated financial statements and disclosures as BancShares did not have any hedged portfolios. 

ASU 2022-02, Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures 

Issued March 2022 

For creditors that have adopted CECL, the amendments in this ASU: (i) eliminate the previous recognition and measurement guidance for TDRs, (ii) require new disclosures for loan modifications when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty (the &#8220;Modification Disclosures&#8221;) and (iii) require disclosures of current period gross charge-offs by year of origination in the vintage disclosures (the &#8220;Gross Charge-off Vintage Disclosures&#8221;) 

The Modification Disclosures apply to the following modification types: principal forgiveness, interest rate reductions, other-than-insignificant payment delays, term extensions, or a combination thereof. Creditors will be required to disclose the following by loan class: (i) amounts and relative percentages of each modification type, (ii) the financial effect of each modification type, including the incremental effect of principal forgiveness or reduction in weighted average interest rate, (iii) the performance of the loan in the 12 months following the modification and (iv) qualitative information discussing how the modifications factored into the determination of the ACL. 

BancShares adopted ASU 2022-02 as of January 1, 2023 and elected to apply the modified retrospective transition method for ACL recognition and measurement. 

As a result of adopting this ASU, BancShares does not expect a material change to its ACL related to loans previously modified as a TDR and, therefore, does not expect a material cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2023. 

The Modification Disclosures and Gross Charge-off Vintage Disclosures are required to be applied prospectively, beginning in BancShares&#8217; Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as of and for the three months ending March 31, 2023.

ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848 

Issued December 2022 

The amendments in these updates apply only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. 

&#160; 

Allows entities to prospectively apply certain optional expedients for contract modifications and removes the requirements to remeasure contract modifications or de-designate hedging relationships. In addition, potential sources of ineffectiveness as a result of reference rate reform may be disregarded when performing certain effectiveness assessments. 

The main purpose of the practical expedients is to ease the administrative burden of accounting for contracts impacted by reference rate reform. 

ASU 2021-01 refines the scope of ASC 848 and clarifies which optional expedients may be applied to derivative instruments that do not reference LIBOR or a reference rate that is expected to be discontinued, but that are being modified in connection with the market-wide transition to new reference rates. 

ASU 2022-06 extends the period of time entities can utilize the reference rate reform relief guidance under ASU 2020-04 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. 

BancShares continues to assess the impact of the optional expedients available through December 31, 2024 for eligible contract modifications and hedge relationships. However, the reference rate reform optional expedients have not yet been applied to any contracts and adoption of this guidance has not had, and is expected to continue to not have, a material impact on the financial statements. ##TABLE_END

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASUREMENTS 

BancShares provides certain non-GAAP information in reporting its financial results to give investors additional data to evaluate its operations. A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company&#8217;s historical or future financial performance or financial position that may either exclude or include amounts or is adjusted in some way to the effect of including or excluding amounts, as compared to the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP financial statements. BancShares believes that non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial information, can provide transparency about, or an alternate means of assessing, its operating results and financial position to its investors, analysts and management. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not superior to or a substitute for, GAAP measures presented in BancShares&#8217; consolidated financial statements and other publicly filed reports. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other institutions. 

Whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure we will generally define and present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, along with a reconciliation between the U.S. GAAP financial measure and the non-GAAP financial measure. We describe each of these measures below and explain why we believe the measure to be useful. 

The following table provides a reconciliation of net income (GAAP) to net revenue on operating leases (non-GAAP) for the Rail Segment. 

Adjusted Rental Income on Operating Lease Equipment for Rail Segment 

Adjusted rental income on operating lease equipment within the Rail segment is calculated as gross revenue earned on rail car leases less depreciation and maintenance. This metric allows us to monitor the performance and profitability of the rail leases after deducting direct expenses. 

The table below presents a reconciliation of net income to adjusted rental income on operating lease equipment.

(1) Calculation is further discussed below in Table 42 of this MD&#38;A. 

For the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022: 

&#8226; Net income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $257 million, a decrease of $58 million, or 18% compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022. Net income available to common stockholders for the three months ended December 31, 2022 totaled $243 million, a decrease of $60 million, or 20% compared to the linked quarter. Net income per diluted common share for the three months ended December 31, 2022. was $16.67, a decrease of 13% from the linked quarter. The decreases were primarily due to higher provision for income taxes, reflecting taxes on the early surrender of BOLI contracts, and higher provision for credit losses. 

&#9702; Fourth quarter results were impacted by the strategic decision to exit $1.25 billion of BOLI policies. The surrender of the policies resulted in a tax charge of $55 million. Favorable market conditions prompted us to exit this long-term, illiquid asset. As we receive proceeds from the surrender, those will increase our capital and liquidity positions while at the same time allow us to invest in highly liquid assets at higher yields. 

&#8226; Return on average assets for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was 0.93%, compared to 1.16% for the three months ended September 30, 2022, impacted by the higher income taxes noted above. 

&#8226; NII for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $802 million, an increase of $7 million, or 1% compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022. See average balances and rates below for more detail. 

&#8226; NIM for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was 3.36%, a decrease of 4 bps from 3.40% for the three months ended September 30, 2022. See average balances and rates below for more detail. 

&#8226; Provision for credit losses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $79 million compared to a provision of $60 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The increase was primarily due to changes in reserves on individually evaluated loans, an increase in net charge-offs, loan growth and deterioration in the economic outlook, partially offset by a change in portfolio mix. The net charge-off ratio for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was 0.14%, up from 0.10% for the three months ended September 30, 2022. 

&#8226; Noninterest income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $429 million, a decrease of $4 million compared to $433 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The change was primarily due to declines in other noninterest income (spread among various accounts), partially offset by higher rental income on operating leases, factoring commissions, service charges on deposit accounts and insurance commissions. Rental income on operating lease equipment increased $5 million on a gross basis, reflecting continued improvement in utilization and a higher lease rate. Noninterest income from fee generating lines of business including service charges on deposit accounts, factoring and insurance commissions, card services and fee income and other service charges increased $8 million. All other noninterest income declined by $17 million, spread among various accounts. 

&#8226; Noninterest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $760 million, unchanged from the three months ended September 30, 2022. While the total was unchanged over the prior quarter, there was a $6 million increase in marketing costs, primarily related to the Direct Bank and a $3 million increase in net occupancy expense due to increased repairs and utilities costs. These were offset by a $4 million decline in maintenance and depreciation expense on operating lease equipment, a $4 million decline in merger-related expenses and a $1 million decline in other operating expenses spread among various accounts. 

&#8226; Select items in the current and linked quarters include: 

&#8226; For the three months ended December 31, 2022: 

&#8226; CIT Merger-related expenses of $29 million in noninterest expense. 

&#8226; A provision for income taxes of $55 million related to the BOLI termination. 

&#8226; For the three months ended September 30, 2022: 

&#8226; CIT Merger-related expenses of $33 million in noninterest expense. 

For the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021: 

&#8226; Net income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $257 million, an increase of $134 million, or 108% compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. Net income available to common stockholders for the three months ended December 31, 2022 totaled $243 million, an increase of $124 million, or 105% compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. Net income per diluted common share for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $16.67, an increase of 38% over the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increases are primarily attributed to the CIT Merger. 

&#8226; Select items for the three months ended December 31, 2022 are mentioned above. 

&#8226; Return on average assets for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was 0.93%, compared to 0.84% in the same quarter in 2021. 

&#8226; NII was $802 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $445 million, or 124% compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. This was primarily due to the CIT Merger, as well as subsequent loan growth and rising interest rates, partially offset by a decline in interest income on SBA-PPP loans. 

&#8226; NIM was 3.36% for the three months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 78 bps from 2.58% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase reflected the higher interest rate environment and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the CIT Merger. 

&#8226; Provision for credit losses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $79 million, compared to a benefit of $5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase primarily reflects the CIT Merger, as well as deterioration in the macroeconomic forecasts used in the CECL forecasting process and loan growth. The net charge-off ratio for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was 0.14%, compared to a net recovery of 0.01% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. 

&#8226; Noninterest income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $429 million, an increase of $315 million compared to $114 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase was due primarily to the added activity due to the CIT Merger, including rental income on operating leases totaling $224 million. 

&#8226; Noninterest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $760 million, an increase of $437 million compared to $323 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase is primarily associated with the CIT Merger, including higher salaries and benefit costs of $159 million, primarily due to the increase in employees and $135 million of depreciation and maintenance costs associated with the operating lease equipment.

Fourth Quarter 2022 compared to Third Quarter 2022 

&#8226; NII for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $802 million, an increase of $7 million, or 1% compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022. The increase was primarily due to a higher yield on earning assets and loan growth, partially offset by higher funding costs and average balances. 

&#8226; Interest income earned on loans and leases for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $892 million, an increase of $107 million compared to the third quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher yields and growth in the average loans and leases balance from $67.73 billion in the previous quarter to $69.29 billion in the current quarter. 

&#8226; Interest income earned on investment securities for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $92 million, an increase of $2 million compared to the third quarter of 2022. The slight increase was primarily due to higher reinvestment rates. 

&#8226; Interest income earned on interest earning deposits at banks for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $56 million, an increase of $25 million, primarily reflecting higher interest rates. 

&#8226; Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $176 million, an increase of $98 million compared to the third quarter of 2022. The increase reflected higher deposit rates as well as the higher average balance, with the increase primarily concentrated in time deposits and savings accounts. 

&#8226; Interest expense on borrowings for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $62 million, an increase of $29 million compared to the third quarter of 2022. The increase was due to higher average FHLB borrowings that supplemented funding our loan growth. Due to the fourth quarter increase in deposits, we repaid some of the borrowings in the fourth quarter. 

&#8226; NIM for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was 3.36%, a decrease of 4 bps from 3.40% for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The yield on earning assets increased by 49 basis points, but was offset by the increase to the cost of funding them. The cost of funding earning assets increased due to higher rates paid on interest bearing deposits and borrowings, as well as a mix shift between noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits 

&#8226; Average interest-earning assets for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $94.36 billion. This is an increase from $92.54 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2022, primarily reflecting higher average loans and leases. 

&#8226; Average interest-bearing liabilities for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $69.93 billion. This is an increase from $67.15 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2022, primarily reflecting higher FHLB borrowings and deposits. The average rate on interest-bearing liabilities for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was 1.35%. This is an increase of 70 bps compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022, reflecting the higher interest rate environment. 

GLOSSARY OF KEY TERMS 

To assist the users of this document, we have added the following Glossary of key terms: 

Allowance for Credit Losses (&#8220;ACL&#8221;) reflects the estimated credit losses over the full remaining expected life of the portfolio. See CECL below. 

Assets Held for Sale include loans and operating lease equipment that we no longer have the intent or ability to hold until maturity. As applicable, assets held for sale could also include a component of goodwill associated with portfolios or businesses held for sale. 

Available Cash consists of the unrestricted portions of &#8216;Cash and due from banks&#8217; and &#8216;Interest-bearing deposits at banks&#8217;, excluding cash not accessible for liquidity, such as vault cash and deposits in transit. 

Available for Sale is a classification that pertains to debt securities. We classify debt securities as available for sale when they are not considered trading securities, securities carried at fair value, or held-to-maturity securities. Available for sale securities are included in investment securities in the balance sheet. 

Average Interest-Earning Assets is a measure that is the sum of average loans and leases (as defined below, less the credit balances of factoring clients), loans and leases held for sale, interest-bearing deposits at banks, and investment securities. Average interest earning assets is computed using daily balances. We use this average for certain key profitability ratios, including NIM (as defined below) for the respective period. 

Average Loans and Leases is computed using daily balances and is used to measure the rate of return on loans and leases (finance leases) and the rate of net charge-offs, for the respective period. 

Capital Conservation Buffer (&#8220;CCB&#8221;) is the excess 2.5% of each of the capital tiers that banks are required to hold in accordance with Basel III rules, above the minimum CET 1 Capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital requirements, designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. 

Common Equity Tier 1 ("CET1"), Additional Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital, Tier 2 Capital, and Total Capital are regulatory capital measures as defined in the capital adequacy guidelines issued by the Federal Reserve. CET1 is common stockholders' equity reduced by capital deductions such as goodwill, intangible assets and DTAs that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and adjusted by elements of other comprehensive income and other items. Tier 1 Capital is Common Equity Tier 1 Capital plus other Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments, including non-cumulative preferred stock. Total Capital consists of Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital, which includes subordinated debt, and qualifying allowance for credit losses and other reserves. 

Current Expected Credit Losses (&#8220;CECL&#8221;) is a forward-looking &#8220;expected loss&#8221; model used to estimate credit losses over the full remaining expected life of the portfolio. Estimates under the CECL model are based on relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts regarding the collectability of reported amounts. Generally, the model requires that an ACL be estimated and recognized for financial assets measured at amortized cost within its scope. 

Delinquent Loan categorization occurs when payment is not received when contractually due. Delinquent loan trends are used as a gauge of potential portfolio degradation or improvement. 

Derivative Contract is a contract whose value is derived from a specified asset or an index, such as an interest rate. As the value of that asset or index changes, so does the value of the derivative contract. 

Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity ("EVE Sensitivity") measures the net impact of hypothetical changes on the value of equity by assessing the economic value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments. 

Finance leases - lessor is an agreement in which the party who owns the property (lessor), which is BancShares as part of our finance business, permits another party (lessee), which is our customer, to use the property with substantially all of the economic benefits and risks of asset ownership passed to the lessee. Finance leases are commonly known as sales-type leases and direct finance leases and are included in the consolidated balance sheet in the line &#8220;Loans and leases.&#8221; 

High Quality Liquid Securities (&#8220;HQLS&#8221;) consist of readily-marketable, unpledged securities, as well as securities pledged but not drawn against at the FHLB and available for sale, and generally is comprised of Treasury and Agency securities held outright or via reverse repurchase agreements. 

Impaired Loan is a loan for which, based on current information and events, it is probable that BancShares will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. 

Interest income includes interest earned on loans, interest-bearing deposits at banks, debt investments and dividends on investments. 

Liquid Assets includes Available Cash and HQLS. 

Loans and Leases include loans, finance lease receivables, and factoring receivables, and do not include amounts contained within assets held for sale (unless otherwise noted) or operating leases. 

Loan-to-Value Ratio ("LTV") is a calculation of a loan's collateral coverage that is used in underwriting and assessing risk in our lending portfolio. LTV is calculated as the total loan obligations (unpaid principal balance) secured by collateral divided by the fair value of the collateral. 

Net Interest Income (&#8220;NII&#8221;) reflects Interest Income less interest expense on deposits and borrowings. When divided by average interest earning assets, the quotient is defined as Net Interest Margin ("NIM"). 

Net Interest Income Sensitivity ("NII Sensitivity") measures the net impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates on forecasted NII. 

Net Operating Loss Carryforward / Carryback ("NOLs") is a tax concept, whereby tax losses in one year can be used to offset taxable income in other years. The rules pertaining to the number of years allowed for the carryback or carryforward of an NOL varies by jurisdiction. 

Non-accrual Loans include loans greater than or equal to $500,000 that are individually evaluated and determined to be impaired, as well as loans less than $500,000 that are delinquent (generally for 90 days or more), unless it is both well secured and in the process of collection. Non-accrual loans also include loans with revenue recognition on a cash basis because of deterioration in the financial position of the borrower. 

Non-performing Assets include Non-accrual Loans , OREO, and repossessed assets. 

Operating leases - lessor is a lease in which BancShares retains ownership of the asset (operating lease equipment, net), collects rental payments, recognizes depreciation on the asset, and retains the risks of ownership, including obsolescence. 

Other Noninterest Income includes (1) fee income and other service charges, (2) wealth management services, (3) service charges on deposit accounts, (4) factoring commissions, (5) cardholder services, net, (6) merchant services, (7) insurance commissions, (8) realized gains and losses on investment securities available for sale, net, (9) fair value adjustment on marketable equity securities, net, (10) BOLI, (11) gains and losses on leasing equipment, net, (12) gain on acquisition, (13) gain and losses on extinguishments of debt, and (14) other noninterest income. 

Other Real Estate Owned ("OREO") is a term applied to real estate properties owned by a financial institution and are considered non-performing assets. 

Pledged Assets are those required under the collateral maintenance requirement in connection with borrowing availability at the FHLB, which are comprised primarily of consumer and commercial real estate loans and also include certain HQLS that are available for secured funding at the FHLB. 

Purchase Accounting Adjustments (&#8220;PAA&#8221;) reflect the fair value adjustments to acquired assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination. 

Purchased Credit Deteriorated (&#8220;PCD&#8221;) financial assets are acquired individual financial assets (or acquired groups of financial assets with similar risk characteristics) that as of the date of acquisition, have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination, as determined by an acquirer&#8217;s assessment. 

Regulatory Credit Classifications used by BancShares are as follows: 

&#8226; Pass &#8212; A pass rated asset is not adversely classified because it does not display any of the characteristics for adverse classification; 

&#8226; Special Mention &#8212; A special mention asset has potential weaknesses which deserve management&#8217;s close attention. If left uncorrected, such potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects or collateral position at some future date. Special mention assets are not adversely classified and do not warrant adverse classification; 

&#8226; Substandard &#8212; A substandard asset is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets classified as substandard generally have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. These assets are characterized by the distinct possibility of loss if the deficiencies are not corrected; 

&#8226; Doubtful &#8212; An asset classified as doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in an asset classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values; and 

&#8226; Loss &#8212; Assets classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value it is inappropriate to be carried as an asset. This classification is not necessarily equivalent to any potential for recovery or salvage value, but rather it is not appropriate to defer a full charge-off even though partial recovery may be affected in the future. 

Classified assets are rated as substandard, doubtful or loss based on the criteria outlined above. Classified assets can be accruing or on non-accrual depending on the evaluation of the relevant factors. Classified loans plus special mention loans are considered criticized loans. 

Residual Values for finance leases represent the estimated value of equipment at the end of its lease term. For operating lease equipment, it is the value to which the asset is depreciated at the end of lease term or at the end of estimated useful life. 

Right of Use Asset (&#8220;ROU Asset&#8221;) represents our right, as lessee, to use underlying assets for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the leases. 

Risk Weighted Assets ("RWA") is the denominator to which CET1, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital is compared to derive the respective risk based regulatory ratios. RWA is comprised of both on-balance sheet assets and certain off-balance sheet items (for example loan commitments, purchase commitments or derivative contracts). RWA items are adjusted by certain risk-weightings as defined by the regulators, which are based upon, among other things, the relative credit risk of the counterparty. 

Troubled Debt Restructuring ("TDR") occurs when a lender, for economic or legal reasons, grants a concession to the borrower related to the borrower's financial difficulties that it would not otherwise consider. 

Variable Interest Entity ("VIE") is a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or any other legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets. These entities: lack sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties; have equity owners who either do not have voting rights or lack the ability to make significant decisions affecting the entity's operations; and/or have equity owners that do not have an obligation to absorb the entity's losses or the right to receive the entity's returns. 

Yield-related Fees are collected in connection with our assumption of underwriting risk in certain transactions in addition to interest income. We recognize yield-related origination fees in interest income over the life of the lending transaction and recognize yield-related prepayment fees when the loan is prepaid.
