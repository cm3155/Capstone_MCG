 Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Management&#8217;s discussion and analysis (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;) of earnings and related financial data are presented to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of First Citizens BancShares, Inc. and Subsidiaries (&#8220;BancShares&#8221;). This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes presented within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q along with our financial statements and related MD&#38;A of financial condition and results of operations included in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Although certain amounts for prior years have been reclassified to conform to statement presentations for 2021, the reclassifications had no effect on shareholders&#8217; equity or net income as previously reported. Unless otherwise noted, the terms &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;BancShares&#8221; refer to the consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations for BancShares. 

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 

BancShares conducts its banking operations through its wholly-owned subsidiary First-Citizens Bank &#38; Trust Company (&#8220;FCB&#8221;), a state-chartered bank organized under the laws of the state of North Carolina. 

BancShares&#8217; earnings and cash flows are primarily derived from our commercial and retail banking activities. We gather deposits from retail and commercial customers and also secure funding through various non-deposit sources. We invest the liquidity generated from these funding sources in interest-earning assets, including loans and leases, investment securities and overnight investments. We also invest in bank premises, hardware, software, furniture and equipment used to conduct our commercial and retail banking business. We provide treasury services products, cardholder and merchant services, wealth management services and various other products and services typically offered by commercial banks. The fees and service charges generated from these products and services are primary sources of noninterest income which is an essential component of our total revenue. 

We are focused on expanding our position in legacy and target markets through organic growth and strategic acquisitions. We believe our franchise is positioned for continued growth as a result of our client centric banking principles, disciplined lending standards, and our people. 

Refer to our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our strategy. 

RECENT ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENTS 

During the first quarter of 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;) spread throughout the world, causing significant disruptions to the domestic and global economies which continue to date. In response to the outbreak, governments imposed restrictions resulting in business shutdowns, regional quarantines, disruptions of supply chains, changes in consumer behavior and overall economic instability. This uncertainty led to volatility in the financial markets. This impact was coupled with spikes in unemployment as a result of business shutdowns that continue to impact financial institutions operationally and financially. Vaccine distribution and other factors have improved the economic outlook, but uncertainty remains. 

During the first quarter of 2021, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Federal Open Market Committee (&#8220;FOMC&#8221;) maintained the federal funds rate at a target range of 0.00% to 0.25%. The FOMC cited the effects of COVID-19 on economic activity and the risks posed to the economic outlook. The FOMC expects to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the FOMC&#8217;s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2% and is on track to moderately exceed 2% for some time. 

On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security Act (the &#8220;CARES Act&#8221;) was passed. The bill was designed to provide short-term economic relief to individuals and businesses most impacted by the fallout of the pandemic. Key provisions include: for individuals, economic impact payments and enhanced unemployment benefits; for small businesses, access to loans and support through the Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;SBA-PPP&#8221;), direct aid and loans to the medical industry and other affected sectors, and certain tax benefits that can be used in conjunction with the other aid mentioned. While direct aid to financial services entities is not a primary goal of the provisions, financial institutions will function to transmit funds from the Federal Reserve, SBA and United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;) Treasury to the public. This was supplemented by the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act, which was signed into law on June 5, 2020, and amended provisions of the SBA-PPP including timing of the program and changes to forgiveness criteria. In addition, there were other regulatory actions taken that may impact our business including changes in credit reporting on customer forbearance, federally backed mortgage forbearance, potential legal lending limit relaxation and other economic stabilization efforts. 

The Consolidated Apportions Act 2021 was signed into law during the fourth quarter of 2020 and contained provisions for a second round of funding of SBA-PPP loans. 

BANCSHARES&#8217; COVID-19 CONTINUED MONITORING AND RESPONSE 

BancShares remains dedicated to serving our customers and communities through the COVID-19 crisis. Our branches have re-opened with enhanced safety protocols and our corporate locations remain at limited occupancy as we navigate the challenges of COVID-19. 

During the first quarter of 2021 in the second round of SBA-PPP, BancShares originated approximately 9,600 SBA-PPP loans totaling $1.1 billion. We recorded $30.9 million of interest and fee income related to SBA-PPP loans for the quarter. As of March 31, 2021, remaining net deferred fees on SBA-PPP loans were $66.7 million. 

With respect to the first round of SBA-PPP, we began accepting and processing applications for forgiveness during the third quarter of 2020. We have received approximately 12,000 forgiveness decisions from the SBA to date, representing over $1.4 billion in forgiveness payments. BancShares originated approximately 23,000 loans during round one totaling $3.2 billion. 

Through March 31, 2021, approximately 98% of all COVID-19 related loan extensions have begun repayment. Delinquency trends among loans entering repayment are in line with the remainder of the portfolio, and we have not seen significant declines in overall credit quality. 

During 2020, we recorded a $36.1 million reserve build due to uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 and its potential impact on our credit portfolio. Improved macroeconomic factors used as inputs into our ACL models and continued low net charge-offs during the first quarter of 2021 resulted in a provision credit of $11.0 million driven primarily by a $13.7 million reserve release during the quarter.

SIGNIFICANT EVENTS IN 2021 

On October 15, 2020, BancShares and CIT Group Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#8220;CIT&#8221;), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;) by and among BancShares, FCB, FC Merger Subsidiary IX, Inc., a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of FCB (&#8220;Merger Sub&#8221;), and CIT, the parent company of CIT Bank, N.A., a national banking association (&#8220;CIT Bank&#8221;). Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into CIT, with CIT as the surviving entity (the &#8220;First-Step Merger&#8221;), and as soon as reasonably practicable following the effective time of the First-Step Merger, CIT will merge with and into FCB, with FCB as the surviving entity (together with the First-Step Merger, the &#8220;Mergers&#8221;). The Merger Agreement further provides that immediately following the consummation of the Mergers, CIT Bank will merge with and into FCB, with FCB as the surviving bank (together with the Mergers, the &#8220;Transaction&#8221;). 

The Merger Agreement was unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of each of BancShares and CIT. The Transaction was approved by the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks on February 5, 2021, as well as the shareholders of both companies on February 9, 2021. We are continuing to work with other regulators on remaining approvals and anticipate closing in mid-2021 subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. 

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the First-Step Merger (the &#8220;Effective Time&#8221;), each share of CIT common stock, par value $0.01 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (&#8220;CIT Common Stock&#8221;), except for certain shares of CIT Common Stock owned by CIT or BancShares, will be converted into the right to receive 0.06200 shares of BancShares Class A common stock, par value $1.00 per share. Holders of CIT Common Stock will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares. 

In addition, at the Effective Time, each share of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, par value $0.01 per share, of CIT and 5.625% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B, par value $0.01 per share, of CIT issued and outstanding will automatically be converted into the right to receive one share of a newly created series of preferred stock, Series B, of BancShares and one share of a newly created series of preferred stock, Series C, of BancShares, respectively. 

The Merger Agreement requires that, effective as of the Effective Time, the Boards of Directors of the combined company and the combined bank will consist of 14 directors, (i) 11 of whom will be members of the current Board of Directors of BancShares, and (ii) three of whom will be selected from among the current Board of Directors of CIT and will include as one of those three Ellen R. Alemany, Chairwoman and Chief Executive Officer of CIT. We intend to appoint Michael A. Carpenter and Vice Admiral John R. Ryan, USN (Ret.), as the two other members from CIT&#8217;s current Board of Directors who will join the Boards of Directors of the combined company and the combined bank. 

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY 

First Quarter Highlights 

&#8226; Net income for the first quarter of 2021 was $147.3 million, an increase of $90.1 million, or 157.7% compared to the same quarter in 2020. Net income available to common shareholders totaled $142.7 million for the first quarter of 2021. Net income per common share increased $9.07, or 166.1%, to $14.53 in the first quarter of 2021, from $5.46 per share during the same quarter in 2020. 

&#8226; Return on average assets for the first quarter of 2021 was 1.16%, up from 0.57% in the first quarter of 2020. Return on average equity for the first quarter of 2021 was 14.70%, up from 6.34% during the same quarter of 2020. 

&#8226; Net interest income was $339.7 million for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $1.3 million, or 0.4% compared to the same quarter in 2020. This was primarily due to interest and fee income on SBA-PPP loans, organic loan growth and lower rates paid on interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a decline in the yield on interest-earning assets. SBA-PPP loans contributed $30.9 million in interest and fee income during the quarter. The taxable-equivalent net interest margin (&#8220;NIM&#8221;) was 2.80% for the first quarter of 2021, a decrease of 75 basis points from 3.55% for the first quarter in 2020. 

&#8226; Noninterest income was $136.6 million for the first quarter of 2021 , an increase of $72.6 million, or 113.5%, compared to $64.0 million for the same quarter of 2020. 

&#8226; Noninterest expense was $295.9 million for the first quarter of 2021, a decrease of $4.0 million or by 1.3% compared to the same quarter of 2020, 

&#8226; Total loans grew to $33.2 billion, an increase of $388.9 million, or by 4.8% on an annualized basis, since December 31, 2020. Excluding loans originated under the SBA-PPP, total loans increased $25.3 million, or by 0.3% on an annualized basis, since December 31, 2020. The net charge-off ratio was 0.03% for the first quarter of 2021, down from 0.06% for the fourth quarter of 2020 and 0.10% for the first quarter of 2020. 

&#8226; Total deposits grew to $47.3 billion, an increase of $3.9 billion, or by 36.4% on an annualized basis, since December 31, 2020. 

&#8226; At March 31, 2021, BancShares remained well capitalized with a total risk-based capital ratio of 14.1%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital of 12.0%, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.0% and a leverage ratio of 7.8%.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Assisted Transactions 

BancShares completed fourteen Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) assisted transactions between 2009 and 2017. Nine of the fourteen FDIC-assisted transactions included shared-loss agreements which, for their terms, protected us from a substantial portion of the credit and asset quality risk we would otherwise incur. 

For certain FDIC-assisted transactions, the shared-loss agreement included a provision related to a payment owed to the FDIC at the termination of the agreement. As of March 31, 2021, these agreements have been satisfied following a $16.1 million payment made to the FDIC for the final active agreement.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Net Interest Income and Margin (Taxable-Equivalent Basis) 

First Quarter 2021 compared to First Quarter 2020 

Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $340.3 million for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $1.1 million, or 0.3%, compared to the first quarter of 2020. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to interest and fee income on SBA-PPP loans, organic loan growth and lower rates paid on interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a decline in yield on interest-earning assets. SBA-PPP loans contributed $30.9 million in interest and fee income during the first quarter of 2021. 

The taxable-equivalent NIM was 2.80% in the first quarter of 2021, a decrease of 75 basis points from the same quarter in the prior year. The margin decline was primarily due to changes in earning asset mix, driven by a build up of excess liquidity held in lower yielding overnight investments. This was coupled with a decrease in the yield on interest-earning assets, partially offset by lower rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and the yield on SBA-PPP loans. 

Average interest-earning assets increased by $10.7 billion to $48.7 billion, compared to the first quarter of 2020. The primary drivers for this change were the excess liquidity build up leading to higher average overnight investments of $4.4 billion, higher average loan balances, which increased $4.0 billion, due to contributions from loans originated under the SBA-PPP as well as organic loan growth and higher average investment securities of $2.3 billion. 

The yield on interest-earning assets decreased by 95 basis points to 2.93% when compared to the first quarter of 2020. The yield on loans and leases decreased to 3.92%, or by 54 basis points, primarily due to lower yields on commercial and home equity loans as a result of downward rate resets on variable rate loans and lower rates on originations. The yield on overnight investments and investment securities decreased by 115 basis points and 86 basis points, respectively. The yield decrease on overnight investments was primarily due to a lower federal funds rate, while lower yield on investment securities was primarily due to yield declines on mortgage-backed and government agency securities. 

Average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $4.7 billion to $27.9 billion, compared to the first quarter of 2020. This increase was primarily due to an increase in average interest-bearing deposit balances of $4.5 billion driven by organic deposit growth, SBA-PPP fundings and stimulus checks, as well as an increase in average long-term borrowings of $274.4 million. 

Rates on interest-bearing liabilities decreased by 31 basis points to 0.23%, primarily due to decreased rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and borrowings. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

Provision for credit losses was an $11.0 million credit for the first quarter of 2021, compared to $28.4 million in provision expense for the same quarter in 2020. The change was driven primarily by a $13.7 million reserve release attributable to continued low net charge-offs, strong credit performance and improvements in macroeconomic factors. This compares to a $21.5 million reserve build related to COVID-19 recorded in the first quarter of 2020. 

Noninterest Income 

Table 6 

NONINTEREST INCOME 

Three months ended March 31 (Dollars in thousands) 2021 2020 Wealth management services $ 32,198 $ 26,412 Service charges on deposit accounts 21,536 26,413 Cardholder services, net 19,960 18,160 Mortgage income 12,991 5,224 Merchant services, net 8,917 5,888 Other service charges and fees 8,489 7,792 Insurance commissions 3,998 3,688 ATM income 1,482 1,422 Marketable equity securities gains (losses), net 16,011 (51,408) Realized gains on investment securities available for sale, net 9,207 19,795 Other 1,860 625 Total noninterest income $ 136,649 $ 64,011 

Noninterest income is an essential component of our total revenue and is critical to our profitability level. The primary sources of noninterest income consist of wealth management services, fees and service charges generated from deposit accounts, cardholder and merchant services, and mortgage lending and servicing. 

Noninterest income for the first quarter of 2021 was $136.6 million, compared to $64.0 million for the same period of 2020, an increase of $72.6 million, or 113.5%. The most significant components of the change were as follows: 

&#8226; Favorable change in the fair market value adjustments on the marketable equity securities portfolio of $67.4 million. 

&#8226; Mortgage income increased by $7.8 million primarily due to the partial recapture of mortgage servicing rights impairment recorded in the first quarter of 2020 totaling $3.1 million as mortgage interest rates increased. The remaining increase was due to higher production and sales volume. 

&#8226; Wealth management services increased by $5.8 million primarily due to increases in advisory and transactions fees, assets under management and annuity fees. 

&#8226; Realized gains on sales of investment securities decreased by $10.6 million. 

&#8226; Service charges on deposit accounts decreased by $4.9 million primarily due to elevated customer deposit balances. 

Noninterest Expense 

Table 7 

NONINTEREST EXPENSE 

Three months ended March 31 (Dollars in thousands) 2021 2020 Salaries and wages $ 147,830 $ 145,255 Employee benefits 35,725 38,511 Occupancy expense 29,743 27,480 Equipment expense 29,803 27,850 Processing fees paid to third parties 13,673 10,372 FDIC insurance expense 3,218 3,466 Collection and foreclosure-related expenses 2,198 4,054 Merger-related expenses 6,819 4,232 Telecommunications expense 3,033 2,973 Consultant expense 2,065 3,260 Advertising expense 1,885 2,669 Core deposit intangible amortization 3,044 3,859 Other 16,890 25,990 Total noninterest expense $ 295,926 $ 299,971 

The primary components of noninterest expense are salaries and related employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expense. 

Noninterest expense was $295.9 million during the first quarter of 2021, a decrease of $4.0 million, or 1.3%, compared to the same quarter in 2020. The most significant components of the change were as follows: 

&#8226; Other noninterest expense decreased $9.1 million primarily due to lower pension expense, a decrease in the reserve for unfunded loan commitments and declining travel expenses due to COVID-19. 

&#8226; Processing fees paid to third parties increased $3.3 million as a result of continued investment in digital and technological capabilities. 

&#8226; Merger-related expenses increased $2.6 million driven by legal and consulting expenses related to the pending merger with CIT. 

Income Taxes 

Income tax expense was $44.0 million and $16.9 million for the first quarter of 2021 and 2020, respectively, representing effective tax rates of 23.0% and 22.8% during the periods. 

We monitor and evaluate the potential impact of current events on the estimates used to establish income tax expenses and income tax liabilities. On a periodic basis, we evaluate our income tax positions based on current tax law, positions taken by various tax auditors within the jurisdictions where BancShares is required to file income tax returns, as well as potential or pending audits or assessments by tax auditors. 

INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS 

Interest-earning assets include overnight investments, investment securities and loans and leases, all of which reflect varying interest rates based on the risk level and repricing characteristics of the underlying asset. Riskier investments typically carry a higher interest rate but expose us to higher levels of market risk. We strive to maintain a high level of interest-earning assets relative to total assets, while keeping non-earning assets at a minimum. 

Interest-earning assets totaled $51.1 billion and $47.2 billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The $3.9 billion increase was primarily composed of a $3.2 billion increase in overnight investments, a $388.9 million increase in loans and leases and a $299.2 million increase in investment securities. 

Investment Securities 

The primary objective of the investment portfolio is to generate incremental income by deploying excess funds into securities with minimal liquidity and credit risk, and low to moderate interest rate risk. Other objectives include acting as a stable source of liquidity, serving as a tool for asset and liability management and maintaining an interest rate risk profile compatible with BancShares&#8217; objectives. Additionally, purchases of equities and corporate bonds in other financial institutions have been made largely under a long-term earnings optimization strategy. Changes in the total balance of our investment portfolio result from trends in balance sheet funding and market performance. Generally, when inflows arising from deposit and treasury services products exceed loan and lease demand, we invest excess funds into the securities portfolio and into overnight investments. Conversely, when loan demand exceeds growth in deposits and short-term borrowings, we allow overnight investments to decline and use proceeds from maturing securities and prepayments to fund loan demand. See Note C - Investments for additional disclosures. 

The carrying value of investment securities totaled $10.2 billion at March 31, 2021, an increase of $299.2 million compared to December 31, 2020. The increase in the portfolio was primarily attributable to deposit growth outpacing loan growth for the period, resulting in investment securities purchases of $2.0 billion, partially offset by sales of $356.1 million and maturities and paydowns of $1.3 billion. 

Available for sale securities are reported at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;), net of deferred taxes. As of March 31, 2021, investment securities available for sale had a net pre-tax unrealized gain of $36.6 million, compared to a net pre-tax unrealized gain of $102.3 million as of December 31, 2020. Management evaluated the available for sale securities in an unrealized loss position and concluded that the unrealized losses relate to changes in interest rates relative to when the securities were purchased, and therefore, no allowance for credit losses was needed at March 31, 2021. 

BancShares&#8217; portfolio of held to maturity debt securities consists of mortgage-backed securities issued by government agencies and government sponsored entities. Given the consistently strong credit rating of the U.S. Treasury and the long history of no credit losses on debt securities issued by government agencies and government sponsored entities, no allowance for credit losses was needed at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

Loans and Leases 

Loans held for sale were $129.3 million at March 31, 2021, a net increase of $4.5 million since December 31, 2020. 

Loans and leases held for investment were $33.2 billion at March 31, 2021, a net increase of $388.9 million, representing annualized growth of 4.8% since December 31, 2020. This increase was driven by a $419.0 million net increase in the non-PCD portfolio offset by a $30.1 million net decrease in the PCD loan portfolio. The net increase in the non-PCD portfolio was due to a net increase of $363.6 million related to SBA-PPP loans, as well as organic growth primarily in commercial and business loans. The net decrease in PCD loans was primarily due to pay downs and pay-offs. Excluding SBA-PPP loans, total loans grew by 0.3% on an annualized basis. 

BancShares reports non-PCD and PCD loan portfolios separately, and the non-PCD portfolio is further divided into commercial and consumer segments. Non-PCD loans and leases at March 31, 2021 were $32.7 billion compared to $32.3 billion at December 31, 2020, representing 98.7% and 98.6% of total loans, respectively. PCD loans at March 31, 2021 were $432.8 million, compared to $462.9 million at December 31, 2020, representing 1.3% and 1.4% of total loans, respectively. 

The discount related to acquired non-PCD loans and leases was $17.0 million and $19.5 million at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The discount related to PCD loans was $41.1 million and $45.3 million at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, accretion income on purchased non-PCD loans and leases was $2.5 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, interest and accretion income on purchased PCD loans was $10.9 million and $18.5 million, respectively.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 

The allowance for credit losses (&#8220;ACL&#8221;) was $210.7 million at March 31, 2021, representing a decrease of $13.7 million since December 31, 2020. The ACL as a percentage of total loans and leases was 0.63% at March 31, 2021, compared to 0.68% at December 31, 2020. The ACL as a percentage of loans and leases excluding SBA-PPP loans, which have no recorded ACL, was 0.69% at March 31, 2021, compared to 0.74% at December 31, 2020. 

The ACL is calculated using a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, charge-off and recovery activity, loan growth, changes in macroeconomic factors, collateral type, estimated loan life and changes in credit quality. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the primary reason for the ACL change was a reserve credit due to improvements in macroeconomic factors. Forecasted economic conditions are developed using third party macroeconomic scenarios adjusted based on management&#8217;s expectations over a forecast period of two years. For most pools, we use a 12-month straight-line reversion period to historical averages for model inputs; however for the consumer other, consumer card and commercial card pools, immediate reversion to historical net loss rates is utilized. Significant macroeconomic factors used in estimating the expected losses include unemployment, gross domestic product, home price index and commercial real estate index. Our ACL forecast considers a range of economic scenarios from an upside scenario to a severely adverse scenario, but the March 31, 2021 ACL forecast was calculated using the consensus baseline scenario. This scenario showed improvements in the most significant economic factors compared to what was used to generate the December 31, 2020 ACL. These loss estimates were also influenced by our strong credit quality, low net charge-offs and recent credit trends, which remained stable through the quarter ended March 31, 2021, despite potential impacts of COVID-19. 

As of March 31, 2021, the consensus baseline forecast utilized the following significant inputs over the two-year reasonable and supportable forecast period: 

Unemployment - Rates are projected to remain elevated, and will generally improve to below 5% by the end of 2022. 

GDP Growth - Peak growth of approximately 6% in the second and third quarters of 2021, decreasing to under 3% in late 2022. 

Home Pricing Index - Growth rates over 4% in 2021 which then fluctuate between 2% and 3% thereafter. 

Commercial Real Estate Index - Forecasted downturn with a maximum 10% drop by the end of 2021, and then slowly improving towards positive year over year growth. 

At March 31, 2021, the ACL allocated to non-PCD loans and leases was $187.7 million, or 0.57% of non-PCD loans and leases, compared to $200.3 million, or 0.62%, at December 31, 2020. The decrease of 5 basis points since December 31, 2020 was primarily due to improvement in the macroeconomic factors. The ACL as a percentage of non-PCD loans and leases excluding SBA-PPP loans was 0.63% at March 31, 2021 compared to 0.67% at December 31, 2020 

At March 31, 2021, the ACL for PCD loans totaled $22.9 million compared to $24.0 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease was due to run off of the portfolio. 

In the three months ended March 31, 2021, the ACL on commercial portfolios decreased $6.0 million, with the largest share of the decrease within commercial real estate. The ACL on consumer portfolios decreased $6.6 million, with the largest decrease within revolving mortgages. These portfolios were most impacted by the improvement in macroeconomic factors. 

Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $2.7 million during the first quarter of 2021, compared to $7.5 million during the first quarter of 2020. On an annualized basis, total net charge-offs as a percentage of total average loans and leases was 0.03% and 0.10% for the first quarter of 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of March 31, 2021, excluding SBA-PPP loans, net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases was 0.04%.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS 

We selectively agree to modify existing loan terms to provide relief to customers who are experiencing financial difficulties or other circumstances that could affect their ability to meet debt obligations. Typical modifications include short-term deferral of interest or modification of payment terms. Troubled debt restructurings (&#8220;TDRs&#8221;) not accruing interest at the time of restructure are included as nonperforming loans. TDRs accruing at the time of restructure and continuing to perform based on the restructured terms are considered performing loans. 

The Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus was published by banking regulators in April 2020 to clarify accounting and reporting expectations for loan modifications in determining TDR designation for borrowers experiencing COVID-19-related financial difficulty. BancShares applied this regulatory guidance during its TDR identification process for short-term loan forbearance agreements as a result of COVID-19, and in most cases, is not recording these as TDRs.

INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES 

Interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, securities sold under customer repurchase agreements, FHLB borrowings, subordinated debt, and other borrowings. Interest-bearing liabilities totaled $28.7 billion at March 31, 2021, compared to $27.3 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase was mostly due to an increase in interest-bearing deposits of $1.4 billion. 

Deposits 

Due to our focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position, core deposit retention remains a key business objective. We believe traditional bank deposit products remain an attractive option for many customers, as evidenced by the significant deposit growth the industry has experienced over the past 12 months. As economic conditions improve, we recognize that our liquidity position could be adversely affected as bank deposits are withdrawn. Our ability to fund future loan growth is significantly dependent on our success at retaining existing deposits and generating new deposits at a reasonable cost. 

At March 31, 2021, total deposits were $47.3 billion, an increase of $3.9 billion, representing annualized growth of 36.4% since December 31, 2020, driven by organic growth, SBA-PPP loan fundings and stimulus checks.

The table below shows Class A common stock repurchase activity for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. All Class A common stock repurchases completed in 2020 were consummated under previously approved authorizations. There were no repurchases of Class B common stock or the preferred stock during the three months ended March 31, 2021 or 2020.

Upon expiration of the most recent authorization on July 31, 2020, share repurchase activity ended and will be reevaluated in subsequent periods. 

We are committed to effectively managing our capital to protect our depositors, creditors and shareholders. We continually monitor the capital levels and ratios for BancShares and FCB to ensure they exceed the minimum requirements imposed by regulatory authorities and to ensure they are appropriate given growth projections, risk profile and potential changes in the regulatory or external environment. Failure to meet certain capital requirements may result in actions by regulatory agencies that could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;), the unrealized gains and losses on certain assets and liabilities, net of deferred taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders&#8217; equity. These amounts are excluded from shareholders&#8217; equity in the calculation of our capital ratios under current regulatory guidelines.

As of March 31, 2021, BancShares and FCB continued to exceed minimum capital standards and remained well-capitalized under Basel III guidelines. Trust preferred capital securities continue to be a component of total risk-based capital. 

BancShares and FCB had capital conservation buffers of 6.02% and 5.99%, respectively, at March 31, 2021, which exceeded the 2.50% requirement and, therefore, result in no limit on distributions. 

RISK MANAGEMENT 

Risk is inherent in any business. BancShares has defined a moderate risk appetite, a conservative approach to risk taking, with a philosophy that does not preclude higher risk business activities balanced with acceptable returns while meeting regulatory objectives. Through the comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management Framework and Risk Appetite Framework, senior management has primary responsibility for day-to-day management of the risks we face with accountability of and support from all associates. Senior management applies various strategies to reduce the risks to which BancShares activities may be exposed, with effective challenge and oversight by management committees. In addition, the Board of Directors strives to ensure that the business culture is integrated with the enterprise risk management program and that policies, procedures and metrics for identifying, assessing, measuring, monitoring and managing risk are part of the decision-making process. The Board of Directors&#8217; role in risk oversight is an integral part of our overall Enterprise Risk Management Framework and Risk Appetite Framework. The Board of Directors administers its risk oversight function primarily through the Board Risk Committee. 

The Board Risk Committee structure is designed to allow for information flow, effective challenge and timely escalation of risk-related issues. The Board Risk Committee is directed to monitor and advise the Board of Directors regarding risk exposures, including credit, market, capital, liquidity, operational, compliance, strategic and reputational risks; review, approve, and monitor adherence to the risk appetite and supporting risk tolerance levels via a series of established metrics; and evaluate, monitor and oversee the adequacy and effectiveness of the Risk Management Framework and Risk Appetite Framework. The Board Risk Committee also reviews: reports of examination by and communications from regulatory agencies; the results of internal and third party testing and qualitative and quantitative assessments related to risk management; and any other matters within the scope of the Committee&#8217;s oversight responsibilities. The Board Risk Committee monitors management&#8217;s response to certain risk-related regulatory and audit issues. In addition, the Board Risk Committee may coordinate with the Audit Committee and the Compensation, Nominations and Governance Committee for the review of financial statements and related risks, information security and other areas of joint responsibility. 

In combination with other risk management and monitoring practices, enterprise-wide stress testing activities are part of the Risk Management Framework and conducted within a defined framework. Stress tests are performed for various risks to ensure the financial institution can support continued operations during stressed periods. 

Credit risk management 

Credit risk is the risk of not collecting payments pursuant to the contractual terms of loans, leases and certain investment securities. Loans and leases we originate are underwritten in accordance with our credit policies and procedures and are subject to periodic ongoing reviews. Acquired loans, regardless of whether PCD or non-PCD, are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date and are subject to periodic reviews to identify any further credit deterioration. Our independent credit review function conducts risk reviews and analyses of both originated and acquired loans to ensure compliance with credit policies and to monitor asset quality trends and borrower financial strength. These reviews include portfolio analysis by geographic location, industry, collateral type and product. We strive to identify potential problem loans as early as possible, to record charge-offs or write-downs as appropriate and to maintain an adequate ACL that accounts for expected credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio. 

We continue to actively monitor our loan portfolio for areas of increased risk as a result of COVID-19 and to date have not seen any significant declines in credit quality. As of March 31, 2021, COVID-19 related loan extensions decreased to approximately $132.5 million in outstanding loan balances, representing approximately $4.2 million in payment deferrals. Through March 31, 2021, approximately 98% of all COVID-19 related loan extensions have begun repayment. Delinquency trends among loans entering repayment are in line with the remainder of the portfolio. 

Additionally, we participated in both rounds of funding in the SBA-PPP program, which provided much needed funds to our existing small business customers. We continue to assess both the credit and operational risks this program presents and at March 31, 2021, BancShares had $2.8 billion in SBA-PPP loans outstanding. 

Interest rate risk management 

Interest rate risk (&#8220;IRR&#8221;) results principally from: assets and liabilities maturing or repricing at different points in time, assets and liabilities repricing at the same point in time but in different amounts, and short-term and long-term interest rates changing in different magnitudes. 

We assess our short-term IRR by forecasting net interest income over 24 months under various interest rate scenarios and comparing those results to forecasted net interest income, assuming stable rates. IRR scenarios modeled include, but are not limited to, immediate, parallel rate shocks, interest rate ramps, changes in the shape of the yield curve and changes in the relationships of our rates to market rates. Market interest rates have increased from year-end driven by improving economic conditions. Net interest income deterioration in down rate shocks will remain muted due to the low absolute value of market interest rates. Assumptions that incorporate customer migration from low rate deposit instruments to intermediate term fixed rate instruments as rates rise have been adjusted based on actual deposit behavior over the last three years during a rising rate cycle. 

Table 19 provides the impact on net interest income over 24 months resulting from various instantaneous interest rate shock scenarios as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Table 19 

NET INTEREST INCOME SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS 

Estimated percentage (decrease) increase in net interest income Change in interest rate (basis points) March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 -100 (7.62) % (6.24) % +100 9.06 8.09 +200 16.83 14.57 

The increased asset sensitivity in net interest income sensitivity metrics as of March 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 continues to be affected by the substantial influx of non-maturity deposits that began in the second quarter of 2020 and continued through the first quarter of 2021. 

Long-term interest rate risk exposure is measured using the economic value of equity (&#8220;EVE&#8221;) sensitivity analysis to study the impact of long-term cash flows on earnings and capital. EVE represents the difference between the sum of the present value of all asset cash flows and the sum of the present value of the liability cash flows. EVE sensitivity analysis involves discounting cash flows of balance sheet items under different interest rate scenarios. Cash flows will vary by interest rate scenario, resulting in variations in EVE. The base-case measurement and its sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve allow management to measure longer-term repricing and option risk in the balance sheet. 

Table 20 presents the EVE profile as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Table 20 

ECONOMIC VALUE OF EQUITY MODELING ANALYSIS 

Estimated percentage (decrease) increase in EVE Change in interest rate (basis points) March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 -100 (15.18) % (21.20) % +100 8.47 12.18 +200 9.21 15.71 

The economic value of equity metrics at March 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 were primarily affected by continued growth in non-maturity deposits of nearly $4.0 billion during the first quarter of 2021 coupled with higher market interest rates. We do not typically utilize interest rate swaps, floors, collars or other derivative financial instruments to hedge our overall balance sheet interest rate sensitivity and risk. 

Liquidity risk management 

Liquidity risk is the risk that an institution will be unable to generate or obtain sufficient cash or its equivalents on a cost-effective basis to meet commitments as they fall due. The most common sources of liquidity risk arise from mismatches in the timing and value of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet cash inflows and outflows. In general, on-balance sheet mismatches generate liquidity risk when the effective maturity of assets exceeds the effective maturity of liabilities. A commonly cited example of a balance sheet liquidity mismatch is when long-term loans (assets) are funded with short-term borrowings (liabilities). Other forms of liquidity risk include market constraints on the ability to convert assets into cash at expected levels, an inability to access funding sources at sufficient levels at a reasonable cost, and changes in economic conditions or exposure to credit, market, operational, legal and reputation risks that can affect an institution&#8217;s liquidity risk profile. 

We utilize various limit-based measures to monitor, measure and control three different categories of liquidity risk: 

&#8226; Tactical - Measures the risk of a negative cash flow position whereby cash outflows exceed cash inflows over a short-term horizon out to nine weeks; 

&#8226; Structural - Measures the amount by which illiquid assets are supported by long-term funding; and 

&#8226; Contingent - Measures the risk of having insufficient liquidity sources to support cash needs under potential future stressed market conditions or having an inability to access wholesale funding sources in a timely and cost effective manner. 

We aim to maintain a diverse mix of liquidity sources to support the liquidity management function, while aiming to avoid funding concentrations by diversifying our external funding with respect to maturities, counterparties and nature. Our primary source of liquidity is our branch-generated retail deposit portfolio due to the generally stable balances and low cost. Additional sources include cash in excess of our reserve requirement at the Federal Reserve Bank, and various other corresponding bank accounts and unencumbered securities, which totaled $12.8 billion at March 31, 2021 compared to $9.6 billion at December 31, 2020. Another source of available funds was advances from the FHLB of Atlanta and Chicago. Outstanding FHLB advances were $648.7 million as of March 31, 2021, and we had sufficient collateral pledged to secure $8.2 billion of additional borrowings from the FHLB of Atlanta. Also, at March 31, 2021, $4.2 billion in non-PCD loans with a lendable collateral value of $3.4 billion were used to create additional borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank. We also maintain Federal Funds lines and other credit lines, which had $606.0 million of available capacity at March 31, 2021. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

In the normal course of business, we are a party to certain financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, which we enter into in order to meet the financing needs of our customers. These off-balance sheet instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. For more information on these commitments Note N - Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements.
