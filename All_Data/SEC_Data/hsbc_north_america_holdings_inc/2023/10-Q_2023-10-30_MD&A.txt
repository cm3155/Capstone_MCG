HSBC USA Inc. 

Executive Overview 

HSBC USA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC North America Holdings Inc. ("HSBC North America"), which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC. HUSI may also be referred to in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&#38;A") as "we," "us" or "our." 

Economic Environment &#160; The U.S. economy continued to grow during the first nine months of 2023 despite continued pressures from high inflation and rising interest rates, which are expected to lead to a slowdown of future economic growth. In addition, bank failures earlier in the year have raised concerns about potential weakness in the banking sector, which has contributed to tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, further weighing on economic activity. U.S. Gross Domestic Product ("GDP") grew at an estimated annual rate of 4.9 percent in the third quarter of 2023, while the personal consumption expenditures price index of 3.4 percent in September 2023 remained above the FRB's target inflation rate. After increasing short-term interest rates by a total of 100 basis points during the first eight months of 2023, the FRB decided to hold short-term interest rates steady in September while indicating that an additional rate increase during the fourth quarter of 2023 is likely depending upon future economic conditions. 

Although economic conditions improved during the third quarter of 2023 driven by better than expected economic growth, economic uncertainty remains due to high inflation, rising interest rates and the expectation for slowing future economic growth, which will continue to impact our business in future periods. Concerns over domestic and global policy issues, trade policy in the U.S. and geopolitical events, including the recent turmoil in the Middle East, as well as the implications of those events on the markets in general, further add to the global uncertainty. There is also a risk that interest rate increases to fight inflation could lead to a recession. Interest rate levels, inflation and economic growth, in combination with global economic conditions, fiscal and monetary policy and the level of regulatory and government scrutiny of financial institutions will continue to impact our results in 2023 and beyond. 

Performance, Developments and Trends Regional bank failures earlier in 2023 triggered turmoil throughout the banking industry as contagion fears spread. To date, we have not experienced any significant impact to our liquidity, deposits or funding capabilities as a result of this industry turmoil. In May 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") issued a proposed rule that would impose a special assessment on certain FDIC-insured banks, including HSBC Bank USA, to recover the loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund arising from the protection of uninsured depositors following a determination of systemic risk in connection with the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The special assessment would be based on an insured depository institution's estimated uninsured deposits reported as of December 31, 2022 and would be collected over eight quarterly assessment periods beginning with the first quarter of 2024. If finalized as proposed, the special assessment is expected to result in approximately $230 million of additional deposit insurance assessment fees for HUSI, which will be accrued once the rule becomes final, which is expected to occur in the fourth quarter. Because the estimated loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund will be periodically adjusted as actual losses are incurred, the FDIC would retain the ability to cease collection early or extend the special assessment collection period, as needed. 

During the second quarter of 2023, we transferred certain commercial real estate loans to held for sale with a carrying value of $507 million as part of an effort to reduce exposure to this sector. We recorded a lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment of $34 million upon transferring these loans to held for sale. During the third quarter of 2023, a portion of these loans with a carrying value of $58 million was transferred back to held for investment, resulting in the reversal of $4 million of the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment. See Note 8, "Loans Held for Sale," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

During the second quarter of 2023, we paid a dividend on our common stock of $1.0 billion from retained earnings to HSBC North America. 

In September 2023, our Markets and Securities Services business segment entered into an agreement to refer transactions related to all future precious metals trading and financing activities associated with our Global Banking clients to HSBC Bank plc. We continue to provide sales and trading services to HSBC Bank Plc in support of these activities, which allows us to record sales commissions and performance fees for such activities while holding fewer assets on our balance sheet. As the transfer was between affiliates under common control, the consideration received in excess of our carrying value resulted in an increase to additional paid-in-capital of $8 million, net of tax. In conjunction with the agreement, during the third quarter of 2023, we also transferred a portion of our precious metals trading assets inventory with a fair value of approximately $0.9 billion to HSBC Bank plc.

Net income was $182 million and $550 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared with $161 million and $452 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively. Income before income tax was $239 million and $725 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared with $224 million and $603 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively. The increase in income before income tax during the three months ended September 30, 2023 was due primarily to higher other revenues driven by higher trading revenue and, to a lesser extent, a lower provision for credit losses. These increases were partially offset by lower net interest income as interest expense on deposits and interest bearing liabilities grew faster than interest income on loans and interest bearing assets. 

In the year-to-date period, the increase in income before income tax was due primarily to higher other revenues driven by higher trading revenue. Also contributing to the increase were lower operating expenses driven by the completion of our strategic plan to restructure our operations ("Restructuring Plan"), including the non-recurrence of $191 million of costs related to the delivery of our Restructuring Plan ("Costs to Achieve") recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as 

HSBC USA Inc. 

discussed further below as well as a lower provision for credit losses. These increases were partially offset by lower net interest income for the reasons discussed above. 

As previously disclosed, we completed our Restructuring Plan over the three-year period of 2020-2022. Costs to Achieve primarily consisted of lease impairment and other related costs, severance costs and allocated costs from HSBC Technology &#38; Services (USA) Inc. ("HTSU"). Costs to Achieve also included allocated costs from other HSBC affiliates related to the HSBC Group's restructuring activities. See Note 2, "Strategic Initiatives," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of these costs. 

See "Results of Operations" for a more detailed discussion of our operating trends. In addition, see "Balance Sheet Review" for further discussion on our asset and liability trends, "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for further discussion on funding and capital and "Credit Quality" for additional discussion on our credit trends. 

London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") Transition Regulators and central banks in various national jurisdictions have been working to help transition from interbank offered rates to acceptable alternative rates, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. As previously disclosed, the remaining overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and twelve-month U.S. dollar ("USD") LIBOR tenors have either ceased to be provided by any administrator or become no longer representative immediately after June 30, 2023. Substantially all of our remaining USD LIBOR-based contracts, consisting primarily of contracts for loans, derivatives and debt, were successfully transitioned onto replacement rates, were set to automatically transition at the first applicable reset subsequent to June 30, 2023 or included appropriate fallback provisions upon cessation. 

Basis of Reporting 

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"). 

Group Reporting Basis We report financial information to HSBC in accordance with HSBC Group accounting and reporting policies, which apply International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRSs") as issued by the IASB. As a result, our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the basis of HSBC Group's accounting and reporting policies ("Group Reporting Basis"). Because operating results on the Group Reporting Basis are used in managing our businesses and rewarding performance of employees, our management also separately monitors profit before tax under this basis of reporting. The following table reconciles our U.S. GAAP versus Group Reporting Basis profit before tax: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 &#160; (in millions) Profit before tax &#8211; U.S. GAAP basis $ 239 &#160; $ 224 $ 725 &#160; $ 603 Adjustments: Other long-lived assets 7 &#160; &#8212; 202 &#160; 23 Loans held for sale (6) 18 28 &#160; 24 Renewable energy tax credit investments 4 &#160; 6 13 &#160; 19 Gain on transfer of precious metals trading client relationships to an affiliate 10 &#160; &#8212; 10 &#160; &#8212; Expected credit losses 8 &#160; 28 4 &#160; 102 Other (5) 1 (3) (1) Profit before tax &#8211; Group Reporting Basis $ 257 &#160; $ 277 $ 979 &#160; $ 770 

The significant differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis as they impact our results are summarized in Note 25, "Business Segments," in our 2022 Form 10-K. In addition, see Note 15, "Business Segments," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of significant changes since December 31, 2022 in the differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis impacting our results. Differences in reported profit before tax in the table above that were individually significant for the periods presented are explained below. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, other long-lived assets in the table above reflects a reversal of $149 million of impairment charges under the Group Reporting Basis related to capitalized software and leasehold improvements primarily associated with our Wealth and Personal Banking business segment which were previously written-off. In 2020, we recorded an impairment charge under the Group Reporting Basis related to the write-off of all the capitalized software and a portion of the leasehold improvements primarily associated with our Wealth and Personal Banking business segment, while under U.S. GAAP no impairment charge was required. Subsequent to recognition of the impairment charge in 2020, expenditures for software 

HSBC USA Inc. 

development and newly completed leasehold improvements in our Wealth and Personal Banking business segment were capitalized and amortized over their useful lives under U.S. GAAP, but not under the Group Reporting Basis. Consequently, the carrying amounts of capitalized software and leasehold improvements were higher under U.S. GAAP than under the Group Reporting Basis and, as a result, corresponding amortization expense was higher under U.S. GAAP. During the second quarter of 2023, we determined that the cash generating unit was no longer impaired under the Group Reporting Basis and that its estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value, which resulted in the re-establishment of these assets at their recoverable amount net of amortization that would have been recorded had no impairment loss been recognized and excluding any assets that have since been sold. In addition, during the first half of 2023, we recorded $22 million of lease related impairment charges under U.S. GAAP associated with the exit of certain office space, while under the Group Reporting Basis, impairment was recognized when we committed to vacate the space in the fourth quarter of 2022. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, amortization expense for long-lived assets was higher under U.S. GAAP due primarily to the impact of the impairment charge recorded under the Group Reporting Basis in 2020 as discussed above. Higher expense under U.S. GAAP was partially offset by the impairment of newly completed leasehold improvements in our Wealth and Personal Banking business segment under the Group Reporting Basis, while under U.S. GAAP they were capitalized and amortized. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we transferred certain loans to held for sale which under U.S. GAAP requires the loans to be carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value which resulted in lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustments on the loans. Under the Group Reporting Basis, loans held for sale continue to be accounted for and credit losses continue to be measured in accordance with IFRS 9, "Financial Instruments," with any gain or loss recorded at the time of sale. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, loans held for sale in the table above reflects a higher gain on loan sales under the Group Reporting Basis than under U.S. GAAP, which includes the gain on sale of the branch disposal group. The higher gain under the Group Reporting Basis was due primarily to the releases of credit loss reserves previously recorded on the loans under U.S. GAAP when they were transferred to held for sale in 2021 as well as the higher carrying amount of leasehold improvements associated with the sold branches under U.S. GAAP at the time of sale. These leasehold improvements were previously determined to be impaired and written-off under the Group Reporting Basis as discussed above. In addition, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, we recorded lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustments on loans held for sale under U.S. GAAP, while under the Group Reporting Basis loans held for sale continue to be accounted for and credit losses continue to be measured in accordance with IFRS 9 with any gain or loss recorded at the time of sale. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we transferred certain precious metals trading client relationships to an affiliate which under the Group Reporting Basis required the gain to be recorded in earnings. Under U.S. GAAP, since the transfer was between affiliates under common control, the gain was reflected as a capital transaction and recorded in common equity as a component of additional paid-in capital. See Note 15, "Business Segments," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, expected credit losses were higher under U.S. GAAP than under the Group Reporting Basis. Under the Group Reporting Basis, a majority of our loans are considered to be in "stage 1" (which requires a 12-month expected credit losses estimate), while under U.S. GAAP such loans require a lifetime expected credit losses ("ECL") estimate. Primarily as a result of the different requirements, loss provisions driven by the weakening of economic conditions, which resulted in a worsening of economic forecasts, and, in the year-to-date period, higher provisions associated with loan growth and maturity extensions were more pronounced under U.S. GAAP. In addition, during the third quarter of 2022, we released credit reserves under the Group Reporting Basis related to a decline in unused credit card lines reflecting completion of the temporary servicing agreement we entered into associated with the sale of a portfolio of mass market retail credit cards during the fourth quarter of 2021. Under U.S. GAAP, unused credit card lines are considered unconditionally cancellable and are not reserved for.

Short-Term Investments Short-term investments include cash and due from banks, interest bearing deposits with banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell. Balances may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our liquidity position at the time and our strategy for deploying liquidity. Short-term investments decreased compared with December 31, 2022 due primarily to net purchases of securities and lower deposits as discussed in detail below. These decreases were partially offset by higher short-term borrowings as well as declines in commercial loans and precious metals trading asset positions.

(3) See "Credit Quality" in this MD&#38;A for a discussion of trends in our allowance for credit losses on loans. 

Commercial loans decreased compared with December 31, 2022 due to paydowns and maturities exceeding new business activity as we continued to apply a disciplined lending approach. Also contributing to the decrease were lower loans to affiliates as well as the transfer of certain commercial real estate loans to held for sale as discussed below. The decline in commercial non-affiliate loans was primarily in the real estate, software and diversified financials industries, partially offset by an increase in the utilities industry. 

Consumer loans increased compared with December 31, 2022 driven by continued growth in residential mortgage loans. 

The following table presents loan-to-value ("LTV") ratios for our residential mortgage loan portfolio, excluding mortgage loans held for sale:

(1) LTVs for first liens are calculated using the loan balance as of the reporting date. LTVs for second liens are calculated using the loan balance as of the reporting date plus the senior lien amount at origination. Current estimated property values are derived from the property's appraised value at the time of loan origination updated by the change in the Federal Housing Finance Agency's House Price Index ("HPI") at either a Core Based Statistical Area or state level. The estimated value of the homes could differ from actual fair values due to changes in condition of the underlying property, variations in housing price changes within metropolitan statistical areas and other factors. As a result, actual property values associated with loans that end in foreclosure may be significantly lower than the estimates used for purposes of this disclosure. 

(2) Current estimated property values are calculated using the most current HPIs available and applied on an individual loan basis, which results in an approximate three month delay in the production of reportable statistics. Therefore, the information in the table above reflects current estimated property values using HPIs at June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively.

* Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. 

Commercial loans held for sale increased compared with December 31, 2022. During the second quarter of 2023, we transferred certain commercial real estate loans to held for sale with a carrying value of $507 million as part of an effort to reduce exposure to this sector. During the third quarter of 2023, a portion of these loans with a carrying value of $58 million was transferred back to held for investment as we now intend to hold these loans for the foreseeable future. At September 30, 2023, the carrying value of the remaining loans held for sale was $443 million. 

Also included in commercial loans held for sale are certain other loans that we no longer intend to hold for investment and were transferred to held for sale which totaled $101 million and $112 million at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

Commercial loans held for sale also includes certain loans that we have elected to designate under the fair value option which consists of loans that we originate in connection with our participation in a number of syndicated credit facilities with the intent of selling them to unaffiliated third parties as well as loans that we purchase from the secondary market and hold as hedges against our exposure to certain total return swaps or intend to sell. The fair value of these loans totaled $304 million and $237 million at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Balances will fluctuate from period to period depending on the volume and level of activity. 

Consumer loans held for sale decreased compared with December 31, 2022. Included in residential mortgage loans held for sale are agency-eligible conforming residential mortgage loans which are originated and held for sale to third parties, currently on a servicing retained basis. Balances will fluctuate from period to period depending on the volume and level of activity. Gains and losses from the sale of these residential mortgage loans are reflected as a component of other income (loss) in the accompanying consolidated statement of income. 

Excluding the loans designated under the fair value option discussed above, loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value, with adjustments to fair value being recorded as a valuation allowance through other revenues. The valuation allowance on commercial loans held for sale was $31 million and nil at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The valuation allowance on consumer loans held for sale was nil at both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

Trading Assets and Liabilities The following table summarizes trading assets and liabilities at September 30, 2023 and increases (decreases) since December 31, 2022: 

&#160; &#160; Increase (Decrease) From December 31, 2022 

&#160; &#160;

* Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. 

(1) See Note 4, "Trading Assets and Liabilities," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a breakout of trading securities by category. 

Trading securities balances were higher compared with December 31, 2022 due primarily to increases in equity and U.S. Treasury positions, partially offset by a decrease in foreign sovereign positions. Trading security positions are primarily held as economic hedges of interest rate, credit and equity derivative products issued to clients of domestic and emerging markets. Balances of securities sold, not yet purchased were also higher compared with December 31, 2022 due to an increase in short U.S. Treasury positions related to economic hedges of trading security positions held for Community Reinvestment Act purposes. 

Precious metals trading assets were lower compared with December 31, 2022 due primarily to declines in our own gold and silver inventory positions, including the transfer of a portion of our precious metals inventory with a fair value of approximately $0.9 billion to HSBC Bank plc during the third quarter of 2023. Payables for precious metals were higher compared with December 31, 2022 reflecting an increase in borrowing of silver inventory to support client activity levels. Precious metal positions may not represent our net underlying exposure as we may use derivatives contracts to reduce our risk associated with these positions, the fair value of which would appear in derivatives in the table above. 

Derivative asset balances decreased compared with December 31, 2022 as higher balances from market movements and increased commodity positions associated with the execution of a risk transfer as discussed below were more than offset by the impacts of higher netting of cash collateral posted and higher netting of outstanding positions. In September 2023, we entered into derivative transactions to transfer the substantial majority of the market risk associated with our precious metals positions to HSBC Bank plc, where it will be centrally managed going forward. Derivative liability balances were flat compared with December 31, 2022 as higher balances from market movements and increased commodity positions associated with the execution of a risk transfer as discussed above were offset by the impacts of higher netting of cash collateral posted and higher netting of outstanding positions. Market movements resulted in higher valuations of foreign exchange and commodity derivatives. 

Securities Securities include securities available-for-sale and securities held-to-maturity, net. Securities balances were higher compared with December 31, 2022 driven by purchases of U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury securities held-to-maturity, partially offset by sales, paydowns and maturities of securities available-for-sale as part of our continuing strategy to maximize returns while balancing the securities portfolio for risk management purposes. 

All Other Assets &#160; All other assets include, among other items, properties and equipment, net, and goodwill. All other assets were higher compared with December 31, 2022 due primarily to increases in outstanding clearing receivables from correspondent banks, prepaid expenses and accrued interest receivables. These increases were partially offset by lower assets associated with client share repurchase transactions.

Deposits The following table summarizes deposit balances by major depositor categories at September 30, 2023 and increases (decreases) since December 31, 2022: 

&#160; &#160; Increase (Decrease) From December 31, 2022 

&#160; &#160; 

September 30, 2023 Amount % &#160; (dollars are in millions) Individuals, partnerships and corporations $ 106,534 &#160; $ (1,636) (1.5) % Domestic and foreign banks 10,323 &#160; (2,033) (16.5) U.S. government and states and political subdivisions 107 &#160; (53) (33.1) Foreign governments and official institutions 2,964 &#160; 427 16.8 Total deposits $ 119,928 &#160; $ (3,295) (2.7) % 

Total deposits decreased compared with December 31, 2022 due primarily to the continued attrition of retail savings and demand deposits driven by the competitive rate environment and clients seeking higher return investments as well as lower deposits from affiliates. These decreases were partially offset by increased time deposits. 

Short-Term Borrowings &#160; Short-term borrowings were higher compared with December 31, 2022 reflecting increases in federal funds purchased and commercial paper outstanding. 

Long-Term Debt Long-term debt increased compared with December 31, 2022 due to debt issuances and fair value movements on fair value option debt, partially offset by debt retirements. Debt issuances during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled $563 million and $3,475 million, respectively, of which nil and $7 million, respectively, was issued by HSBC Bank USA. 

Incremental issuances from our shelf registration statement with the SEC totaled $3,468 million of senior debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which included $1,250 million of senior notes that were issued by HSBC USA in March as well as $2,218 million of structured notes. Total long-term debt outstanding under this shelf was $10,086 million and $9,597 million at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

Incremental issuances from the HSBC Bank USA Global Bank Note Program totaled $7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Total debt outstanding under this program was $1,931 million and $1,932 million at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

Borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") totaled $1,000 million at both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

Interest, Taxes and Other Liabilities Interest, taxes and other liabilities were higher compared with December 31, 2022 due primarily to increases in margin requirements related to futures trading, outstanding settlement balances related to security purchases and accrued interest payables. These increases were partially offset by lower liabilities associated with client share repurchase transactions. 

Total Equity Total equity decreased compared with December 31, 2022 due primarily to a dividend paid on our common stock of $1.0 billion from retained earnings to HSBC North America during the second quarter of 2023. See Note 16, "Retained Earnings and Regulatory Capital Requirements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional details.

Results of Operations 

Net Interest Income Net interest income is the total interest income on earning assets less the total interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds. An analysis of consolidated average balances and interest rates is presented in this MD&#38;A under the caption "Consolidated Average Balances and Interest Rates." 

The significant components of net interest margin are summarized in the following table:

Increased percentages reflect growth in this excess or a higher cost of interest bearing liabilities, while decreased percentages reflect a reduction in this excess or a lower cost of interest bearing liabilities. 

Net interest income decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to higher interest expense from interest bearing liabilities driven by higher rates paid and higher long-term debt average balances, partially offset by higher interest income from interest bearing assets driven by higher yields. Also contributing to the decrease was the unfavorable impact of lower short-term investment and commercial loan average balances. 

Short-term investments Interest income increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to higher yields reflecting the impact of higher market rates, partially offset by lower average balances. 

Trading securities Interest income increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to higher yields reflecting the impact of higher market rates and, in the three-month period, higher average balances. Higher average balances in the three-month period were driven by increases in equity and U.S. Treasury positions, partially offset by a decline in foreign sovereign positions. Interest income associated with trading securities was partially offset within trading revenue by the performance of the associated derivatives as discussed further below. 

Securities Interest income was higher during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to higher yields reflecting the impact of higher market rates. Also contributing to the increase in the three-month period were higher average balances driven by an increase in U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed securities, partially offset by a decline in U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities. 

Commercial loans Interest income increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to higher yields reflecting the impact of higher market rates on variable rate loans and newly originated loans, partially offset by lower average balances. 

Consumer loans Interest income was higher during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to higher yields on residential mortgage and home equity mortgage loans reflecting the impact of higher market rates on variable rate loans and newly originated loans. Also contributing to the increase were higher average balances driven by growth in residential mortgage loans. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Other Higher interest income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due primarily to higher yields on cash collateral posted reflecting the impact of higher market rates, partially offset by lower average balances. 

Deposits Interest expense increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to higher rates paid reflecting the impact of higher market rates and, to a lesser extent, a shift in mix to higher cost time deposits. Also contributing to the increase in the three-month period were higher average balances driven by growth in commercial savings and demand deposits and higher time deposits which were partially offset by the attrition of retail savings and demand deposits as well as lower deposits from a few large private banking clients. 

Short-term borrowings Higher interest expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due primarily to higher rates paid reflecting the impact of higher market rates and, to a lesser extent, higher average balances driven by increases in commercial paper outstanding and federal funds purchased. 

Long-term debt Interest expense increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to higher rates paid reflecting the impact of higher market rates on variable rate borrowings and newly issued debt. Also contributing to the increase, to a lesser extent, were higher average balances. 

Tax liabilities and other Interest expense increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to higher rates paid on securities sold, not yet repurchased reflecting the impact of higher market rates.

* Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. 

Our provision for credit losses decreased $33 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to a lower provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures and a lower provision for credit losses on our commercial loan portfolio. In the year-to-date period, our provision for credit losses decreased $57 million due to a lower provision for credit losses on both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures. 

The provision for credit losses on our commercial loan portfolio decreased $18 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The provision in the current year period reflects improved economic forecasts and a decline in credit reserves for risk factors associated with large loan exposures which were offset by an increase in credit reserves for risk factors associated with higher risk industry exposures as well as downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients. In the prior year period, the loss provision was driven by the weakening of economic conditions which resulted in a worsening of economic forecasts and weakness in the financial condition of certain clients. The loss provision in the prior year period was partially offset by declines in credit reserves for risk factors associated with supply chain disruptions, higher risk industry exposures and energy price uncertainty. 

In the year-to-date period, the provision for credit losses on our commercial loan portfolio decreased $67 million. The loss provision in the current year period was driven by downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and an increase in credit reserves for risk factors associated with higher risk industry exposures, partially offset by improved economic forecasts. In the prior year period, the loss provision was driven by the weakening of economic conditions which resulted in a worsening of economic forecasts and weakness in the financial condition of certain clients. Also contributing to the loss provision in the prior year period were higher provisions associated with loan growth and maturity extensions as well as an increase in credit reserves for risk factors associated with large loan exposures. The loss provision in the prior year period was partially offset by a decline in credit reserves for risk factors associated with supply chain disruptions. 

The provision for credit losses on our consumer loan portfolio increased $4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to a higher provision for credit losses on credit cards reflecting a modest loss provision compared with a modest release in credit loss reserves in the prior year period. In the year-to-date period, the provision for credit losses on our consumer loan portfolio decreased $11 million reflecting a higher release in credit loss reserves. The release in credit reserves in the current year period was driven by improved housing price forecasts, partially offset by an increase in credit reserves for risk factors associated with a change in New York State foreclosure law. In the prior year period, the release in credit reserves 

HSBC USA Inc. 

was driven by the impact of net recoveries, partially offset by an increase in credit reserves for risk factors associated with economic uncertainty. 

The provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures decreased $21 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 reflecting a release in credit loss reserves compared with a loss provision in the prior year period. The release in credit reserves in the current year period resulted from improved economic forecasts and a decline in credit reserves for risk factors associated with large loan exposures, while the loss provision in the prior year period resulted from the weakening of economic conditions. 

In the year-to-date period, the provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures increased $19 million reflecting a loss provision compared with a release in credit loss reserves in the prior year period. The loss provision in the current year period resulted from downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients, partially offset by improved economic forecasts, while the release in credit reserves in the prior year period resulted from improvements in the credit condition of certain clients, partially offset by the weakening of economic conditions. 

See "Credit Quality" in this MD&#38;A for additional discussion on the allowance for credit losses associated with our various loan portfolios.

* Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. 

Credit card fees, net Credit card fees, net increased during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and was relatively flat in the year-to-date period. The increase in the three-month period reflects higher late fees. 

Trust and investment management fees Trust and investment management fees decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to lower fees from liquidity funds reflecting lower average assets under management. In the year-to-date period, trust and investment management fees decreased due primarily to lower fees from private banking funds reflecting lower average assets under management which was partially offset by higher fees from liquidity funds driven by lower fee waivers reflecting the impact of higher market interest rates. 

Other fees and commissions Other fees and commissions increased during the three months ended September 30, 2023 driven by higher fees from loan syndication, guarantees and account services reflecting higher business activity compared with the prior year period. In the year-to-date period, other fees and commissions were relatively flat as higher fees from loan syndication, guarantees and account services were largely offset by the non-recurrence of loan servicing fees recorded in the prior year period reflecting the temporary servicing agreement we entered into associated with the sale of a portfolio of mass market retail credit cards during the fourth quarter of 2021. See Note 13, "Fee Income from Contracts with Customers," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information including a summary of the components of other fees and commissions.

(1) Includes trading revenue related to Global Banking and Equities. 

Trading revenue increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to higher revenue in Securities Financing, Metals and Foreign Exchange as the unfavorable impacts of lower client volumes and lower balance sheet deployment were more than offset by the impact of higher market rates which impacts fair value. These increases were partially offset by lower Markets Treasury revenue driven by the lower performance of economic hedge positions used to manage interest rate risk. 

Other securities gains, net We maintain securities portfolios as part of our balance sheet diversification and risk management strategies. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 we sold nil and $681 million, respectively, of primarily U.S. Treasury securities compared with $341 million and $1,343 million during the prior year periods as part of a continuing strategy to maximize returns while balancing the securities portfolio for risk management purposes. Other securities gains, net were relatively flat during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and decreased in the year-to-date period. The decrease in the year-to-date period was driven by lower gains from the sale of U.S. Treasury securities and the impact of lower sales activity. The gross realized gains and losses from sales of securities, which are included as a component of other securities gains, net above, are summarized in Note 5, "Securities," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates increased during the three months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to higher cost reimbursements associated with shared services performed on behalf of other HSBC affiliates, higher sales commissions from HSBC Bank plc and higher loan servicing fees from HSBC Markets (USA) Inc. ("HMUS"). In the year-to-date period, servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates decreased as higher sales 

HSBC USA Inc. 

commissions from HSBC Bank plc and higher loan servicing fees from HMUS were more than offset by lower performance fees associated with trading activity booked on the balance sheet of HSBC Bank plc. 

Gain (loss) on instruments designated at fair value and related derivatives We have elected to apply fair value option accounting to certain commercial loans held for sale, certain student loans, certain of our own fixed-rate debt issuances, all of our hybrid instruments issued, including structured notes and deposits, and certain client share repurchase transactions. We also use derivatives to economically hedge the interest rate and other risks associated with certain financial assets and liabilities for which fair value option accounting has been elected. Gain (loss) on instruments designated at fair value and related derivatives increased during the three months ended September 30, 2023 attributable primarily to favorable fair value adjustments on commercial loans held for sale driven by a loss recorded in the prior year period on certain loans which were impacted by the weakening of economic conditions. Also contributing to the increase were favorable movements related to the economic hedging of interest rate risk and other risks within our hybrid instruments. In the year-to-date period, gain (loss) on instruments designated at fair value and related derivatives decreased as favorable fair value adjustments on commercial loans held for sale for the reasons discussed above were more than offset by unfavorable movements related to the economic hedging of interest rate risk and other risks within our hybrid instruments. See Note 11, "Fair Value Option," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information including a breakout of these amounts by individual component. 

Gain on sale of branch disposal group, net During the first quarter of 2022, we completed the sale of the branch disposal group associated with the exit of our mass market retail banking business to third parties and recognized a gain on sale of $111 million, net of transaction costs. The gain on sale was increased by $2 million during the third quarter of 2022 reflecting transaction cost adjustments. See Note 3, "Sale of Certain Branch Assets and Liabilities," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

Other income (loss) &#160; Other income (loss) was lower during the three months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to a loss of $34 million recorded during the third quarter of 2023 on the swap agreements entered into in conjunction with previous sales of Visa Class B shares primarily related to extending the expected timing of the final resolution of the related litigation. Also contributing to the decrease were higher valuation losses associated with credit default swap protection which largely reflects the hedging of a few client relationships. These decreases were partially offset by lower losses on loan sales driven by a loss of $18 million recorded during the third quarter of 2022 on the sales of certain global banking loans as part of our Restructuring Plan as well as improved valuations on loans held for sale and lower losses associated with bank owned life insurance. 

In the year-to-date period, other income (loss) was lower due primarily to a valuation loss associated with credit default swap protection compared with a valuation gain in the prior year period as well as higher valuation losses on loans held for sale and higher losses on the swap agreements entered into in conjunction with previous sales of Visa Class B shares. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a loss of $40 million primarily related to extending the expected timing of the final resolution of the related litigation compared with a loss of $31 million in the prior year period. These decreases were partially offset by lower losses associated with bank owned life insurance and lower losses on loan sales. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we recorded losses of $35 million on the sale of a portfolio of consumer mortgage loans and $21 million on the sales of certain global banking loans as part of our Restructuring Plan. The loss on sale of the portfolio of consumer mortgage loans was increased by $10 million during the second quarter of 2023 reflecting a repricing reserve adjustment.

* Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. 

Salaries and employee benefits Salaries and employee benefits expense decreased modestly during the three months ended September 30, 2023 as declines in salaries expense, severance costs and health care costs were largely offset by higher incentive 

HSBC USA Inc. 

compensation expense. In the year-to-date period, salaries and employee benefits expense decreased due primarily to lower salaries expense driven by staff reductions related to the completion of our Restructuring Plan, including the sale of the branch disposal group during the first quarter of 2022. Also contributing to the decrease were declines in severance costs and health care costs. These decreases were partially offset by higher incentive compensation costs. 

Support services from HSBC affiliates Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates increased modestly during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and decreased in the year-to-date period as the non-recurrence of allocated Costs to Achieve as discussed below was more than offset in the three-month period and partially offset in the year-to-date period by higher cost allocations from our support service functions, primarily associated with global resourcing and other global support activities, as well as higher cost allocations from HMUS associated with Global Banking activities reflecting the impact of a higher utilization percentage and higher costs associated with our investments in systems infrastructure and new technologies. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, we recorded $61 million and $156 million, respectively, of allocated Costs to Achieve from HTSU and other HSBC affiliates, primarily support service project costs and severance costs. A summary of the services received from various HSBC affiliates is included in Note 14, "Related Party Transactions," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Occupancy expense, net Occupancy expense, net increased modestly during the three months ended September 30, 2023 as higher depreciation expense was largely offset by lower lease impairment and other related costs related to the exit of certain office space. In the year-to-date period, occupancy expense, net increased due to higher lease impairment and other related costs related to the exit of certain office space and higher depreciation expense which were partially offset by lower operating lease costs driven by the completion of our Restructuring Plan. 

Other expenses Other expenses increased modestly during the three months ended September 30, 2023 as increases in litigation expense and deposit insurance assessment fees were largely offset by higher levels of expense capitalization related to internally developed software as well as declines in outside services expense and professional fees. In the year-to-date period, other expenses were lower due primarily to lower professional fees driven by lower attorney's fees, higher levels of expense capitalization related to internally developed software and lower outside services expense. These decreases were partially offset by increases in deposit insurance assessment fees and litigation expense. 

Efficiency ratio Our efficiency ratio increased during the three months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to lower net interest income, partially offset by higher other revenues driven by higher trading revenue. In the year-to-date period, our efficiency ratio improved due to higher other revenues driven by higher trading revenue as well as lower operating expenses, partially offset by lower net interest income. 

Income tax expense The following table summarizes our effective tax rate based on the provision for income taxes attributable to pretax income: 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 &#160; (dollars are in millions) Income before income tax $ 239 &#160; $ 224 Income tax expense 57 &#160; 63 Effective tax rate 23.8 &#160; % 28.1 % Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 (dollars are in millions) Income before income tax $ 725 &#160; $ 603 Income tax expense 175 &#160; 151 Effective tax rate 24.1 &#160; % 25.0 % 

During the three months ended September 30, 2023, income tax expense and the effective tax rate decreased due primarily to higher expected investment tax credits. In the year-to-date period, income tax expense increased driven by higher pre-tax income, while the effective tax rate decreased resulting primarily from higher expected investment tax credits. 

Management evaluated the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 and it was determined that a valuation allowance was not required. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Segment Results &#8211; Group Reporting Basis 

We have distinct businesses, which are aligned with HSBC's global business strategy: Wealth and Personal Banking ("WPB"), Commercial Banking ("CMB"), and Global Banking and Markets ("GBM"). These businesses and a Corporate Center ("CC") serve as our reportable segments with the exception of GBM. Our GBM business is comprised of three distinct operating segments: Global Banking ("GB"), Markets and Securities Services ("MSS"), and Global Banking and Markets Other ("GBM Other"), which are separately reported. See Item 1, "Business," in our 2022 Form 10-K for a description of our segments, including a discussion of the main business activities of the segments and a summary of their products and services. There have been no changes in the basis of our segmentation as compared with the presentation in our 2022 Form 10-K. 

Net interest income of each segment represents the difference between actual interest earned on assets and interest incurred on liabilities of the segment, adjusted for a funding charge or credit that includes both interest rate and liquidity components. Segments are charged a cost to fund assets (e.g., customer loans) and receive a funding credit for funds provided (e.g., customer deposits) based on equivalent market rates that incorporate both repricing (interest rate risk) and tenor (liquidity) characteristics. The objective of these charges/credits is to transfer interest rate risk to one centralized unit in Markets Treasury. Markets Treasury income statement and balance sheet results are allocated to each of the global businesses based upon tangible equity levels and levels of any surplus liabilities. 

Certain other revenue and operating expense amounts are also apportioned among the business segments based upon the benefits derived from this activity or the relationship of this activity to other segment activity. These inter-segment transactions have not been eliminated, and we generally account for them as if they were with third parties. 

We report financial information to our parent, HSBC, in accordance with HSBC Group accounting and reporting policies, which apply IFRSs as issued by the IASB. As a result, our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the Group Reporting Basis as operating results are monitored and reviewed, trends are evaluated and decisions about allocating resources, such as employees, are primarily made on this basis. We continue, however, to monitor capital adequacy and report to regulatory agencies on a U.S. GAAP basis. 

During the second quarter of 2023, we implemented a change to our internal management reporting to report net funding charges associated with MSS trading activities within other operating income to better align with the trading revenue generated by such activities. Historically, these funding charges were reported within net interest income (expense). There was no impact to consolidated net interest income (expense) or other operating income as these net funding charges are reversed back into net interest income (expense) in the CC. As a result, we have aligned our segment reporting for MSS and CC to reflect this change for all periods presented. See Note 15, "Business Segments," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a table that summarizes the impact of this change on reported segment net interest income (expense) and other operating income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. 

There have been no other changes in the measurement of segment profit as compared with the presentation in our 2022 Form 10-K. 

The significant differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis as they impact our results are summarized in Note 25, "Business Segments," in our 2022 Form 10-K. In addition, see Note 15, "Business Segments," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of significant changes since December 31, 2022 in the differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis impacting our results.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, retail business banking and other also reflects gains of $2 million and $151 million, respectively, on the sale of the branch disposal group associated with the exit of our mass market retail banking business as well as a loss on the sale of a portfolio of consumer mortgage loans in the year-to-date period as discussed below. 

Our WPB segment reported a lower profit before tax during the three months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to lower net interest income, lower other operating income and higher expected credit losses. In the year-to-date period, our WPB segment reported a higher profit before tax due primarily to lower operating expenses driven by a reversal of $142 million of impairment charges recorded during the second quarter of 2023 related to capitalized software and leasehold improvements which were previously written-off. During the second quarter of 2023, we determined that the cash generating unit was no 

HSBC USA Inc. 

longer impaired and that its estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value, which resulted in the re-establishment of these assets at their recoverable amount net of amortization that would have been recorded had no impairment loss been recognized and excluding any assets that have since been sold. Also contributing to the increase in the year-to-date period was higher net interest income. These increases in the year-to-date period were partially offset by lower other operating income driven by the non-recurrence of a gain of $151 million recorded in the prior year period on the sale of the branch disposal group associated with the exit of our mass market retail banking business as well as higher expected credit losses. 

Net interest income decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to the unfavorable impact of lower deposits driven by the attrition of savings and demand deposits which was partially offset by the favorable impact of higher market rates. In the year-to-date period, net interest income increased as the unfavorable impact of lower deposits driven by attrition was more than offset by the favorable impact of higher market rates. 

Other operating income decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to a loss of $34 million recorded during the third quarter of 2023 on the swap agreements entered into in conjunction with previous sales of Visa Class B shares primarily related to extending the expected timing of the final resolution of the related litigation. In the year-to-date period, excluding the gain on sale of the branch disposal group as discussed above, other operating income increased due primarily to lower losses on loan sales. During the first quarter of 2022, we recorded a loss of $55 million on the sale of a portfolio of consumer mortgage loans. The loss on sale was increased by $10 million during the second quarter of 2023 reflecting a repricing reserve adjustment. This increase was partially offset by higher losses on the swap agreements entered into in conjunction with previous sales of Visa Class B shares. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 we recorded a loss of $40 million primarily related to extending the expected timing of the final resolution of the related litigation compared with a loss of $31 million in the prior year period. 

Expected credit losses increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 reflecting lower releases in credit loss reserves. The releases in credit reserves in the current year periods were driven by improvements in the credit quality of the portfolio and, in the year-to-date period, improved housing price forecasts. The release in the current year-to-date period was partially offset by a higher loss estimate for risk factors associated with a change in New York State foreclosure law. In the prior year periods, the releases in credit reserves were due primarily to a decline in unused credit card lines reflecting completion of the temporary servicing agreement we entered into associated with the sale of a portfolio of mass market retail credit cards during the fourth quarter of 2021. 

Operating expenses increased during the three months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to higher litigation expense and higher amortization expense for capitalized software due to the impact of the reversal of impairment charges as discussed above. These increases were partially offset by the non-recurrence of $10 million of lease impairment and other related costs recorded during the third quarter of 2022 primarily related to the impairment of newly completed leasehold improvements. In the year-to-date period, excluding the reversal of impairment charges as discussed above, operating expenses remained lower driven by the completion of our Restructuring Plan, including the sale of the branch disposal group during the first quarter of 2022, which resulted in declines in staff costs, operating lease costs, marketing expense and cost allocations from our technology and support service functions. Also contributing to the decrease were lower deposit insurance assessment fees and the non-recurrence of lease impairment and other related costs recorded in the prior year period as discussed above. These decreases were partially offset by higher litigation expense and higher amortization expense for capitalized software due to the impact of the reversal of impairment charges as discussed above.

Our CMB segment reported a lower profit before tax during the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to higher operating expenses and higher expected credit losses, partially offset by higher net interest income and higher other operating income. In the year-to-date period, our CMB segment reported a higher profit before tax due primarily to higher net interest income, partially offset by higher operating expenses and higher expected credit losses. 

Net interest income increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to higher deposit spreads reflecting the impact of higher market rates and higher earnings on capital. 

Other operating income increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to higher fees from account services, commitments and guarantees, which were partially offset in the year-to-date period by lower syndication fees. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Expected credit losses increased during the three months ended September 30, 2023 reflecting a loss provision compared with a release in credit loss reserves in the prior year period. The loss provision in the current year period was driven by downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients, partially offset by improved economic forecasts. In the prior year period, the release in credit reserves was due primarily to a lower loss estimate for risk factors associated with higher risk industry exposures, partially offset by the weakening of economic conditions which resulted in a worsening of economic forecasts. 

In the year-to-date period, expected credit losses increased. The loss provision in the current year period was driven by downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients, partially offset by improved economic forecasts. In the prior year period, the loss provision was driven by the weakening of economic conditions which resulted in a worsening of economic forecasts and weakness in the financial condition of certain clients as well as higher provisions associated with loan growth. The loss provision in the prior year period was partially offset by a lower loss estimate for risk factors associated with higher risk industry exposures. 

Operating expenses increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to higher salaries and incentive compensation expenses related to growth initiatives in innovation banking as well as higher cost allocations from our technology and support service functions.

Our GB segment reported a higher profit before tax during the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to lower expected credit losses and higher other operating income, partially offset by higher operating expenses and lower net interest income. In the year-to-date period, our GB segment reported a lower profit before tax due to higher operating expenses and lower other operating income, partially offset by higher net interest income and lower expected credit losses. 

Revenue increased during the three months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to higher revenue in Investment Banking and GB Other. Higher Investment Banking revenue was driven by higher fees from loan syndication and favorable fair value adjustments on certain loans held for sale driven by a loss recorded in the prior year period on certain loans which were impacted by the weakening of economic conditions. Higher revenue in GB Other was due primarily to the non-recurrence of a loss of $18 million recorded in the prior year period on the sales of certain loans as part of our Restructuring Plan which was partially offset by higher valuation losses associated with credit default swap protection which largely reflects the hedging of a few client relationships. These increases were partially offset by lower revenue in GPS due primarily to lower net interest income reflecting lower corporate funding credits driven by an update to transfer pricing rates and lower average deposit balances. 

In the year-to-date period, revenue decreased due to lower revenue in GB Other and GPS. Lower revenue in GB Other was driven by unfavorable fair value adjustments on certain credit-linked structured notes and a valuation loss associated with credit default swap protection compared with a valuation gain in the prior year period which were partially offset by the non-recurrence of a loss of $21 million recorded in the prior year period on the sales of certain loans as part of our Restructuring Plan. Lower GPS revenue was due primarily to lower net interest income reflecting lower funding credits driven by an update to transfer pricing rates and lower average deposit balances. These decreases were partially offset by higher revenue in Investment Banking and Credit and Lending. Higher Investment Banking revenue was driven by favorable fair value adjustments on certain loans held for sale driven by a loss recorded in the prior year period on certain loans which were impacted by the weakening of economic conditions, higher net interest income in issuer services reflecting the impact of higher market rates as well as higher fees from loan syndication. Higher revenue in Credit and Lending was due primarily to higher commitment fees. 

Expected credit losses improved during the three months ended September 30, 2023 reflecting a release in credit loss reserves driven by improved economic forecasts compared with a loss provision in the prior year period as discussed below. In the year-to-date period, expected credit losses decreased. The loss provision in the current year period was driven by downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients, partially offset by improved economic conditions. In the prior year periods, the loss provisions were driven by the weakening of economic conditions which resulted in a worsening of economic forecasts and weakness in the financial condition of certain clients. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Operating expenses increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to higher cost allocations from HMUS reflecting the impact of a higher utilization percentage and higher cost allocations from our technology and support service functions.

Our MSS segment reported a higher profit before tax during the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to higher other operating income, partially offset by lower net interest income. In the year-to-date period, our MSS segment reported a lower profit before tax due primarily to lower other operating income, partially offset by lower operating expenses. 

Revenue increased during the three months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to favorable credit and funding valuation adjustments attributable primarily to gains from credit valuation adjustments on derivative assets in the current year period compared with losses in the prior year period as well as higher revenue in MSS Other due to a gain of $10 million recorded during the third quarter of 2023 on the transfer of all future precious metals trading and financing activities associated with our Global Banking clients to HSBC Bank plc. These increases were partially offset by lower revenue in Foreign Exchange and Metals due to lower client volumes in Foreign Exchange driven by lower market volatility compared with the prior year period and lower balance sheet deployment in Metals. 

In the year-to-date period, revenue decreased due to lower revenue in Foreign Exchange and Metals, Equities and Securities Financing. Lower revenue in Foreign Exchange and Metals was due to lower client volumes and lower balance sheet deployment as discussed above, while lower revenue in Securities Financing was driven by spread compression. Lower Equities revenue was driven by lower performance fees associated with trading activity booked on the balance sheet of HSBC Bank plc. These decreases were partially offset by higher revenue in Debt Markets due to higher earnings on capital, higher revenue in MSS Other due to the gain on transfer as discussed above and favorable credit and funding valuation adjustments attributable primarily to gains from credit valuation adjustments on derivative assets in the current year period compared with losses in the prior year period. 

Operating expenses were relatively flat during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and decreased in the year-to-date period. The decrease in the year-to-date period was due primarily to lower cost allocations from our technology and support service functions.

Our GBM Other segment reported a higher loss before tax during the three months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to lower revenue driven by higher liquidity charges. In the year-to-date period, our GBM Other segment reported a higher loss before tax due to lower revenue driven by lower allocated Market Treasury revenue and lower cost reimbursements, partially offset by lower operating expenses driven by lower cost allocations from our technology and support service functions.

* Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. 

Our CC segment reported a lower loss before tax during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to higher other operating income and lower operating expenses, partially offset by higher net interest expense. 

Net interest expense increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 driven by a higher cost of funds reflecting the impact of higher market rates. 

Other operating income increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to higher net funding credits associated with MSS trading activities which increased by $70 million and $238 million, respectively. Also contributing to the increase in the year-to-date period were favorable fair value adjustments on certain investments held for Community Reinvestment Act purposes. 

Operating expenses decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to the non-recurrence of allocated Costs to Achieve from HTSU and other HSBC affiliates, primarily support service project costs and severance costs, recorded during the prior year periods. Also contributing to the decrease in the year-to-date period were lower professional fees driven by lower attorney's fees. 

Reconciliation of Segment Results As previously discussed, segment results are reported on a Group Reporting Basis.

Credit Quality 

In the normal course of business, we enter into a variety of transactions that involve both on and off-balance sheet credit risk. Principal among these activities is lending to various commercial, institutional, governmental and individual customers. We participate in lending activity throughout the United States and, on a limited basis, internationally. 

Allowance for Credit Losses / Liability for Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures &#160; Our accounting policies and methodologies related to the allowance for credit losses and liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures are presented under the caption "Critical Accounting Estimates" in MD&#38;A and in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements," in our 2022 Form 10-K. Our approach toward credit risk management is summarized under the caption "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2022 Form 10-K. There have been no significant revisions to our policies or methodologies during the first nine months of 2023. 

The following table summarizes our allowance for credit losses and the liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures: 

September 30, 2023 June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 &#160; (in millions) Allowance for credit losses: Loans: Commercial loans $ 562 &#160; $ 593 $ 551 Consumer loans 14 &#160; 12 33 Total loans 576 &#160; 605 584 Securities held-to-maturity &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#8212;

(1) Primarily includes accrued interest receivables and customer acceptances. 

The total allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2023 decreased $29 million or 5 percent as compared with June 30, 2023 due primarily to a lower loss estimate on our commercial loan portfolio. As compared with December 31, 2022, the total allowance for credit losses decreased $8 million or 1 percent due to a lower loss estimate on our consumer loan portfolio, partially offset by a higher loss estimate on our commercial loan portfolio. 

Our commercial allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2023 decreased $31 million or 5 percent as compared with June 30, 2023 due primarily to the charge-off of a corporate banking loan, improved economic forecasts and a decline in credit reserves for risk factors associated with large loan exposures. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in credit reserves for risk factors associated with higher risk industry exposures as well as downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients. As compared with December 31, 2022, our commercial allowance for credit losses increased $11 million or 2 percent driven by downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and an increase in credit reserves for risk factors associated with higher risk industry exposures, partially offset by the charge-off of a corporate banking loan and improved economic forecasts. 

Our consumer allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2023 was relatively flat as compared with June 30, 2023. As compared with December 31, 2022, our consumer allowance for credit losses decreased $19 million or 58 percent driven by improved housing price forecasts, partially offset by an increase in credit reserves for risk factors associated with a change in New York State foreclosure law. 

The liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures at September 30, 2023 decreased $10 million or 7 percent as compared with June 30, 2023 resulting from improved economic forecasts and a decline in credit reserves for risk factors associated with large loan exposures. As compared with December 31, 2022, the liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures increased $16 million or 14 percent resulting from downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients, partially offset by improved economic forecasts.

(2) Represents our commercial and consumer allowance for credit losses, as appropriate, divided by the corresponding outstanding balance of total nonperforming loans held for investment. Nonperforming loans include accruing loans contractually past due 90 days or more. 

See Note 7, "Allowance for Credit Losses," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a rollforward of credit losses by loan categories for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. 

The allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment at September 30, 2023 decreased as compared with June 30, 2023 due to the decrease in our commercial allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above. As compared with December 31, 2022, the allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of total loans held for 

HSBC USA Inc. 

investment increased modestly as a decrease in total loans held for investment outpaced the decrease in our allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above. 

The allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of nonperforming loans held for investment at September 30, 2023 decreased as compared with both June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 due primarily to an increase in nonperforming loans as discussed further below in our commercial loan portfolio and, as compared with June 30, 2023, the decrease in our commercial allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above. 

Delinquency The following table summarizes dollars of two-months-and-over contractual delinquency and two-months-and-over contractual delinquency as a percentage of total loans, excluding loans held for sale ("delinquency ratio"). 

&#160; September 30, 2023 June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022

(1) At September 30, 2023, June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, consumer mortgage loan delinquency includes $55 million, $57 million and $60 million, respectively, of loans that are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. 

(2) The following table reflects dollars of contractual delinquency and delinquency ratios for interest-only loans and adjustable rate mortgage ("ARM") loans: 

&#160; September 30, 2023 June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Delinquent Loans Delinquency Ratio Delinquent Loan Delinquency Ratio Delinquent Loans Delinquency Ratio &#160; (dollars are in millions) Interest-only loans $ 5 &#160; .12 &#160; % $ 9 .22 % $ 9 .22 % ARM loans 66 &#160; .52 &#160; 69 .54 85 .67 

Our two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio decreased 18 basis points compared with June 30, 2023 due primarily to lower dollars of delinquency in our commercial loan portfolio. As compared with December 31, 2022, our two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio increased 16 basis points due primarily to higher dollars of delinquency in our commercial loan portfolio, partially offset by lower dollars of delinquency in our consumer loan portfolio. 

Our commercial loan two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio decreased 25 basis points compared with June 30, 2023 due primarily to lower dollars of delinquency driven by the payoff of a commercial real estate loan and the collection of a global banking loan, both of which became 60 days past due in the second quarter. As compared with December 31, 2022, our commercial loan two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio increased 29 basis points due primarily to higher dollars of delinquency driven by two commercial real estate loans which became 60 days past due, partially offset by collections, including the collections of a few large private banking loans in the first quarter. Also contributing to the increase in the ratio as compared with December 31, 2022 were lower outstanding loan balances. 

Our consumer loan two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio was relatively flat compared with June 30, 2023 and decreased 15 basis points compared with December 31, 2022. The decrease in the ratio as compared with December 31, 2022 was due primarily to lower dollars of delinquency in residential mortgages reflecting collections and, to a lesser extent, higher outstanding loan balances.

Our net charge-off ratio increased 22 basis points during the three months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to a higher level of net charge-offs in our commercial loan portfolio driven by the deterioration of a corporate banking loan. Also contributing to the increase in the ratio were lower average loan balances in our commercial loan portfolio. 

In the year-to-date period, our net charge-off ratio increased 8 basis points due to a higher level of net charge-offs in our commercial loan portfolio driven by the deterioration of a corporate banking loan as well as a higher level of net charge-offs in our consumer loan portfolio due in part to the impact of certain legacy mass market credit cards and other consumer loans which were transferred from held for sale back to held for investment in the fourth quarter of 2022.

(1) See Note 6, "Loans," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a breakout of nonaccrual loans and accruing loans contractually 90 days or more past due. At September 30, 2023, June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, total nonperforming loans include $3 million, $4 million and $4 million, respectively, of accruing loans contractually 90 days or more past due. 

(2) At September 30, 2023, June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, nonperforming consumer mortgage loans include $119 million, $120 million and $109 million, respectively, of loans that are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell. 

(3) Nonperforming consumer mortgage loans held for investment include all loans which are 90 or more days contractually delinquent as well as loans discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not re-affirmed and second lien loans where the first lien loan that we own or service is 90 or more days contractually delinquent. 

(4) Nonperforming consumer mortgage loans for all periods does not include guaranteed loans purchased from the Government National Mortgage Association. Repayment of these loans is predominantly insured by the Federal Housing Administration and as such, these loans have different risk characteristics from the rest of our customer loan portfolio. 

(5) Includes $1 million or less of commercial other real estate owned at September 30, 2023, June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

Our nonperforming loans ratio increased 11 basis points and 28 basis points compared with June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, due primarily to higher nonperforming loans in our commercial loan portfolio, partially offset by lower nonperforming loans in our consumer loan portfolio. 

Our commercial nonperforming loans ratio increased 18 basis points and 44 basis points compared with June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, due primarily to higher nonperforming loans driven by downgrades, including the downgrade of a commercial real estate loan in the third quarter. The increase in nonperforming loans was partially offset by paydowns and loan sales and, as compared with June 30, 2023, the charge-off of a corporate banking loan which was downgraded to nonaccrual in the second quarter. Also contributing to the increase in the ratio as compared with December 31, 2022 were lower outstanding loan balances. 

Our consumer nonperforming loans ratio decreased 5 basis points compared with June 30, 2023 due primarily to the collection of a large private banking home equity mortgage loan which had become 90 days past due in the first quarter. As compared with December 31, 2022, our consumer nonperforming loans ratio decreased 12 basis points due primarily to lower nonperforming loans in residential mortgages reflecting collections and customers returning to accrual status. Also contributing to the decrease in the ratio in both periods were higher outstanding loan balances. 

Our policies and practices for problem loan management and placing loans on nonaccrual status are summarized in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements," in our 2022 Form 10-K.

Concentration of Credit Risk A concentration of credit risk is defined as a significant credit exposure with an individual or group engaged in similar activities or affected similarly by economic conditions. We enter into a variety of transactions in the normal course of business that involve both on and off-balance sheet credit risk. Principal among these activities is lending to various commercial, institutional, governmental and individual customers. We manage the varying degrees of credit risk associated with on and off-balance sheet transactions through specific credit policies and procedures which provide for a strict approval, monitoring and reporting process. It is our policy to require collateral when it is deemed appropriate. Varying degrees and types of collateral are secured depending upon management's credit evaluation. 

Commercial Credit Exposure Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Commercial loans outstanding, excluding loans held for sale, and unused commercial commitments by industry are presented in the table below:

Residential Mortgage Loans Our consumer loan portfolio includes the following types of loans: 

&#8226; Interest-only loans &#8211; A loan which allows a customer to pay the interest-only portion of the monthly payment for a period of time which results in lower payments during the initial loan period. 

&#8226; ARM loans &#8211; A loan which allows us to adjust pricing on the loan in line with market movements. 

The following table summarizes the balances of interest-only and ARM loans in our loan portfolios, excluding mortgages held for sale, at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Each category is not mutually exclusive and loans may appear in more than one category below.

Credit Risks Associated with Derivative Contracts Credit risk associated with derivatives is measured as the net replacement cost of derivative contracts in a receivable position in the event the counterparties of such contracts fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. In managing derivative credit risk, both the current exposure, which is the replacement cost of contracts on the measurement date, as well as an estimate of the potential change in value of contracts over their remaining lives are considered. Counterparties to our derivative activities include financial institutions, central clearing parties, foreign and domestic government agencies, corporations, funds (mutual funds, hedge funds, etc.), insurance companies and private clients as well as other HSBC entities. These counterparties are subject to regular credit review by the credit risk management department. To minimize credit risk, we may enter into legally enforceable master netting agreements which reduce risk by permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon occurrence of certain events. In addition, we reduce credit risk by obtaining collateral from counterparties. The determination of the need for and the levels of collateral will differ based on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty and/or regulatory requirements. 

The total risk in a derivative contract is a function of a number of variables, such as: 

&#8226; volatility of interest rates, currencies, equity or corporate reference entity used as the basis for determining contract payments; 

&#8226; current market events or trends; 

&#8226; country risk; 

&#8226; maturity and liquidity of contracts; 

&#8226; creditworthiness of the counterparties in the transaction; 

&#8226; the existence of a master netting agreement among the counterparties; and 

&#8226; existence and value of collateral received from counterparties to secure exposures. 

The table below presents total credit risk exposure calculated using the general risk-based capital rules of the Basel III Standardized Approach which includes the net positive mark-to-market of the derivative contracts plus any adjusted potential future exposure as measured in reference to the notional amount. The regulatory capital rules recognize that bilateral netting agreements reduce credit risk and, therefore, allow for reductions of risk-weighted assets when netting requirements have been met and collateral exists. As a result, risk-weighted amounts for regulatory capital purposes are a portion of the original gross exposures. Furthermore, many contracts contain provisions that allow us to close out the transaction if the counterparty fails to post required collateral. In addition, many contracts give us the right to break the transactions earlier than the final maturity date. As a result, these contracts have potential future exposures that are often much smaller than the future exposures derived from the regulatory capital rules. 

September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 &#160; (in millions) Risk associated with derivative contracts: Total credit risk exposure $ 13,899 &#160; $ 12,437 Less: collateral held against exposure 4,911 &#160; 3,488 Net credit risk exposure $ 8,988 &#160; $ 8,949 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Effective liquidity management is defined as ensuring we can meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities/withdrawals and other cash commitments efficiently under both normal operating conditions and under unpredictable circumstances of industry or market stress. To achieve this objective, we have guidelines that require sufficient liquidity to cover potential funding requirements in both the short- and long-term and to avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. Guidelines are set for the consolidated balance sheet of HSBC USA to ensure that it is a source of strength for our regulated, deposit-taking banking subsidiary, as well as to address the more limited sources of liquidity available to it as a holding company. Similar guidelines are set for HSBC Bank USA to ensure that it can meet its liquidity needs in various stress scenarios. Cash flow analysis, including stress testing scenarios, forms the basis for liquidity management and contingency funding plans. See "Risk Management" in this MD&#38;A for further discussion of our approach towards liquidity and funding risk management, including information regarding the key measures employed to define, monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk. 

Regional bank failures earlier in 2023 triggered turmoil throughout the banking industry as contagion fears spread. To date, we have not experienced any significant impact to our liquidity, deposits or funding capabilities as a result of this industry turmoil. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Interest Bearing Deposits with Banks totaled $30,826 million and $17,744 million at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, of which $30,599 million and $17,633 million, respectively, were held with the Federal Reserve Bank. Balances may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our liquidity position at the time and our strategy for deploying liquidity. Surplus interest bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank may be deployed into securities purchased under agreements to resell or other investments depending on market conditions and the opportunity to maximize returns. 

Federal Funds Sold and Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell totaled $7,749 million and $23,085 million at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Balances may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our liquidity position at the time and our strategy for deploying liquidity.

Under our shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, we may issue certain securities including debt securities and preferred stock. We satisfy the eligibility requirements for designation as a "well-known seasoned issuer," which allows us to file a registration statement that does not have a limit on issuance capacity. The ability to issue under the registration statement is limited by the authority granted by the Board of Directors. At September 30, 2023, we were authorized to issue up to $15,000 million, of which $4,914 million was available. HSBC Bank USA has a $40,000 million Global Bank Note Program that provides for the issuance of subordinated and senior notes, of which $11,968 million was available at September 30, 2023. 

As a member of the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, we have secured borrowing facilities which are collateralized by loans and investment securities. At September 30, 2023, long-term debt included $1,000 million of borrowings from the FHLB facility. Based upon the amounts pledged as collateral under these facilities, we have additional borrowing capacity of up to $13,094 million. 

Preferred Equity See Note 19, "Preferred Stock," in our 2022 Form 10-K for information regarding all outstanding preferred share issues. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Common Equity During the second quarter of 2023, HSBC USA received a common stock dividend of $1.0 billion from its subsidiary, HSBC Bank USA, and paid a dividend on its common stock of $1.0 billion from retained earnings to its parent, HSBC North America. 

Capital Ratios In managing capital, we develop targets for common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, total capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier 1 capital to adjusted quarterly average assets (i.e., the "Tier 1 leverage ratio"). Capital targets are reviewed at least semi-annually to ensure they reflect our business mix and risk profile, as well as real-time conditions and circumstances. The following table summarizes HSBC USA's Basel III capital ratios calculated as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022: 

September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 13.5 &#160; % 13.5 % Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 13.8 &#160; 13.8 Total capital to risk-weighted assets 16.2 &#160; 16.1 

Tier 1 leverage ratio (1) 

8.2 &#160; 8.5 

(1) Adjusted quarterly average assets, the Tier 1 leverage ratio denominator, reflects quarterly average assets adjusted for amounts permitted to be deducted from Tier 1 capital. 

We manage capital in accordance with HSBC Group policy. The HSBC North America Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ("ICAAP") works in conjunction with the HSBC Group's ICAAP. The HSBC North America ICAAP applies to HSBC Bank USA and evaluates regulatory capital adequacy and capital adequacy under various stress scenarios. Our approach is to meet our capital needs for these stress scenarios locally through activities which reduce risk. To the extent that local alternatives are insufficient, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC, we would seek support from our ultimate parent. Regulatory capital requirements are based on the amount of capital required to be held, plus applicable capital buffers, as defined by regulations, and the amount of risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure, also calculated based on regulatory definitions. 

We are subject to regulatory capital rules issued by U.S. banking regulators including Basel III (the "Basel III rule"). The Basel III rule establishes minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for banks and bank holding companies ("BHCs"). HSBC North America, HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA each calculate their risk-based capital requirements for credit risk under the Standardized Approach in the Basel III rule. In 2019, the FRB and the other federal banking agencies jointly finalized rules to implement the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act that tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards for large BHC and foreign banking organizations (the "Tailoring Rules"). The Tailoring Rules assign each BHC and IHC with $50 billion or more in total U.S. assets into one of five classifications (Categories I through IV, and 'other firms') based on its size and four risk-based indicators. Under the Tailoring Rules, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA are subject to Category IV standards. For additional discussion of the Basel III rule requirements, including required minimum capital ratios, as well as further discussion of the Tailoring Rules and Category IV standards see Part I, "Regulation and Competition - Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Requirements," in our 2022 Form 10-K. We continue to review the composition of our capital structure. 

Regulatory Developments In July 2023, U.S. banking regulators proposed changes to the regulatory capital rules applicable to U.S. banks, BHCs and IHCs with total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more. These changes are intended to be broadly consistent with revisions to Basel III finalized by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in 2017. The U.S. proposal would end the use of internal models for credit risk, credit valuation adjustments, and operational risk, create an expanded risk-based credit capital approach in addition to retaining a modified version of the current standardized approach, and make changes to the modeling requirements for market risk. These proposals are subject to a public comment period through at least January 16, 2024, and would not be effective until July 1, 2025. Certain aspects of the proposal would be subject to a three-year phase-in period. We are analyzing the proposed changes, including the timing of implementation, to determine the potential effects on capital requirements. Based on the foregoing, we expect an increase in the capital requirements of HSBC North America, HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA during the phase-in period and thereafter. 

In August 2023, U.S. banking regulators also released a proposal that would require certain U.S. banks, BHCs and IHCs to issue and maintain long-term debt to improve resolvability. The proposal is subject to a public comment period through at least November 30, 2023. If adopted as proposed, HSBC Bank USA would be required to issue minimum levels of internal long-term debt to either HSBC USA or HSBC North America, phased-in over a three-year period. HSBC North America is already subject to long-term debt and TLAC requirements as an IHC of a non-U.S. G-SIB. 

Capital Planning and Stress Testing The FRB requires certain U.S. top-tier BHCs and IHCs, including HSBC North America, to comply with the FRB's capital plan rule and CCAR program, as well as the supervisory stress tests conducted by the FRB. The stress tests are forward looking exercises to assess the impact of hypothetical macroeconomic baseline and severely adverse scenarios provided by the FRB on the financial condition and capital adequacy of a CCAR firm over a nine quarter planning 

HSBC USA Inc. 

horizon. As a Category IV firm, HSBC North America is subject to supervisory stress testing on a biennial basis, although it may opt-in to such testing in an "off year" in order to recalibrate its stress capital buffer based on its most recent supervisory stress test. The FRB continues to supervise Category IV firms on an ongoing basis, including evaluation of the capital adequacy and capital planning processes during off-cycle years. For further discussion of capital planning and stress testing, including detail regarding the FRB's supervisory assessment as part of the CCAR process, see Part I, "Regulation and Competition - Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Requirements," in our 2022 Form 10-K. 

HSBC North America submitted its 2023 CCAR capital plan in April 2023. As discussed above, HSBC North America is subject to supervisory stress testing on a biennial basis and, therefore, did not participate in the FRB's 2023 supervisory stress test. Capital planning and stress testing for HSBC North America may impact our future capital and liquidity. 

While BHC regulatory capital compliance is generally performed at the HSBC North America level, and also separately for HSBC Bank USA, as a BHC we are required to meet minimum capital requirements imposed by the FRB. We present our capital ratios, together with HSBC Bank USA's in Note 16, "Retained Earnings and Regulatory Capital Requirements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

2023 Funding Strategy Our current estimate for funding needs and sources for 2023 are summarized in the following table: 

Actual January 1 through 

September 30, 2023 

Estimated October 1 through 

December 31, 2023 

Estimated Full Year 2023 

&#160; (in billions) Increase (decrease) in funding needs: Net change in loans $ (1) $ 1 $ &#8212; Net change in short-term investments and securities 2 &#8212; 2 Net change in trading and other assets (1) (1) (2) Total funding needs $ &#8212; $ &#8212; $ &#8212; Increase (decrease) in funding sources: Net change in deposits $ (3) $ 2 $ (1) Net change in trading and other short-term liabilities 2 (1) 1 Net change in long-term debt 1 (1) &#8212; Total funding sources $ &#8212; $ &#8212; $ &#8212; 

The above table reflects a long-term funding strategy. Daily balances fluctuate as we accommodate customer needs, while ensuring that we have liquidity in place to support the balance sheet maturity funding profile. Should market conditions deteriorate, we have contingency plans to generate additional liquidity through the sales of assets or financing transactions. We remain confident in our ability to access the market for long-term debt funding needs in the current market environment. We continue to seek well-priced and stable customer deposits. We also continue to sell new agency-eligible conforming residential mortgage loans to third parties. 

HSBC Bank USA is subject to significant restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to, and certain other 'covered transactions' with HSBC USA and other affiliates. For further discussion, see Part I, "Regulation and Competition - Affiliate Transaction Restrictions," in our 2022 Form 10-K. 

See "Risk Management" in this MD&#38;A for further discussion relating to our liquidity contingency plans and our approach to liquidity and funding risk management. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our normal operations, we enter into credit derivatives and various off-balance sheet arrangements with affiliates and third parties. These arrangements arise principally in connection with our lending and client intermediation activities and involve primarily commitments to extend credit and, in certain cases, guarantees. 

Commitments to extend credit include arrangements whereby we are contractually obligated to extend credit in the form of loans, participations in loans or similar transactions. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had commitments to extend credit totaling $88.9 billion and $88.8 billion, respectively, comprised primarily of commercial commitments and, to a lesser extent, consumer commitments. Commercial commitments comprise primarily those related to secured and unsecured loans and lines of credit. Consumer commitments comprise unused MasterCard/Visa credit card lines, where we have the right to change terms or conditions upon notification to the customer, and commitments to extend credit secured by residential properties, where we have the right to change terms or conditions, for cause, upon notification to the customer. For a summary of guarantees, including standby letters of credit and certain credit derivative transactions, as well as the contractual amounts 

HSBC USA Inc. 

outstanding at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, see Note 18, "Guarantee Arrangements, Pledged Asset and Repurchase Agreements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent our maximum possible credit exposure in the event that a counterparty draws down the full commitment amount or we are required to fulfill our maximum obligation under a guarantee. Many of these commitments and guarantees expire unused or without default. As a result, we believe that the contractual amount is not representative of the actual future credit exposure or funding requirements. 

Our off-balance sheet arrangements also include transactions with unconsolidated variable interest entities ("VIEs"). See Note 17, "Variable Interest Entities," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of these unconsolidated VIEs. 

Fair Value 

Fair Value Hierarchy Fair value measurement accounting principles establish a fair value hierarchy structure that prioritizes the inputs to determine the fair value of an asset or liability (the "Fair Value Framework"). The Fair Value Framework distinguishes between inputs that are based on observed market data and unobservable inputs that reflect market participants' assumptions. It emphasizes the use of valuation methodologies that maximize observable market inputs. For financial instruments carried at fair value, the best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an actively traded market (Level 1). Where the market for a financial instrument is not active, valuation techniques are used. The majority of our valuation techniques use market inputs that are either observable or indirectly derived from and corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the financial instrument (Level 2). Because Level 1 and Level 2 instruments are determined by observable inputs, less judgment is applied in determining their fair values. In the absence of observable market inputs, the financial instrument is valued based on valuation techniques that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The determination of the level of fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement of an asset or a liability is classified often requires judgment and may change over time as market conditions evolve. We consider the following factors in developing the fair value hierarchy: 

&#8226; whether the asset or liability is transacted in an active market with a quoted market price; 

&#8226; the level of bid-ask spreads; 

&#8226; a lack of pricing transparency due to, among other things, complexity of the product and market liquidity; 

&#8226; whether only a few transactions are observed over a significant period of time; 

&#8226; whether the pricing quotations differ substantially among independent pricing services; 

&#8226; whether inputs to the valuation techniques can be derived from or corroborated with market data; and 

&#8226; whether significant adjustments are made to the observed pricing information or model output to determine the fair value. 

Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that the reporting entity has the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities. A financial instrument is classified as a Level 1 measurement if it is listed on an exchange or is an instrument actively traded in the over-the-counter ("OTC") market where transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume. We regard financial instruments such as debt securities, equity securities and derivative contracts listed on the primary exchanges of a country to be actively traded. Non-exchange-traded instruments classified as Level 1 assets include securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, to-be-announced securities, non-callable securities issued by U.S. Government sponsored enterprises and certain foreign government-backed debt. 

Level 2 inputs are those that are observable either directly or indirectly but do not qualify as Level 1 inputs. We classify mortgage pass-through securities, agency and certain non-agency mortgage collateralized obligations, non-exchange-traded derivative contracts, asset-backed securities, obligations of U.S. states and political subdivisions, corporate debt securities, certain foreign government-backed debt, preferred securities, securities purchased and sold under resale and repurchase agreements, precious metals, certain loans held for sale, certain student loans, residential mortgage loans whose carrying amount was reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, real estate owned and certain client share repurchase transactions as Level 2 measurements. Where possible, at least two quotations from independent sources are obtained based on transactions involving comparable assets and liabilities to validate the fair value of these instruments. We have established a process to understand the methodologies and inputs used by the third party pricing services to ensure that pricing information meets the fair value objective and, where appropriate, this pricing data is back-tested to market trade executions. Where significant differences arise among the independent pricing quotes and the internally determined fair value, we investigate and reconcile the differences. If the investigation results in a significant adjustment to the fair value, the instrument will be classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. In general, we have observed that there is a correlation between the credit standing and the market liquidity of a non-derivative instrument. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Level 2 derivative instruments are generally valued based on discounted future cash flows or an option pricing model adjusted for counterparty credit risk and market liquidity. The fair value of certain derivative products is determined using valuation techniques based on inputs derived from observable indices traded in the OTC market. Appropriate control processes and procedures have been applied to ensure that the derived inputs are applied to value only those instruments that share similar risks to the relevant benchmark indices and therefore demonstrate a similar response to market factors. 

Level 3 inputs are unobservable estimates that management expects market participants would use to determine the fair value of the asset or liability. That is, Level 3 inputs incorporate market participants' assumptions about risk and the risk premium required by market participants in order to bear that risk. We develop Level 3 inputs based on the best information available in the circumstances. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our Level 3 measurements included the following: certain structured deposits and structured notes for which the embedded derivatives have significant unobservable inputs (e.g., volatility or default correlations), certain asset-backed securities, individually assessed commercial loans, mortgage servicing rights, derivatives with certain inputs which are unobservable, certain credit default swaps, certain loans held for sale and swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of Visa Class B Shares for which the fair value is dependent upon the final resolution of the related litigation. See Note 19, "Fair Value Measurements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on Level 3 inputs. 

Level 3 Measurements The following table provides information about Level 3 assets/liabilities in relation to total assets/liabilities measured at fair value at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022:

(3) Includes $66,316 million of assets measured on a recurring basis and $773 million of assets measured on a non-recurring basis at September 30, 2023. Includes $68,276 million of assets measured on a recurring basis and $165 million of assets measured on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2022. 

Significant Changes in Fair Value for Level 3 Assets and Liabilities See Note 19, "Fair Value Measurements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on additions to and transfers into (out of) Level 3 measurements during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 as well as for further details including the classification hierarchy associated with assets and liabilities measured at fair value. 

Effect of Changes in Significant Unobservable Inputs &#160; The fair value of certain financial instruments is measured using valuation techniques that incorporate pricing assumptions not supported by, derived from or corroborated by observable market data. The resultant fair value measurements are dependent on unobservable input parameters which can be selected from a range of estimates and may be interdependent. Changes in one or more of the significant unobservable input parameters may change the fair value measurements of these financial instruments. For the purpose of preparing the financial statements, the final valuation inputs selected are based on management's best judgment that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing similar assets or liabilities. 

The unobservable input parameters selected are subject to the internal valuation control processes and procedures. When we perform a test of all the significant input parameters to the extreme values within the range at the same time, it could result in an increase of the overall fair value measurement of approximately $22 million or a decrease of the overall fair value measurement of approximately $62 million at September 30, 2023. The effect of changes in significant unobservable input parameters are primarily driven by the uncertainty in determining the fair value of certain credit-linked structured notes and swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of Visa Class B Shares.

Risk Management 

Overview &#160; The primary role of risk management is to protect our customers, business, colleagues and the communities that we serve, while ensuring we are able to support our strategy and provide sustainable growth. 

We aim to use a comprehensive risk management approach across the organization and across all risk types underpinned by our culture and values. This is outlined in our risk management framework, including the key principles and practices that we employ in managing material risks, both financial and non-financial. This framework fosters continuous monitoring, promotes risk awareness, and encourages sound operational and strategic decision-making and escalation processes. It also supports a consistent approach to identifying, assessing, managing, and reporting the risks we accept and incur in our activities, with clear accountabilities. 

Our Board of Directors has the ultimate responsibility for the effective oversight of risk management and approves our risk appetite. It is advised on risk matters by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors, notably risk appetite and its alignment with our strategy, risk governance and internal controls, as well as high-level risk related matters. We use a defined executive risk governance structure to help ensure there is appropriate oversight and accountability embedded throughout our business for the effective management of risk. 

Our material risks The principal risks associated with our operations include the following: 

&#8226; Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract; 

&#8226; Treasury risk is the risk of having insufficient capital, liquidity or funding resources to meet financial obligations and satisfy regulatory requirements, including the risk of an adverse impact on earnings due to changes in market interest rates, together with pension risk; 

&#8226; Market risk is the risk of an adverse financial impact on trading activities arising from changes in market parameters such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, asset prices, volatilities, correlations and credit spreads; 

&#8226; Climate risk relates to the financial and non-financial impacts that may arise as a result of climate change and the move to a greener economy; 

&#8226; Resilience risk is the risk that we are unable to provide critical services to our customers, affiliates and counterparties as a result of sustained and significant operational disruption; 

&#8226; Regulatory compliance risk is the risk associated with breaching our duty to clients and other counterparties, inappropriate market conduct and breaching related financial services regulatory standards; 

&#8226; Financial crime risk is the risk of knowingly or unknowingly helping parties to commit or to further potentially illegal activity, including money laundering, fraud, bribery and corruption, tax evasion, sanctions breaches, and terrorist and proliferation financing; 

&#8226; Strategic risk is the risk that the business will fail to identify, execute and react appropriately to opportunities and/or threats arising from changes in the market, some of which may emerge over a number of years such as changing economic and political circumstances, customer requirements, demographic trends, regulatory developments or competitor action; and 

&#8226; Model risk is the risk of inappropriate or incorrect business decisions arising from the use of models that have been inadequately designed, implemented or used, or from models that do not perform in line with expectations and predictions. 

In the course of our regular risk management activities, we use models to help quantify the risk we are taking. We believe that the assumptions used in these models are reasonable within the parameters for which the models have been built and calibrated to operate, but events may unfold differently than what is assumed in the models. Adjustments to model outputs to reflect consideration of management judgment are used with stringent governance in place to ensure appropriate results. Where models do not require adjustments, enhanced model monitoring confirms models are performing as intended. 

See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2022 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of the objectives of our risk management system as well as our risk management policies and practices. There have been no material changes to our approach to risk management since December 31, 2022. 

Credit Risk Management Credit risk is managed through a robust risk identification and control framework which outlines clear and consistent policies, principles and guidance for risk managers. Credit risk is monitored using various internal risk management measures and within limits approved by individuals within a framework of delegated authorities. Our credit risk management procedures are designed for all stages of economic and financial cycles, including challenging periods of market volatility and economic uncertainty. During the first nine months of 2023, the future economic environment remained uncertain amidst high inflation, rising interest rates and the expectation for slowing future economic growth. We continue to monitor the 

HSBC USA Inc. 

performance of our material commercial loans as conditions evolve and take necessary credit actions where warranted. See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2022 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our approach to credit risk. 

Treasury Risk Management We continuously monitor our capital ratios and the impact of market events on our liquidity positions and will continue to adapt our frameworks as necessary to reflect market events and the evolving regulatory landscape and view as to best practices. See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2022 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our approach to treasury risk. 

Capital risk See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in this MD&#38;A for a discussion of our approach to capital risk management, including our capital ratios and regulatory capital requirements. 

Liquidity and funding risk As part of our approach towards liquidity and funding risk management, we employ the measures discussed below to define, monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk in accordance with HSBC policy. 

HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA are subject to the U.S. liquidity coverage ratio ("LCR") rule, which is designed to be a short-term liquidity measure to ensure banks have sufficient High Quality Liquid Assets ("HQLA") to cover net stressed cash outflows over the next 30 days, and are required to report their LCR to U.S. regulators on a daily basis. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, HSBC Bank USA's LCR remained above 100 percent. Under the Tailoring Rules, a 70 percent LCR requirement applies to Category IV firms with weighted short-term wholesale funding that equals or exceeds $50 billion and their depository institution subsidiaries. As a result, a LCR of 100 percent or higher reflects an unencumbered HQLA balance that is equal to or exceeds 70 percent of a Category IV firm's liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario. HQLA consists of cash or assets that can be converted into cash at little or no loss of value in private markets. 

HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA are also subject to the U.S. net stable funding ratio ("NSFR") rule, which is a longer term liquidity measure with a 12-month time horizon to ensure a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities. At both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, HSBC Bank USA's NSFR exceeded 100 percent. Under the Tailoring Rules, a 70 percent NSFR requirement applies to Category IV firms with weighted short-term wholesale funding that equals or exceeds $50 billion and their depository institution subsidiaries. As a result, a NSFR of 100 percent or more reflects an available stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next 12 months that is equal to or exceeds 70 percent of a Category IV firm's required amount of funding for assets and off-balance sheet exposures. In addition, under the United Kingdom ("U.K.") Prudential Regulatory Authority ("PRA") based NSFR rule, HSBC USA's NSFR exceeded 100 percent at both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Under the U.K. PRA NSFR rule, a NSFR of 100 percent or more reflects an available stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next 12 months that is equal to or exceeds the required amount of funding for assets and off-balance sheet exposures. 

As a Category IV firm, HSBC North America remains subject to liquidity stress testing and related liquidity buffer and liquidity risk management requirements. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA have liquidity profiles to support compliance with these rules and may need to make changes to their liquidity profiles to support compliance with any future rules. 

Our liquidity and funding risk management approach includes deposits, supplemented by wholesale borrowing to fund our balance sheet, and using security sales or secured borrowings for liquidity stress situations in our liquidity contingency plans. In addition, regulations require banks to retain a portfolio of HQLA. As such, we are maintaining a large portfolio of high quality sovereign and sovereign guaranteed securities. 

Our ability to regularly attract wholesale funds at a competitive cost is enhanced by strong ratings from the major credit rating agencies. The following table reflects the short and long-term credit ratings of HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA at September 30, 2023: 

&#160; &#160; 

Moody's S&#38;P Fitch HSBC USA: Short-term borrowings P-1 A-2 F1+ Long-term/senior debt A1 A- A+ HSBC Bank USA: Short-term borrowings P-1 A-1 F1+ Long-term/senior debt Aa3 A+ AA- 

Rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk management practices and legal matters, all of which could lead to adverse ratings actions. 

Although we closely monitor and strive to manage factors influencing our credit ratings, there is no assurance that our credit ratings will not change in the future. In July 2023, Moody's placed on review for downgrade the long-term debt ratings of HSBC USA reflecting the decrease in loss absorbing capacity debt outstanding at HSBC North America. At September 30, 2023, none of the other ratings on the debt of HSBC USA or HSBC Bank USA from any of the rating agencies were under 

HSBC USA Inc. 

review for potential downgrade. In October 2023, Moody's concluded their review and downgraded the long-term debt ratings of HSBC USA by one notch, including the senior debt rating which was downgraded to A2 from A1. The outlook for the senior debt ratings of HSBC USA is stable. While these rating actions are not expected to have a material financial impact on our borrowing costs or liquidity, any additional future actions could have such an impact. 

See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in this MD&#38;A for further discussion of our liquidity position, including additional information regarding our outstanding borrowings, the remaining availability of our debt issuance programs and our funding strategy. 

Interest rate risk Various techniques are utilized to quantify and monitor risks associated with the repricing characteristics of our assets, liabilities and derivative contracts. See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2022 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our approach to interest rate risk. 

Economic value of equity ("EVE") EVE represents the present value of the banking book cash flows that could be provided to our equity holder under a managed run-off scenario. An EVE sensitivity represents the change in EVE due to a defined movement in interest rates. We manage to an immediate parallel upward shock of 200 basis points and an immediate parallel downward shock of 200 basis points to the market implied interest rates. At both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our EVE remained within risk limits for the up 200 and down 200 basis point interest rate shock scenarios. 

Net interest income simulation modeling techniques We utilize simulation modeling to monitor a number of interest rate scenarios for their impact on projected net interest income. These techniques simulate the impact on projected net interest income under various scenarios, such as rate shock scenarios which assume immediate market rate movements by 100 basis points, as well as scenarios in which rates gradually rise or fall by 100 basis points over a twelve month period. In the gradual scenarios, 25 percent of the interest rate movement occurs at the beginning of each quarter. The following table reflects the impact on our projected net interest income of the scenarios utilized by these modeling techniques: 

September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Amount % Amount % &#160; (dollars are in millions) Estimated increase (decrease) in projected net interest income (reflects projected rate movements on October 1, 2023 and January 1, 2023, respectively): 

Resulting from a gradual 100 basis point increase in the yield curve $ (39) (2) % $ 34 1 % Resulting from a gradual 100 basis point decrease in the yield curve 20 &#160; 1 &#160; (43) (2) Other significant scenarios monitored (reflects projected rate movements on October 1, 2023 and January 1, 2023, respectively): 

Resulting from an immediate 100 basis point increase in the yield curve (51) (2) 66 2 Resulting from an immediate 100 basis point decrease in the yield curve 57 &#160; 2 &#160; (60) (2) 

The projections do not take into consideration possible complicating factors such as the effect of changes in interest rates on the credit quality, size and composition of the balance sheet. Therefore, although this provides a reasonable estimate of interest rate sensitivity, actual results will differ from these estimates, possibly by significant amounts. 

Non-trading value at risk ("VaR") Non-trading VaR predominantly relates to Markets Treasury and represents the potential negative changes in the investment portfolio market value (which includes available-for-sale and held-to-maturity assets) and associated hedges. Our investment portfolio holdings comprise mainly U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed and U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities. Our non-trading VaR exposure is driven by interest rates and agency spread volatility. Refer to "Market Risk Management" below for further discussion regarding VaR and the management of market risk in our non-trading portfolios. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

The following table summarizes our non-trading VaR for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and at December 31, 2022:

(1) Refer to the Trading VaR table in "Market Risk Management" below for additional information. 

Non-trading VaR also includes the interest rate risk of non-trading financial assets and liabilities held by the global businesses and transfer priced into Markets Treasury which has the mandate to centrally manage and hedge it. 

Market Risk Management Exposure to market risk is separated into two portfolios: 

&#8226; Trading portfolios comprise positions arising from market-making and warehousing of client-derived positions. 

&#8226; Non-trading portfolios comprise positions that primarily arise from the interest rate management of our retail and commercial banking assets and liabilities and financial investments classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity. 

We apply similar risk management policies and measurement techniques to both trading and non-trading portfolios. Our objective is to manage and control market risk exposures to optimize return on risk while maintaining a market profile consistent with our established risk appetite. See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2022 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our approach to market risk. 

Value at risk ("VaR") VaR is a technique for estimating potential losses on risk positions as a result of movements in market rates and prices over a specified time horizon and to a given level of confidence. The use of VaR is integrated into market risk management and calculated for all trading positions regardless of how we capitalize them. In addition, we calculate VaR for non-trading portfolios to have a complete picture of risk. VaR measures are calculated to a 99 percent confidence level and use a one-day holding period. 

Trading VaR Trading VaR is generated principally from trading activities within the MSS segment of GBM. These include positions in interest rates, foreign exchange, precious metals (i.e., gold, silver, platinum) and credit default swaps. In September 2023, we entered into derivative transactions to transfer the substantial majority of the market risk associated with our precious metals trading positions to HSBC Bank plc, where it will be centrally managed going forward. 

The following graph summarizes daily VaR for our trading portfolios at a 99 percent confidence level (in millions): 

HSBC USA Inc.

(1) Portfolio diversification is the market risk dispersion effect of holding a portfolio containing different risk types. It represents the reduction in unsystematic market risk that occurs when combining a number of different risk types, for example, foreign exchange, interest rate and credit spread, together in one portfolio. It is measured as the difference between the sum of the VaR by individual risk type and the combined total VaR. A negative number represents the benefit of portfolio diversification. As the maximum and minimum occur on different days for different risk types, it is not meaningful to calculate a portfolio diversification benefit for these measures. 

(2) The total VaR is non-additive across risk types due to diversification effects. For presentation purposes, portfolio diversification of the VaR for trading portfolios includes VaR-based risk-not-in-VaR. 

Refer to "Treasury Risk Management" above for disclosure of our non-trading VaR. 

Back-testing We routinely validate the accuracy of our VaR models by back-testing them against hypothetical profit and loss that excludes non-modeled items such as fees, commissions and revenues of intra-day transactions from the actual reported profit and loss. We would expect, under stable market conditions, to experience two or three losses in excess of VaR at the 99 percent confidence level over a one-year period. However, in periods of unstable market conditions, we could see an increase in the number of back-testing exceptions. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we experienced no loss back-testing exceptions.

CONSOLIDATED AVERAGE BALANCES AND INTEREST RATES 

The following table summarizes the quarter-to-date and year-to-date average daily balances of the principal components of assets, liabilities and equity together with their respective interest amounts and rates earned or paid. Net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by the average interest earning assets from which interest income is earned. Loan interest for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 included fees of $7 million and $20 million, respectively, compared with fees of $9 million and $31 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively.
