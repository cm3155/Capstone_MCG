HSBC USA Inc. 

Executive Overview 

HSBC USA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC North America Holdings Inc. ("HSBC North America"), which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC. HUSI may also be referred to in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&#38;A") as "we," "us" or "our." 

Economic Environment &#160; The U.S. economy continued to grow during the first quarter of 2024 despite continued pressures from inflation and elevated interest rates, which are expected to lead to a slowdown of future economic growth. U.S. Gross Domestic Product ("GDP") grew at an estimated annual rate of 1.6 percent in the first quarter of 2024, while the personal consumption expenditures price index of 2.7 percent in March 2024 remained slightly above the FRB's target inflation rate. In March 2024, the FRB decided to hold short-term interest rates steady and, while interest rates are expected to remain elevated for some time, the FRB is expected to start decreasing short-term interest rates in 2024, the timing of which is dependent upon future economic conditions. 

Although the U.S. economy continued to grow during the first quarter of 2024, economic uncertainty remains due to elevated interest rates, inflation levels and the expectation for slowing economic growth, all of which will continue to impact our business in future periods. Concerns over domestic and global policy issues, trade policy in the U.S. and geopolitical events, including the turmoil in the Middle East, as well as the implications of those events on the markets in general, further add to the global uncertainty. Interest rate levels, inflation and economic growth, in combination with global economic conditions, fiscal and monetary policy and the level of regulatory and government scrutiny of financial institutions will continue to impact our results in 2024 and beyond. 

Performance, Developments and Trends As previously disclosed, in November 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") issued a final rule that imposes a special assessment on certain FDIC-insured banks, including HSBC Bank USA, to recover the loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund ("DIF") arising from the protection of uninsured depositors following a determination of systemic risk in connection with the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. This resulted in additional deposit insurance assessment fees of $243 million being accrued in 2023. Because the estimated loss to the DIF will be periodically adjusted as actual losses are incurred, the FDIC retains the ability to cease collection early, extend the special assessment collection period beyond the initial eight-quarter collection period, or impose a final shortfall special assessment after the receiverships for the two banks are terminated. During the first quarter of 2024, we became aware that the estimated loss to the DIF has increased and, as a result, we accrued $36 million of additional deposit insurance assessment fees to reflect our best estimate of the updated special assessment amount. The FDIC is expected to inform banks who are required to fund the shortfall in the DIF of the amount of the updated special assessment in June 2024. 

The following tables set forth selected financial metrics of HUSI for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 and at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

Net income was $225 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared with $217 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023. Income before income tax was $278 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared with $287 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in income before income tax during the three months ended March 31, 2024 was due to lower net interest income as interest expense on deposits and interest bearing liabilities grew faster than interest income on interest earning assets as well as higher operating expenses driven by the additional deposit insurance special assessment fees which were accrued in the first quarter of 2024 as discussed above. These decreases were largely offset by higher other revenues driven by higher trading revenue and a lower provision for credit losses. 

See "Results of Operations" for a more detailed discussion of our operating trends. In addition, see "Balance Sheet Review" for further discussion on our asset and liability trends, "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for further discussion on funding and capital and "Credit Quality" for additional discussion on our credit trends. 

In March 2024, the SEC adopted final rules that will require registrants to disclose climate-related information in registration statements and annual reports, including material climate-related risks, descriptions of board oversight and risk management activities, the material impacts of these risks on a registrant's strategy, business model and outlook, and any material climate-related targets or goals. Non-accelerated filers such as HSBC USA will be exempt from the requirements to disclose Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Registrants will also have to disclose, among other things, certain effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions (e.g., hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding) relating to capitalized costs and charges, expenditures and losses in their audited financial statements. HSBC USA will be required to comply with the rules for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2027, with certain additional disclosure requirements becoming applicable for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2028. Following adoption of the rules, several lawsuits were filed challenging them and subsequently consolidated into the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. The SEC issued an order in April 2024 to stay the rules pending the judicial review by the Eighth Circuit of the consolidated challenges. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Basis of Reporting 

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"). 

Group Reporting Basis We report financial information to HSBC in accordance with HSBC Group accounting and reporting policies, which apply International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRSs") as issued by the IASB. As a result, our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the basis of HSBC Group's accounting and reporting policies ("Group Reporting Basis"). Because operating results on the Group Reporting Basis are used in managing our businesses and rewarding performance of employees, our management also separately monitors profit before tax under this basis of reporting. The following table reconciles our U.S. GAAP versus Group Reporting Basis profit before tax: 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 2023 &#160; (in millions) Profit before tax &#8211; U.S. GAAP basis $ 278 &#160; $ 287 Adjustments: Expected credit losses 10 &#160; (8) Renewable energy tax credit investments 4 &#160; 4 Other long-lived assets (1) 33 Other (5) 5 Profit before tax &#8211; Group Reporting Basis $ 286 &#160; $ 321 

The significant differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis as they impact our results are summarized in Note 25, "Business Segments," in our 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no significant changes since December 31, 2023 in the differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis impacting our results. Differences in reported profit before tax in the table above that were individually significant for the periods presented are explained below. 

During the first quarter of 2024, expected credit losses were higher under U.S. GAAP than under the Group Reporting Basis. Under the Group Reporting Basis, a majority of our loans are considered to be in "stage 1" (which requires a 12-month expected credit losses ("ECL") estimate), while under U.S. GAAP such loans require a lifetime ECL estimate. Primarily as a result of the different requirements, loss provisions associated with growth in innovation banking were more pronounced under U.S. GAAP. 

During the first quarter of 2023, expected credit losses were lower under U.S. GAAP than under the Group Reporting Basis. Primarily as a result of the different requirements related to stage 1 loans discussed above, the favorable impact of improved housing price forecasts on residential mortgages was more pronounced under U.S. GAAP. 

During the first quarter of 2023, other long-lived assets in the table above reflects $19 million of lease related impairment charges under U.S. GAAP associated with the exit of certain office space, while under the Group Reporting Basis, impairment was recognized when we committed to vacate the space in the fourth quarter of 2022. In addition, amortization expense for long-lived assets was higher under U.S. GAAP due primarily to the impact of an impairment charge recorded under the Group Reporting Basis in 2020 related to the write-off of all the capitalized software and a portion of the leasehold improvements associated with our Wealth and Personal Banking business segment, while under U.S. GAAP no impairment charge was required. Subsequent to recognition of the impairment charge in 2020, expenditures for software development and newly completed leasehold improvements in our Wealth and Personal Banking business segment were capitalized and amortized over their useful lives under U.S. GAAP, but not under the Group Reporting Basis. Consequently, the carrying amounts of capitalized software and leasehold improvements were higher under U.S. GAAP than under the Group Reporting Basis and, as a result, corresponding amortization expense was higher under U.S. GAAP. As previously disclosed, during the second quarter of 2023, we determined that the cash generating unit was no longer impaired under the Group Reporting Basis and that its estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value, which resulted in the re-establishment of these assets at their recoverable amount net of amortization that would have been recorded had no impairment loss been recognized and excluding any assets that had since been sold.

Balance Sheet Review 

The following table provides balance sheet totals at March 31, 2024 and increases (decreases) since December 31, 2023:

Short-Term Investments Short-term investments include cash and due from banks, interest bearing deposits with banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell. Balances may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our liquidity position at the time and our strategy for deploying liquidity. Short-term investments were relatively flat compared with December 31, 2023 as an increase in funds driven primarily by lower trading asset positions as discussed in detail below was largely offset by lower short-term borrowings.

(3) See "Credit Quality" in this MD&#38;A for a discussion of trends in our allowance for credit losses on loans. 

Commercial loans increased compared with December 31, 2023 driven by higher loans to affiliates, partially offset by paydowns and maturities exceeding new business activity as we continued to apply a disciplined lending approach. The decline in commercial non-affiliate loans was primarily in the diversified financials, consumer services, banking and technology industries, partially offset by increases in the utilities and real estate industries. 

Consumer loans increased compared with December 31, 2023 due to continued growth in residential mortgages. 

The following table presents loan-to-value ("LTV") ratios for our residential mortgage loan portfolio, excluding mortgage loans held for sale:

(1) LTVs for first liens are calculated using the loan balance as of the reporting date. LTVs for second liens are calculated using the loan balance as of the reporting date plus the senior lien amount at origination. Current estimated property values are derived from the property's appraised value at the time of loan origination updated by the change in the Federal Housing Finance Agency's House Price Index ("HPI") at either a core-based statistical area or state level. The estimated value of the homes could differ from actual fair values due to changes in condition of the underlying property, variations in housing price changes within metropolitan statistical areas and other factors. As a result, actual property values associated with loans that end in foreclosure may be significantly lower than the estimates used for purposes of this disclosure. 

(2) Current estimated property values are calculated using the most current HPIs available and applied on an individual loan basis, which results in an approximate three month delay in the production of reportable statistics. Therefore, the information in the table above reflects current estimated property values using HPIs at December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Loans Held for Sale The following table summarizes loans held for sale at March 31, 2024 and increases (decreases) since December 31, 2023: 

&#160; &#160; Increase (Decrease) From December 31, 2023 

&#160; &#160;

Commercial loans held for sale increased compared with December 31, 2023. Included in commercial loans held for sale are certain loans that we no longer intend to hold for investment and were transferred to held for sale which totaled $189 million and $89 million at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Commercial loans held for sale also includes certain loans that we have elected to designate under the fair value option which consists of loans that we originate in connection with our participation in a number of syndicated credit facilities with the intent of selling them to unaffiliated third parties as well as loans that we purchase from the secondary market and hold as hedges against our exposure to certain total return swaps or intend to sell. The fair value of these loans totaled $264 million and $250 million at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Balances will fluctuate from period to period depending on the volume and level of activity. 

Consumer loans held for sale were nil at both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Included in residential mortgage loans held for sale are agency-eligible conforming residential mortgage loans which are originated and held for sale to third parties, currently on a servicing retained basis. Balances will fluctuate from period to period depending on the volume and level of activity. Gains and losses from the sale of these residential mortgage loans are reflected as a component of other income (loss) in the accompanying consolidated statement of income. 

Excluding the loans designated under the fair value option discussed above, loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value, with adjustments to fair value being recorded as a valuation allowance through other revenues. The valuation allowance on commercial loans held for sale was nil and $2 million at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The valuation allowance on consumer loans held for sale was nil at both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Trading Assets and Liabilities The following table summarizes trading assets and liabilities at March 31, 2024 and increases (decreases) since December 31, 2023:

(1) See Note 2, "Trading Assets and Liabilities," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a breakout of trading securities by category. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Trading securities balances were lower compared with December 31, 2023 due primarily to a decrease in foreign sovereign positions, partially offset by an increase in equity positions. Trading security positions are primarily held as economic hedges of interest rate, credit and equity derivative products issued to clients of domestic and emerging markets. Balances of securities sold, not yet purchased were also lower compared with December 31, 2023 due to a decrease in short U.S. Treasury positions related to economic hedges of trading security positions held for Community Reinvestment Act purposes. 

Precious metals trading assets were relatively flat compared with December 31, 2023 as a decrease in our own silver inventory position was largely offset by an increase in our own platinum inventory position. Payables for precious metals were lower compared with December 31, 2023 reflecting a decline in borrowing of gold inventory to support client activity levels. Precious metal positions may not represent our net underlying exposure as we may use derivatives contracts to reduce our risk associated with these positions, the fair value of which would appear in derivatives in the table above. 

Derivative asset and liability balances both decreased compared with December 31, 2023 mainly from market movements which resulted in lower valuations of foreign exchange derivatives. 

Securities Securities include securities available-for-sale and securities held-to-maturity, net. Securities balances were relatively flat compared with December 31, 2023 as net purchases of foreign sovereign securities was offset by net sales, paydowns and maturities of U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed and U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed securities as part of our continuing strategy to maximize returns while balancing the securities portfolio for risk management purposes. 

All Other Assets &#160; All other assets include, among other items, properties and equipment, net, and goodwill. All other assets were higher compared with December 31, 2023 due primarily to increases in assets associated with client share repurchase transactions and outstanding settlement balances related to security sales. These increases were partially offset by lower margin requirements related to futures trading and lower cash collateral posted. 

Deposits The following table summarizes deposit balances by major depositor categories at March 31, 2024 and increases (decreases) since December 31, 2023: 

&#160; &#160; Increase (Decrease) From December 31, 2023 

&#160; &#160; 

March 31, 2024 Amount % &#160; (dollars are in millions) Individuals, partnerships and corporations $ 104,613 &#160; $ (4,824) (4.4) % Domestic and foreign banks 14,842 &#160; 5,491 58.7 U.S. government and states and political subdivisions 112 &#160; (14) (11.1) Foreign governments and official institutions 2,486 &#160; 117 4.9 Total deposits $ 122,053 &#160; $ 770 .6 % 

Total deposits increased compared with December 31, 2023 due primarily to higher deposits from affiliates, partially offset by lower commercial deposits reflecting the impacts of deposit repricing in the current rate environment and seasonality as clients managed their cash needs at year-end. Also contributing to the increase, to a lesser extent, were higher retail time deposits. 

Short-Term Borrowings &#160; Short-term borrowings were lower compared with December 31, 2023 due primarily to a decrease in federal funds purchased resulting from the management of our short-term funding positions. We continue to actively manage our balance sheet to maximize returns while maintaining adequate liquidity. 

Long-Term Debt Long-term debt increased compared with December 31, 2023 due to debt issuances, partially offset by debt retirements. Debt issuances during the three months ended March 31, 2024 totaled $2,335 million, of which nil was issued by HSBC Bank USA. 

Incremental issuances from our shelf registration statement with the SEC totaled $2,335 million of senior debt during the three months ended March 31, 2024, which included $1,500 million of senior notes that were issued by HSBC USA in March as well as $835 million of structured notes. Total long-term debt outstanding under this shelf was $10,065 million and $9,227 million at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Incremental issuances from the HSBC Bank USA Global Bank Note Program totaled nil during the three months ended March 31, 2024. Total debt outstanding under this program was $1,904 million and $1,918 million at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") totaled $1,000 million at both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Interest, Taxes and Other Liabilities Interest, taxes and other liabilities increased compared with December 31, 2023 due primarily to increases in liabilities associated with client share repurchase transactions and outstanding settlement balances related to security purchases. These increases were partially offset by lower derivative balances associated with hedging activities. 

Results of Operations 

Net Interest Income Net interest income is the total interest income on earning assets less the total interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds. An analysis of consolidated average balances and interest rates is presented in this MD&#38;A under the caption "Consolidated Average Balances and Interest Rates." 

The significant components of net interest margin are summarized in the following table: 

&#160; 2024 Compared with 2023 Increase (Decrease) &#160; Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 Volume Rate 2023 &#160; (dollars are in millions) Interest income: Short-term investments $ 448 &#160; $ (84) $ 122 $ 410 Trading securities 85 &#160; 26 10 49 Securities 445 &#160; 54 68 323 Commercial loans 711 &#160; (33) 87 657 Consumer loans 188 &#160; 14 28 146 Other 16 &#160; (5) 2 19 Total interest income 1,893 &#160; (28) 317 1,604 Interest expense: Deposits 1,012 &#160; 44 212 756 Short-term borrowings 154 &#160; 21 33 100 Long-term debt 285 &#160; 4 25 256 Tax liabilities and other 16 &#160; 5 2 9 Total interest expense 1,467 &#160; 74 272 1,121 Net interest income $ 426 &#160; $ (102) $ 45 $ 483 Yield on total interest earning assets

4.75 &#160; 3.87 Interest rate spread 

.13 &#160; .36 Benefit from net non-interest paying funds (1) 

.97 &#160; .92 Net interest margin on average earning assets 

1.10 &#160; % 1.28 % 

(1) Represents the benefit associated with interest earning assets in excess of interest bearing liabilities. Increased percentages reflect growth in this excess or a higher cost of interest bearing liabilities, while decreased percentages reflect a reduction in this excess or a lower cost of interest bearing liabilities. 

Net interest income decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due to higher interest expense from interest bearing liabilities driven by higher rates paid and higher average balances, primarily in deposits and short-term borrowings, partially offset by higher interest income from interest earning assets driven by higher yields and higher average balances in securities and trading securities. Also contributing to the decrease was the unfavorable impact of lower average balances in short-term investments and commercial loans. 

Higher yields on interest earning assets and higher rates paid on interest bearing liabilities reflect the impact of higher market rates. 

Short-term investments Interest income increased during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due to higher yields, partially offset by lower average balances. 

Trading securities Interest income increased during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due to higher average balances and higher yields. Higher average balances were driven by increases in equity, U.S. Treasury and U.S. Government sponsored 

HSBC USA Inc. 

mortgage-backed positions, partially offset by a decline in foreign sovereign positions. Interest income associated with trading securities was partially offset within trading revenue by the performance of the associated derivatives as discussed further below. 

Securities Interest income was higher during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due to higher yields and higher average balances. Higher average balances were driven by increases in U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed, foreign sovereign and U.S. Treasury securities, partially offset by a decline in U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities. 

Commercial loans Interest income increased during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due to higher yields on variable rate loans and newly originated loans, partially offset by lower average balances. 

Consumer loans Interest income was higher during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due to higher yields on variable rate loans and newly originated loans as well as higher average balances driven by growth in residential mortgages. 

Other Lower interest income during the three months ended March 31, 2024 was due to lower average balances in cash collateral posted. 

Deposits Interest expense increased during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due primarily to higher rates paid and a shift in mix to higher cost time deposits. Also contributing to the increase, to a lesser extent, were higher average balances driven by growth in commercial demand deposits and higher time deposits, partially offset by the attrition of retail savings and demand deposits. 

Short-term borrowings Higher interest expense during the three months ended March 31, 2024 was due to higher rates paid and higher average balances. Higher average balances were driven by increases in federal funds purchased and commercial paper outstanding. 

Long-term debt Interest expense increased during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due primarily to higher rates paid on variable rate borrowings and newly issued debt. 

Tax liabilities and other Interest expense increased during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due primarily to higher average balances in securities sold, not yet repurchased. 

Provision for Credit Losses The following table summarizes the components of the provision for credit losses: 

Increase (Decrease) Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 2023 Amount % &#160; (dollars are in millions) Loans: Commercial loans: Real estate, including construction $ (10) $ (28) $ 18 64.3 % Business and corporate banking 7 &#160; 38 (31) (81.6) Global banking (8) 12 (20) * Other commercial &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Total commercial loans (11) 22 (33) * Consumer loans: Residential mortgages 1 &#160; (10) 11 * Home equity mortgages 1 &#160; 1 &#8212; &#8212; Credit cards &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Other consumer (1) (1) &#8212; &#8212; Total consumer loans 1 &#160; (10) 11 * Total loans (10) 12 (22) * Off-balance sheet credit exposures 12 &#160; 8 4 50.0 Total provision for credit losses $ 2 &#160; $ 20 $ (18) (90.0) % 

* Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. 

Our provision for credit losses decreased $18 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due to a lower provision for credit losses on our commercial loan portfolio, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses on our consumer loan portfolio and a higher provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

The provision for credit losses on our commercial loan portfolio decreased $33 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 reflecting a release in credit loss reserves compared with a loss provision in the prior year period. The release in credit reserves in the current year period was driven by improved economic forecasts and improvements in the credit condition of certain clients, partially offset by downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and higher provisions associated with growth in innovation banking. In the prior year period, the loss provision was driven by increases in credit reserves for risk factors associated with higher risk industry exposures and large loan exposures as well as downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients. 

The provision for credit losses on our consumer loan portfolio increased $11 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due to a release in credit loss reserves in the prior year period driven by improved housing price forecasts, partially offset by an increase in credit reserves for risk factors associated with a change in New York State foreclosure law. 

The provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures increased $4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024. The loss provision in the current year period resulted from downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and higher provisions associated with growth in innovation banking, while the loss provision in the prior year period resulted from an increase in credit reserves for risk factors associated with large loan exposures and downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients. 

See "Credit Quality" in this MD&#38;A for additional discussion on the allowance for credit losses associated with our various loan portfolios. 

Other Revenues The following table summarizes the components of other revenues: 

Increase (Decrease) Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 2023 Amount % &#160; (dollars are in millions) Credit card fees, net $ 15 &#160; $ 11 $ 4 36.4 % Trust and investment management fees 36 &#160; 31 5 16.1 Other fees and commissions 176 &#160; 148 28 18.9 Trading revenue 276 &#160; 225 51 22.7 Other securities gains, net 2 &#160; 3 (1) (33.3) Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates 88 &#160; 74 14 18.9 Gain (loss) on instruments designated at fair value and related derivatives (20) (22) 2 9.1 Other income (loss): Valuation of loans held for sale 2 &#160; &#8212; 2 * Residential mortgage banking revenue 1 &#160; 1 &#8212; &#8212; Insurance 1 &#160; 1 &#8212; &#8212; Miscellaneous income (loss) (38) (19) (19) (100.0) Total other income (loss) (34) (17) (17) (100.0) Total other revenues $ 539 &#160; $ 453 $ 86 19.0 % 

* Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. 

Credit card fees, net Credit card fees, net were higher during the three months ended March 31, 2024 reflecting increases in interchange fees, late fees and other miscellaneous fees. 

Trust and investment management fees Trust and investment management fees increased during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due primarily to higher fees from liquidity funds driven by higher average assets under management and lower fee waivers reflecting the impact of higher market interest rates. 

Other fees and commissions Other fees and commissions increased during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due primarily to higher fees from loan syndication and account services reflecting higher business activity compared with the prior year period. See Note 11, "Fee Income from Contracts with Customers," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information including a summary of the components of other fees and commissions.

Trading revenue Trading revenue is generated by participation in the foreign exchange, precious metals, rates, credit and equities markets. The following table presents trading revenue by business activity. Not included in the table below is the impact of net interest income associated with trading securities which is an integral part of trading activities' overall performance. Net interest income related to trading activities is recorded in net interest income in the consolidated statement of income. Certain derivatives, such as total return swaps, are economically hedged by holding the underlying interest bearing referenced assets. Trading revenue related to the mortgage banking business is included as a component of other income (loss). 

Increase (Decrease) Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 2023 Amount % &#160; (dollars are in millions) Business Activities: Foreign Exchange $ 84 &#160; $ 102 $ (18) (17.6) % Metals 14 &#160; 57 (43) (75.4) Debt Markets 5 &#160; 1 4 * Securities Financing 145 &#160; 71 74 * Markets Treasury 7 &#160; (2) 9 * Other trading (1) 

21 &#160; (4) 25 * Total trading revenue $ 276 &#160; $ 225 $ 51 22.7 % 

* Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. 

(1) Includes trading revenue related to Global Banking and Equities. 

Trading revenue increased during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due primarily to higher revenue in Securities Financing driven by the impact of higher market rates which impacts fair value. Also contributing to the increase was higher Other trading revenue due primarily to favorable fair value adjustments on certain investments held for Community Reinvestment Act purposes as well as higher Markets Treasury revenue due to the improved performance of economic hedge positions used to manage interest rate risk. These increases were partially offset by lower revenue in Metals reflecting the impact of our agreement to refer transactions related to all future precious metals trading and financing activities associated with our Global Banking clients to HSBC Bank plc beginning in September 2023 as well as lower revenue in Foreign Exchange driven by lower market volatility compared with the prior year period. 

Other securities gains, net We maintain securities portfolios as part of our balance sheet diversification and risk management strategies. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, we sold $1,075 million and $681 million, respectively, of primarily U.S. Treasury securities as part of our continuing strategy to maximize returns while balancing the securities portfolio for risk management purposes. Other securities gains, net was relatively flat during the three months ended March 31, 2024. The gross realized gains and losses from sales of securities, which are included as a component of other securities gains, net above, are summarized in Note 3, "Securities," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates increased during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due primarily to higher cost reimbursements associated with shared services performed on behalf of other HSBC affiliates, higher loan servicing fees from HSBC Markets (USA) Inc. ("HMUS") and higher performance fees associated with trading activity booked on the balance sheet of HSBC Bank plc. 

Gain (loss) on instruments designated at fair value and related derivatives We have elected to apply fair value option accounting to certain commercial loans held for sale, certain student loans held for investment, certain of our own fixed-rate debt issuances, all of our hybrid instruments issued, including structured notes and deposits, and certain client share repurchase transactions. We also use derivatives to economically hedge the interest rate and other risks associated with certain financial assets and liabilities for which fair value option accounting has been elected. Gain (loss) on instruments designated at fair value and related derivatives was relatively flat during the three months ended March 31, 2024 as favorable fair value adjustments on commercial loans held for sale driven by a loss recorded in the prior year period and favorable movements related to the economic hedging of interest rate risk and other risks within our hybrid instruments was largely offset by unfavorable movements related to the economic hedging of interest rate risk within our own debt. See Note 9, "Fair Value Option," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information including a breakout of these amounts by individual component. 

Other income (loss) &#160; Other income (loss) decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due primarily to higher valuation losses associated with credit default swap protection which largely reflects the hedging of a few client relationships and lower gains associated with bank owned life insurance.

Operating Expenses The following table summarizes the components of operating expenses: 

Increase (Decrease) Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 2023 Amount % &#160; (dollars are in millions) Salaries and employee benefits $ 135 &#160; $ 121 $ 14 11.6 % Support services from HSBC affiliates: Fees paid to HSBC Technology &#38; Services (USA) Inc. ("HTSU") 235 &#160; 220 15 6.8 Fees paid to HMUS 56 &#160; 53 3 5.7 Fees paid to other HSBC affiliates 108 &#160; 111 (3) (2.7) Total support services from HSBC affiliates 399 &#160; 384 15 3.9 Occupancy expense, net 18 &#160; 30 (12) (40.0) Other expenses: Equipment and software 27 &#160; 27 &#8212; &#8212; Marketing 6 &#160; 3 3 100.0 Outside services 12 &#160; 12 &#8212; &#8212; Professional fees 13 &#160; 12 1 8.3 FDIC assessment fees (1)

* Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. 

(1) Includes $36 million of additional special assessment fees which were accrued in the first quarter of 2024 associated with a final rule issued by the FDIC in November 2023 as discussed further below. 

Salaries and employee benefits Salaries and employee benefits expense increased during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due primarily to higher salaries and incentive compensation expenses driven by the addition of personnel associated with growth initiatives in innovation banking. Incentive compensation expense was also higher due to improved business performance. 

Support services from HSBC affiliates Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates increased during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due primarily to higher cost allocations from our technology, operations and other support service functions. A summary of the services received from various HSBC affiliates is included in Note 12, "Related Party Transactions," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Occupancy expense, net Occupancy expense, net decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due primarily to lower lease impairment and other related costs related to the exit of certain office space, partially offset by higher rent expense. 

Other expenses Other expenses increased during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due primarily to higher deposit insurance assessment fees driven by $36 million of additional special assessment fees which were accrued in the first quarter of 2024 associated with a final rule issued by the FDIC in November 2023. During the first quarter of 2024, we became aware that the estimated loss to the DIF has increased and, as a result, we accrued additional fees to reflect our best estimate of the updated special assessment amount. Also contributing to the increase was higher marketing expense. 

Efficiency ratio Our efficiency ratio increased during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due to lower net interest income as discussed in detail above and higher operating expenses driven by higher deposit insurance assessment fees, partially offset by higher other revenues driven by higher trading revenue. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Income tax expense The following table summarizes our effective tax rate based on the provision for income taxes attributable to pretax income: 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 2023 &#160; (dollars are in millions) Income before income tax $ 278 &#160; $ 287 Income tax expense 53 &#160; 70 Effective tax rate 19.1 &#160; % 24.4 % 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, income tax expense and the effective tax rate decreased due primarily to an immaterial out of period adjustment to our deferred tax asset balance which decreased tax expense by $12 million. 

Management evaluated the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and it was determined that a valuation allowance was not required. 

Segment Results &#8211; Group Reporting Basis 

We have distinct businesses, which are aligned with HSBC's global business strategy: Wealth and Personal Banking ("WPB"), Commercial Banking ("CMB"), and Global Banking and Markets ("GBM"). These businesses and a Corporate Center ("CC") serve as our reportable segments with the exception of GBM. Our GBM business is comprised of three distinct operating segments: Global Banking ("GB"), Markets and Securities Services ("MSS"), and Global Banking and Markets Other ("GBM Other"), which are separately reported. See Item 1, "Business," in our 2023 Form 10-K for a description of our segments, including a discussion of the main business activities of the segments and a summary of their products and services. There have been no changes in the basis of our segmentation as compared with the presentation in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Net interest income of each segment represents the difference between actual interest earned on assets and interest incurred on liabilities of the segment, adjusted for a funding charge or credit that includes both interest rate and liquidity components. Segments are charged a cost to fund assets (e.g., customer loans) and receive a funding credit for funds provided (e.g., customer deposits) based on equivalent market rates that incorporate both repricing (interest rate risk) and tenor (liquidity) characteristics. The objective of these charges/credits is to transfer interest rate risk to one centralized unit in Markets Treasury. Markets Treasury income statement and balance sheet results are allocated to each of the global businesses based upon tangible equity levels and levels of any surplus liabilities. 

Certain other revenue and operating expense amounts are also apportioned among the business segments based upon the benefits derived from this activity or the relationship of this activity to other segment activity. These inter-segment transactions have not been eliminated, and we generally account for them as if they were with third parties. 

We report financial information to our parent, HSBC, in accordance with HSBC Group accounting and reporting policies, which apply IFRSs as issued by the IASB. As a result, our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the Group Reporting Basis as operating results are monitored and reviewed, trends are evaluated and decisions about allocating resources, such as employees, are primarily made on this basis. We continue, however, to monitor capital adequacy and report to regulatory agencies on a U.S. GAAP basis. 

During the second quarter of 2023, we implemented a change to our internal management reporting to report net funding charges associated with MSS trading activities within other operating income to better align with the trading revenue generated by such activities. Historically, these funding charges were reported within net interest income (expense). There was no impact to consolidated net interest income (expense) or other operating income as these net funding charges are reversed back into net interest income (expense) in the CC. As a result, we have aligned our segment reporting for MSS and CC to reflect this change for all periods presented. See Note 13, "Business Segments," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a table that summarizes the impact of this change on reported segment net interest income (expense) and other operating income for the three months ended March 31, 2023. 

There have been no changes in the measurement of segment profit as compared with the presentation in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

The significant differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis as they impact our results are summarized in Note 25, "Business Segments," in our 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no significant changes since December 31, 2023 in the differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis impacting our results.

(2) Includes cost reimbursements associated with activities performed on behalf of other HSBC affiliates and allocated Markets Treasury revenue. 

Our WPB segment reported a lower profit before tax during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due to lower net interest income and higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher other operating income and lower expected credit losses. 

Net interest income decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due primarily to the unfavorable impact of lower deposit balances driven by the attrition of savings and demand deposits, partially offset by the favorable impact of higher market rates and higher loan balances driven by growth in residential mortgages. 

Other operating income increased during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due primarily to higher investment management fees driven by higher average assets under management and lower liquidity fee waivers reflecting the impact of higher market interest rates as well as the improved performance of economic hedge positions used to manage interest rate risk. 

Expected credit losses decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due to a loss provision in the prior year period driven by a higher loss estimate for risk factors associated with a change in New York State foreclosure law. 

Operating expenses increased during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due primarily to higher incentive compensation expense and higher marketing expense. 

Client Assets The following table provides information regarding private banking client assets during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023:

(2) Includes allocated Markets Treasury revenue. 

Our CMB segment reported a relatively flat profit before tax during the three months ended March 31, 2024 as lower expected credit losses, higher net interest income and higher other operating income were largely offset by higher operating expenses. 

Net interest income increased during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due to higher allocated Markets Treasury net interest income, partially offset by lower loan and deposit balances. 

Other operating income increased during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due primarily to higher fees from account services and commitments. 

Expected credit losses improved during the three months ended March 31, 2024 reflecting a modest release in credit loss reserves compared with a loss provision in the prior year period. The modest release in credit reserves in the current year period was driven by improvements in the credit condition of certain clients, largely offset by downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and a higher loss estimate for risk factors associated with higher risk industry exposures. In the prior year period, the loss provision was driven by a higher loss estimate for risk factors associated with higher risk industry exposures as well as downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients. 

Operating expenses increased during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due primarily to higher salaries and incentive compensation expenses driven by the addition of personnel associated with growth initiatives in innovation banking as well as higher cost allocations from our technology and support service functions.

(2) Includes net interest income on capital held in the business and not assigned to products as well as revenue associated with credit default swap protection, certain credit-linked structured notes and loan sales. 

Our GB segment reported a higher profit before tax during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due to higher other operating income, lower expected credit losses and lower operating expenses, partially offset by lower net interest income. 

Revenue increased during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due primarily to higher revenue in Investment Banking driven by higher fees from loan syndication, partially offset by lower net interest income from decreased loan spreads and balances. 

Expected credit losses improved during the three months ended March 31, 2024 reflecting a release in credit loss reserves compared with a loss provision in the prior year period. The release in credit reserves in the current year period was due primarily to improvement in the credit condition of a single client relationship. In the prior year period, the loss provision was driven by downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients as well as a higher loss estimate for risk factors associated with higher risk industry exposures. 

Operating expenses decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due primarily to lower cost allocations from our support service functions.

Our MSS segment reported a lower profit before tax during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due to lower other operating income, higher operating expenses and lower net interest income. 

Revenue decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due primarily to lower revenue in Foreign Exchange and Metals driven by lower market volatility in Foreign Exchange compared with the prior year period as well as the impact of our agreement to refer transactions related to all future precious metals trading and financing activities associated with our Global Banking clients to HSBC Bank plc beginning in September 2023. This decrease was partially offset by higher revenue in Equities driven by higher performance fees associated with trading activity booked on the balance sheet of HSBC Bank plc as well as higher revenue in Securities Financing due to higher market rates and increased balance sheet deployment. 

Operating expenses increased during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due primarily to higher cost allocations from our technology and support service functions.

Our GBM Other segment reported a higher profit before tax during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due to higher revenue driven by higher allocated Markets Treasury net interest income, partially offset by higher operating expenses driven by higher cost allocations from support service functions. 

Corporate Center The following table summarizes the Group Reporting Basis results for our CC segment:

* Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. 

Our CC segment reported a higher loss before tax during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due to higher net interest expense and higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher other operating income. 

Net interest expense increased during the three months ended March 31, 2024 driven by a higher cost of funds reflecting the impact of higher market rates. 

Other operating income increased during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due primarily to higher net funding credits associated with MSS trading activities which increased by $67 million. Also contributing to the increase were favorable fair value adjustments on certain investments held for Community Reinvestment Act purposes. 

Operating expenses increased during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due primarily to $36 million of additional deposit insurance special assessment fees which were accrued in the first quarter of 2024 associated with a final rule issued by the FDIC in November 2023. During the first quarter of 2024, we became aware that the estimated loss to the DIF has increased and, as a result, we accrued additional fees to reflect our best estimate of the updated special assessment amount. 

Reconciliation of Segment Results As previously discussed, segment results are reported on a Group Reporting Basis. See Note 13, "Business Segments," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of our Group Reporting Basis segment results to U.S. GAAP consolidated totals.

Credit Quality 

In the normal course of business, we enter into a variety of transactions that involve both on and off-balance sheet credit risk. Principal among these activities is lending to various commercial, institutional, governmental and individual customers. We participate in lending activity throughout the United States and, on a limited basis, internationally. 

Allowance for Credit Losses / Liability for Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures &#160; Our accounting policies and methodologies related to the allowance for credit losses and liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures are presented under the caption "Critical Accounting Estimates" in MD&#38;A and in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements," in our 2023 Form 10-K. Our approach toward credit risk management is summarized under the caption "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no significant revisions to our policies or methodologies during the first quarter of 2024. 

The following table summarizes our allowance for credit losses and the liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures: 

March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 &#160; (in millions) Allowance for credit losses: Loans: Commercial loans $ 563 &#160; $ 574 Consumer loans 18 &#160; 17 Total loans 581 &#160; 591 Securities held-to-maturity &#8212; &#160; &#8212;

(1) Primarily includes accrued interest receivables and customer acceptances. 

The total allowance for credit losses at March 31, 2024 decreased $10 million or 2 percent as compared with December 31, 2023 due to a lower loss estimate on our commercial loan portfolio, while our consumer allowance for credit losses was relatively flat. 

Our commercial allowance for credit losses at March 31, 2024 decreased $11 million or 2 percent as compared with December 31, 2023 driven by improved economic forecasts and improvements in the credit condition of certain clients, partially offset by downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and higher loss estimates associated with growth in innovation banking. 

The liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures at March 31, 2024 increased $12 million or 11 percent as compared with December 31, 2023 resulting from downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and higher loss estimates associated with growth in innovation banking.

See Note 5, "Allowance for Credit Losses," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a rollforward of credit losses by loan categories for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. 

The allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment at March 31, 2024 decreased modestly as compared with December 31, 2023 due primarily to the decrease in our commercial allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

The allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of nonperforming loans held for investment at March 31, 2024 decreased as compared with December 31, 2023 due primarily to an increase in nonperforming loans as discussed further below in our commercial loan portfolio. 

Delinquency The following table summarizes dollars of two-months-and-over contractual delinquency and two-months-and-over contractual delinquency as a percentage of total loans, excluding loans held for sale ("delinquency ratio").

Our two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio decreased 33 basis points compared with December 31, 2023 due to lower dollars of delinquency in our commercial loan portfolio, while dollars of delinquency in our consumer loan portfolio were relatively flat. 

Our commercial loan two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio decreased 48 basis points compared with December 31, 2023 due to lower dollars of delinquency driven by the collections of a few large private banking loans.

Our net charge-off ratio decreased 5 basis points during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due to a lower level of net charge-offs in our commercial loan portfolio driven by the deterioration of a corporate banking loan in the prior year period as well as a lower level of net charge-offs in our consumer loan portfolio driven by improved net charge-offs in residential mortgages reflecting a modest level of net recoveries in the current year period compared with a modest level of net charge-offs in the prior year period.

At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, total nonperforming loans include $4 million and $6 million, respectively, of accruing loans contractually 90 days or more past due. 

(2) At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, nonperforming consumer mortgage loans include $103 million and $108 million, respectively, of loans that are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell. 

(3) Nonperforming consumer mortgage loans held for investment include all loans which are 90 or more days contractually delinquent as well as loans discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not re-affirmed and second lien loans where the first lien loan that we own or service is 90 or more days contractually delinquent. 

(4) Nonperforming consumer mortgage loans for all periods does not include guaranteed loans purchased from the Government National Mortgage Association. Repayment of these loans is predominantly insured by the Federal Housing Administration and as such, these loans have different risk characteristics from the rest of our customer loan portfolio. 

(5) Includes $1 million or less of commercial other real estate owned at both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Our nonperforming loans ratio increased 34 basis points compared with December 31, 2023 due to higher nonperforming loans in our commercial loan portfolio, partially offset by lower nonperforming loans in our consumer loan portfolio. 

Our commercial nonperforming loans ratio increased 54 basis points compared with December 31, 2023 due to higher nonperforming loans driven by downgrades, including the downgrade of a global banking loan. 

Our consumer nonperforming loans ratio decreased 5 basis points compared with December 31, 2023 due primarily to lower nonperforming loans in residential mortgages driven by the collections of a few large private banking loans. Also contributing to the decrease in the ratio, to a lesser extent, were higher outstanding loan balances. 

Our policies and practices for problem loan management and placing loans on nonaccrual status are summarized in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements," in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Concentration of Credit Risk A concentration of credit risk is defined as a significant credit exposure with an individual or group engaged in similar activities or affected similarly by economic conditions. We enter into a variety of transactions in the normal course of business that involve both on and off-balance sheet credit risk. Principal among these activities is lending to various commercial, institutional, governmental and individual customers. We manage the varying degrees of credit risk associated with on and off-balance sheet transactions through specific credit policies and procedures which provide for a strict approval, monitoring and reporting process. It is our policy to require collateral when it is deemed appropriate. Varying degrees and types of collateral are secured depending upon management's credit evaluation. 

Commercial Credit Exposure Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Commercial loans outstanding, excluding loans held for sale, and unused commercial commitments by industry are presented in the table below:

Residential Mortgage Loans Our consumer loan portfolio includes the following types of loans: 

&#8226; Interest-only loans &#8211; A loan which allows a customer to pay the interest-only portion of the monthly payment for a period of time which results in lower payments during the initial loan period. 

&#8226; ARM loans &#8211; A loan which allows us to adjust pricing on the loan in line with market movements. 

The following table summarizes the balances of interest-only and ARM loans in our loan portfolios, excluding mortgages held for sale, at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Each category is not mutually exclusive and loans may appear in more than one category below.

Credit Risks Associated with Derivative Contracts Credit risk associated with derivatives is measured as the net replacement cost of derivative contracts in a receivable position in the event the counterparties of such contracts fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. In managing derivative credit risk, both the current exposure, which is the replacement cost of contracts on the measurement date, as well as an estimate of the potential change in value of contracts over their remaining lives are considered. Counterparties to our derivative activities include financial institutions, central clearing parties, foreign and domestic government agencies, corporations, funds (mutual funds, hedge funds, etc.), insurance companies and private clients as well as other HSBC entities. These counterparties are subject to regular credit review by the credit risk management department. To minimize credit risk, we may enter into legally enforceable master netting agreements which reduce risk by permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon occurrence of certain events. In addition, we reduce credit risk by obtaining collateral from counterparties. The determination of the need for and the levels of collateral will differ based on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty and/or regulatory requirements. 

The total risk in a derivative contract is a function of a number of variables, such as: 

&#8226; volatility of interest rates, currencies, equity or corporate reference entity used as the basis for determining contract payments; 

&#8226; current market events or trends; 

&#8226; country risk; 

&#8226; maturity and liquidity of contracts; 

&#8226; creditworthiness of the counterparties in the transaction; 

&#8226; the existence of a master netting agreement among the counterparties; and 

&#8226; existence and value of collateral received from counterparties to secure exposures. 

The table below presents total credit risk exposure calculated using the general risk-based capital rules of the Basel III Standardized Approach which includes the net positive mark-to-market of the derivative contracts plus any adjusted potential future exposure as measured in reference to the notional amount. The regulatory capital rules recognize that bilateral netting agreements reduce credit risk and, therefore, allow for reductions of risk-weighted assets when netting requirements have been met and collateral exists. As a result, risk-weighted amounts for regulatory capital purposes are a portion of the original gross exposures. Furthermore, many contracts contain provisions that allow us to close out the transaction if the counterparty fails to post required collateral. In addition, many contracts give us the right to break the transactions earlier than the final maturity date. As a result, these contracts have potential future exposures that are often much smaller than the future exposures derived from the regulatory capital rules.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Effective liquidity management is defined as ensuring we can meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities/withdrawals and other cash commitments efficiently under both normal operating conditions and under unpredictable circumstances of industry or market stress. To achieve this objective, we have guidelines that require sufficient liquidity to cover potential funding requirements in both the short- and long-term and to avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. Guidelines are set for the consolidated balance sheet of HSBC USA to ensure that it is a source of strength for our regulated, deposit-taking banking subsidiary, as well as to address the more limited sources of liquidity available to it as a holding company. Similar guidelines are set for HSBC Bank USA to ensure that it can meet its liquidity needs in various stress scenarios. Cash flow analysis, including stress testing scenarios, forms the basis for liquidity management and contingency funding plans. See "Risk Management" in this MD&#38;A for further discussion of our approach towards liquidity and funding risk management, including information regarding the key measures employed to define, monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk. 

Interest Bearing Deposits with Banks totaled $30,687 million and $25,015 million at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, of which $30,593 million and $24,830 million, respectively, were held with the Federal Reserve Bank. Balances may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our liquidity position at the time and our strategy for deploying liquidity.

Under our shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, we may issue certain securities including debt securities and preferred stock. We satisfy the eligibility requirements for designation as a "well-known seasoned issuer," which allows us to file a registration statement that does not have a limit on issuance capacity. The ability to issue under the registration statement is limited by the authority granted by the Board of Directors. At March 31, 2024, we were authorized to issue up to $15,000 million, of which $4,935 million was available. HSBC Bank USA has a $40,000 million Global Bank Note Program that provides for the issuance of subordinated and senior notes, of which $11,968 million was available at March 31, 2024. 

As a member of the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, we have secured borrowing facilities which are collateralized by loans and investment securities. At March 31, 2024, long-term debt included $1,000 million of borrowings from the FHLB facility. Based upon the amounts pledged as collateral under these facilities, we have additional borrowing capacity of up to $25,654 million. 

Preferred Equity See Note 19, "Preferred Stock," in our 2023 Form 10-K for information regarding all outstanding HSBC USA preferred share issues. 

Common Equity During the first quarter of 2024, HSBC USA did not receive any cash capital contributions from its parent, HSBC North America, and did not make any capital contributions to its subsidiary, HSBC Bank USA. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Capital Ratios In managing capital, we develop targets for common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, total capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier 1 capital to adjusted quarterly average assets (i.e., the "Tier 1 leverage ratio"). Capital targets are reviewed at least semi-annually to ensure they reflect our business mix and risk profile, as well as real-time conditions and circumstances. The following table summarizes HSBC USA's Basel III capital ratios calculated as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 

March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 Common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 13.1 &#160; % 13.0 % Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 13.4 &#160; 13.3 Total capital to risk-weighted assets 15.7 &#160; 15.7 

Tier 1 leverage ratio (1) 

8.0 &#160; 7.7 

(1) Adjusted quarterly average assets, the Tier 1 leverage ratio denominator, reflects quarterly average assets adjusted for amounts permitted to be deducted from Tier 1 capital. 

We manage capital in accordance with HSBC Group policy. The HSBC North America Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ("ICAAP") works in conjunction with the HSBC Group's ICAAP. The HSBC North America ICAAP applies to HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA and evaluates regulatory capital adequacy and capital adequacy under various stress scenarios. Our approach is to meet our capital needs for these stress scenarios locally through activities which reduce risk. To the extent that local alternatives are insufficient, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC, we would seek support from our ultimate parent. Regulatory capital requirements are based on the amount of capital required to be held, plus applicable capital buffers, as defined by regulations, and the amount of risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure, also calculated based on regulatory definitions. 

We are subject to regulatory capital rules issued by U.S. banking regulators including Basel III (the "Basel III rule"). The Basel III rule establishes minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for banks and bank holding companies ("BHCs"). HSBC North America, HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA each calculate their risk-based capital requirements for credit risk under the Standardized Approach in the Basel III rule. In 2019, the FRB and the other federal banking agencies jointly finalized rules to implement the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act that tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards for large BHC and foreign banking organizations (the "Tailoring Rules"). The Tailoring Rules assign each BHC and IHC with $50 billion or more in total U.S. assets into one of five classifications (Categories I through IV, and 'other firms') based on its size and four risk-based indicators. Under the Tailoring Rules, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA are subject to Category IV standards. For additional discussion of the Basel III rule requirements, including required minimum capital ratios, as well as further discussion of the Tailoring Rules, Category IV standards and other related regulatory developments and their expected impact see Part I, "Regulation and Competition - Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Requirements," in our 2023 Form 10-K. We continue to review the composition of our capital structure. 

Regulatory Developments In July 2023, U.S. banking regulators proposed changes to the regulatory capital rules applicable to U.S. banks, BHCs and IHCs with total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more. These changes are intended to be broadly consistent with revisions to Basel III finalized by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in 2017. The U.S. proposal would end the use of internal models for credit risk, credit valuation adjustments, and operational risk, eliminate the accumulated other comprehensive income opt-out for Category IV banking organizations, create an expanded risk-based credit capital approach in addition to retaining a modified version of the current standardized approach, and make changes to the modeling requirements for market risk. These proposals would not be effective until July 1, 2025 at the earliest. Certain aspects of the proposal would be subject to a three-year phase-in period. We are analyzing the proposed changes, including the timing of implementation, to determine the potential effects on capital requirements. Based on the foregoing, if adopted as proposed, we expect an increase in the capital requirements of HSBC North America, HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA during the phase-in period and thereafter. 

Capital Planning and Stress Testing The FRB requires certain U.S. top-tier BHCs and IHCs, including HSBC North America, to comply with the FRB's capital plan rule and CCAR program, as well as the supervisory stress tests conducted by the FRB. The stress tests are forward looking exercises to assess the impact of hypothetical macroeconomic baseline and severely adverse scenarios provided by the FRB on the financial condition and capital adequacy of a CCAR firm over a nine quarter planning horizon. As a Category IV firm, HSBC North America is subject to supervisory stress testing on a biennial basis, and it may opt-in to such testing in an "off year" in order to recalibrate its stress capital buffer based on its most recent supervisory stress test. The FRB continues to supervise Category IV firms on an ongoing basis, including evaluation of the capital adequacy and capital planning processes during off-cycle years. For further discussion of capital planning and stress testing, including detail regarding the FRB's supervisory assessment as part of the CCAR process, see Part I, "Regulation and Competition - Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Requirements," in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

HSBC North America submitted its 2024 CCAR capital plan in April 2024. The FRB will publicly disclose its supervisory stress test results on or before June 30, 2024. Stress testing results are based solely on hypothetical adverse stress scenarios and should not be viewed or interpreted as forecasts of expected outcomes or capital adequacy or of the actual financial condition of HSBC North America. Capital planning and stress testing for HSBC North America may impact our future capital and liquidity. 

While BHC regulatory capital compliance is generally performed at the HSBC North America level, and also separately for HSBC Bank USA, as a BHC we are required to meet minimum capital requirements imposed by the FRB. We present our capital ratios, together with HSBC Bank USA's in Note 14, "Retained Earnings and Regulatory Capital Requirements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

2024 Funding Strategy Our current estimate for funding needs and sources for 2024 are summarized in the following table: 

Actual January 1 through 

March 31, 2024 

Estimated April 1 through 

December 31, 2024 

Estimated Full Year 2024 

&#160; (in billions) Increase (decrease) in funding needs: Net change in loans $ 1 $ 4 $ 5 Net change in short-term investments and securities &#8212; (6) (6) Net change in trading and other assets (2) 6 4 Total funding needs $ (1) $ 4 $ 3 Increase (decrease) in funding sources: Net change in deposits $ 1 $ (1) $ &#8212; Net change in trading and other short-term liabilities (3) 6 3 Net change in long-term debt 1 (1) &#8212; Total funding sources $ (1) $ 4 $ 3 

The above table reflects a long-term funding strategy. Daily balances fluctuate as we accommodate customer needs, while ensuring that we have liquidity in place to support the balance sheet maturity funding profile. Should market conditions deteriorate, we have contingency plans to generate additional liquidity through the sales of assets or financing transactions. We remain confident in our ability to access the market for long-term debt funding needs in the current market environment. We continue to seek well-priced and stable customer deposits. We also continue to sell new agency-eligible conforming residential mortgage loans to third parties. 

HSBC Bank USA is subject to significant restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to, and certain other 'covered transactions' with HSBC USA and other affiliates. For further discussion, see Part I, "Regulation and Competition - Affiliate Transaction Restrictions," in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

See "Risk Management" in this MD&#38;A for further discussion relating to our liquidity contingency plans and our approach to liquidity and funding risk management. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our normal operations, we enter into credit derivatives and various off-balance sheet arrangements with affiliates and third parties. These arrangements arise principally in connection with our lending and client intermediation activities and involve primarily commitments to extend credit and, in certain cases, guarantees. 

Commitments to extend credit include arrangements whereby we are contractually obligated to extend credit in the form of loans, participations in loans or similar transactions. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had commitments to extend credit totaling $91.1 billion and $87.4 billion, respectively, comprised primarily of commercial commitments and, to a lesser extent, consumer commitments. Commercial commitments comprise primarily those related to secured and unsecured loans and lines of credit. Consumer commitments comprise unused MasterCard/Visa credit card lines, where we have the right to change terms or conditions upon notification to the customer, and commitments to extend credit secured by residential properties, where we have the right to change terms or conditions, for cause, upon notification to the customer. For a summary of guarantees, including standby letters of credit and certain credit derivative transactions, as well as the contractual amounts outstanding at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, see Note 16, "Guarantee Arrangements, Pledged Asset and Repurchase Agreements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent our maximum possible credit exposure in the event that a counterparty draws down the full commitment amount or we are required to fulfill our maximum obligation under a guarantee. Many of these commitments and guarantees expire unused or without default. As a result, we believe that the contractual amount is not representative of the actual future credit exposure or funding requirements. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

In addition, we had commitments to purchase securities under agreements to resell on a forward starting basis totaling $0.7 billion and $4.8 billion at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These contracts typically expire in less than one month and are secured by collateral primarily from U.S. Treasury securities. 

Our off-balance sheet arrangements also include transactions with unconsolidated variable interest entities ("VIEs"). See Note 15, "Variable Interest Entities," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of these unconsolidated VIEs. 

Fair Value 

Fair Value Hierarchy Fair value measurement accounting principles establish a fair value hierarchy structure that prioritizes the inputs to determine the fair value of an asset or liability (the "Fair Value Framework"). The Fair Value Framework distinguishes between inputs that are based on observed market data and unobservable inputs that reflect market participants' assumptions. It emphasizes the use of valuation methodologies that maximize observable market inputs. For financial instruments carried at fair value, the best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an actively traded market (Level 1). Where the market for a financial instrument is not active, valuation techniques are used. The majority of our valuation techniques use market inputs that are either observable or indirectly derived from and corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the financial instrument (Level 2). Because Level 1 and Level 2 instruments are determined by observable inputs, less judgment is applied in determining their fair values. In the absence of observable market inputs, the financial instrument is valued based on valuation techniques that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The determination of the level of fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement of an asset or a liability is classified often requires judgment and may change over time as market conditions evolve. We consider the following factors in developing the fair value hierarchy: 

&#8226; whether the asset or liability is transacted in an active market with a quoted market price; 

&#8226; the level of bid-ask spreads; 

&#8226; a lack of pricing transparency due to, among other things, complexity of the product and market liquidity; 

&#8226; whether only a few transactions are observed over a significant period of time; 

&#8226; whether the pricing quotations differ substantially among independent pricing services; 

&#8226; whether inputs to the valuation techniques can be derived from or corroborated with market data; and 

&#8226; whether significant adjustments are made to the observed pricing information or model output to determine the fair value. 

Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that the reporting entity has the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities. A financial instrument is classified as a Level 1 measurement if it is listed on an exchange or is an instrument actively traded in the over-the-counter ("OTC") market where transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume. We regard financial instruments such as debt securities, equity securities and derivative contracts listed on the primary exchanges of a country to be actively traded. Non-exchange-traded instruments classified as Level 1 assets include securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, to-be-announced securities, non-callable securities issued by U.S. Government sponsored enterprises and certain foreign government-backed debt. 

Level 2 inputs are those that are observable either directly or indirectly but do not qualify as Level 1 inputs. We classify mortgage pass-through securities, agency and certain non-agency mortgage collateralized obligations, non-exchange-traded derivative contracts, asset-backed securities, obligations of U.S. states and political subdivisions, corporate debt securities, certain foreign government-backed debt, preferred securities, securities purchased and sold under resale and repurchase agreements, precious metals, certain loans held for sale, certain student loans held for investment, residential mortgage loans whose carrying amount was reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, real estate owned and certain client share repurchase transactions as Level 2 measurements. Where possible, at least two quotations from independent sources are obtained based on transactions involving comparable assets and liabilities to validate the fair value of these instruments. We have established a process to understand the methodologies and inputs used by the third-party pricing services to ensure that pricing information meets the fair value objective and, where appropriate, this pricing data is back-tested to market trade executions. Where significant differences arise among the independent pricing quotes and the internally determined fair value, we investigate and reconcile the differences. If the investigation results in a significant adjustment to the fair value, the instrument will be classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. In general, we have observed that there is a correlation between the credit standing and the market liquidity of a non-derivative instrument. 

Level 2 derivative instruments are generally valued based on discounted future cash flows or an option pricing model adjusted for counterparty credit risk and market liquidity. The fair value of certain derivative products is determined using valuation techniques based on inputs derived from observable indices traded in the OTC market. Appropriate control processes and 

HSBC USA Inc. 

procedures have been applied to ensure that the derived inputs are applied to value only those instruments that share similar risks to the relevant benchmark indices and therefore demonstrate a similar response to market factors. 

Level 3 inputs are unobservable estimates that management expects market participants would use to determine the fair value of the asset or liability. That is, Level 3 inputs incorporate market participants' assumptions about risk and the risk premium required by market participants in order to bear that risk. We develop Level 3 inputs based on the best information available in the circumstances. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value included the following: certain structured deposits and structured notes for which the embedded derivatives have significant unobservable inputs (e.g., volatility or default correlations), certain asset-backed securities, individually assessed commercial loans, mortgage servicing rights, derivatives with certain inputs which are unobservable, certain credit default swaps, certain loans held for sale and swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of Visa Class B Shares for which the fair value is dependent upon the final resolution of the related litigation. See Note 17, "Fair Value Measurements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on Level 3 inputs. 

Level 3 Measurements The following table provides information about Level 3 assets/liabilities in relation to total assets/liabilities measured at fair value at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

(3) Includes $59,113 million of assets measured on a recurring basis and $485 million of assets measured on a non-recurring basis at March 31, 2024. Includes $64,268 million of assets measured on a recurring basis and $480 million of assets measured on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2023. 

Significant Changes in Fair Value for Level 3 Assets and Liabilities See Note 17, "Fair Value Measurements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on additions to and transfers into (out of) Level 3 measurements during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 as well as for further details including the classification hierarchy associated with assets and liabilities measured at fair value. 

Effect of Changes in Significant Unobservable Inputs &#160; The fair value of certain financial instruments is measured using valuation techniques that incorporate pricing assumptions not supported by, derived from or corroborated by observable market data. The resultant fair value measurements are dependent on unobservable input parameters which can be selected from a range of estimates and may be interdependent. Changes in one or more of the significant unobservable input parameters may change the fair value measurements of these financial instruments. For the purpose of preparing the financial statements, the final valuation inputs selected are based on management's best judgment that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing similar assets or liabilities. 

The unobservable input parameters selected are subject to the internal valuation control processes and procedures. When we perform a test of all the significant input parameters to the extreme values within the range at the same time, it could result in an increase of the overall fair value measurement of approximately $20 million or a decrease of the overall fair value measurement of approximately $70 million at March 31, 2024. The effect of changes in significant unobservable input parameters are primarily driven by the uncertainty in determining the fair value of certain credit-linked structured notes and swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of Visa Class B Shares. 

Risk Management 

Overview &#160; The primary role of risk management is to protect our customers, business, colleagues and the communities that we serve, while ensuring we are able to support our strategy and provide sustainable growth. 

We aim to use a comprehensive risk management approach across the organization and across all risk types underpinned by our culture and values. This is outlined in our risk management framework, including the key principles and practices that we employ in managing material risks, both financial and non-financial. This framework fosters continuous monitoring, promotes 

HSBC USA Inc. 

risk awareness, and encourages sound operational and strategic decision-making and escalation processes. It also supports a consistent approach to identifying, assessing, managing, and reporting the risks we accept and incur in our activities, with clear accountabilities. 

Our Board of Directors has the ultimate responsibility for the effective oversight of risk management and approves our risk appetite. It is advised on risk matters by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors, notably risk appetite and its alignment with our strategy, risk governance and internal controls, as well as high-level risk related matters. We use a defined executive risk governance structure to help ensure there is appropriate oversight and accountability embedded throughout our business for the effective management of risk. 

Our material risks The principal risks associated with our operations include the following: 

&#8226; Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract; 

&#8226; Treasury risk is the risk of having insufficient capital, liquidity or funding resources to meet financial obligations and satisfy regulatory requirements, including the risk of an adverse impact on earnings or capital due to changes in market interest rates, together with pension risk; 

&#8226; Market risk is the risk of an adverse financial impact on trading activities arising from changes in market parameters such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, asset prices, volatilities, correlations and credit spreads; 

&#8226; Climate risk relates to the financial and non-financial impacts that may arise as a consequence of climate change and the move to a net zero economy; 

&#8226; Resilience risk is the risk of sustained and significant business disruption from execution, delivery, physical security or safety events, causing the inability to provide critical services to our customers, affiliates and counterparties; 

&#8226; Regulatory compliance risk is the risk associated with breaching our duty to clients and other counterparties, inappropriate market conduct and breaching related financial services regulatory standards; 

&#8226; Financial crime risk is the risk that our products and services will be exploited for criminal activity, including fraud, bribery and corruption, tax evasion, sanctions and export control violations, money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing; 

&#8226; Strategic risk is the risk that the business will fail to identify, execute and react appropriately to opportunities and/or threats arising from changes in the market, some of which may emerge over a number of years such as changing economic and political circumstances, customer requirements, demographic trends, regulatory developments or competitor action; and 

&#8226; Model risk is the risk of inappropriate or incorrect business decisions arising from the use of models that have been inadequately designed, implemented or used, or from models that do not perform in line with expectations and predictions. 

In the course of our regular risk management activities, we use models to help quantify the risk we are taking. We believe that the assumptions used in these models are reasonable within the parameters for which the models have been built and calibrated to operate, but events may unfold differently than what is assumed in the models. Adjustments to model outputs to reflect consideration of management judgment are used with stringent governance in place to ensure appropriate results. Models are also monitored to confirm they are performing as intended. 

See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2023 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of the objectives of our risk management system as well as our risk management policies and practices. Other than the change to treasury risk management discussed below, there have been no material changes to our approach to risk management since December 31, 2023. 

Credit Risk Management Credit risk is managed through a robust risk identification and control framework which outlines clear and consistent policies, principles and guidance for risk managers. Credit risk is monitored using various internal risk management measures and within limits approved by individuals within a framework of delegated authorities. Our credit risk management procedures are designed for all stages of economic and financial cycles, including challenging periods of market volatility and economic uncertainty. During the first quarter of 2024, economic uncertainty remained due to elevated interest rates, inflation levels and the expectation for slowing economic growth. We continue to monitor the performance of our material commercial loans as conditions evolve and take necessary credit actions where warranted. See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2023 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our approach to credit risk. 

Treasury Risk Management We continuously monitor our capital ratios and the impact of market events on our liquidity positions and will continue to adapt our frameworks as necessary to reflect market events and the evolving regulatory landscape and view as to best practices. In the first quarter of 2024, we began managing our non-trading value at risk ("VaR") exposure to a 10-day holding period as compared with the previous approach which was based on a one-day holding period. As a result, we have revised prior year amounts in the non-trading VaR table below in order to conform to the current year presentation. There

have been no other material changes to our approach towards treasury risk management since December 31, 2023. See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2023 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our approach to treasury risk 

Capital risk See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in this MD&#38;A for a discussion of our approach to capital risk management, including our capital ratios and regulatory capital requirements. 

Liquidity and funding risk As part of our approach towards liquidity and funding risk management, we employ the measures discussed below to define, monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk in accordance with HSBC policy. 

HSBC North America is subject to the U.S. liquidity coverage ratio ("LCR") rule, which is designed to be a short-term liquidity measure to ensure banks have sufficient High Quality Liquid Assets ("HQLA") to cover net stressed cash outflows over the next 30 days, and both HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA calculate and report their LCR to U.S. regulators on a daily basis. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, HSBC Bank USA's LCR remained above 100 percent. Under the Tailoring Rules, a 70 percent LCR requirement applies to Category IV firms with weighted short-term wholesale funding that equals or exceeds $50 billion. As a result, a LCR of 100 percent or higher reflects an unencumbered HQLA balance that is equal to or exceeds 70 percent of a Category IV firm's liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario. HQLA consists of cash or assets that can be converted into cash at little or no loss of value in private markets. 

HSBC North America is also subject to the U.S. net stable funding ratio ("NSFR") rule, which is a longer term liquidity measure with a 12-month time horizon to ensure a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities, and both HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA calculate and report their NSFR to U.S. regulators. At both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, HSBC Bank USA's NSFR exceeded 100 percent. Under the Tailoring Rules, a 70 percent NSFR requirement applies to Category IV firms with weighted short-term wholesale funding that equals or exceeds $50 billion. As a result, a NSFR of 100 percent or more reflects an available stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next 12 months that is equal to or exceeds 70 percent of a Category IV firm's required amount of funding for assets and off-balance sheet exposures. In addition, under the United Kingdom ("U.K.") Prudential Regulatory Authority ("PRA") based NSFR rule, HSBC USA's NSFR exceeded 100 percent at both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Under the U.K. PRA NSFR rule, a NSFR of 100 percent or more reflects an available stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next 12 months that is equal to or exceeds the required amount of funding for assets and off-balance sheet exposures. 

As a Category IV firm, HSBC North America is subject to liquidity stress testing and related liquidity buffer and liquidity risk management requirements. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA have liquidity profiles to support compliance with these rules and may need to make changes to their liquidity profiles to support compliance with any future rules. 

Our liquidity and funding risk management approach includes deposits, supplemented by wholesale borrowing to fund our balance sheet, and using security sales or secured borrowings for liquidity stress situations in our liquidity contingency plans. In addition, regulations require banks to retain a portfolio of HQLA. As such, we are maintaining a large portfolio of high quality sovereign and sovereign guaranteed securities. 

Our ability to regularly attract wholesale funds at a competitive cost is enhanced by strong ratings from the major credit rating agencies. The following table reflects the short and long-term credit ratings of HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA at March 31, 2024: 

&#160; &#160; 

Moody's S&#38;P Fitch HSBC USA: Short-term borrowings P-1 A-2 F1+ Long-term/senior debt A2 A- A+ HSBC Bank USA: Short-term borrowings P-1 A-1 F1+ Long-term/senior debt Aa3 A+ AA- 

Rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk management practices and legal matters, all of which could lead to adverse ratings actions. 

Although we closely monitor and strive to manage factors influencing our credit ratings, there is no assurance that our credit ratings will not change in the future. At March 31, 2024, none of the ratings on the debt of HSBC USA or HSBC Bank USA from any of the rating agencies were under review for potential downgrade. 

See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in this MD&#38;A for further discussion of our liquidity position, including additional information regarding our outstanding borrowings, the remaining availability of our debt issuance programs and our funding strategy.

Interest rate risk Various techniques are utilized to quantify and monitor risks associated with the repricing characteristics of our assets, liabilities and derivative contracts. See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2023 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our approach to interest rate risk. 

Economic value of equity ("EVE") EVE represents the present value of the banking book cash flows that could be provided to our equity holder under a managed run-off scenario. An EVE sensitivity represents the change in EVE due to a defined movement in interest rates. We manage to an immediate parallel upward shock of 200 basis points and an immediate parallel downward shock of 200 basis points to the market implied interest rates. At both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our EVE remained within risk limits for the up 200 and down 200 basis point interest rate shock scenarios. 

Earnings-at-risk Earnings-at-risk is a measure of interest rate risk in the banking book generated by our non-trading assets and liabilities that primarily includes loans, deposits with banks, investment securities, deposits, long-term debt and any associated interest rate hedges that are not held for trading intent or in order to hedge positions held with trading intent. Earnings-at-risk utilizes a number of interest rate scenarios to estimate the impact on projected banking book net interest income over a twelve month period, such as rate shock scenarios which assume immediate market rate movements by 100 basis points, as well as scenarios in which rates gradually rise or fall by 100 basis points. In the gradual scenarios, 25 percent of the interest rate movement occurs at the beginning of each quarter. The following table reflects the estimated impact of the earnings-at-risk scenarios on projected banking book net interest income: 

March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 Amount % Amount % &#160; (dollars are in millions) Estimated increase (decrease) in projected banking book net interest income (reflects projected rate movements on April 1, 2024 and January 1, 2024, respectively): 

Resulting from a gradual 100 basis point increase in the yield curve $ (7) &#8212; &#160; % $ (17) (1) % Resulting from a gradual 100 basis point decrease in the yield curve (10) &#8212; &#160; (33) (1) Other significant scenarios monitored (reflects projected rate movements on April 1, 2024 and January 1, 2024, respectively):

The projections do not take into consideration possible complicating factors such as the effect of changes in interest rates on the credit quality, size and composition of the balance sheet. Therefore, although this provides a reasonable estimate of interest rate sensitivity, actual results will differ from these estimates, possibly by significant amounts. 

Non-trading VaR Non-trading VaR predominantly relates to Markets Treasury and represents the potential negative changes in the investment portfolio market value (which includes available-for-sale and held-to-maturity assets) and associated hedges. Our investment portfolio holdings comprise mainly U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed and U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities. Our non-trading VaR exposure is driven by interest rates and agency mortgage-backed security spread volatility. Refer to "Market Risk Management" below for further discussion regarding VaR and the management of market risk in our non-trading portfolios. 

The following table summarizes our non-trading VaR for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and at December 31, 2023:

Non-trading VaR also includes the interest rate risk of non-trading financial assets and liabilities held by the global businesses and transfer priced into Markets Treasury which has the mandate to centrally manage and hedge it. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Market Risk Management Exposure to market risk is separated into two portfolios: 

&#8226; Trading portfolios comprise positions held for client servicing and market-making, with the intention of short-term resale and/or to hedge risks resulting from such positions. 

&#8226; Non-trading portfolios comprise positions that primarily arise from the interest rate management of our retail and commercial banking assets and liabilities as well as financial investments classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity. 

We apply similar risk management policies and measurement techniques to both trading and non-trading portfolios. Our objective is to manage and control market risk exposures to optimize return on risk while maintaining a market profile consistent with our established risk appetite. See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2023 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our approach to market risk. 

Value at risk ("VaR") VaR is a technique for estimating potential losses on risk positions as a result of movements in market rates and prices over a specified time horizon and to a given level of confidence. The use of VaR is integrated into market risk management and calculated for all trading positions regardless of how we capitalize them. In addition, we calculate VaR for non-trading portfolios to have a complete picture of risk. VaR measures are calculated to a 99 percent confidence level and use a one-day holding period for trading VaR and a 10-day holding period for non-trading VaR. 

Trading VaR Trading VaR is generated principally from trading activities within the MSS segment of GBM. These primarily include positions in various products across rates, foreign exchange and credit asset classes. 

The following graph summarizes daily VaR for our trading portfolios at a 99 percent confidence level (in millions):

(1) Portfolio diversification is the market risk dispersion effect of holding a portfolio containing different risk types. It represents the reduction in unsystematic market risk that occurs when combining a number of different risk types, for example, foreign exchange, interest rate and credit spread, together in one portfolio. It is measured as the difference between the sum of the VaR by individual risk type and the combined total VaR. A negative number represents the benefit of portfolio diversification. As the maximum and minimum occur on different days for different risk types, it is not meaningful to calculate a portfolio diversification benefit for these measures. 

(2) The total VaR is non-additive across risk types due to diversification effects. For presentation purposes, portfolio diversification of the VaR for trading portfolios includes VaR-based risk-not-in-VaR. 

Refer to "Treasury Risk Management" above for disclosure of our non-trading VaR. 

Back-testing We routinely validate the accuracy of our VaR models by back-testing them against hypothetical profit and loss that excludes non-modeled items such as fees, commissions and revenues of intra-day transactions from the actual reported profit and loss. We would expect, under stable market conditions, to experience two or three losses in excess of VaR at the 99 

HSBC USA Inc. 

percent confidence level over a one-year period. However, in periods of unstable market conditions, we could see an increase in the number of back-testing exceptions. 

During the first quarter of 2024, we experienced no loss back-testing exception.
