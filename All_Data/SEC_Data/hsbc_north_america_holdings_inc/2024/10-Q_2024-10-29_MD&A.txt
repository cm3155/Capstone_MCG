Forward-Looking Statements 

Certain matters discussed throughout this Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, we may make or approve certain statements in future filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), in press releases, or oral or written presentations by representatives of HSBC USA Inc.

HSBC USA Inc. 

Executive Overview 

HSBC USA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC North America Holdings Inc. ("HSBC North America"), which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC. HUSI may also be referred to in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&#38;A") as "we," "us" or "our." 

Economic Environment &#160; The U.S. economy continued to grow during the first nine months of 2024 despite continued pressures from inflation and elevated interest rates. U.S. Gross Domestic Product ("GDP") is currently forecast to grow at an annual rate in excess of 2.9 percent in the third quarter of 2024, while the personal consumption expenditures price index is currently forecast to further decline in September 2024, showing additional progress towards achieving the FRB's target inflation rate. However, while unemployment rates have remained low during the first nine months of 2024, the total unemployment rate increased to 4.1 percent at September 2024 as compared with 3.7 percent at December 2023. In September 2024, the FRB cut short-term interest rates by 50 basis points and indicated that additional rate decreases in the fourth quarter of 2024 are likely depending upon future economic conditions. 

Although the U.S. economy continued to grow during the third quarter of 2024, economic uncertainty remains due to elevated interest rates and the effects from higher inflation, which will continue to impact our business in future periods. Concerns over domestic and global policy issues, trade policy in the U.S. and geopolitical events, including the turmoil in the Middle East, as well as the implications of those events on the markets in general, further add to the global uncertainty. Interest rate levels, inflation, unemployment levels and economic growth, in combination with global economic conditions, fiscal and monetary policy and the level of regulatory and government scrutiny of financial institutions will continue to impact our results in 2024 and beyond. 

Performance, Developments and Trends As previously disclosed, in November 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") issued a final rule that imposes a special assessment on certain FDIC-insured banks, including HSBC Bank USA, to recover the loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund ("DIF") arising from the protection of uninsured depositors following a determination of systemic risk in connection with the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. This resulted in additional deposit insurance assessment fees of $243 million being accrued in 2023. Because the estimated loss to the DIF will be periodically adjusted as actual losses are incurred, the FDIC retains the ability to cease collection early, extend the special assessment collection period beyond the initial eight-quarter collection period, or impose a final shortfall special assessment after the receiverships for the two banks are terminated. During the first half of 2024, the FDIC informed banks who are required to fund the shortfall in the DIF that the estimated loss has increased and it projects that the special assessment will be collected for an additional two quarters beyond the initial eight-quarter collection period at a rate that reflects estimated changes in the special assessment. During the third quarter of 2024, the FDIC informed banks that the estimated loss had decreased. As a result, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, we released $8 million of deposit insurance special assessment fees to reflect our updated special assessment amount while, in the year-to-date period, we increased our accrual by $34 million. 

During the third quarter of 2024, we sold certain U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities classified as available-for-sale with a total carrying value of $2,130 million and realized a loss of $148 million. These securities were sold to manage our exposure to the changing interest rate environment as part of our continuing strategy to maximize returns while balancing the securities portfolio for risk management purposes. We have reinvested the proceeds into higher yielding U.S. Treasury and U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed securities classified as held-to-maturity.

Net income was $88 million and $482 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with $182 million and $550 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Income before income tax was $115 million and $611 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with $239 million and $725 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in income before income tax during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due primarily to lower other revenues driven by the loss realized in the third quarter of 2024 from the sale of certain available-for-sale securities for risk management purposes as discussed above and lower trading revenue. Also contributing to the decrease, to a lesser extent, were higher operating expenses. These decreases were partially offset by higher net interest income. 

In the year-to-date period, the decrease in income before income tax was due primarily to higher operating expenses, including the additional deposit insurance special assessment fees which were accrued during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as discussed above. Also contributing to the decrease, to a lesser extent, were lower net interest income and lower other revenues. The decrease in other revenues was driven by the loss realized from the sale of certain available-for-sale securities for 

HSBC USA Inc. 

risk management purposes as discussed above which was partially offset by increases in other income, servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates, and other fees and commissions. These decreases were partially offset by a lower provision for credit losses. 

See "Results of Operations" for a more detailed discussion of our operating trends. In addition, see "Balance Sheet Review" for further discussion on our asset and liability trends, "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for further discussion on funding and capital and "Credit Quality" for additional discussion on our credit trends. 

In March 2024, the SEC adopted final rules that will require registrants to disclose climate-related information in registration statements and annual reports, including material climate-related risks, descriptions of board oversight and risk management activities, the material impacts of these risks on a registrant's strategy, business model and outlook, and any material climate-related targets or goals. Non-accelerated filers such as HSBC USA will be exempt from the requirements to disclose Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Registrants will also have to disclose, among other things, certain effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions (e.g., hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding) relating to capitalized costs and charges, expenditures and losses in their audited financial statements. HSBC USA will be required to comply with the rules for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2027, with certain additional disclosure requirements becoming applicable for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2028. Following adoption of the rules, several lawsuits were filed challenging them and subsequently consolidated into the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. The SEC issued an order in April 2024 to stay the rules pending the judicial review by the Eighth Circuit of the consolidated challenges. 

Basis of Reporting 

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"). 

Group Reporting Basis We report financial information to HSBC in accordance with HSBC Group accounting and reporting policies, which apply International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRSs") as issued by the IASB. As a result, our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the basis of HSBC Group's accounting and reporting policies ("Group Reporting Basis"). Because operating results on the Group Reporting Basis are used in managing our businesses and rewarding performance of employees, our management also separately monitors profit before tax under this basis of reporting. The following table reconciles our U.S. GAAP versus Group Reporting Basis profit before tax: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 &#160; (in millions) Profit before tax &#8211; U.S. GAAP basis $ 115 &#160; $ 239 $ 611 &#160; $ 725 Adjustments: Expected credit losses (32) 8 (14) 4 Loans held for sale &#8212; &#160; (6) (5) 28 Other long-lived assets &#8212; &#160; 7 (2) 202 Renewable energy tax credit investments 5 &#160; 4 13 &#160; 13 Gain on transfer of precious metals trading client relationships to an affiliate &#8212; &#160; 10 &#8212; &#160; 10 Other 3 &#160; (5) &#8212; &#160; (3) Profit before tax &#8211; Group Reporting Basis $ 91 &#160; $ 257 $ 603 &#160; $ 979 

The significant differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis as they impact our results are summarized in Note 25, "Business Segments," in our 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no significant changes since December 31, 2023 in the differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis impacting our results. Differences in reported profit before tax in the table above that were individually significant for the periods presented are explained below. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, expected credit losses were lower under U.S. GAAP than under the Group Reporting Basis. Under the Group Reporting Basis, a majority of our loans are considered to be in "stage 1" (which requires a 12-month expected credit losses ("ECL") estimate), while under U.S. GAAP such loans require a lifetime ECL estimate. Primarily as a result of the different requirements, releases in credit reserves for risk factors associated with higher risk industry exposures and for risk associated with large loan exposures were more pronounced under U.S. GAAP which, in the year-to-date period, was partially offset by higher loss provisions under U.S. GAAP associated with growth in innovation banking. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we transferred certain loans to held for sale which under U.S. GAAP requires the loans to be carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value which resulted in lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustments on the loans. Under the Group Reporting Basis, loans held for sale continue to be accounted for and credit losses continue to be measured in accordance with IFRS 9, "Financial Instruments," with any gain or loss recorded at the time of sale. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, other long-lived assets in the table above reflects a reversal of $149 million of impairment charges under the Group Reporting Basis related to capitalized software and leasehold improvements primarily associated with our Wealth and Personal Banking business segment which were previously impaired and written-off. In 2020, we recorded an impairment charge under the Group Reporting Basis related to the write-off of all the capitalized software and a portion of the leasehold improvements, while under U.S. GAAP no impairment charge was required. Subsequent to recognition of the impairment charge in 2020, expenditures for software development and newly completed leasehold improvements in our Wealth and Personal Banking business segment were capitalized and amortized over their useful lives under U.S. GAAP, but not under the Group Reporting Basis. Consequently, the carrying amounts of capitalized software and leasehold improvements were higher under U.S. GAAP than under the Group Reporting Basis and, as a result, corresponding amortization expense was higher under U.S. GAAP. During the second quarter of 2023, we determined that the cash generating unit was no longer impaired under the Group Reporting Basis and that its estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value, which resulted in the re-establishment of these assets at their recoverable amount net of amortization that would have been recorded had no impairment loss been recognized and excluding any assets that had since been sold. In addition, during the first half of 2023, we recorded $22 million of lease related impairment charges under U.S. GAAP primarily associated with the exit of certain office space, while under the Group Reporting Basis, impairment was recognized when we committed to vacate the space in the fourth quarter of 2022. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we transferred certain precious metals trading client relationships to an affiliate which under the Group Reporting Basis required the gain to be recorded in earnings. Under U.S. GAAP, since the transfer was between affiliates under common control, the gain was reflected as a capital transaction and recorded in common equity as a component of additional paid-in capital. See Note 25, "Business Segments," in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional discussion. 

Balance Sheet Review 

The following table provides balance sheet totals at September 30, 2024 and increases (decreases) since December 31, 2023:

Short-Term Investments Short-term investments include cash and due from banks, interest bearing deposits with banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell. Balances may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our liquidity position at the time and our strategy for deploying liquidity. Short-term investments decreased compared with December 31, 2023 due to a decrease in funds driven primarily by higher loans and securities as well as lower short-term borrowings as discussed in detail below. These decreases were partially offset by higher deposits. 

Loans, Net The following table summarizes our loan balances at September 30, 2024, excluding loans held for sale, and increases (decreases) since December 31, 2023:

(3) See "Credit Quality" in this MD&#38;A for a discussion of trends in our allowance for credit losses on loans. 

Commercial loans increased compared with December 31, 2023 driven by higher loans to affiliates, while non-affiliate loans were flat as new business activity was offset by paydowns and maturities as we continued to apply a disciplined lending approach. The trend in commercial non-affiliate loans reflects decreases in the commercial services, technology, semiconductor and banking industries which were offset by increases in the real estate, software, food and beverage, and insurance industries. 

Consumer loans increased compared with December 31, 2023 due to growth in residential mortgages, which we continue to target towards our globally connected affluent and high net worth clients. 

The following table presents loan-to-value ("LTV") ratios for our residential mortgage loan portfolio, excluding mortgage loans held for sale:

(1) LTVs for first liens are calculated using the loan balance as of the reporting date. LTVs for second liens are calculated using the loan balance as of the reporting date plus the senior lien amount at origination. Current estimated property values are derived from the property's appraised value at the time of loan origination updated by the change in the Federal Housing Finance Agency's House Price Index ("HPI") at either a core-based statistical area or state 

HSBC USA Inc. 

level. The estimated value of the homes could differ from actual fair values due to changes in condition of the underlying property, variations in housing price changes within metropolitan statistical areas and other factors. As a result, actual property values associated with loans that end in foreclosure may be significantly lower than the estimates used for purposes of this disclosure. 

(2) Current estimated property values are calculated using the most current HPIs available and applied on an individual loan basis, which results in an approximate three month delay in the production of reportable statistics. Therefore, the information in the table above reflects current estimated property values using HPIs at June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 

Loans Held for Sale The following table summarizes loans held for sale at September 30, 2024 and increases (decreases) since December 31, 2023: 

&#160; &#160; Increase (Decrease) From December 31, 2023

Commercial loans held for sale increased compared with December 31, 2023. Included in commercial loans held for sale are certain loans that we have elected to designate under the fair value option which consists of loans that we originate in connection with our participation in a number of syndicated credit facilities with the intent of selling them to unaffiliated third parties as well as loans that we purchase from the secondary market and hold as hedges against our exposure to certain total return swaps or intend to sell. The fair value of these loans totaled $673 million and $250 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Balances will fluctuate from period to period depending on the volume and level of activity. 

Commercial loans held for sale also includes certain loans that we no longer intend to hold for investment and were transferred to held for sale which totaled $69 million and $89 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Consumer loans held for sale were relatively flat compared with December 31, 2023. Included in residential mortgage loans held for sale are agency-eligible conforming residential mortgage loans which are originated and held for sale to third parties, currently on a servicing retained basis. Balances will fluctuate from period to period depending on the volume and level of activity. Gains and losses from the sale of these residential mortgage loans are reflected as a component of other income (loss) in the accompanying consolidated statement of income. 

Excluding the loans designated under the fair value option discussed above, loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value, with adjustments to fair value being recorded as a valuation allowance through other revenues. The valuation allowance on commercial loans held for sale was nil and $2 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The valuation allowance on consumer loans held for sale was nil at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Trading Assets and Liabilities The following table summarizes trading assets and liabilities at September 30, 2024 and increases (decreases) since December 31, 2023: 

&#160; &#160; Increase (Decrease) From December 31, 2023 

&#160; &#160;

(1) See Note 2, "Trading Assets and Liabilities," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a breakout of trading securities by category. 

Trading securities balances were lower compared with December 31, 2023 due to a decrease in foreign sovereign positions, partially offset by increases in equity and U.S. Treasury positions. Trading security positions are primarily held as economic hedges of interest rate, credit and equity derivative products issued to clients of domestic and emerging markets. Balances of securities sold, not yet purchased were also lower compared with December 31, 2023 reflecting a decrease in short U.S. Treasury positions related to economic hedges of trading security positions held for Community Reinvestment Act purposes. 

Precious metals trading assets decreased compared with December 31, 2023 driven by a decline in our own gold inventory position, partially offset by a higher gold spot price. Payables for precious metals also decreased compared with December 31, 2023 driven by a decline in borrowing of gold inventory to support client activity levels, partially offset by an increase in borrowing of silver inventory to support client activity levels as well as higher gold and silver spot prices. Precious metal positions may not represent our net underlying exposure as we may use derivatives contracts to reduce our risk associated with these positions, the fair value of which would appear in derivatives in the table above. 

Derivative asset and liability balances both decreased compared with December 31, 2023 mainly from market movements which resulted in lower valuations of foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives. 

Securities Securities include securities available-for-sale and securities held-to-maturity, net. Securities balances were higher compared with December 31, 2023 due to net purchases of U.S. Treasury, foreign sovereign and U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed securities, partially offset by sales, paydowns and maturities of U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities as part of our continuing strategy to maximize returns while balancing the securities portfolio for risk management purposes. 

All Other Assets &#160; All other assets include, among other items, properties and equipment, net, and goodwill. All other assets increased compared with December 31, 2023 due primarily to higher outstanding settlement balances related to security sales, partially offset by lower margin requirements related to futures trading and lower outstanding settlement balances related to secondary loan sales. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Deposits The following table summarizes deposit balances by major depositor categories at September 30, 2024 and increases (decreases) since December 31, 2023: 

&#160; &#160; Increase (Decrease) From December 31, 2023 

&#160; &#160; 

September 30, 2024 Amount % &#160; (dollars are in millions) Individuals, partnerships and corporations $ 109,316 &#160; $ (121) (.1) % Domestic and foreign banks 11,352 &#160; 2,001 21.4 U.S. government and states and political subdivisions 125 &#160; (1) (.8) Foreign governments and official institutions 2,580 &#160; 211 8.9 Total deposits $ 123,373 &#160; $ 2,090 1.7 % 

Total deposits increased compared with December 31, 2023 due to higher commercial demand deposits reflecting increased business activity as well as higher deposits from affiliates. These increases were partially offset by lower commercial savings deposits reflecting the impact of deposit repricing in the current rate environment and the attrition of retail savings and demand deposits. 

Short-Term Borrowings &#160; Short-term borrowings were lower compared with December 31, 2023 due to a decrease in federal funds purchased, partially offset by an increase in securities sold under repurchase agreements resulting from the management of our short-term funding positions. We continue to actively manage our balance sheet to maximize returns while maintaining adequate liquidity. 

Long-Term Debt &#160; Long-term debt decreased compared with December 31, 2023 as the impact of debt issuances, including $250 million of senior debt issued to HSBC North America during the third quarter of 2024, was more than offset by debt retirements. Debt issuances during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled $1,801 million and $5,270 million, respectively, of which nil was issued by HSBC Bank USA. 

Incremental issuances from our shelf registration statement with the SEC totaled $5,020 million of senior debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which included $1,500 million of senior notes that were issued by HSBC USA in March as well as $3,520 million of structured notes. Total long-term debt outstanding under this shelf was $8,637 million and $9,227 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Incremental issuances from the HSBC Bank USA Global Bank Note Program totaled nil during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Total debt outstanding under this program was $1,884 million and $1,918 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") totaled $1,000 million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Interest, Taxes and Other Liabilities Interest, taxes and other liabilities was lower compared with December 31, 2023 due primarily to decreases in outstanding settlement balances related to secondary loan purchases, accrued interest payables and derivative balances associated with hedging activities. These decreases were partially offset by higher outstanding settlement balances related to security purchases.

Results of Operations 

Net Interest Income Net interest income is the total interest income on earning assets less the total interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds. An analysis of consolidated average balances and interest rates is presented in this MD&#38;A under the caption "Consolidated Average Balances and Interest Rates." 

The significant components of net interest margin are summarized in the following table:

(1) Represents the benefit associated with interest earning assets in excess of interest bearing liabilities. Increased percentages reflect growth in this excess or a higher cost of interest bearing liabilities, while decreased percentages reflect a reduction in this excess or a lower cost of interest bearing liabilities. 

Net interest income increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to higher interest income from interest earning assets driven by higher yields and higher average balances in securities, loans and trading securities, partially offset by higher interest expense from interest bearing liabilities driven by higher rates paid and higher average deposit balances. Also contributing to the overall increase in net interest income was the favorable impact of lower average long-term debt balances, while the unfavorable impact of lower average short-term investment balances partially offset the increase. 

In the year-to-date period, net interest income decreased modestly as higher interest expense from interest bearing liabilities driven by higher rates paid and higher average balances in deposits and short-term borrowings was largely offset by higher interest income from interest earning assets driven by higher yields and higher average balances in securities, trading securities and consumer loans. Also contributing to the overall decrease in net interest income was the unfavorable impact of lower average balances in short-term investments and commercial loans, while the favorable impact of lower average long-term debt balances partially offset the decrease. 

Higher yields on interest earning assets and higher rates paid on interest bearing liabilities reflect the impact of higher market rates. 

Short-term investments Interest income increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to higher yields, partially offset by lower average balances. 

Trading securities Interest income increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to higher average balances and, to a lesser extent, higher yields. Higher average balances were driven by increases in equity, U.S. Treasury and U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed positions, partially offset by a decline in foreign sovereign positions. Interest income associated with trading securities was partially offset within trading revenue by the performance of the associated derivatives as discussed further below. 

Securities Interest income was higher during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to higher yields as we continue to reinvest in securities at higher market rates as well as higher average balances. Higher average balances were driven 

HSBC USA Inc. 

by increases in U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed, foreign sovereign and U.S. Treasury securities, partially offset by a decline in U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities. 

Commercial loans Interest income increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to higher average balances driven by new business activity and higher loans to affiliates. In the year-to-date period, interest income increased due to higher yields on variable rate loans and newly originated loans, partially offset by lower average balances. 

Consumer loans Interest income was higher during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to higher yields on variable rate loans and newly originated loans as well as higher average balances driven by growth in residential mortgages. 

Other Lower interest income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to lower average balances in cash collateral posted, partially offset by higher yields. 

Deposits Interest expense increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to higher rates paid and higher average balances. Higher average balances were driven by growth in commercial demand deposits, including a shift in mix to interest bearing accounts from noninterest bearing accounts, as well as higher time deposits. Higher average balances were partially offset by lower commercial savings deposits reflecting the impact of deposit repricing in the current rate environment and the attrition of retail savings and demand deposits. 

Short-term borrowings Interest expense was higher during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to higher rates paid and, to a lesser extent, higher average balances. Higher average balances were driven by increases in securities sold under repurchase agreements and commercial paper outstanding, partially offset by a decline in federal funds purchased. 

Long-term debt Interest expense decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and increased in the year-to-date period as the impact of lower average balances was partially offset in the three-month period and more than offset in the year-to-date period by higher rates paid on variable rate borrowings and newly issued debt. 

Tax liabilities and other Higher interest expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to higher average balances in securities sold, not yet repurchased and higher rates paid. 

Provision for Credit Losses The following table summarizes the components of the provision for credit losses:

* Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. 

Our provision for credit losses decreased $5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due primarily to a lower provision for credit losses on our commercial loan portfolio, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures. In the year-to-date period, our provision for credit losses decreased $12 million due to a lower provision for credit losses on our commercial loan portfolio, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses on our consumer loan portfolio and a higher provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures. 

The provision for credit losses on our commercial loan portfolio decreased $31 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 reflecting a release in credit loss reserves in the current year period. The release in credit reserves in the current year period was driven by a decline in credit reserves for risk factors associated with higher risk industry exposures and lower credit reserves for risk associated with large loan exposures, partially offset by downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and higher provisions associated with growth in innovation banking. In the prior year period, the provision reflects improved economic forecasts and lower credit reserves for risk associated with large loan exposures which were offset by an increase in credit reserves for risk factors associated with higher risk industry exposures and downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients. 

In the year-to-date period, the provision for credit losses on our commercial loan portfolio decreased $33 million. The loss provision in the current year period was driven by downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and higher provisions associated with growth in innovation banking, partially offset by a decline in credit reserves for risk factors associated with higher risk industry exposures and lower credit reserves for risk associated with large loan exposures. In the prior year period, the loss provision was driven by downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and an increase in credit reserves for risk factors associated with higher risk industry exposures, partially offset by improved economic forecasts. 

The provision for credit losses on our consumer loan portfolio was relatively flat during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and increased $13 million in the year-to-date period reflecting a higher release in credit loss reserves in the prior year period. The release in credit reserves in the prior year period was driven by improved housing price forecasts, partially offset by an increase in credit reserves for risk factors associated with a change in New York State foreclosure law. 

The provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures increased $27 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 reflecting a loss provision compared with a release in credit loss reserves in the prior year period. The loss provision in the current year period resulted from higher provisions associated with growth in innovation banking and downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients. In the prior year period, the release in credit reserves resulted from improved economic forecasts and a decline in credit reserves for risk associated with large loan exposures. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

In the year-to-date period, the provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures increased $8 million. The loss provision in the current year period resulted from higher provisions associated with growth in innovation banking and downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients. In the prior year period, the loss provision resulted from downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients, partially offset by improved economic forecasts. 

See "Credit Quality" in this MD&#38;A for additional discussion on the allowance for credit losses associated with our various loan portfolios.

* Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. 

Credit card fees, net Credit card fees, net were relatively flat during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and increased in the year-to-date period reflecting increases in interchange fees, over-limit fees and other miscellaneous fees. 

Trust and investment management fees Trust and investment management fees increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to higher average assets under management, higher discretionary fees from private banking 

HSBC USA Inc. 

funds and, in the year-to-date period, lower fee waivers from liquidity funds reflecting the impact of higher market interest rates. 

Other fees and commissions Other fees and commissions decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as higher fees from wire transfers and other account services were more than offset by lower fees from loan syndication. In the year-to-date period, other fees and commissions increased due to higher fees from loan syndication, wire transfers and other account services reflecting higher business activity compared with the prior year period. See Note 11, "Fee Income from Contracts with Customers," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information including a summary of the components of other fees and commissions. 

Trading revenue Trading revenue is generated by participation in the foreign exchange, precious metals, rates, credit and equities markets. The following table presents trading revenue by business activity. Not included in the table below is the impact of net interest income associated with trading securities which is an integral part of trading activities' overall performance. Net interest income related to trading activities is recorded in net interest income in the consolidated statement of income. Certain derivatives, such as total return swaps, are economically hedged by holding the underlying interest bearing referenced assets. Trading revenue related to the mortgage banking business is included as a component of other income (loss).

(1) Includes trading revenue related to Global Banking and Equities. 

Trading revenue decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due primarily to lower revenue in Metals reflecting the impact of our agreement to refer transactions related to all future precious metals trading and financing activities associated with our Global Banking clients to HSBC Bank plc beginning in September 2023, lower Market Treasury revenue driven by the lower performance of economic hedge positions used to manage interest rate risk and lower revenue in Foreign Exchange driven by lower market volatility compared with the prior year periods. Also contributing to the decrease in the three-month period was lower revenue in Debt Markets due primarily to unfavorable funding fair value adjustments on derivatives. These decreases were partially offset by higher revenue in Securities Financing driven by the impact of higher market rates which impacts fair value and increased balance sheet deployment. Other trading revenue was also higher in the year-to-date period due primarily to favorable fair value adjustments on certain investments held for Community Reinvestment Act purposes. 

Other securities gains (losses), net We maintain securities portfolios as part of our balance sheet diversification and risk management strategies. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold $2,282 million and $4,317 

HSBC USA Inc. 

million, respectively, of primarily U.S. Treasury and U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities compared with nil and $681 million during the prior year periods as part of our continuing strategy to maximize returns while balancing the securities portfolio for risk management purposes. Other securities gains (losses), net decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to a loss of $148 million realized in the third quarter of 2024 from the sale of certain U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities with a total carrying value of $2,130 million as we managed our exposure to the changing interest rate environment and rebalanced the portfolio for risk management purposes. The gross realized gains and losses from sales of securities, which are included as a component of other securities gains (losses), net above, are summarized in Note 3, "Securities," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due primarily to higher cost reimbursements associated with shared services performed on behalf of other HSBC affiliates, higher loan servicing fees from HSBC Markets (USA) Inc. ("HMUS") and higher performance fees associated with trading activity booked on the balance sheet of HSBC Bank plc. 

Gain (loss) on instruments designated at fair value and related derivatives We have elected to apply fair value option accounting to certain commercial loans held for sale, certain student loans held for investment, certain of our own fixed-rate debt issuances, all of our hybrid instruments issued, including structured notes and deposits, and certain client share repurchase transactions. We also use derivatives to economically hedge the interest rate and other risks associated with certain financial assets and liabilities for which fair value option accounting has been elected. Gain (loss) on instruments designated at fair value and related derivatives improved during the three months ended September 30, 2024 attributable primarily to favorable movements related to the economic hedging of interest rate risk within our own debt. In the year-to-date period, gain (loss) on instruments designated at fair value and related derivatives decreased due to the non-recurrence of valuation gains recorded in the prior year period on certain commercial loans held for sale reflecting improvements in the financial condition of certain clients, partially offset by favorable movements related to the economic hedging of interest rate risk within our own debt. See Note 9, "Fair Value Option," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information including a breakout of these amounts by individual component. 

Other income (loss) &#160; Other income (loss) improved during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to higher income associated with bank owned life insurance and lower losses on the swap agreements entered into in conjunction with previous sales of Visa Class B shares. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded losses of $29 million and $32 million, respectively, primarily related to extending the expected timing of the final resolution of the related litigation and a change in the Visa Class B share conversion rate compared with losses of $34 million and $40 million during the prior year periods. Also contributing to the improvement in the year-to-date period were improved valuations on loans held for sale driven by a $30 million lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 associated with certain commercial real estate loans held for sale as well as lower losses on loan sales driven by a loss on sale of $10 million recorded during the second quarter of 2023 reflecting a repricing reserve adjustment associated with a previously sold portfolio of consumer mortgage loans.

(1) During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we released $8 million of deposit insurance special assessment fees while, in the year-to-date period, we increased our accrual by $34 million as discussed further below. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Salaries and employee benefits Salaries and employee benefits expense increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due primarily to higher salaries expense driven by the addition of personnel associated with growth initiatives in innovation banking and, in the year-to-date period, higher incentive compensation expense reflecting improved core business performance. Also contributing to the increase were higher health care costs. 

Support services from HSBC affiliates Support services from HSBC affiliates increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to higher cost allocations from HMUS associated with Global Banking activities, partially offset by lower cost allocations from our technology and support service functions. A summary of the services received from various HSBC affiliates is included in Note 12, "Related Party Transactions," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Occupancy expense, net Occupancy expense, net decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due primarily to lower depreciation expense, partially offset by higher rent expense. 

Other expenses Other expenses were higher during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to increases in marketing expense, expense related to legal matters and capitalized software amortization expense, which were more pronounced in the year-to-date period. While deposit insurance assessment fees were lower and partially offset the increase in the three-month period, they were higher and contributed to the increase in the year-to-date period. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we released $8 million of deposit insurance special assessment fees while, in the year-to-date period, we increased our accrual by $34 million. During the first half of 2024, the FDIC informed banks who are required to fund the shortfall in the DIF that the estimated loss has increased and, as a result, we accrued additional fees to reflect our updated special assessment amount. During the third quarter of 2024, the FDIC informed banks that the estimated loss had decreased. The increase in the year-to-date period was partially offset by higher levels of expense capitalization related to internally developed software. 

Efficiency ratio Our efficiency ratio increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to lower other revenues and, to a lesser extent, higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher net interest income as discussed in detail above. In the year-to-date period, our efficiency ratio increased due primarily to higher operating expenses and, to a lesser extent, lower net interest income as discussed in detail above. 

Income tax expense The following table summarizes our effective tax rate based on the provision for income taxes attributable to pretax income: 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 &#160; (dollars are in millions) Income before income tax $ 115 &#160; $ 239 Income tax expense 27 &#160; 57 Effective tax rate 23.5 &#160; % 23.8 % Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (dollars are in millions) Income before income tax $ 611 &#160; $ 725 Income tax expense 129 &#160; 175 Effective tax rate 21.1 &#160; % 24.1 % 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, income tax expense decreased due primarily to lower pre-tax income, while the effective tax rate was relatively flat. In the year-to-date period, income tax expense and the effective tax rate decreased due primarily to lower pre-tax income, an immaterial out of period adjustment to our deferred tax asset balance which decreased tax expense by $12 million during the first quarter of 2024, and higher expected investment tax credits. 

Management evaluated the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and it was determined that a valuation allowance was not required.

Segment Results &#8211; Group Reporting Basis 

We have distinct businesses, which are aligned with HSBC's global business strategy: Wealth and Personal Banking ("WPB"), Commercial Banking ("CMB"), and Global Banking and Markets ("GBM"). These businesses and a Corporate Center ("CC") serve as our reportable segments with the exception of GBM. Our GBM business is comprised of three distinct operating segments: Global Banking ("GB"), Markets and Securities Services ("MSS"), and Global Banking and Markets Other ("GBM Other"), which are separately reported. See Item 1, "Business," in our 2023 Form 10-K for a description of our segments, including a discussion of the main business activities of the segments and a summary of their products and services. There have been no changes in the basis of our segmentation as compared with the presentation in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Net interest income of each segment represents the difference between actual interest earned on assets and interest incurred on liabilities of the segment, adjusted for a funding charge or credit that includes both interest rate and liquidity components. Segments are charged a cost to fund assets (e.g., customer loans) and receive a funding credit for funds provided (e.g., customer deposits) based on equivalent market rates that incorporate both repricing (interest rate risk) and tenor (liquidity) characteristics. Net funding charges associated with MSS trading activities are reported within other operating income to align with the trading revenue generated by such activities. These net funding charges are reversed back into net interest income in the CC. The objective of these charges/credits is to transfer interest rate risk to one centralized unit in Markets Treasury. Markets Treasury income statement and balance sheet results are allocated to each of the global businesses based upon tangible equity levels and levels of any surplus liabilities. 

Certain other revenue and operating expense amounts are also apportioned among the business segments based upon the benefits derived from the activity or the relationship of the activity to other segment activity. These inter-segment transactions have not been eliminated, and we generally account for them as if they were with third parties. 

We report financial information to our parent, HSBC, in accordance with HSBC Group accounting and reporting policies, which apply IFRSs as issued by the IASB. As a result, our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the Group Reporting Basis as operating results are monitored and reviewed, trends are evaluated and decisions about allocating resources, such as employees, are primarily made on this basis. We continue, however, to monitor capital adequacy and report to regulatory agencies on a U.S. GAAP basis. 

There have been no changes in the measurement of segment profit as compared with the presentation in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

In October 2024, HSBC announced plans to simplify its organizational structure effective January 1, 2025 to accelerate delivery against its strategic priorities. We are currently evaluating the impact of these plans on our financial reporting. To the extent we make changes to the financial information being reported to our management in the future, we will evaluate any impact such changes may have on our segment reporting. 

The significant differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis as they impact our results are summarized in Note 25, "Business Segments," in our 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no significant changes since December 31, 2023 in the differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis impacting our results.

Our WPB segment reported a loss before tax during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with a profit before tax in the prior year period due primarily to lower other operating income and higher operating expenses. In the year-to-date period, our WPB segment reported a lower profit before tax due primarily to higher operating expenses driven by the non-recurrence of a reversal of $142 million of impairment charges recorded during the second quarter of 2023 related to capitalized software and leasehold improvements which were previously impaired and written-off. Also contributing to the lower profit before tax in the year-to-date period was lower net interest income. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Net interest income was flat during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and decreased in the year-to-date period as the unfavorable impact of lower deposit balances driven by the attrition of savings and demand deposits was offset in the three-month period and partially offset in the year-to-date period by the favorable impact of higher market rates and higher loan balances driven by growth in residential mortgages. 

Other operating income decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 driven by lower allocated Markets Treasury other operating income, largely reflecting an allocated loss of $22 million in the third quarter of 2024 from the sale of certain securities for risk management purposes. This decrease was partially offset by lower losses on the swap agreements entered into in conjunction with previous sales of Visa Class B shares. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded losses of $29 million and $32 million, respectively, primarily related to extending the expected timing of the final resolution of the related litigation and a change in the Visa Class B share conversion rate compared with losses of $34 million and $40 million during the prior year periods. 

In the year-to-date period, other operating income was relatively flat as lower allocated Markets Treasury other operating income as discussed above was more than offset by lower losses on the swap agreements entered into in conjunction with previous sales of Visa Class B shares as discussed above, lower losses on loan sales driven by a loss on sale of $10 million recorded during the second quarter of 2023 reflecting a repricing reserve adjustment associated with a previously sold portfolio of consumer mortgage loans, and higher investment management fees. The increase in investment management fees was driven by higher average assets under management, higher discretionary fees from private banking funds and lower fee waivers from liquidity funds reflecting the impact of higher market interest rates. 

Expected credit losses increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 reflecting a modest loss provision compared with a release in credit loss reserves in the prior year period driven by improvements in the credit quality of the portfolio. In the year-to-date period, expected credit losses increased reflecting a release in credit loss reserves in the prior year period driven by improvements in the credit quality of the portfolio and improved housing price forecasts, partially offset by a higher loss estimate for risk factors associated with a change in New York State foreclosure law. 

Excluding the reversal of impairment charges as discussed above, operating expenses remained higher during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due primarily to higher expense related to legal matters and higher incentive compensation expense. 

Client Assets The following table provides information regarding private banking client assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

(3) Includes allocated Markets Treasury revenue. 

Our CMB segment reported a lower profit before tax during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to higher operating expenses, lower other operating income and higher expected credit losses, partially offset by higher net interest income. 

Net interest income increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due primarily to higher allocated Markets Treasury net interest income and higher deposits spreads, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of lower deposit balances and lower earnings on capital. 

Other operating income decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to lower allocated Markets Treasury other operating income, largely reflecting an allocated loss of $56 million in the third quarter of 2024 from the sale of 

HSBC USA Inc. 

certain securities for risk management purposes. This increase was partially offset by higher fees from account services and, in the year-to-date period, commitments and loan syndication. 

Expected credit losses increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The loss provisions in the current year periods were driven by downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and higher provisions associated with growth in innovation banking. In the prior year periods, the loss provisions were driven by downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients, partially offset by improved economic forecasts. 

Operating expenses increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due primarily to higher cost allocations from our technology and support service functions and higher salaries expense driven by the addition of personnel associated with growth initiatives in innovation banking.

Our GB segment reported a higher profit before tax during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to higher net interest income and lower operating expenses, partially offset by lower other operating income and higher expected credit losses. In the year-to-date period, our GB segment reported a higher profit before tax due to higher other operating income, lower operating expenses and lower expected credit losses. 

Revenue increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due primarily to higher revenue in GPS driven by higher net interest income from higher spreads as well as higher account service fees. This increase was partially offset by lower revenue in Investment Banking and Credit and Lending. Lower revenue in Investment Banking was due primarily to lower fees from loan syndication, lower net interest income from decreased loan spreads and balances and, in the year-to-date period, the non-recurrence of fair value adjustment gains recorded in the prior year period on certain loans held for sale reflecting improvements in the financial condition of certain clients. Revenue in Credit and Lending was lower due primarily to lower net interest income from decreased loan spreads. 

Expected credit losses increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 reflecting a lower release in credit loss reserves. The release in credit reserves in the current year period was driven by improvements in the credit condition of a single client relationship, partially offset by downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients. In the prior year period, the release in credit reserves was driven by improved economic forecasts. In the year-to-date period, expected credit losses improved reflecting a release in credit loss reserves in the current year period for the reasons discussed above compared with a loss provision in the prior year period. The loss provision in the prior year-to-date period was driven by downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients, partially offset by improved economic conditions. 

Operating expenses decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due primarily to lower cost allocations from our support service functions.

Our MSS segment reported a lower profit before tax during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due primarily to lower other operating income and higher operating expenses. These decreases were partially offset in the three-month period by higher net interest income. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Revenue decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to lower revenue in Foreign Exchange and Metals, MSS Other and credit and funding valuation adjustments. Lower revenue in Foreign Exchange and Metals was driven by lower market volatility in Foreign Exchange compared with the prior year periods as well as the impact of our agreement to refer transactions related to all future precious metals trading and financing activities associated with our Global Banking clients to HSBC Bank plc beginning in September 2023. The agreement to transfer these activities to HSBC Bank plc also resulted in a gain of $10 million recorded in MSS Other during the third quarter of 2023 which did not re-occur. Credit and funding valuation adjustments were unfavorable attributable primarily to funding fair value adjustments on derivatives and, in the year-to-date period, movements related to the economic hedging of interest rate risk and other risks within our structured notes. These decreases were partially offset by higher revenue in Equities and, in the year-to-date period, Securities Financing. Higher revenue in Equities was driven by higher performance fees associated with trading activity booked on the balance sheet of HSBC Bank plc. Higher revenue in Securities Financing in the year-to-date period was due to higher market rates and increased balance sheet deployment. 

Operating expenses increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due primarily to higher cost allocations from our technology and support service functions.

* Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. 

Our GBM Other segment reported a higher loss before tax during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due primarily to lower revenue driven by lower allocated Markets Treasury other operating income, largely reflecting an allocated loss of $70 million in the third quarter of 2024 from the sale of certain securities for risk management purposes. Lower revenue was partially offset by higher allocated Markets Treasury net interest income and higher cost reimbursements. Also contributing to the higher loss before tax were higher operating expenses driven by higher cost allocations from our support service functions.

Corporate Center The following table summarizes the Group Reporting Basis results for our CC segment: 

Increase (Decrease) Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Amount % &#160; (dollars are in millions) Net interest expense $ (175) $ (134) $ (41) (30.6) % Other operating income 174 &#160; 120 54 45.0 Total operating income (expense) (1) (14) 13 92.9 Expected credit losses &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Net operating income (expense) (1) (14) 13 92.9 Operating expenses 24 &#160; 36 (12) (33.3) Loss before tax $ (25) $ (50) $ 25 50.0 % Increase (Decrease) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Amount % &#160; (dollars are in millions) Net interest expense $ (502) $ (347) $ (155) (44.7) % Other operating income 507 &#160; 317 190 59.9 Total operating income (expense) 5 &#160; (30) 35 * Expected credit losses &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Net operating income (expense) 5 &#160; (30) 35 * Operating expenses 142 &#160; 104 38 36.5 Loss before tax $ (137) $ (134) $ (3) (2.2) % 

* Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. 

Our CC segment reported a lower loss before tax during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to higher other operating income and lower operating expenses, partially offset by higher net interest expense. In the year-to-date period, our CC segment loss before tax was relatively flat as higher net interest expense and higher operating expenses were largely offset by higher other operating income. 

Net interest expense increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 driven by a higher cost of funds reflecting the impact of higher market rates. 

Other operating income increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due primarily to higher net funding credits associated with MSS trading activities which increased by $37 million and $154 million, respectively, which reflects the higher net interest expense above. Also contributing to the increase were favorable movements related to the economic hedging of interest rate risk within our own debt and, in the year-to-date period, favorable fair value adjustments on certain investments held for Community Reinvestment Act purposes. 

Operating expenses decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and increased in the year-to-date period due primarily to adjustments to deposit insurance special assessment fees. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we released $8 million of deposit insurance special assessment fees while, in the year-to-date period, we increased our accrual by $34 million. During the first half of 2024, the FDIC informed banks who are required to fund the shortfall in the DIF that the estimated loss has increased and, as a result, we accrued additional fees to reflect our updated special assessment amount. During the third quarter of 2024, the FDIC informed banks that the estimated loss had decreased. 

Reconciliation of Segment Results As previously discussed, segment results are reported on a Group Reporting Basis. See Note 13, "Business Segments," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of our Group Reporting Basis segment results to U.S. GAAP consolidated totals.

Credit Quality 

In the normal course of business, we enter into a variety of transactions that involve both on and off-balance sheet credit risk. Principal among these activities is lending to various commercial, institutional, governmental and individual customers. We participate in lending activity throughout the United States and, on a limited basis, internationally. 

Allowance for Credit Losses / Liability for Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures &#160; Our accounting policies and methodologies related to the allowance for credit losses and liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures are presented under the caption "Critical Accounting Estimates" in MD&#38;A and in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements," in our 2023 Form 10-K. Our approach toward credit risk management is summarized under the caption "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no significant revisions to our policies or methodologies during the first nine months of 2024. 

The following table summarizes our allowance for credit losses and the liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures: 

September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 &#160; (in millions) Allowance for credit losses: Loans: Commercial loans $ 531 &#160; $ 567 $ 574 Consumer loans 16 &#160; 16 17 Total loans 547 &#160; 583 591 Securities held-to-maturity &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#8212;

(1) Primarily includes accrued interest receivables and customer acceptances. 

The total allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024 decreased $36 million or 6 percent as compared with June 30, 2024 and decreased $44 million or 7 percent as compared with December 31, 2023 due primarily to a lower loss estimate on our commercial loan portfolio, while our consumer allowance for credit losses was relatively flat. 

Our commercial allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024 decreased $36 million or 6 percent as compared with June 30, 2024 and decreased $43 million or 7 percent as compared with December 31, 2023 driven by a decline in credit reserves for risk factors associated with higher risk industry exposures, lower credit reserves for risk associated with large loan exposures and, as compared with December 31, 2023, the charge-off of two corporate banking loans in the second quarter. These decreases were partially offset by downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and higher loss estimates associated with growth in innovation banking. 

The liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures at September 30, 2024 increased $17 million or 14 percent as compared with June 30, 2024 and increased $24 million or 22 percent as compared with December 31, 2023 resulting from higher loss estimates associated with growth in innovation banking and downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients.

See Note 5, "Allowance for Credit Losses," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a rollforward of credit losses by loan categories for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

The allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment at September 30, 2024 decreased as compared with both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 due to the decrease in our allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above and an increase in total loans held for investment. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

The allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of nonperforming loans held for investment at September 30, 2024 was relatively flat as compared with June 30, 2024 as the decrease in our allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above was offset by a decrease in nonperforming loans as discussed further below in our commercial loan portfolio. As compared with December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of nonperforming loans held for investment decreased due to an increase in nonperforming loans as discussed further below in our commercial loan portfolio and the decrease in our allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above. 

Delinquency The following table summarizes dollars of two-months-and-over contractual delinquency and two-months-and-over contractual delinquency as a percentage of total loans, excluding loans held for sale ("delinquency ratio").

(1) At September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, consumer mortgage loan delinquency includes $69 million, $62 million and $61 million, respectively, of loans that are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. 

(2) The following table reflects dollars of contractual delinquency and delinquency ratios for interest-only loans and adjustable rate mortgage ("ARM") loans: 

&#160; September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Delinquent Loans Delinquency Ratio Delinquent Loan Delinquency Ratio Delinquent Loans Delinquency Ratio &#160; (dollars are in millions) Interest-only loans $ 3 &#160; .07 &#160; % $ 6 .13 % $ 4 .09 % ARM loans 84 &#160; .57 &#160; 89 .63 69 .51 

Our two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio increased 16 basis points compared with June 30, 2024 due to higher dollars of delinquency in our commercial loan portfolio. As compared with December 31, 2023, our two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio decreased 48 basis points due to lower dollars of delinquency in our commercial loan portfolio, partially offset by higher dollars of delinquency in our consumer loan portfolio. Also contributing to the decrease in the ratio as compared with December 31, 2023 were higher outstanding loan balances. 

Our commercial loan two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio increased 25 basis points compared with June 30, 2024 due primarily to higher dollars of delinquency driven by a few loans which which became 60 days past due. As compared with December 31, 2023, our commercial loan two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio decreased 72 basis points due to lower dollars of delinquency driven by collections, including the collections of two commercial real estate loans in the second quarter and a few large private banking loans in the first quarter. 

Our consumer loan two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio decreased 4 basis points compared with June 30, 2024 due to lower dollars of delinquency in residential mortgages driven by the collections of a few large loans which became 60 days past due in the second quarter as well as higher outstanding loan balances. As compared with December 31, 2023, our consumer loan two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio was relatively flat as higher dollars of delinquency driven primarily by deterioration in residential mortgages was largely offset by higher outstanding loan balances.

Our net charge-off ratio decreased 17 basis points during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due primarily to a lower level of net charge-offs in our commercial loan portfolio driven by the deterioration of a corporate banking loan in the prior year period. 

In the year-to-date period, our net charge-off ratio increased 3 basis points due to a higher level of net charge-offs in our commercial loan portfolio driven by the deterioration of two corporate banking loans in the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by a lower level of net charge-offs in our consumer loan portfolio driven by improved net charge-offs in residential mortgages reflecting a modest level of net recoveries in the current year period compared with a modest level of net charge-offs in the prior year period.

At September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, total nonperforming loans include $4 million, $4 million and $6 million, respectively, of accruing loans contractually 90 days or more past due. 

(2) At September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, nonperforming consumer mortgage loans include $107 million, $103 million and $108 million, respectively, of loans that are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell. 

(3) Nonperforming consumer mortgage loans held for investment include all loans which are 90 or more days contractually delinquent as well as loans discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not re-affirmed and second lien loans where the first lien loan that we own or service is 90 or more days contractually delinquent. 

(4) Nonperforming consumer mortgage loans for all periods does not include guaranteed loans purchased from the Government National Mortgage Association. Repayment of these loans is predominantly insured by the Federal Housing Administration and as such, these loans have different risk characteristics from the rest of our customer loan portfolio. 

(5) Includes $1 million or less of commercial other real estate owned at September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Our nonperforming loans ratio decreased 9 basis points compared with June 30, 2024 due primarily to lower nonperforming loans in our commercial loan portfolio. As compared with December 31, 2023, our nonperforming loans ratio increased 20 basis points due to higher nonperforming loans in our commercial loan portfolio, partially offset by lower nonperforming loans in our consumer loan portfolio and higher outstanding loan balances. 

Our commercial nonperforming loans ratio decreased 12 basis points compared with June 30, 2024 due primarily to lower nonperforming loans as the impact of downgrades was more than offset by paydowns and charge-offs. As compared with December 31, 2023, our commercial nonperforming loans ratio increased 38 basis points due to higher nonperforming loans driven by downgrades, including the downgrade of a global banking loan in the first quarter, partially offset by paydowns and charge-offs. 

Our consumer nonperforming loans ratio decreased 3 basis points compared with June 30, 2024 due to higher outstanding loan balances while nonperforming loans were relatively flat. As compared with December 31, 2023, our consumer nonperforming loans ratio decreased 14 basis points due to lower nonperforming loans in residential mortgages driven by collections as well as higher outstanding loan balances. 

Our policies and practices for problem loan management and placing loans on nonaccrual status are summarized in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements," in our 2023 Form 10-K.

Concentration of Credit Risk A concentration of credit risk is defined as a significant credit exposure with an individual or group engaged in similar activities or affected similarly by economic conditions. We enter into a variety of transactions in the normal course of business that involve both on and off-balance sheet credit risk. Principal among these activities is lending to various commercial, institutional, governmental and individual customers. We manage the varying degrees of credit risk associated with on and off-balance sheet transactions through specific credit policies and procedures which provide for a strict approval, monitoring and reporting process. It is our policy to require collateral when it is deemed appropriate. Varying degrees and types of collateral are secured depending upon management's credit evaluation.

Credit Risks Associated with Derivative Contracts Credit risk associated with derivatives is measured as the net replacement cost of derivative contracts in a receivable position in the event the counterparties of such contracts fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. In managing derivative credit risk, both the current exposure, which is the replacement cost of contracts on the measurement date, as well as an estimate of the potential change in value of contracts over their remaining lives are considered. Counterparties to our derivative activities include financial institutions, central clearing parties, foreign and domestic government agencies, corporations, funds (mutual funds, hedge funds, etc.), insurance companies and private clients as well as other HSBC entities. These counterparties are subject to regular credit review by the credit risk management department. To minimize credit risk, we may enter into legally enforceable master netting agreements which reduce risk by permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon occurrence of certain events. In addition, we reduce credit risk by obtaining collateral from counterparties. The determination of the need for and the levels of collateral will differ based on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty and/or regulatory requirements. 

The total risk in a derivative contract is a function of a number of variables, such as: 

&#8226; volatility of interest rates, currencies, equity or corporate reference entity used as the basis for determining contract payments; 

&#8226; current market events or trends; 

&#8226; country risk; 

&#8226; maturity and liquidity of contracts; 

&#8226; creditworthiness of the counterparties in the transaction; 

&#8226; the existence of a master netting agreement among the counterparties; and 

&#8226; existence and value of collateral received from counterparties to secure exposures. 

The table below presents total credit risk exposure calculated using the general risk-based capital rules of the Basel III Standardized Approach which includes the net positive mark-to-market of the derivative contracts plus any adjusted potential future exposure as measured in reference to the notional amount. The regulatory capital rules recognize that bilateral netting agreements reduce credit risk and, therefore, allow for reductions of risk-weighted assets when netting requirements have been met and collateral exists. As a result, risk-weighted amounts for regulatory capital purposes are a portion of the original gross exposures. Furthermore, many contracts contain provisions that allow us to close out the transaction if the counterparty fails to post required collateral. In addition, many contracts give us the right to break the transactions earlier than the final maturity date. As a result, these contracts have potential future exposures that are often much smaller than the future exposures derived from the regulatory capital rules.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Effective liquidity management is defined as ensuring we can meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities/withdrawals and other cash commitments efficiently under both normal operating conditions and under unpredictable circumstances of industry or market stress. To achieve this objective, we have guidelines that require sufficient liquidity to cover potential funding requirements in both the short- and long-term and to avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. Guidelines are set for the consolidated balance sheet of HSBC USA to ensure that it is a source of strength for our regulated, deposit-taking banking subsidiary, as well as to address the more limited sources of liquidity available to it as a holding company. Similar guidelines are set for HSBC Bank USA to ensure that it can meet its liquidity needs in various stress scenarios. Cash flow analysis, including stress testing scenarios, forms the basis for liquidity management and contingency funding plans. See "Risk Management" in this MD&#38;A for further discussion of our approach towards liquidity and funding risk management, including information regarding the key measures employed to define, monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk. 

Interest Bearing Deposits with Banks totaled $28,334 million and $25,015 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, of which $28,150 million and $24,830 million, respectively, were held with the Federal Reserve Bank. Balances may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our liquidity position at the time and our strategy for deploying

Under our shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, we may issue certain securities including debt securities and preferred stock. We satisfy the eligibility requirements for designation as a "well-known seasoned issuer," which allows us to file a registration statement that does not have a limit on issuance capacity. The ability to issue under the registration statement is limited by the authority granted by the Board of Directors. At September 30, 2024, we were authorized to issue up to $15,000 million, of which $6,363 million was available. HSBC Bank USA has a $40,000 million Global Bank Note Program that provides for the issuance of subordinated and senior notes, of which $11,968 million was available at September 30, 2024. 

As a member of the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, we have secured borrowing facilities which are collateralized by loans and investment securities. At September 30, 2024, long-term debt included $1,000 million of borrowings from the FHLB facility. Based upon the amounts pledged as collateral under these facilities, we have additional borrowing capacity of up to $35,646 million. 

Preferred Equity See Note 19, "Preferred Stock," in our 2023 Form 10-K for information regarding all outstanding HSBC USA preferred share issues. 

Common Equity During the third quarter of 2024, HSBC USA received a common stock dividend of $600 million from its subsidiary, HSBC Bank USA. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Capital Ratios In managing capital, we develop targets for common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, total capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier 1 capital to adjusted quarterly average assets (i.e., the "Tier 1 leverage ratio"). Capital targets are reviewed at least semi-annually to ensure they reflect our business mix and risk profile, as well as real-time conditions and circumstances. The following table summarizes HSBC USA's Basel III capital ratios calculated as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 

September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 13.0 &#160; % 13.0 % Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 13.3 &#160; 13.3 Total capital to risk-weighted assets 15.5 &#160; 15.7 

Tier 1 leverage ratio (1) 

8.2 &#160; 7.7 

(1) Adjusted quarterly average assets, the Tier 1 leverage ratio denominator, reflects quarterly average assets adjusted for amounts permitted to be deducted from Tier 1 capital. 

We manage capital in accordance with HSBC Group policy. The HSBC North America Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ("ICAAP") works in conjunction with the HSBC Group's ICAAP. The HSBC North America ICAAP applies to HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA and evaluates regulatory capital adequacy and capital adequacy under various stress scenarios. Our approach is to meet our capital needs for these stress scenarios locally through activities which reduce risk. To the extent that local alternatives are insufficient, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC, we would seek support from our ultimate parent. Regulatory capital requirements are based on the amount of capital required to be held, plus applicable capital buffers, as defined by regulations, and the amount of risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure, also calculated based on regulatory definitions. 

We are subject to regulatory capital rules issued by U.S. banking regulators including Basel III (the "Basel III rule"). The Basel III rule establishes minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for banks and bank holding companies ("BHCs"). HSBC North America, HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA each calculate their risk-based capital requirements for credit risk under the Standardized Approach in the Basel III rule. In 2019, the FRB and the other federal banking agencies jointly finalized rules to implement the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act that tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards for large BHC and foreign banking organizations (the "Tailoring Rules"). The Tailoring Rules assign each BHC and IHC with $50 billion or more in total U.S. assets into one of five classifications (Categories I through IV, and 'other firms') based on its size and four risk-based indicators. Under the Tailoring Rules, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA are subject to Category IV standards. For additional discussion of the Basel III rule requirements, including required minimum capital ratios, as well as further discussion of the Tailoring Rules, Category IV standards and other related regulatory developments and their expected impact see Part I, "Regulation and Competition - Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Requirements," in our 2023 Form 10-K. We continue to review the composition of our capital structure. 

Regulatory Developments In June 2024, the FDIC issued a final rule to amend its existing resolution planning requirements for insured depository institutions. Under the final rule, banks with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets that are not affiliated with U.S. G-SIBs, including HSBC Bank USA, are required to submit a full resolution plan every three years and an interim supplement in each intervening year, and are subject to increased submission content requirements and expanded engagement and capabilities testing with the FDIC. HSBC Bank USA's next submission will be an interim supplement which is due on or before July 1, 2025, while its next full resolution plan submission is due on or before July 1, 2026. 

Capital Planning and Stress Testing The FRB requires certain U.S. top-tier BHCs and IHCs, including HSBC North America, to comply with the FRB's capital plan rule and CCAR program, as well as the supervisory stress tests conducted by the FRB. The stress tests are forward looking exercises to assess the impact of hypothetical macroeconomic baseline and severely adverse scenarios provided by the FRB on the financial condition and capital adequacy of a CCAR firm over a nine quarter planning horizon. As a Category IV firm, HSBC North America is subject to supervisory stress testing on a biennial basis, and it may opt-in to such testing in an "off year" in order to recalibrate its stress capital buffer based on its most recent supervisory stress test. The FRB continues to supervise Category IV firms on an ongoing basis, including evaluation of the capital adequacy and capital planning processes during off-cycle years. For further discussion of capital planning and stress testing, including detail regarding the FRB's supervisory assessment as part of the CCAR process, see Part I, "Regulation and Competition - Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Requirements," in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

HSBC North America submitted its 2024 CCAR capital plan in April 2024. In June 2024, the FRB publicly disclosed its supervisory stress test results for all CCAR firms, including HSBC North America, and the results are incorporated into the stress capital buffer for HSBC North America. Stress testing results are based solely on hypothetical adverse stress scenarios and should not be viewed or interpreted as forecasts of expected outcomes or capital adequacy or of the actual financial 

HSBC USA Inc. 

condition of HSBC North America. Capital planning and stress testing for HSBC North America may impact our future capital and liquidity. 

While BHC regulatory capital compliance is generally performed at the HSBC North America level, and also separately for HSBC Bank USA, as a BHC we are required to meet minimum capital requirements imposed by the FRB. We present our capital ratios, together with HSBC Bank USA's in Note 14, "Retained Earnings and Regulatory Capital Requirements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

2024 Funding Strategy Our current estimate for funding needs and sources for 2024 are summarized in the following table: 

Actual January 1 through 

September 30, 2024 

Estimated October 1 through 

December 31, 2024 

Estimated Full Year 2024 

&#160; (in billions) Increase (decrease) in funding needs: Net change in loans $ 4 $ &#8212; $ 4 Net change in short-term investments and securities (4) (8) (12) Net change in trading and other assets &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Total funding needs $ &#8212; $ (8) $ (8) Increase (decrease) in funding sources: Net change in deposits $ 2 $ (2) $ &#8212; Net change in trading and other short-term liabilities (2) (6) (8) Net change in long-term debt &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Total funding sources $ &#8212; $ (8) $ (8) 

The above table reflects a long-term funding strategy. Daily balances fluctuate as we accommodate customer needs, while ensuring that we have liquidity in place to support the balance sheet maturity funding profile. Should market conditions deteriorate, we have contingency plans to generate additional liquidity through the sales of assets or financing transactions. We remain confident in our ability to access the market for long-term debt funding needs in the current market environment. We continue to seek well-priced and stable customer deposits. We also continue to sell new agency-eligible conforming residential mortgage loans to third parties. 

HSBC Bank USA is subject to significant restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to, and certain other 'covered transactions' with HSBC USA and other affiliates. For further discussion, see Part I, "Regulation and Competition - Affiliate Transaction Restrictions," in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

See "Risk Management" in this MD&#38;A for further discussion relating to our liquidity contingency plans and our approach to liquidity and funding risk management. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our normal operations, we enter into credit derivatives and various off-balance sheet arrangements with affiliates and third parties. These arrangements arise principally in connection with our lending and client intermediation activities and involve primarily commitments to extend credit and, in certain cases, guarantees. 

Commitments to extend credit include arrangements whereby we are contractually obligated to extend credit in the form of loans, participations in loans or similar transactions. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had commitments to extend credit totaling $92.4 billion and $87.4 billion, respectively, comprised primarily of commercial commitments and, to a lesser extent, consumer commitments. Commercial commitments comprise primarily those related to secured and unsecured loans and lines of credit. Consumer commitments comprise unused MasterCard/Visa credit card lines, where we have the right to change terms or conditions upon notification to the customer, and commitments to extend credit secured by residential properties, where we have the right to change terms or conditions, for cause, upon notification to the customer. For a summary of guarantees, including standby letters of credit and certain credit derivative transactions, as well as the contractual amounts outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, see Note 16, "Guarantee Arrangements, Pledged Asset and Repurchase Agreements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent our maximum possible credit exposure in the event that a counterparty draws down the full commitment amount or we are required to fulfill our maximum obligation under a guarantee. Many of these commitments and guarantees expire unused or without default. As a result, we believe that the contractual amount is not representative of the actual future credit exposure or funding requirements. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

In addition, we had commitments to purchase securities under agreements to resell on a forward starting basis totaling nil and $4.8 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These contracts typically expire in less than one month and are secured by collateral primarily from U.S. Treasury securities. 

Our off-balance sheet arrangements also include transactions with unconsolidated variable interest entities ("VIEs"). See Note 15, "Variable Interest Entities," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of these unconsolidated VIEs. 

Fair Value 

Fair Value Hierarchy Fair value measurement accounting principles establish a fair value hierarchy structure that prioritizes the inputs to determine the fair value of an asset or liability (the "Fair Value Framework"). The Fair Value Framework distinguishes between inputs that are based on observed market data and unobservable inputs that reflect market participants' assumptions. It emphasizes the use of valuation methodologies that maximize observable market inputs. For financial instruments carried at fair value, the best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an actively traded market (Level 1). Where the market for a financial instrument is not active, valuation techniques are used. The majority of our valuation techniques use market inputs that are either observable or indirectly derived from and corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the financial instrument (Level 2). Because Level 1 and Level 2 instruments are determined by observable inputs, less judgment is applied in determining their fair values. In the absence of observable market inputs, the financial instrument is valued based on valuation techniques that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The determination of the level of fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement of an asset or a liability is classified often requires judgment and may change over time as market conditions evolve. We consider the following factors in developing the fair value hierarchy: 

&#8226; whether the asset or liability is transacted in an active market with a quoted market price; 

&#8226; the level of bid-ask spreads; 

&#8226; a lack of pricing transparency due to, among other things, complexity of the product and market liquidity; 

&#8226; whether only a few transactions are observed over a significant period of time; 

&#8226; whether the pricing quotations differ substantially among independent pricing services; 

&#8226; whether inputs to the valuation techniques can be derived from or corroborated with market data; and 

&#8226; whether significant adjustments are made to the observed pricing information or model output to determine the fair value. 

Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that the reporting entity has the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities. A financial instrument is classified as a Level 1 measurement if it is listed on an exchange or is an instrument actively traded in the over-the-counter ("OTC") market where transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume. We regard financial instruments such as debt securities, equity securities and derivative contracts listed on the primary exchanges of a country to be actively traded. Non-exchange-traded instruments classified as Level 1 assets include securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, to-be-announced securities, non-callable securities issued by U.S. Government sponsored enterprises and certain foreign government-backed debt. 

Level 2 inputs are those that are observable either directly or indirectly but do not qualify as Level 1 inputs. We classify mortgage pass-through securities, agency and certain non-agency mortgage collateralized obligations, non-exchange-traded derivative contracts, asset-backed securities, obligations of U.S. states and political subdivisions, corporate debt securities, certain foreign government-backed debt, preferred securities, securities purchased and sold under resale and repurchase agreements, precious metals, certain loans held for sale, certain student loans held for investment, residential mortgage loans whose carrying amount was reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, real estate owned and certain client share repurchase transactions as Level 2 measurements. Where possible, at least two quotations from independent sources are obtained based on transactions involving comparable assets and liabilities to validate the fair value of these instruments. We have established a process to understand the methodologies and inputs used by the third-party pricing services to ensure that pricing information meets the fair value objective and, where appropriate, this pricing data is back-tested to market trade executions. Where significant differences arise among the independent pricing quotes and the internally determined fair value, we investigate and reconcile the differences. If the investigation results in a significant adjustment to the fair value, the instrument will be classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. In general, we have observed that there is a correlation between the credit standing and the market liquidity of a non-derivative instrument. 

Level 2 derivative instruments are generally valued based on discounted future cash flows or an option pricing model adjusted for counterparty credit risk and market liquidity. The fair value of certain derivative products is determined using valuation techniques based on inputs derived from observable indices traded in the OTC market. Appropriate control processes and 

HSBC USA Inc. 

procedures have been applied to ensure that the derived inputs are applied to value only those instruments that share similar risks to the relevant benchmark indices and therefore demonstrate a similar response to market factors. 

Level 3 inputs are unobservable estimates that management expects market participants would use to determine the fair value of the asset or liability. That is, Level 3 inputs incorporate market participants' assumptions about risk and the risk premium required by market participants in order to bear that risk. We develop Level 3 inputs based on the best information available in the circumstances. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value included the following: certain structured deposits and structured notes for which the embedded derivatives have significant unobservable inputs (e.g., volatility or default correlations), certain asset-backed securities, individually assessed commercial loans, mortgage servicing rights, derivatives with certain inputs which are unobservable, certain credit default swaps, certain loans held for sale and swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of Visa Class B Shares for which the fair value is dependent upon the final resolution of the related litigation. See Note 17, "Fair Value Measurements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on Level 3 inputs.

Significant Changes in Fair Value for Level 3 Assets and Liabilities See Note 17, "Fair Value Measurements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on additions to and transfers into (out of) Level 3 measurements during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 as well as for further details including the classification hierarchy associated with assets and liabilities measured at fair value. 

Effect of Changes in Significant Unobservable Inputs &#160; The fair value of certain financial instruments is measured using valuation techniques that incorporate pricing assumptions not supported by, derived from or corroborated by observable market data. The resultant fair value measurements are dependent on unobservable input parameters which can be selected from a range of estimates and may be interdependent. Changes in one or more of the significant unobservable input parameters may change the fair value measurements of these financial instruments. For the purpose of preparing the financial statements, the final valuation inputs selected are based on management's best judgment that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing similar assets or liabilities. 

The unobservable input parameters selected are subject to the internal valuation control processes and procedures. When we perform a test of all the significant input parameters to the extreme values within the range at the same time, it could result in an increase of the overall fair value measurement of approximately $17 million or a decrease of the overall fair value measurement of approximately $35 million at September 30, 2024. The effect of changes in significant unobservable input parameters are primarily driven by the uncertainty in determining the fair value of certain credit-linked structured notes and swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of Visa Class B Shares. 

Risk Management 

Overview &#160; The primary role of risk management is to protect our customers, business, colleagues and the communities that we serve, while ensuring we are able to support our strategy and provide sustainable growth. 

We aim to use a comprehensive risk management approach across the organization and across all risk types underpinned by our culture and values. This is outlined in our risk management framework, including the key principles and practices that we employ in managing material risks, both financial and non-financial. This framework fosters continuous monitoring, promotes 

HSBC USA Inc. 

risk awareness, and encourages sound operational and strategic decision-making and escalation processes. It also supports a consistent approach to identifying, assessing, managing, and reporting the risks we accept and incur in our activities, with clear accountabilities. 

Our Board of Directors has the ultimate responsibility for the effective oversight of risk management and approves our risk appetite. It is advised on risk matters by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors, notably risk appetite and its alignment with our strategy, risk governance and internal controls, as well as high-level risk related matters. We use a defined executive risk governance structure to help ensure there is appropriate oversight and accountability embedded throughout our business for the effective management of risk. 

Our material risks The principal risks associated with our operations include the following: 

&#8226; Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract; 

&#8226; Treasury risk is the risk of having insufficient capital, liquidity or funding resources to meet financial obligations and satisfy regulatory requirements, including the risk of an adverse impact on earnings or capital due to changes in market interest rates, together with pension risk; 

&#8226; Market risk is the risk of an adverse financial impact on trading activities arising from changes in market parameters such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, asset prices, volatilities, correlations and credit spreads; 

&#8226; Climate risk relates to the financial and non-financial impacts that may arise as a consequence of climate change and the move to a net zero economy; 

&#8226; Resilience risk is the risk of sustained and significant business disruption from execution, delivery, physical security or safety events, causing the inability to provide critical services to our customers, affiliates and counterparties; 

&#8226; Regulatory compliance risk is the risk associated with breaching our duty to clients and other counterparties, inappropriate market conduct and breaching related financial services regulatory standards; 

&#8226; Financial crime risk is the risk that our products and services will be exploited for criminal activity, including fraud, bribery and corruption, tax evasion, sanctions and export control violations, money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing; 

&#8226; Strategic risk is the risk that the business will fail to identify, execute and react appropriately to opportunities and/or threats arising from changes in the market, some of which may emerge over a number of years such as changing economic and political circumstances, customer requirements, demographic trends, regulatory developments or competitor action; and 

&#8226; Model risk is the risk of inappropriate or incorrect business decisions arising from the use of models that have been inadequately designed, implemented or used, or from models that do not perform in line with expectations and predictions. 

In the course of our regular risk management activities, we use models to help quantify the risk we are taking. We believe that the assumptions used in these models are reasonable within the parameters for which the models have been built and calibrated to operate, but events may unfold differently than what is assumed in the models. Adjustments to model outputs to reflect consideration of management judgment are used with stringent governance in place to ensure appropriate results. Models are also monitored to confirm they are performing as intended. 

See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2023 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of the objectives of our risk management system as well as our risk management policies and practices. Other than the change to treasury risk management discussed below, there have been no material changes to our approach to risk management since December 31, 2023. 

Credit Risk Management Credit risk is managed through a robust risk identification and control framework which outlines clear and consistent policies, principles and guidance for risk managers. Credit risk is monitored using various internal risk management measures and within limits approved by individuals within a framework of delegated authorities. Our credit risk management procedures are designed for all stages of economic and financial cycles, including challenging periods of market volatility and economic uncertainty. During the first nine months of 2024, economic uncertainty remained due to elevated interest rates and the effects from higher inflation. We continue to monitor the performance of our material commercial loans as conditions evolve and take necessary credit actions where warranted. See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2023 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our approach to credit risk. 

Treasury Risk Management We continuously monitor our capital ratios and the impact of market events on our liquidity positions and will continue to adapt our frameworks as necessary to reflect market events and the evolving regulatory landscape and view as to best practices. In the first quarter of 2024, we began managing our non-trading value at risk ("VaR") exposure to a 10-day holding period as compared with the previous approach which was based on a one-day holding period. As a result, we have revised prior year amounts in the non-trading VaR table below in order to conform to the current year presentation. There 

HSBC USA Inc. 

have been no other material changes to our approach towards treasury risk management since December 31, 2023. See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2023 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our approach to treasury risk 

Capital risk See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in this MD&#38;A for a discussion of our approach to capital risk management, including our capital ratios and regulatory capital requirements. 

Liquidity and funding risk As part of our approach towards liquidity and funding risk management, we employ the measures discussed below to define, monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk in accordance with HSBC policy. 

HSBC North America is subject to the U.S. liquidity coverage ratio ("LCR") rule, which is designed to be a short-term liquidity measure to ensure banks have sufficient High Quality Liquid Assets ("HQLA") to cover net stressed cash outflows over the next 30 days, and both HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA calculate and report their LCR to U.S. regulators on a daily basis. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, HSBC Bank USA's LCR remained above 100 percent. Under the Tailoring Rules, a 70 percent LCR requirement applies to Category IV firms with weighted short-term wholesale funding that equals or exceeds $50 billion. As a result, a LCR of 100 percent or higher reflects an unencumbered HQLA balance that is equal to or exceeds 70 percent of a Category IV firm's liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario. HQLA consists of cash or assets that can be converted into cash at little or no loss of value in private markets. 

HSBC North America is also subject to the U.S. net stable funding ratio ("NSFR") rule, which is a longer term liquidity measure with a 12-month time horizon to ensure a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities, and both HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA calculate and report their NSFR to U.S. regulators. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, HSBC Bank USA's NSFR exceeded 100 percent. Under the Tailoring Rules, a 70 percent NSFR requirement applies to Category IV firms with weighted short-term wholesale funding that equals or exceeds $50 billion. As a result, a NSFR of 100 percent or more reflects an available stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next 12 months that is equal to or exceeds 70 percent of a Category IV firm's required amount of stable funding for assets and off-balance sheet exposures. In addition, under the United Kingdom ("U.K.") Prudential Regulatory Authority ("PRA") based NSFR rule, HSBC USA's NSFR exceeded 100 percent at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Under the U.K. PRA NSFR rule, a NSFR of 100 percent or more reflects an available stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next 12 months that is equal to or exceeds the required amount of stable funding for assets and off-balance sheet exposures. 

As a Category IV firm, HSBC North America is subject to liquidity stress testing and related liquidity buffer and liquidity risk management requirements. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA have liquidity profiles to support compliance with these rules and may need to make changes to their liquidity profiles to support compliance with any future rules. 

Our liquidity and funding risk management approach includes deposits, supplemented by wholesale borrowing to fund our balance sheet, and using security sales or secured borrowings for liquidity stress situations in our liquidity contingency plans. In addition, regulations require banks to retain a portfolio of HQLA. As such, we are maintaining a large portfolio of high quality sovereign and sovereign guaranteed securities. 

Our ability to regularly attract wholesale funds at a competitive cost is enhanced by strong ratings from the major credit rating agencies. The following table reflects the short and long-term credit ratings of HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA at September 30, 2024: 

&#160; &#160; 

Moody's S&#38;P Fitch HSBC USA: Short-term borrowings P-1 A-2 F1+ Long-term/senior debt A2 A- A+ HSBC Bank USA: Short-term borrowings P-1 A-1 F1+ Long-term/senior debt Aa3 A+ AA- 

Rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk management practices and legal matters, all of which could lead to adverse ratings actions. 

Although we closely monitor and strive to manage factors influencing our credit ratings, there is no assurance that our credit ratings will not change in the future. At September 30, 2024, none of the ratings on the debt of HSBC USA or HSBC Bank USA from any of the rating agencies were under review for potential downgrade. 

See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in this MD&#38;A for further discussion of our liquidity position, including additional information regarding our outstanding borrowings, the remaining availability of our debt issuance programs and our funding strategy. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Interest rate risk Various techniques are utilized to quantify and monitor risks associated with the repricing characteristics of our assets, liabilities and derivative contracts. See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2023 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our approach to interest rate risk. 

Economic value of equity ("EVE") EVE represents the present value of the banking book cash flows that could be provided to our equity holder under a managed run-off scenario. An EVE sensitivity represents the change in EVE due to a defined movement in interest rates. We manage to an immediate parallel upward shock of 200 basis points and an immediate parallel downward shock of 200 basis points to the market implied interest rates. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our EVE remained within risk limits for the up 200 and down 200 basis point interest rate shock scenarios. 

Earnings-at-risk Earnings-at-risk is a measure of interest rate risk in the banking book generated by our non-trading assets and liabilities that primarily includes loans, deposits with banks, investment securities, deposits, long-term debt and any associated interest rate hedges that are not held for trading intent or in order to hedge positions held with trading intent. Earnings-at-risk utilizes a number of interest rate scenarios to estimate the impact on projected banking book net interest income over a twelve month period, such as rate shock scenarios which assume immediate market rate movements by 100 basis points, as well as scenarios in which rates gradually rise or fall by 100 basis points. In the gradual scenarios, 25 percent of the interest rate movement occurs at the beginning of each quarter. The following table reflects the estimated impact of the earnings-at-risk scenarios on projected banking book net interest income: 

September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Amount % Amount % &#160; (dollars are in millions) Estimated increase (decrease) in projected banking book net interest income (reflects projected rate movements on October 1, 2024 and January 1, 2024, respectively): 

Resulting from a gradual 100 basis point increase in the yield curve $ (28) (1) % $ (17) (1) % Resulting from a gradual 100 basis point decrease in the yield curve 12 &#160; &#8212; &#160; (33) (1) Other significant scenarios monitored (reflects projected rate movements on October 1, 2024 and January 1, 2024, respectively): 

Resulting from an immediate 100 basis point increase in the yield curve (47) (2) (37) (1) Resulting from an immediate 100 basis point decrease in the yield curve 28 &#160; 1 &#160; (16) (1) 

The projections do not take into consideration possible complicating factors such as the effect of changes in interest rates on the credit quality, size and composition of the balance sheet. Therefore, although this provides a reasonable estimate of interest rate sensitivity, actual results will differ from these estimates, possibly by significant amounts. 

Non-trading VaR Non-trading VaR estimates potential valuation changes that could arise from market movements impacting the behavioralized interest rate risk of non-trading financial assets and liabilities held by the global businesses and transfer priced into and managed by Markets Treasury, and the associated hedging activity performed by Markets Treasury (including our investment portfolio of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities). Our investment portfolio holdings comprise mainly U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed and U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities. Our non-trading VaR exposure is driven by interest rates and mortgage-backed security spread volatility. Refer to "Market Risk Management" below for further discussion regarding VaR and the management of market risk in our non-trading portfolios.

Market Risk Management Exposure to market risk is separated into two portfolios: 

&#8226; Trading portfolios comprise positions held for client servicing and market-making, with the intention of short-term resale and/or to hedge risks resulting from such positions. 

&#8226; Non-trading portfolios comprise positions that primarily arise from the interest rate management of our retail and commercial banking assets and liabilities as well as financial investments classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity. 

We apply similar risk management policies and measurement techniques to both trading and non-trading portfolios. Our objective is to manage and control market risk exposures to optimize return on risk while maintaining a market profile consistent with our established risk appetite. See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2023 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our approach to market risk. 

Value at risk ("VaR") VaR is a technique for estimating potential losses on risk positions as a result of movements in market rates and prices over a specified time horizon and to a given level of confidence. The use of VaR is integrated into market risk management and calculated for all trading positions regardless of how we capitalize them. In addition, we calculate VaR for non-trading portfolios to have a complete picture of risk. VaR measures are calculated to a 99 percent confidence level and use a one-day holding period for trading VaR and a 10-day holding period for non-trading VaR. 

Trading VaR Trading VaR is generated principally from trading activities within the MSS segment of GBM. These primarily include positions in various products across rates, foreign exchange and credit asset classes. 

The following graph summarizes daily VaR for our trading portfolios at a 99 percent confidence level (in millions): 

The following table summarizes our trading VaR for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023:

(1) Portfolio diversification is the market risk dispersion effect of holding a portfolio containing different risk types. It represents the reduction in unsystematic market risk that occurs when combining a number of different risk types, for example, foreign exchange, interest rate and credit spread, together in one portfolio. It is measured as the difference between the sum of the VaR by individual risk type and the combined total VaR. A negative number represents the benefit of portfolio diversification. As the maximum and minimum occur on different days for different risk types, it is not meaningful to calculate a portfolio diversification benefit for these measures. 

(2) The total VaR is non-additive across risk types due to diversification effects. For presentation purposes, portfolio diversification of the VaR for trading portfolios includes VaR-based risk-not-in-VaR. 

Refer to "Treasury Risk Management" above for disclosure of our non-trading VaR. 

Back-testing We routinely validate the accuracy of our VaR models by back-testing them against hypothetical profit and loss that excludes non-modeled items such as fees, commissions and revenues of intra-day transactions from the actual reported profit and loss. We would expect, under stable market conditions, to experience two or three losses in excess of VaR at the 99 

HSBC USA Inc. 

percent confidence level over a one-year period. However, in periods of unstable market conditions, we could see an increase in the number of back-testing exceptions. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we experienced one loss back-testing exception in the third quarter due primarily to increased market volatility in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.

CONSOLIDATED AVERAGE BALANCES AND INTEREST RATES 

The following table summarizes the quarter-to-date and year-to-date average daily balances of the principal components of assets, liabilities and equity together with their respective interest amounts and rates earned or paid. Net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by the average interest earning assets from which interest income is earned. Loan interest for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, included fees of $7 million and $21 million, respectively, compared with fees of $7 million and $20 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.
