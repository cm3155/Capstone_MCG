HSBC USA Inc. 

Executive Overview 

HSBC USA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC North America, which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC. HUSI may also be referred to in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&#38;A") as "we," "us" or "our." 

Economic Environment &#160; The U.S. economy continued its recovery during the first half of 2021 after contracting sharply in 2020 driven by the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in disruption to business and economic activity as well as to the capital markets. COVID-19's effects in the U.S. and globally have been extreme, and the duration of the pandemic and its ultimate repercussions continue to remain unclear. Unprecedented government economic intervention, including additional government support enacted during the first quarter of 2021, has likely dampened the pandemic's effects, but at uncertain long-term cost. However, these government support measures combined with accelerated progress on vaccinations along with the easing and recent removal of restrictions by many states as new infections continue to drop significantly, have helped speed the economic recovery along considerably while also contributing to higher inflation. U.S. Gross Domestic Product ("GDP") grew at an estimated annual rate of 6.5 percent in the second quarter of 2021, while the U.S. economy added over 800 thousand jobs during the first half of 2021 and the total unemployment rate fell to 5.9 percent at June 2021 as compared with 6.7 percent at December 2020. In June 2021, the FRB decided to hold short-term interest rates steady (at near zero) and indicated it expects short-term rates to remain low for some time, but also signaled it may increase short-term rates sooner than previously anticipated as the economy continues to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and market expectations for inflation remain uncertain. 

Although the U.S. economy continued to improve in the first half of 2021, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the emergence of new variants, on economic conditions both in the United States and abroad continues to create global uncertainty about the future economic environment, including the pace and extent of an economic recovery. Concerns over interest rate levels, energy prices, domestic and global policy issues, including civil unrest in the U.S., trade policy in the U.S. and geopolitical events as well as the implications of those events on the markets in general further add to this global uncertainty. Interest rate levels and energy prices, in combination with global economic conditions, fiscal and monetary policy and the level of regulatory and government scrutiny of financial institutions will continue to impact our results in 2021 and beyond. 

Performance, Developments and Trends As mentioned above, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted global financial markets, negatively affected supply and demand across a broad range of industries and caused disruption to our customers, vendors and employees. This pandemic has had a significant impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Despite the improvement in economic conditions during the first half of 2021 as discussed above, the circumstances around this pandemic will continue to impact our business in future periods. The extent of such impact will depend on the outcome of certain developments, including but not limited to, the duration of the pandemic as well as its continuing impact on our customers, vendors and employees, all of which are uncertain. See Part II, Item 1A, "Risk Factors - Risks related to the impact of COVID-19," in our 2020 Form 10-K for further discussion. 

We continue to progress our strategic plan to restructure our operations ("Restructuring Plan") as discussed further in Note 2, "Strategic Initiatives," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We remain committed to our multi-year strategic plan to re-profile our business. 

We previously disclosed that as part of our Restructuring Plan, we were continuing to explore strategic options with respect to our retail operations. In May 2021, we announced that we would take further actions to strategically reposition our Wealth and Personal Banking business to focus on the banking and wealth management needs of globally-connected affluent and high net worth clients through our Premier, Jade and Private Banking propositions. We will exit our mass market retail banking business, including our Personal and Advance propositions as well as retail business banking, and will rebrand approximately 20-25 of our retail branches into international wealth centers to serve our Premier and Jade customers. In conjunction with the execution of this strategy, we have entered into definitive sale agreements with third parties to sell approximately 90 of our retail branches along with substantially all residential mortgage, unsecured and retail business banking loans and all deposits in our branch network not associated with our Premier, Jade and Private Banking customers. Certain assets under management associated with our mass market retail banking business which are managed by an affiliate will also be transferred. The remaining branches not sold or rebranded will be closed. As a result of entering into these sale agreements, assets and liabilities with an aggregate carrying value of approximately $2.9 billion and $10.1 billion, respectively, were transferred to held for sale during the second quarter of 2021. Although the disposal group will be sold in multiple transactions that are expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2022, the actual time to complete these sales depends on many factors, including regulatory approval. In addition, mass market retail banking loans that will not be purchased in the transaction described above, including our remaining retail credit card portfolio, which collectively totaled $1.1 billion, were also transferred to held for sale during the second quarter of 2021 as we currently do not intend to hold these loans for the foreseeable future. See Note 3, "Branch Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.

(3) Prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the current period presentation. See Note 17, "Retained Earnings and Regulatory Capital Requirements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 

(4) Includes $9.9 billion of deposits held for sale at June 30, 2021. 

Net income (loss) was income of $193 million and $532 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared with income of $7 million and a loss of $1,276 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively. Income (loss) before income tax was income of $254 million and $714 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared with income of $56 million and a loss of $1,384 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively. The increase in income (loss) before income tax during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 was due primarily to a lower provision for credit losses driven by improved economic conditions and the impact of our decision to exit our mass market retail banking business as well as our remaining credit card portfolio which resulted in a release of credit loss reserves and a reduction to the provision for credit losses of approximately $101 million during the second quarter of 2021. Also contributing to the increase in the year-to-date period was lower operating expenses driven by the non-recurrence of a $784 million goodwill impairment charge recorded during the first quarter of 2020. The increases in both periods were partially offset by lower other revenues driven by lower trading revenue. 

Our reported results in all periods were impacted by certain items management believes to be significant, which affect comparability between periods. Significant items are excluded to arrive at adjusted performance because management would ordinarily identify and consider them separately to better understand underlying business trends. The following table summarizes the impact of these significant items for all periods presented: 

Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 &#160; (in millions) Income (loss) before income tax, as reported $ 254 &#160; $ 56 $ 714 &#160; $ (1,384) Goodwill impairment &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#160; 784

Adjusted performance (2) 

$ 383 &#160; $ 105 $ 868 &#160; $ (449) 

(1) Reflects costs related to the delivery of our Restructuring Plan. Costs to achieve primarily consists of lease impairment and other related costs, severance costs, allocated costs from HSBC Technology &#38; Services ("HTSU"), and trading losses associated with the exit of certain derivative contracts. See Note 2, "Strategic Initiatives," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of these costs. The expense during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 also includes $11 million and $18 million, respectively, of allocated costs from other HSBC affiliates related to the HSBC Group's restructuring activities. The expense during the six months ended June 30, 2020 also includes a $9 million gain on the sale of one of our owned retail branch properties. 

(2) Represents a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure. 

Excluding the impact of the items in the table above, our adjusted performance during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, increased $278 million and $1,317 million compared with the prior year periods due primarily to a lower provision for credit losses driven by improved economic conditions and the impact of our decision to exit our mass market retail banking business as well as our remaining credit card portfolio which resulted in a release in credit loss reserves during the second quarter of 2021 as discussed above. Also contributing to the increase in the year-to-date period was lower operating expenses. The increases in both periods were partially offset by lower other revenues driven by lower trading revenue. 

See "Results of Operations" for a more detailed discussion of our operating trends. In addition, see "Balance Sheet Review" for further discussion on our asset and liability trends, "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for further discussion on funding and capital and "Credit Quality" for additional discussion on our credit trends. 

London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") Transition Regulators and central banks in various national jurisdictions continue to actively work to help transition from interbank offered rates ("IBORs") to acceptable alternative rates, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") recommended by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee convened by the FRB. We have a considerable number of contracts referencing IBORs, primarily U.S. dollar ("USD") LIBOR, such as loans, derivatives and long-term debt. 

In March 2021, the United Kingdom ("U.K.") Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA") confirmed that all LIBOR tenors will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after December 31, 2021, in the case of the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR tenors, and immediately after June 30, 2023, in the case of the remaining overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and twelve-month USD LIBOR tenors. The extension of certain USD LIBOR tenors until June 2023 will allow many legacy LIBOR-based contracts to mature naturally and significantly aids in reducing the risks associated with transitioning legacy contracts onto replacement rates. Separately, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association ("ISDA") has confirmed that the fallback spread adjustments to be used in its ISDA fallbacks have been fixed as of the date of the FCA announcement. As a result, the ISDA fallbacks (i.e. to the adjusted risk-free rate plus the fixed spread 

HSBC USA Inc. 

adjustment) will automatically occur for outstanding derivative contracts that incorporate the ISDA fallback language or adhere to the ISDA fallback protocol generally when each LIBOR tenor ceases or becomes non-representative. For all outstanding derivatives referenced to USD LIBOR tenors, the ISDA fallback will occur at the first reset subsequent to June 30, 2023. These announcements provide clarity on the future terms of the many derivative contracts which now incorporate the ISDA fallbacks. In addition, during the first half of 2021, central clearing counterparties amended their rules to incorporate the new ISDA fallback language and adhere to the ISDA fallback protocol for cleared derivative contracts. 

We continue to actively participate in HSBC's global transition program with the objective of facilitating an orderly transition of all products, processes, models and curves, as well as all legacy LIBOR-based contracts, onto replacement rates. In particular, during the first half of 2021, we: 

&#8226; implemented the capabilities for SOFR-based derivatives in our Markets Treasury function and to offer SOFR-based bilateral loans in our Commercial Banking business; 

&#8226; continued to reduce our LIBOR derivative exposures through the exit or transfer of certain derivative contracts as part of our Restructuring Plan; and 

&#8226; started to engage our clients to provide alternative products and determine their ability and readiness to transition. 

The current focus of our client transition efforts is on those contracts that will be impacted by tenors ceasing or becoming non-representative immediately after December 31, 2021. Such contracts outstanding at June 30, 2021 included contracts for non-derivative financial assets with a carrying value of approximately $746 million, primarily consisting of certain non-USD LIBOR-based commercial loans, and contracts for non-USD LIBOR-based derivatives with a notional value of approximately $2.8 billion. Such contracts for non-derivative financial liabilities were immaterial at June 30, 2021. The ability of HUSI and its clients to transition legacy contracts onto replacement rates is dependent on the availability and market liquidity of products that reference replacement rates, including SOFR, and on our clients being ready and able to adapt their own processes and systems to accommodate the replacement products. We continue to engage with industry participants, the official sector and our clients to support an orderly transition and the mitigation of the risks resulting from the transition. For further discussion of our LIBOR transition program and the associated risks, see "Executive Overview" in MD&#38;A in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Other COVID-19 Related Developments 

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted economic activity in many countries, including the United States, and the U.S. Government has taken multiple actions to mitigate the magnitude and persistence of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The United States has been operating under a presidentially declared national emergency since March 2020. In March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act") was signed into law, which provided financial assistance for businesses and individuals and targeted regulatory relief for financial institutions. In December 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act was signed into law, which extended many of the CARES Act programs and provided additional financial assistance for businesses and individuals. 

Loan Forbearance Initiatives The CARES Act created a forbearance program for federally-backed mortgage loans and provided financial institutions with the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under U.S. GAAP related to troubled debt restructurings ("TDR Loans") beginning March 1, 2020. This TDR Loan guidance can be applied until the earlier of January 1, 2022 or 60 days following the termination of the presidentially declared national emergency. We elected to adopt the TDR Loan guidance in the CARES Act and are not applying TDR Loan classification to COVID-19 related loan modifications in the form of a long-term payment deferral (for commercial loans all payment modifications, including all payment deferrals) granted to borrowers that were current (less than 30 days past due) as of December 31, 2019 which otherwise may have been reported as TDR Loans. The CARES Act also prohibited servicers of federally-backed mortgage loans from initiating any foreclosure action on any residential property that is not vacant or abandoned for a period of 60 days. This moratorium expired on July 31, 2021. In addition to these federal measures, some state governments have taken action to require forbearance with respect to certain loans and fees. We are continuing to monitor federal, state and international regulatory developments in relation to COVID-19 and their potential impact on our operations. 

In 2020, federal banking regulators issued a revised interagency statement on loan modifications and the reporting for financial institutions working with customers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic ("Interagency Statement"). The Interagency Statement confirmed that COVID-19 related short-term loan modifications (e.g., payment deferrals of six months or less) provided to borrowers that were current (less than 30 days past due) at the time the relief was granted are not TDR Loans. Borrowers that do not meet the criteria in the CARES Act or the Interagency Statement are assessed for TDR Loan classification in accordance with our accounting policies. Through June 30, 2021, these loans were not significant. 

In addition, under the Interagency Statement, for COVID-19 related loan modifications in the form of a payment deferral, the borrower&#8217;s past due status will not be affected during the deferral period and, if the loan was accruing at the time the relief was granted, the loan will generally not be placed on nonaccrual status as long as the borrower utilizes a payment deferral of six months or less. For consumer mortgage loans, when a borrower utilizes a payment deferral of more than six months, the loan 

HSBC USA Inc. 

will generally be placed on nonaccrual status and, if the loan does not meet the criteria in the CARES Act, assessed for TDR Loan classification. Any accrued interest recorded on these loans is generally not reversed against income and will remain recorded as accrued interest receivable. We have not modified our commercial loan nonaccrual policies as a result of this guidance. 

We have implemented various loan modification payment deferral programs to provide borrowers relief from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The following table summarizes information about loans under these programs as of June 30, 2021. Not included in the following table are loans that have exited the programs or have been transferred to held for sale as well as other forms of relief that we have provided to commercial clients affected by the impact of COVID-19, such as covenant waivers and amendments, and deferrals of financial statement and covenant compliance reporting requirements.

(2) Total number of commercial loans is less than 20. 

(3) Includes $446 million of consumer mortgage loans where the borrowers were provided with extended payment deferral relief of more than six months at June 30, 2021. Due to our CARES Act election, $424 million of these loans were exempted from TDR assessment. In addition, $384 million of these loans have been placed on nonaccrual status, because the borrowers utilized a payment deferral of more than six months. 

(4) Not included in the table at June 30, 2021 are $139 million of consumer loans under COVID-19 payment deferral programs which were transferred to held for sale during the second quarter of 2021 as part of our decision to exit our mass market retail banking business as well as our remaining retail credit card portfolio. 

When the payment relief period ends, borrowers have various options, including repaying the deferred payments in full, repaying the deferred payments over an installment period or moving the deferred payments to the end of the loan. If a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty when the payment relief period ends, they may enter into a modification program to reduce the interest rate and extend the term of the loan which would result in the loan being classified as a TDR Loan. As of June 30, 2021, $905 million and $1,035 million of commercial and consumer loans, respectively, have exited a COVID-19 related payment deferral program, of which nil and $33 million, respectively, entered into a modification program upon exiting that resulted in the loans being classified as TDR Loans. Of the commercial and consumer loans that have exited a COVID-19 related payment deferral program, 100 percent and 81 percent, respectively, were current or less than 30 days past due as of June 30, 2021. 

Paycheck Protection Program The CARES Act created a new loan guarantee program entitled the Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP") targeted to provide small businesses with support to cover payroll and certain other expenses. Loans made under the PPP are fully guaranteed by the Small Business Administration ("SBA"), whose guarantee is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. PPP covered loans also afford borrowers forgiveness up to the principal amount of the PPP covered loan, plus accrued interest, if the loan proceeds are used to retain workers and maintain payroll or to make certain mortgage interest, lease and utility payments, and certain other criteria are satisfied. The SBA will reimburse PPP lenders for any amount of a PPP covered loan that is forgiven, and PPP lenders will not be held liable for any representations made by PPP borrowers in connection with their requests for loan forgiveness. Lenders receive pre-determined fees for processing and servicing PPP loans. In addition, PPP loans are risk-weighted at zero percent under the generally-applicable Standardized 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Approach used to calculate risk-weighted assets for regulatory capital purposes. HSBC Bank USA is a PPP participating lender and had loans funded under the PPP which totaled $819 million at June 30, 2021. The SBA deadline for accepting PPP loan applications from participating lenders expired on May 31, 2021. 

Basis of Reporting 

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"). 

Group Reporting Basis We report financial information to HSBC in accordance with HSBC Group accounting and reporting policies, which apply International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRSs") as issued by the IASB. As a result, our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the basis of HSBC Group's accounting and reporting policies ("Group Reporting Basis"). Because operating results on the Group Reporting Basis are used in managing our businesses and rewarding performance of employees, our management also separately monitors profit before tax under this basis of reporting. The following table reconciles our U.S. GAAP versus Group Reporting Basis profit before tax: 

Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 &#160; (in millions) Profit (loss) before tax &#8211; U.S. GAAP basis $ 254 &#160; $ 56 $ 714 &#160; $ (1,384) Adjustments: Expected credit losses (49) (17) (188) 330 Loans held for sale (96) &#8212; (104) &#8212; Loan origination (5) 5 (6) 9 Pension and other postretirement benefit costs (1) (5) (5) (10) Precious metal loans &#8212; &#160; 9 2 &#160; 9 Leases 2 &#160; (11) 5 &#160; (9) Renewable energy tax credit investments 5 &#160; 5 9 &#160; 7 Other long-lived assets 29 &#160; &#8212; 39 &#160; &#8212; Goodwill impairment &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#160; 91 Other 3 &#160; 5 1 &#160; 6 Profit (loss) before tax &#8211; Group Reporting Basis $ 142 &#160; $ 47 $ 467 &#160; $ (951) 

The significant differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis as they impact our results are summarized in Note 24, "Business Segments," in the our 2020 Form 10-K. There have been no significant changes since December 31, 2020 in the differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis impacting our results. Differences in reported profit before tax in the table above that were individually significant for the periods presented are explained below. 

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, expected credit losses were lower under U.S. GAAP than under the Group Reporting Basis. Under the Group Reporting Basis, a majority of our loans are considered to be in "stage 1" (which requires a 12-month expected credit losses estimate), while under U.S. GAAP such loans require a lifetime expected credit losses ("lifetime ECL") estimate. Primarily as a result of the different requirements, releases in credit reserves driven by improved economic conditions, which resulted in improved economic forecasts used to calculate expected credit losses as well as client paydowns, were more pronounced under U.S. GAAP. 

During the six months ended June 30, 2020, expected credit losses were higher under U.S. GAAP than under the Group Reporting Basis. Primarily as a result of the different requirements related to stage 1 loans discussed above, loss provisions driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts used to calculate expected credit losses, downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and loan growth as clients drew on their available lines of credit, were more pronounced under U.S. GAAP. 

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, we transferred certain loans to held for sale which under U.S. GAAP require the loans to be carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value which resulted in a release of credit loss reserves on the loans. Under the Group Reporting Basis, loans held for sale continue to be accounted for and credit losses continue to be measured in accordance with IFRS 9, "Financial Instruments," with any gain or loss recorded at the time of sale. In addition, a portion of the loans transferred under U.S. GAAP did not meet the more stringent criteria for held for sale classification under the Group Reporting Basis. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, amortization expense for long-lived assets was higher under U.S. GAAP. During the third quarter of 2020, we recorded an impairment charge under the Group Reporting Basis related to the write-off of all the capitalized software and a portion of the leasehold improvements primarily associated with our Wealth and Personal Banking business segment, while under U.S. GAAP, no impairment charge was required. Consequently, the carrying amounts for capitalized software and leasehold improvements are higher under U.S. GAAP than under the Group Reporting Basis and, as a result, corresponding amortization expense is higher under U.S. GAAP. In addition, during the second quarter of 2021, we determined we would exit certain branches as part of our Restructuring Plan and, as a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $18 million under U.S. GAAP to write-off the leasehold improvements associated with these branches. These leasehold improvements were previously written-off under the Group Reporting Basis as discussed above. 

During the six months ended June 30, 2020, goodwill impairment charges were lower under the Group Reporting Basis than under U.S.GAAP. Under the Group Reporting Basis, goodwill was amortized until 2005, however goodwill was amortized under U.S. GAAP until 2002, which resulted in a lower carrying amount of goodwill and, therefore, a lower impairment charge under the Group Reporting Basis. 

Balance Sheet Review 

The following table provides balance sheet totals at June 30, 2021 and increases (decreases) since December 31, 2020:

* Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. 

Short-Term Investments Short-term investments include cash and due from banks, interest bearing deposits with banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell. Balances may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our liquidity position at the time and our strategy for deploying liquidity. Short-term investments increased compared with December 31, 2020 due to an increase in overall liquidity as we raised funds in advance of their usage. The increase in funds was driven primarily by net sales, paydowns and maturities of securities. Also contributing to the increase were lower loans and higher deposits as discussed in detail below. These increases were partially offset by repayments of precious metal trading liabilities, short-term borrowings and long-term debt.

(3) See "Credit Quality" in this MD&#38;A for a discussion of trends in our allowance for credit losses on loans. 

Commercial loans decreased compared with December 31, 2020 due primarily to the impact of our efforts to improve returns through disciplined lending, paydowns and lower demand from clients reflecting increased capital markets activity. Also contributing to the decrease was the transfer of our retail business banking loan portfolio with a carrying value of $149 million to held for sale during the second quarter of 2021 as discussed below. These decreases were partially offset by higher loans to affiliates. The decline in commercial non-affiliate loans was primarily in the energy, real estate, diversified financial, semiconductor and banking industries. 

Consumer loans decreased compared with December 31, 2020 due primarily to the transfer of certain consumer loans with a carrying value of $3,616 million to held for sale during the second quarter of 2021 as discussed below. 

The following table presents loan-to-value ("LTV") ratios for our residential mortgage loan portfolio, excluding mortgage loans held for sale:

(1) LTVs for first liens are calculated using the loan balance as of the reporting date. LTVs for second liens are calculated using the loan balance as of the reporting date plus the senior lien amount at origination. Current estimated property values are derived from the property's appraised value at the time of loan origination updated by the change in the Federal Housing Finance Agency's House Price Index ("HPI") at either a Core Based Statistical Area or state level. The estimated value of the homes could differ from actual fair values due to changes in condition of the underlying property, variations in housing price changes within metropolitan statistical areas and other factors. As a result, actual property values associated with loans that end in foreclosure may be significantly lower than the estimates used for purposes of this disclosure. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

(2) Current estimated property values are calculated using the most current HPIs available and applied on an individual loan basis, which results in an approximate three month delay in the production of reportable statistics. Therefore, the information in the table above reflects current estimated property values using HPIs at March 31, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively.

* Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. 

Commercial loans held for sale increased compared with December 31, 2020. During the second quarter of 2021, as part of our Restructuring Plan we made the decision to exit our mass market retail banking business. See Note 3, "Branch Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. As a result, we transferred our retail business banking loan portfolio to held for sale with a carrying value of $149 million. 

Also included in commercial loans held for sale are certain loans that we have elected to designate under the fair value option which consists of loans that we originate in connection with our participation in a number of syndicated credit facilities with the intent of selling them to unaffiliated third parties as well as loans that we purchase from the secondary market and hold as hedges against our exposure to certain total return swaps. The fair value of these loans totaled $215 million and $36 million at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Balances will fluctuate from period to period depending on the volume and level of activity. 

In addition, commercial loans held for sale includes certain other loans that we no longer intend to hold for investment and were transferred to held for sale which totaled $61 million and $93 million at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

Consumer loans held for sale increased compared with December 31, 2020. As discussed above, during the second quarter of 2021, as part of our Restructuring Plan we made the decision to exit our mass market retail banking business as well as our remaining retail credit card portfolio. As a result, we transferred certain consumer loans to held for sale, including loans related to the branch disposal group, which collectively totaled $3,616 million, including $2,364 million of residential mortgages, $265 million of home equity mortgages, $829 million of credit cards and $158 million of other consumer loans. 

Also included in residential mortgage loans held for sale are agency-eligible residential mortgage loans which are originated and held for sale to third parties, currently on a servicing retained basis. Balances will fluctuate from period to period depending on the volume and level of activity. Gains and losses from the sale of these residential mortgage loans are reflected as a component of other income (loss) in the accompanying consolidated statement of income (loss). 

Excluding the commercial loans designated under fair value option discussed above, loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value, with adjustments to fair value being recorded as a valuation allowance through other revenues. The valuation allowance on consumer loans held for sale was nil at both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The valuation allowance on commercial loans held for sale was $5 million and $1 million at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

Trading Assets and Liabilities The following table summarizes trading assets and liabilities at June 30, 2021 and increases (decreases) since December 31, 2020: 

&#160; &#160; Increase (Decrease) From &#160; &#160; December 31, 2020

(1) See Note 4, "Trading Assets and Liabilities," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a breakout of trading securities by category. 

Trading securities balances were lower compared with December 31, 2020 due to decreases in foreign sovereign and U.S. Treasury positions, partially offset by an increase in equity positions. Trading security positions are held as economic hedges of interest rate, credit and equity derivative products issued to clients of domestic and emerging markets. Balances of securities sold, not yet purchased were higher compared with December 31, 2020 driven by an increase in short U.S. Treasury positions related to economic hedges of derivatives in the interest rate trading portfolio. 

Precious metals trading assets increased compared with December 31, 2020 due primarily to increases in our own gold and palladium inventory position. Payables for precious metals were lower compared with December 31, 2020 reflecting a decrease in borrowing of gold inventory to support client activity levels. Precious metal positions may not represent our net underlying exposure as we may use derivatives contracts to reduce our risk associated with these positions, the fair value of which would appear in derivatives in the table above. 

Derivative asset and liability balances both decreased compared with December 31, 2020 mainly from market movements and reduced positions driven by the exit or transfer of certain derivative contracts as part of our Restructuring Plan which resulted in lower valuations of foreign exchange, interest rate, equity, commodity and credit derivatives. 

Securities Securities include securities available-for-sale and securities held-to-maturity, net. Securities balances were lower compared with December 31, 2020 driven by net sales, paydowns and maturities as part of our continuing strategy to maximize returns while balancing the securities portfolio for risk management purposes as well as unfavorable market valuations due to increasing yields. The decline in securities balances was primarily in U.S. Treasury, foreign sovereign and U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed securities which was partially offset by net purchases of U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities. 

All Other Assets &#160; All other assets includes, among other items, properties and equipment, net, goodwill and other branch related assets held for sale. All other assets were relatively flat compared with December 31, 2020 as higher outstanding settlement balances related to security sales were largely offset by lower cash collateral posted, lower lease assets and lower investments in Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") stock. 

During the third quarter of 2020, we completed a quantitative impairment test of goodwill and determined that the fair value of our Commercial Banking reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, with its fair value being approximately 110 percent of book value, including allocated goodwill. Our fair value calculations are highly sensitive to certain assumptions and estimates used. We will continue to monitor changes to our business forecasts as we continue to perform periodic analyses of the risks and strategies of our business and product offerings. If deterioration in economic and credit conditions, a change in the strategy or performance of our business or product offerings, or an increase in the capital requirements of our business occurs, interim goodwill impairment tests could again be required, which may result in an impairment charge.

(2) Core deposits, as calculated in accordance with Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council ("FFIEC") guidelines, generally include all domestic demand, money market and other savings accounts, as well as time deposits with balances not exceeding $250,000. Balance at June 30, 2021 excludes deposits held for sale. 

Total deposits increased compared with December 31, 2020 as our commercial clients increased their demand and savings deposits in response to the economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, improved economic conditions and the actions taken by the U.S. Government to provide financial support to businesses. The increase was partially offset by declines in time deposits and deposits from affiliates. A shift in mix of deposits from affiliates resulted in a decline in deposits from non-bank affiliates, partially offset by an increase in deposits from bank affiliates. 

Short-Term Borrowings Short-term borrowings decreased compared with December 31, 2020 reflecting a decline in securities sold under repurchase agreements. 

Long-Term Debt Long-term debt decreased compared with December 31, 2020 as the impact of debt issuances, including $3,500 million of senior debt issued to HSBC North America during the first half of 2021, was more than offset by debt retirements. Debt issuances during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 totaled $3,029 million and $5,317 million, respectively, of which $113 million and $195 million, respectively, was issued by HSBC Bank USA. 

Incremental issuances from our shelf registration statement with the SEC totaled $1,622 million of senior structured notes during the six months ended June 30, 2021. Total long-term debt outstanding under this shelf was $8,082 million and $9,138 million at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

Incremental issuances from the HSBC Bank USA Global Bank Note Program totaled $195 million during the six months ended June 30, 2021. Total debt outstanding under this program was $1,724 million and $1,888 million at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

Borrowings from the FHLB totaled $2,000 million and $4,250 million at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

Interest, Taxes and Other Liabilities Interest, taxes and other liabilities includes, among other items, other branch related liabilities held for sale. Interest, taxes and other liabilities increased compared with December 31, 2020 due primarily to higher outstanding settlement balances related to security purchases, partially offset by lower lease liabilities and a lower liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures.

Results of Operations 

Net Interest Income Net interest income is the total interest income on earning assets less the total interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds. An analysis of consolidated average balances and interest rates is presented in this MD&#38;A under the caption "Consolidated Average Balances and Interest Rates."

(1) Represents the benefit associated with interest earning assets in excess of interest bearing liabilities. Increased percentages reflect growth in this excess or a higher cost of interest bearing liabilities, while decreased percentages reflect a reduction in this excess or a lower cost of interest bearing liabilities. 

Net interest income decreased during the three months ended June 30, 2021 due primarily to lower interest income from interest earning assets driven by the unfavorable impact of lower average interest earning asset balances, primarily commercial loans and securities, as well as lower yields on securities, loans and short-term investments. The decrease in the three-month period was partially offset by lower interest expense from interest bearing liabilities driven by lower rates paid and the favorable impact of lower average interest bearing liability balances. In the year-to-date period, net interest income increased due primarily to lower interest expense from interest bearing liabilities driven by lower rates paid and the favorable impact of lower average interest bearing liability balances, primarily long-term debt and short-term borrowings. The increase in the year-to-date period was partially offset by lower interest income from interest earning assets driven by lower yields on short-term investments, loans and securities as well as the unfavorable impact of lower average interest earning asset balances, primarily commercial loans and securities. 

Short-term investments Interest income decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 due to lower yields earned on these balances reflecting the impact of lower market rates, partially offset by higher average balances. 

Trading securities Interest income increased during the three months ended June 30, 2021 due primarily to higher average balances driven by an increase in equity positions, partially offset by declines in U.S. Treasury, foreign sovereign and corporate bond positions. In the year-to-date period, interest income decreased due to lower yields reflecting the impact of lower market rates as well as lower average balances driven by declines in U.S. Treasury, foreign sovereign and corporate bond positions, partially offset by an increase in equity positions. Interest income associated with trading securities was partially offset within trading revenue by the performance of the associated derivatives as discussed further below. 

Securities Lower interest income during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 was due to lower yields reflecting the impact of lower market rates and lower average balances. Lower average balances were driven by declines in U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed, U.S. Treasury and foreign sovereign securities, partially offset by an increase in U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Commercial loans Interest income was lower during the three months ended June 30, 2021 due primarily to lower average balances. In the year-to-date period, interest income was lower due to lower average balances and lower yields reflecting the impact of lower market rates on variable rate loans. Lower average balances in both the three-month and year-to-date periods were driven primarily by the impact of our efforts to improve returns through disciplined lending, paydowns and lower demand from clients reflecting increased capital markets activity as well as lower loans to affiliates. 

Consumer loans Lower interest income during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 was due primarily to lower yields reflecting the impact of lower market rates on residential mortgage and, in the year-to-date period, home equity mortgage loans. 

Other Interest income was relatively flat during the three months ended June 30, 2021. In the year-to-date period, interest income decreased due primarily to lower average cash collateral balances. 

Deposits Interest expense decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 due primarily to lower rates paid reflecting the impact of lower market rates. While average balances were lower and contributed to the decrease in the three-month period, they were higher and partially offset the decrease in the year-to-date period. In the three month period, lower average balances were driven by declines in time deposits and deposits from affiliates which were partially offset by growth in savings and demand deposits as our customers increased their deposits in response to the economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken by the U.S. Government to provide financial support to households and businesses. In the year-to-date period, average balances were higher as declines in time deposits and deposits from affiliates were more than offset by growth in savings and demand deposits as our customers increased their deposits in response to the economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken by the U.S. Government to provide financial support to households and businesses. 

Short-term borrowings Lower interest expense during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 was due to lower rates paid reflecting the impact of lower market rates and lower average borrowings driven by a decline in securities sold under repurchase agreements. 

Long-term debt Interest expense decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 due to lower rates paid reflecting the impact of lower market rates on variable rate borrowings and lower average borrowings. 

Tax liabilities and other Interest expense was relatively flat during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021. 

Provision for Credit Losses &#160; The following table summarizes the components of the provision for credit losses:

* Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. 

Our provision for credit losses decreased $448 million and $1,401 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, due to a lower provision for credit losses on both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios. While the provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures was higher in the three-month period, it was lower in the year-to-date period. 

The provision for credit losses on our commercial loan portfolio decreased $416 million and $934 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, reflecting releases in credit loss reserves compared with loss provisions in the prior year periods. The releases in credit reserves in the current year periods were driven by improved economic conditions which resulted in improved economic forecasts used for calculating lifetime ECL and improvements in credit conditions associated with certain clients as well as declines in credit reserves for risk factors associated with higher risk client exposures and, in the year-to-date period, economic uncertainty. Client paydowns and loan sales also contributed to the releases in credit reserves in the current year periods. In the prior year periods, the loss provisions were driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts used for calculating lifetime ECL, downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and provisions for risk factors associated with large loan exposures. While a loss provision associated with loan growth as clients drew on their available lines of credit contributed to the loss provision in the 2020 year-to-date period, a significant portion of the commercial lines of credit that were drawn in March 2020 were repaid during the second quarter of 2020 resulting in a release of credit loss reserves. 

The provision for credit losses on our consumer loan portfolio decreased $122 million and $261 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, reflecting releases in credit loss reserves compared with loss provisions in the prior year periods. The releases in credit reserves in the current year periods were driven by the impact of our decision to exit our mass market retail banking business as well as our remaining credit card portfolio which resulted in a release of credit loss reserves and a reduction to the provision for credit losses of approximately $100 million during the second quarter of 2021. Also contributing to the releases in credit reserves in the current year periods were improved economic conditions which resulted in improved economic forecasts used for calculating lifetime ECL and declines in credit reserves for risk factors primarily associated with economic uncertainty and forbearance accounts. In the prior year periods, the loss provisions were driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts used for calculating lifetime ECL as well as higher dollars of delinquency and, to a lesser extent, growth in personal loan balances due to new product promotions. While loss provisions were recorded for credit cards in the prior year periods, the provision in the second quarter of 2020 was not as significant due to lower customer spending and a decline in credit card balances. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

The provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures increased $91 million during the three months ended June 30, 2021 reflecting lower releases in credit loss reserves. The release in credit loss reserves in the prior year period resulted from lower outstanding exposure and a lower estimate of expected future draws, which more than offset the impact of the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic consistent with commercial loans as discussed above. In the current year period, the release in credit loss reserves resulted from the improved economic conditions consistent with commercial loans as discussed above. In the year-to-date period, the provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures decreased $204 million reflecting a release in credit loss reserves compared with a loss provision in the prior year-to-date period. The release in credit reserves in the current year-to-date period resulted from the improved economic conditions consistent with commercial loans as discussed above. In the prior year-to-date period, the loss provision resulted from the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic consistent with commercial loans as discussed above, partially offset by the impact of lower outstanding exposure. 

See "Credit Quality" in this MD&#38;A for additional discussion on the allowance for credit losses associated with our various loan portfolios.

* Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. 

Credit card fees, net Credit card fees, net increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 due to higher interchange fees driven by higher customer spending reflecting improved economic conditions compared with the prior year periods, partially offset by higher cost estimates associated with our credit rewards program. 

Trust and investment management fees Trust and investment management fees declined during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 reflecting a shift in mix to products with lower management fees. 

Other fees and commissions Other fees and commissions increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 due primarily to higher fees from loan syndication, wire transfers and other account services reflecting improved economic conditions compared with the prior year periods. See Note 14, "Fee Income from Contracts with Customers," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information including a summary of the components of other fees and commissions. 

Trading revenue Trading revenue is generated by participation in the foreign exchange, precious metals, rates, credit and equities markets. The following table presents trading revenue by business activity. Not included in the table below is the impact of net interest income associated with trading securities which is an integral part of trading activities' overall performance. Certain derivatives, such as total return swaps, are economically hedged by holding the underlying interest bearing referenced assets. Net interest income related to trading activities is recorded in net interest income in the consolidated statement of income (loss). Trading revenue related to the mortgage banking business is included as a component of other income (loss). During the first quarter of 2021, we changed our presentation for the components of trading revenue to provide a more detailed view. As a result, we have reclassified prior year amounts in order to conform to the current year presentation.

(1) Includes trading revenue related to Global Banking and Equities as well as trading revenue associated with the exit or transfer of certain derivative contracts as part of our Restructuring Plan, including trading losses of $6 million and $10 million recorded during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared with trading losses of $10 million during both the three and six months ended June 30, 2020. 

Trading revenue decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 due primarily to lower revenue in Foreign Exchange and Metals as market volatility driven by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in increased trading opportunities in the prior year periods. Also contributing to the decreases in both periods was lower revenue in Foreign Exchange and Debt Markets 

HSBC USA Inc. 

reflecting the impact of our decision to exit or transfer certain derivatives as part of our Restructuring Plan which resulted in lower revenue from emerging markets rate products and interest rate swaps. Lower revenue in Securities Financing in both periods was due to higher losses related to swaps in prime brokerage. These decreases in trading revenue were partially offset by higher revenue in Markets Treasury due to the improved performance of economic hedge positions used to manage interest rate risk. While revenue in legacy structured credit products was lower and contributed to the decrease in the three-month period, it was higher and partially offset the decrease in the year-to-date period. Lower revenue in legacy structured credit products in the three-month period was due primarily to the non-recurrence of the recovery of valuation losses in the prior year period as valuation losses that were recorded in March 2020 due to market volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic largely recovered during the second quarter of 2020. Legacy structured credit products revenue in both periods also reflects the impact of a structured note vehicle that was unwound during the third quarter of 2020 which was a key contributor to prior year results. 

Other securities gains, net We maintain securities portfolios as part of our balance sheet diversification and risk management strategies. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, we sold $2,263 million and $6,170 million, respectively, of primarily U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed and U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities compared with $3,609 million and $8,239 million during the prior year periods as part of a continuing strategy to maximize returns while balancing the securities portfolio for risk management purposes. Other securities gains, net decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 reflecting the impact of lower sales activity as well as lower net gains from the sale of U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities. The gross realized gains and losses from sales of securities, which are included as a component of other securities gains, net above, are summarized in Note 5, "Securities," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 due primarily to lower cost reimbursements associated with shared services performed on behalf of other HSBC affiliates, including internal audit, as well as lower sales commissions from HSBC Bank plc. While cost reimbursements associated with trading activities performed on behalf of HSBC Bank plc were lower and contributed to the decrease in the three-month period, they were higher and partially offset the decrease in the year-to-date. 

Gain on instruments designated at fair value and related derivatives We have elected to apply fair value option accounting to certain commercial loans held for sale, certain student loans held for investment, certain of our own fixed-rate debt issuances and all of our hybrid instruments issued, including structured notes and deposits. We also use derivatives to economically hedge the interest rate and other risks associated with certain financial assets and liabilities for which fair value option accounting has been elected. Gain on instruments designated at fair value and related derivatives was lower during the three months ended June 30, 2021 attributable primarily to unfavorable movements related to the economic hedging of interest rate and other risks within our structured notes. In the year-to-date period, gain on instruments designated at fair value and related derivatives was higher attributable primarily to favorable movements related to the economic hedging of interest rate and other risks within our structured notes and the non-recurrence of unfavorable fair value adjustments recorded in the prior year-to-date period on certain commercial loans held for sale which were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. These increases in the year-to-date period were partially offset by unfavorable movements related to the economic hedging of interest rate risk within our own debt. See Note 11, "Fair Value Option," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information including a breakout of these amounts by individual component. 

Other income (loss) &#160; Other income (loss) was higher during the three months ended June 30, 2021 due primarily to a loss of $6 million in the current year period associated with credit default swap protection which largely reflects the hedging of a few client relationships compared with a loss of $38 million in the prior year period. Also contributing to the increase in the three-month period was higher gains on sales of commercial loans. In the year-to-date period, other income (loss) was lower due primarily to a loss of $12 million in the current year-to-date period associated with credit default swap protection which largely reflects the hedging of a few client relationships compared with a gain of $13 million in the prior year-to-date period. Also contributing to the decrease in the year-to-date period was lower income associated with bank owned life insurance and the non-recurrence of miscellaneous gains recorded in the first quarter of 2020, including a $12 million gain on extinguishment of time deposits reflecting early client withdrawals and a $9 million gain on the sale of one of our owned retail branch properties. These decreases in the year-to-date period were partially offset by higher residential mortgage banking revenue driven by higher gains on sales of residential mortgage loans as well as higher gains on sales of commercial loans.

Operating Expenses The following table summarizes the components of operating expenses:

Salaries and employee benefits Salaries and employee benefits expense decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 due primarily to lower salaries expense driven by staff reductions related to our Restructuring Plan as well as lower severance costs. These decrease were partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense and increased health care costs. 

Support services from HSBC affiliates Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates increased modestly during the three months ended June 30, 2021 as higher cost allocations from our technology and support service functions were largely offset by lower allocated restructuring related costs from HTSU and other HSBC affiliates. In the year-to-date period, servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates decreased due primarily to lower cost allocations from our technology and support service functions driven by the execution of our Restructuring Plan. The decrease in the year-to-date period was partially offset by higher allocated restructuring related costs from HTSU and other HSBC affiliates, primarily severance costs and support service project costs. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, we recorded $29 million and $48 million, respectively, of allocated restructuring related costs from HTSU and other HSBC affiliates compared with $32 million and $42 million of allocated costs during the prior year periods. A summary of the services received from various HSBC affiliates is included in Note 15, "Related Party Transactions," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Occupancy expense, net Occupancy expense, net was higher during the three months ended June 30, 2021 due primarily to $82 million of lease impairment and other related costs recorded in the second quarter of 2021 related to the exit of certain branches and office space as part of our Restructuring Plan. The increase in the three-month period was partially offset by lower operating lease costs and depreciation expense driven by the execution of our Restructuring Plan. In the year-to-date period, occupancy expense, net was lower due primarily to lower operating lease costs and depreciation expense driven by the execution of our Restructuring Plan. Also contributing to the decrease in the year-to-date period were lower lease impairment and other related costs as the impact of the costs recorded in the second quarter of 2021 as discussed above was more than offset by $86 million of lease impairment and other related costs recorded in the first half of 2020 related to the initial consolidation of our retail branch network as part of our Restructuring Plan. See Note 2, "Strategic Initiatives," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

Goodwill impairment Reflects a goodwill impairment charge of $784 million recorded during the first quarter of 2020 representing the entire amount of goodwill allocated to our previously separate Retail Banking and Wealth Management and Private Banking reporting units. For additional discussion of the results of our goodwill impairment testing, see Note 9, "Goodwill," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Other expenses Other expenses were flat during the three months ended June 30, 2021 as lower levels of expense capitalization related to internally developed software as well as higher costs related to equipment, outside services and professional fees were offset by lower deposit insurance assessment fees and lower marketing expense. In the year-to-date period, other expenses increased due primarily to lower levels of expense capitalization related to internally developed software as well as higher costs related to equipment, outside services and professional fees which were partially offset by lower marketing expense. 

Efficiency ratio Our efficiency ratio increased during the three months ended June 30, 2021 due primarily to lower other revenues driven by lower trading revenue and higher operating expenses driven by lease impairment and other related costs recorded in the second quarter of 2021 as discussed in detail above. In the year-to-date period, our efficiency ratio improved due primarily to lower operating expenses driven by the non-recurrence of a goodwill impairment charge recorded in the first quarter of 2020 and lower other revenues driven by lower trading revenue as discussed in detail above. 

Income tax expense (benefit) The following table summarizes our effective tax rate based on the provision for income taxes attributable to pretax income (loss): 

Three Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 &#160; (dollars are in millions) Income before income tax $ 254 &#160; $ 56 Income tax expense 61 &#160; 49 Effective tax rate 24.0 &#160; % 87.5 % Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 &#160; (dollars are in millions) Income (loss) before income tax $ 714 &#160; $ (1,384) Income tax expense (benefit) 182 &#160; (108) Effective tax rate 25.5 &#160; % (7.8) % 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Income tax expense (benefit) increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 driven by higher income. The income tax expense and higher effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2020 primarily relates to a tax benefit limitation on interim period ordinary losses under ASC 740. The income tax benefit and the lower effective tax benefit rate for the six months ended June 30, 2020 was related primarily to a non-deductible goodwill impairment related to our previously separate Retail Banking and Wealth Management and Private Banking businesses. 

Segment Results &#8211; Group Reporting Basis 

We have four distinct business segments that we utilize for management reporting and analysis purposes, which are aligned with HSBC's global business strategy: Wealth and Personal Banking ("WPB"), Commercial Banking ("CMB"), Global Banking and Markets ("GBM") and a Corporate Center ("CC"). See Item 1, "Business," in our 2020 Form 10-K for a description of our segments which are based upon our global businesses, including a discussion of the main business activities of the segments and a summary of their products and services. 

During the first half of 2021, we implemented a change to our internal management reporting to prospectively report assets related to our active branches as of January 1, 2021, which were historically reported within our CC segment, within our WPB segment. As a result, lease impairment and other related costs associated with these branches is recorded within our WPB segment beginning in 2021. Prior periods were not impacted by the change. 

There have been no additional changes in the basis of our segmentation as compared with the presentation in our 2020 Form 10-K. We are currently reviewing the financial information used to manage our GBM business, including the scope and content of the financial data being reported to our management and our Board of Directors. We will evaluate any impact such changes may have on our segment reporting once completed. 

Net interest income of each segment represents the difference between actual interest earned on assets and interest incurred on liabilities of the segment, adjusted for a funding charge or credit that includes both interest rate and liquidity components. Segments are charged a cost to fund assets (e.g. customer loans) and receive a funding credit for funds provided (e.g. customer deposits) based on equivalent market rates that incorporate both repricing (interest rate risk) and tenor (liquidity) characteristics. The objective of these charges/credits is to transfer interest rate risk to one centralized unit in Markets Treasury. Markets Treasury income statement and balance sheet results are allocated to each of the global businesses based upon tangible equity levels and levels of any surplus liabilities. 

Certain other revenue and operating expense amounts are also apportioned among the business segments based upon the benefits derived from this activity or the relationship of this activity to other segment activity. These inter-segment transactions have not been eliminated, and we generally account for them as if they were with third parties. 

We report financial information to our parent, HSBC, in accordance with HSBC Group accounting and reporting policies, which apply IFRSs as issued by the IASB. As a result, our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the Group Reporting Basis as operating results are monitored and reviewed, trends are evaluated and decisions about allocating resources, such as employees, are primarily made on this basis. We continue, however, to monitor capital adequacy and report to regulatory agencies on a U.S. GAAP basis. 

There have been no changes in the measurement of segment profit as compared with the presentation in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

The significant differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis as they impact our results are summarized in Note 24, "Business Segments," in our 2020 Form 10-K. There have been no significant changes since December 31, 2020 in the differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis impacting our results.

During the second quarter of 2021, as part of our Restructuring Plan we made the decision to exit our mass market retail banking business, including our Personal and Advance propositions as well as retail business banking, and focus on the banking and wealth management needs of globally-connected affluent and high net worth clients through our Premier, Jade or Private Banking propositions. In conjunction with the execution of this strategy, we have entered into definitive sale agreements with third parties to sell approximately 90 of our retail branches along with substantially all residential mortgage, unsecured and retail business banking loans and all deposits in our branch network not associated with our Premier, Jade and Private Banking customers. Certain assets under management associated with our mass market retail banking business which are managed by an affiliate will also be transferred. Although this disposal group will be sold in multiple transactions that are expected to be 

HSBC USA Inc. 

completed by the first quarter of 2022, the actual time to complete these sales depends on many factors, including regulatory approval. We will continue to offer deposits and retail loan products to our Premier, Jade and Private Banking customers. 

Our WPB segment reported a higher loss before tax during the three months ended June 30, 2021 due to higher operating expenses driven by $57 million of lease impairment and other related costs recorded in the second quarter of 2021 primarily related to the exit of certain branches as part of our Restructuring Plan as well as lower other operating income. The higher loss in the three-month period was partially offset by lower expected credit losses and higher net interest income. In the year-to-date period, our WPB segment reported a lower loss before tax due primarily to lower operating expenses as the impact of the lease impairment and other related costs recorded in the second quarter of 2021 as discussed above was more than offset by the non-recurrence of a goodwill impairment charge of $693 million recorded during the first quarter of 2020, representing the entire amount of remaining goodwill previously recorded. Also contributing to the improvement in the year-to-date period was lower expected credit losses, partially offset by lower other operating income and lower net interest income. 

Net interest income increased during the three months ended June 30, 2021 due to improved residential mortgage loan spreads. In the year-to-date period, net interest income decreased as improved residential mortgage loan spreads were more than offset by lower deposit spreads reflecting the impact of lower market rates. 

Other operating income decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 due to lower investment management fees reflecting a shift in mix to products with lower management fees and lower residential mortgage banking revenue driven by unfavorable fair value adjustments on residential mortgage loans held for sale. The decrease in the year-to-date period was partially offset by the non-recurrence of a loss of $7 million recorded during the first quarter of 2020 related to extending the maturity of the total return swap position used to economically hedge the periodic payments made under the swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of Visa Inc. Class B common shares. 

Expected credit losses improved during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 reflecting lower loss estimates due to declines in credit card balances as well as improved economic conditions in the current year periods which resulted in improved economic forecasts used for calculating ECL. In the prior year periods, loss provisions were driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts used for calculating ECL as well as higher dollars of delinquency and, to a lesser extent, growth in personal loan balances due to new product promotions. While loss provisions were recorded for credit cards in the prior year periods, the provision in the second quarter of 2020 was not as significant due to lower customer spending and a decline in credit card balances. 

Excluding the lease impairment and other related costs as well as the goodwill impairment charge discussed above, operating expenses decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 driven by the execution of our Restructuring Plan which resulted in lower staff costs, lower operating lease costs, lower marketing expense, lower severance costs and lower cost allocations from our technology and support service functions. Also contributing to the decrease in the three-month period were lower deposit insurance assessment fees. 

Client Assets The following table provides information regarding private banking client assets during the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020: 

Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 (in millions) Client assets at beginning of period $ 44,104 &#160; $ 39,295 Net new money (outflows) 9,008 &#160; (1,437) Value change 2,078 &#160; 232 Client assets at end of period $ 55,190 &#160; $ 38,090 

The increase in client assets during the six months ended June 30, 2021 reflects new money growth primarily driven by a few large clients as well as positive market performance.

(2) Includes allocated Markets Treasury revenue. 

Our CMB segment reported a profit before tax during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared with a loss before tax in the prior year periods due primarily to lower expected credit losses and, to a lesser extent, higher other operating income. The improvements were partially offset by lower net interest income and higher operating expenses. 

Net interest income decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 due to lower deposit spreads reflecting the impact of lower market rates and lower average loan balances, partially offset by higher average deposit balances, higher earnings on capital and lower liquidity charges. 

Other operating income increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 due primarily to higher fees from loan syndication and other account services as well as the non-recurrence of a loss recorded on the sale of a loan in the second quarter of 2020. The increase in the three-month period was partially offset by lower allocated Markets Treasury revenue. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Expected credit losses improved during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 reflecting releases in credit loss reserves compared with loss provisions in the prior year periods. The releases in credit reserves in the current year periods were driven by improved economic conditions which resulted in improved economic forecasts used for calculating ECL as well as client paydowns. In the prior year periods, the loss provisions were driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts used for calculating ECL and provisions for downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients. Also contributing to the loss provision in the 2020 year-to-date period was loan growth as clients drew on their available lines of credit. 

Operating expenses increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 due primarily to higher incentive compensation expense and higher cost allocations from our support service functions. These increases were partially offset by lower branch network and corporate real estate costs.

(3) Includes net interest income on capital held in the business and not assigned to products as well as revenue associated with credit default swap protection and loan sales. 

(4) Includes cost reimbursements associated with activities performed on behalf of other HSBC affiliates, allocated Markets Treasury revenue and certain corporate funding charges not assigned to products. 

Our GBM segment reported a lower profit before tax during the three months ended June 30, 2021 due to lower other operating income and lower net interest income, partially offset by lower expected credit losses and lower operating expenses. In the year-to-date period, our GBM segment reported a higher profit before tax due primarily to lower expected credit losses, partially offset by lower other operating income and lower net interest income. 

MSS revenue decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 due primarily to lower revenue in Foreign Exchange and Metals as market volatility driven by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in increased trading opportunities in the prior year periods. Also contributing to the decreases in both periods was lower revenue in Foreign Exchange, Debt Markets 

HSBC USA Inc. 

and, in the year-to-date period, MSS other reflecting the impact of our decision to exit or transfer certain derivatives as part of our Restructuring Plan which resulted in lower revenue from emerging markets rate products and interest rate swaps. Lower revenue in Securities Financing in both periods was due to compressed spreads. These decreases were partially offset in the year-to-date period by a gain from credit and funding valuation adjustments in the current year-to-date period due to compressed credit and funding spreads compared with a loss in the prior year-to-date period due to widening credit spreads on derivative assets driven by market volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Global Banking revenue increased during the three months ended June 30, 2021 and decreased in the year-to-date period reflecting higher revenue in Capital Markets and Credit and Lending which was partially offset in the three-month period by lower revenue in GLCM and more than offset in the year-to-date period by lower revenue in GLCM and Global Banking other. Higher revenue in Capital Markets and Credit and Lending in both periods was due to higher loan syndication fees and higher revenue associated with collections of nonaccrual loans, partially offset by lower net interest income from lower average loan balances driven by the impact of our efforts to improve returns through disciplined lending as well as lower demand from clients reflecting increased capital markets activity. The decrease in GLCM revenue in both periods was due to lower net interest income driven by lower deposit spreads reflecting the impact of lower market rates, partially offset by the impact of higher average deposit balances as well as higher account service fees. Global Banking other revenue was higher in the three-month period and lower in the year-to-date period driven by revenue associated with credit default swap protection which largely reflects the hedging of a few client relationships. 

GBM other revenue decreased during the three months ended June 30, 2021 and increased in the year-to-date period as lower allocated Markets Treasury revenue was partially offset in the three-month period and more than offset in the year-to-date period by lower corporate funding charges and lower liquidity charges. 

Expected credit losses improved during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 reflecting releases in credit loss reserves compared with loss provisions in the prior year periods. The releases in credit reserves in the current year periods were driven by improved economic conditions which resulted in improved economic forecasts used for calculating ECL and improvements in credit conditions associated with certain clients. Client paydowns and loan sales also contributed to the releases in credit reserves in the current year periods. In the prior year periods, the loss provisions were driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts used for calculating ECL and provisions for risk factors associated with oil and gas industry loan exposures and downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients. 

Operating expenses decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 due primarily to lower salaries expense and lower market data costs, partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense and higher cost allocations from our support service functions.

Our CC segment reported a loss before tax during the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared with a profit before tax in the prior year period due primarily to lower other operating income. In the year-to-date period, our CC segment reported a lower loss before tax due to lower operating expenses and lower net interest expense, partially offset by lower other operating income. 

Net interest expense was lower during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 driven by lower retained liquidity charges and lower net interest expense from legacy structured credit products. 

Other operating income decreased during the three months ended June 30, 2021 due primarily to lower revenue in legacy structured credit products as discussed below. In the year-to-date period, other operating income decreased due primarily to unfavorable movements related to the economic hedging of interest rate risk within our own debt, lower cost reimbursements associated with shared services performed on behalf of other HSBC affiliates, including internal audit, and the non-recurrence of a $9 million gain recorded during the first quarter of 2020 on the sale of one of our owned retail branch properties. The decrease in the year-to-date period was partially offset by higher revenue in legacy structured credit products. Lower revenue in legacy structured credit products in the three-month period was due primarily to the non-recurrence of the recovery of valuation losses in the prior year period as valuation losses that were recorded in March 2020 due to market volatility caused by the 

HSBC USA Inc. 

COVID-19 pandemic largely recovered during the second quarter of 2020. Legacy structured credit products revenue in both periods also reflects the impact of a structured note vehicle that was unwound during the third quarter of 2020 which was a key contributor to prior year results. 

Operating expenses increased during the three months ended June 30, 2020 due primarily to higher lease impairment and other related costs driven by $10 million of costs recorded in the second quarter of 2021 associated with branches closed prior to 2021 and certain office space as part of our Restructuring Plan. In the year-to-date period, operating expenses decreased due primarily to lower lease impairment and other related costs as the impact of the costs recorded in the second quarter of 2021 as discussed above was more than offset by $92 million of lease impairment and other related costs recorded during the first half of 2020 related to the initial consolidation of our retail branch network as part of our Restructuring Plan. Also contributing to the decrease in the year-to-date period were lower cost allocations from our technology and support service functions. These decreases were partially offset by higher allocated restructuring related costs from HTSU and other HSBC affiliates, primarily severance costs and support service project costs. 

Reconciliation of Segment Results As previously discussed, segment results are reported on a Group Reporting Basis. See Note 16, "Business Segments," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of our Group Reporting Basis segment results to U.S. GAAP consolidated totals. 

Credit Quality 

In the normal course of business, we enter into a variety of transactions that involve both on and off-balance sheet credit risk. Principal among these activities is lending to various commercial, institutional, governmental and individual customers. We participate in lending activity throughout the United States and, on a limited basis, internationally. 

COVID-19 Loan Forbearance Initiatives We have implemented various loan modification payment deferral programs to provide borrowers relief from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Substantially all of the loans under these programs are not classified as TDR Loans due to our election to suspend TDR Loan classification under the CARES Act or their short-term nature as discussed under the Interagency Statement. In addition, under the Interagency Statement, for COVID-19 related loan modifications in the form of a payment deferral, the borrower&#8217;s past due status will not be affected during the deferral period and, if the loan was accruing at the time the relief was granted, the loan will generally not be placed on nonaccrual status as long as the borrower utilizes a payment deferral of six months or less. For consumer mortgage loans, when a borrower utilizes a payment deferral of more than six months, the loan will generally be placed on nonaccrual status and, if the loan does not meet the criteria in the CARES Act, assessed for TDR Loan classification. We have not modified our commercial loan nonaccrual policies as a result of this guidance. These COVID-19 related payment deferral programs could delay the recognition of delinquencies, nonaccrual status, and net charge-offs for those customers who may have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual status had such relief not been offered. See "Executive Overview," in this MD&#38;A for additional information. 

Allowance for Credit Losses / Liability for Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures &#160; Our accounting policies and methodologies related to the allowance for credit losses and liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures in prior periods are presented under the caption "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" in MD&#38;A and in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements," in our 2020 Form 10-K. Our approach toward credit risk management is summarized under the caption "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2020 Form 10-K. There have been no significant revisions to our policies or methodologies during the first half of 2021.

The following table summarizes our allowance for credit losses and the liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures: 

June 30, 2021 March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 &#160; (in millions) Allowance for credit losses: Loans: Commercial loans $ 538 &#160; $ 670 $ 814 Consumer loans 9 &#160; 183 201 Total loans 547 &#160; 853 1,015 Securities held-to-maturity 2 &#160; 2 2

(1) Primarily includes accrued interest receivables and customer acceptances. 

The total allowance for credit losses at June 30, 2021 decreased $307 million or 36 percent as compared with March 31, 2021 and decreased $469 million or 46 percent as compared with December 31, 2020 due to lower loss estimates on both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios. 

Our commercial allowance for credit losses at June 30, 2021 decreased $132 million or 20 percent as compared with March 31, 2021 and decreased $276 million or 34 percent as compared with December 31, 2020 driven by improved economic conditions which resulted in improved economic forecasts used for calculating lifetime ECL and improvements in credit conditions associated with certain clients as well as a decline in credit reserves for risk factors associated with higher risk client exposures and, as compared with December 31, 2020, economic uncertainty. Also contributing to the decreases were client paydowns and loan sales. 

Our consumer allowance for credit losses at June 30, 2021 decreased $174 million or 95 percent as compared with March 31, 2021 and decreased $192 million or 96 percent as compared with December 31, 2020 driven by the impact of our decision to exit our mass market retail banking business as well as our remaining credit card portfolio which resulted in a reduction in credit loss reserves on consumer loans of approximately $156 million during the second quarter of 2021. Also contributing to the decreases were improved economic conditions which resulted in improved economic forecasts used for calculating lifetime ECL and declines in credit reserves for risk factors primarily associated with economic uncertainty and forbearance accounts. 

The liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures at June 30, 2021 decreased $27 million or 17 percent as compared with March 31, 2021 and decreased $109 million or 46 percent as compared with December 31, 2020 resulting from the improved economic conditions consistent with commercial loans as discussed above.

See Note 7, "Allowance for Credit Losses," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a rollforward of credit losses by general loan categories for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. 

The allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment at June 30, 2021 decreased as compared with both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 as the decrease in our allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above outpaced a decrease in total loans held for investment. 

The allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of net charge-offs at June 30, 2021 decreased as compared with both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 due to increased dollars of net charge-offs driven by higher charge-offs in our consumer loan portfolio due primarily to the transfer of our credit card loan portfolio to held for sale during the second quarter of 2021 as well as the decrease in our allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above. Also contributing to increased dollars of net charge-offs as compared with March 31, 2021 were higher charge-offs in our commercial loan portfolio due primarily to the sale of a global banking loan. 

The allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of nonperforming loans held for investment at June 30, 2021 decreased as compared with both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 as the decrease in our allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above outpaced a decrease in nonperforming loans driven by lower nonperforming loans in both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios. 

Delinquency The following table summarizes dollars of two-months-and-over contractual delinquency and two-months-and-over contractual delinquency as a percentage of total loans, excluding loans held for sale ("delinquency ratio"). For COVID-19 related loan modifications in the form of a payment deferral, the borrower's past due status will not be affected during the deferral period.

N/A Not Applicable 

Our two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio decreased 29 basis points and 13 basis points compared with March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, due to lower dollars of delinquency in both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios, partially offset by lower outstanding loan balances in both our consumer and commercial loan portfolios. 

Our commercial loan two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio decreased 38 basis points and 17 basis points compared with March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, due to lower dollars of delinquency driven primarily by the collection of a global banking loan and, as compared with March 31, 2021, the sale of a global banking loan and the collection of a commercial real estate loan, both of which became 60 days delinquent during the first quarter. The decrease in the ratio was partially offset by lower outstanding loan balances. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Our consumer loan two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio increased 9 basis points and 13 basis points compared with March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, as lower dollars of delinquency reflecting the impact of our decision to exit our mass market retail banking business as well as our remaining retail credit card portfolio which resulted in the transfer of certain loans to held for sale during the second quarter of 2021, including $61 million of delinquent consumer loans, was more than offset by lower outstanding loan balances.

Our net charge-off ratio as a percentage of average loans increased 32 basis points during the three months ended June 30, 2021 due to a higher level of net charge-offs in our consumer loan portfolio due primarily to the transfer of our credit card loan portfolio to held for sale during the second quarter of 2021 which increased net charge-offs by $56 million as well as lower average loan balances driven by a decline in the commercial loan portfolio. Net charge-offs in our commercial loan portfolio were lower during the three months ended June 30, 2021 due primarily to the deterioration of two corporate banking loans in the prior year period. 

In the year-to-date period, our net charge-off ratio as a percentage of average loans increased 8 basis points due primarily to lower average loan balances driven by a decline in the commercial loan portfolio. Net charge-offs in the year-to-date period were relatively flat as a lower level of net charge-offs in our commercial loan portfolio due primarily to the deterioration of two corporate banking loans in the prior year period was largely offset by a higher level of net charge-offs in our consumer loan portfolio due primarily to the transfer of our credit card loan portfolio to held for sale during the second quarter of 2021 as discussed above.

At June 30, 2021, March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, total nonperforming loans include $1 million, $31 million and $21 million, respectively, of accruing loans contractually 90 days or more past due. 

(2) At June 30, 2021, March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, nonperforming consumer mortgage loans include $343 million, $371 million and $375 million, respectively, of loans that are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell. 

(3) Nonperforming consumer mortgage loans held for investment include all loans which are 90 or more days contractually delinquent as well as loans discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not re-affirmed and second lien loans where the first lien loan that we own or service is 90 or more days contractually delinquent. At June 30, 2021, March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, nonaccrual consumer mortgage loans also included $384 million, $535 million and $590 million, respectively, of loans under COVID-19 related payment deferral programs where the borrowers utilized a payment deferral of more than six months and, as a result, have been placed on nonaccrual status. 

(4) Nonperforming consumer mortgage loans for all periods does not include guaranteed loans purchased from the Government National Mortgage Association. Repayment of these loans is predominantly insured by the Federal Housing Administration and as such, these loans have different risk characteristics from the rest of our customer loan portfolio. 

(5) Includes $1 million or less of commercial other real estate owned at June 30, 2021, March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

N/A Not Applicable 

Our nonperforming loans ratio decreased 34 basis points and 37 basis points compared with March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, due to lower nonperforming loans in both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios, partially offset by lower outstanding loan balances in both our consumer and commercial loan portfolios. 

Our commercial nonperforming loans ratio decreased 10 basis points and 25 basis points compared with March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, due to lower nonperforming loans driven primarily by paydowns of global banking loans and the sale of a global banking loan, partially offset by the downgrade of a commercial real estate loan. The decrease in the ratio was partially offset by lower outstanding loan balances. 

Our consumer nonperforming loans ratio decreased 48 basis points and 29 basis points compared with March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, due primarily to lower nonperforming loans reflecting the impact of our decision to exit our mass market retail banking business as well as our remaining retail credit card portfolio which resulted in the transfer of certain loans to held for sale during the second quarter of 2021, including $206 million of nonperforming consumer loans, of which $21 million were accruing loans contractually 90 days or more past due. Lower nonperforming consumer loans also reflects payoffs as well as the impact of customers exiting forbearance relief and returning to accruing status. The decrease in the ratio was partially offset by lower outstanding loan balances.

Concentration of Credit Risk A concentration of credit risk is defined as a significant credit exposure with an individual or group engaged in similar activities or affected similarly by economic conditions. We enter into a variety of transactions in the normal course of business that involve both on and off-balance sheet credit risk. Principal among these activities is lending to various commercial, institutional, governmental and individual customers throughout the United States and internationally. We manage the varying degrees of credit risk associated with on and off-balance sheet transactions through specific credit policies and procedures which provide for a strict approval, monitoring and reporting process. It is our policy to require collateral when it is deemed appropriate. Varying degrees and types of collateral are secured depending upon management's credit evaluation. 

Commercial Credit Exposure Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Commercial loans outstanding and unused commercial commitments by industry are presented in the table below:

Residential Mortgage Loans Our consumer loan portfolio includes the following types of loans: 

&#8226; Interest-only loans &#8211; A loan which allows a customer to pay the interest-only portion of the monthly payment for a period of time which results in lower payments during the initial loan period. 

&#8226; Adjustable rate mortgage ("ARM") loans &#8211; A loan which allows us to adjust pricing on the loan in line with market movements. 

The following table summarizes the balances of interest-only and ARM loans in our loan portfolios, excluding mortgages held for sale, at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Each category is not mutually exclusive and loans may appear in more than one category below.

Credit Risks Associated with Derivative Contracts Credit risk associated with derivatives is measured as the net replacement cost of derivative contracts in a receivable position in the event the counterparties of such contracts fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. In managing derivative credit risk, both the current exposure, which is the replacement cost of contracts on the measurement date, as well as an estimate of the potential change in value of contracts over their remaining lives are considered. Counterparties to our derivative activities include financial institutions, central clearing parties, foreign and domestic government agencies, corporations, funds (mutual funds, hedge funds, etc.), insurance companies and private clients as well as other HSBC entities. These counterparties are subject to regular credit review by the credit risk management department. To minimize credit risk, we may enter into legally enforceable master netting agreements which reduce risk by permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon occurrence of certain events. In addition, we reduce credit risk by obtaining collateral from counterparties. The determination of the need for and the levels of collateral will differ based on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty and/or regulatory requirements. 

The total risk in a derivative contract is a function of a number of variables, such as: 

&#8226; volatility of interest rates, currencies, equity or corporate reference entity used as the basis for determining contract payments; 

&#8226; current market events or trends; 

&#8226; country risk; 

&#8226; maturity and liquidity of contracts; 

&#8226; creditworthiness of the counterparties in the transaction; 

&#8226; the existence of a master netting agreement among the counterparties; and 

&#8226; existence and value of collateral received from counterparties to secure exposures. 

The table below presents total credit risk exposure calculated using the general risk-based capital rules of the Basel III Standardized Approach which includes the net positive mark-to-market of the derivative contracts plus any adjusted potential future exposure as measured in reference to the notional amount. The regulatory capital rules recognize that bilateral netting agreements reduce credit risk and, therefore, allow for reductions of risk-weighted assets when netting requirements have been met and collateral exists. As a result, risk-weighted amounts for regulatory capital purposes are a portion of the original gross exposures. Furthermore, many contracts contain provisions that allow us to close out the transaction if the counterparty fails to post required collateral. In addition, many contracts give us the right to break the transactions earlier than the final maturity date. As a result, these contracts have potential future exposures that are often much smaller than the future exposures derived from the regulatory capital rules.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Effective liquidity management is defined as ensuring we can meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities/withdrawals and other cash commitments efficiently under both normal operating conditions and under unpredictable circumstances of industry or market stress. To achieve this objective, we have guidelines that require sufficient liquidity to cover potential funding requirements and to avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. Guidelines are set for the consolidated balance sheet of HSBC USA to ensure that it is a source of strength for our regulated, deposit-taking banking subsidiary, as well as to address the more limited sources of liquidity available to it as a holding company. Similar guidelines are set for HSBC Bank USA to ensure that it can meet its liquidity needs in various stress scenarios. Cash flow analysis, including stress testing scenarios, forms the basis for liquidity management and contingency funding plans. 

During the first half of 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact business and economic activity. We continue to actively monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk in accordance with HSBC policy. To date, we have not experienced any significant impact to our liquidity or funding capabilities as a result of the pandemic. See "Risk Management" in this MD&#38;A for further discussion of our approach towards liquidity and funding risk management, including information regarding the key measures employed to define, monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk. We continuously monitor the impact of market events on our liquidity positions and will continue to adapt our framework as necessary to reflect market events. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Interest Bearing Deposits with Banks totaled $48,504 million and $14,353 million at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, of which $48,351 million and $13,895 million, respectively, were held with the Federal Reserve Bank. Balances may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our liquidity position at the time and our strategy for deploying liquidity. Surplus interest bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank may be deployed into securities purchased under agreements to resell or other investments depending on market conditions and the opportunity to maximize returns. 

Federal Funds Sold and Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell totaled $10,503 million and $35,746 million at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Balances may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our liquidity position at the time and our strategy for deploying liquidity. 

Trading Assets includes securities totaling $18,910 million and $19,494 million at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. See "Balance Sheet Review" in this MD&#38;A for further analysis and discussion on trends. 

Securities includes securities available-for-sale and securities held-to-maturity totaling $41,475 million and $49,653 million at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. See "Balance Sheet Review" in this MD&#38;A for further analysis and discussion on trends.

Under our shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, we may issue certain securities including debt securities and preferred stock. We satisfy the eligibility requirements for designation as a "well-known seasoned issuer," which allows us to file a registration statement that does not have a limit on issuance capacity. The ability to issue under the registration statement is limited by the authority granted by the Board of Directors. During the first quarter of 2021, due to an anticipated decrease in utilization of the shelf registration statement, the Board of Directors approved a reduction in the amount we are authorized to issue from $25,000 million at December 31, 2020 to $20,000 million, of which $11,918 million was available at June 30, 2021. HSBC Bank USA has a $40,000 million Global Bank Note Program that provides for the issuance of subordinated and senior notes, of which $12,754 million was available at June 30, 2021. We anticipate using the Global Bank Note Program more in the future as part of our efforts designed to minimize overall funding costs while accessing diverse funding channels. 

As a member of the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, we have secured borrowing facilities which are collateralized by loans and investment securities. At June 30, 2021, long-term debt included $2,000 million of borrowings from the FHLB facility. Based upon the amounts pledged as collateral under these facilities, we have additional borrowing capacity of up to $17,099 million.

Preferred Equity See Note 18, "Preferred Stock," in our 2020 Form 10-K for information regarding all outstanding preferred share issues. 

Common Equity During the six months ended June 30, 2021, HSBC USA did not receive any cash capital contributions from its parent, HSBC North America, and did not make any capital contributions to its subsidiary, HSBC Bank USA. 

Capital Ratios In managing capital, we develop targets for common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, total capital to risk-weighted assets, Tier 1 capital to adjusted quarterly average assets (i.e., the "Tier 1 leverage ratio") and Tier 1 capital to total leverage exposure (i.e., the "supplementary leverage ratio" or "SLR"). Capital targets are reviewed at least semi-annually to ensure they reflect our business mix and risk profile, as well as real-time conditions and circumstances. The following table summarizes HSBC USA's Basel III capital ratios calculated as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020: 

June 30, 2021 December 31, 2020

(1) Prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the current period presentation. See Note 17, "Retained Earnings and Regulatory Capital Requirements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 

(2) Adjusted quarterly average assets, the Tier 1 leverage ratio denominator, reflects quarterly average assets adjusted for amounts permitted to be deducted from Tier 1 capital. 

(3) Total leverage exposure, the SLR denominator, includes adjusted quarterly average assets plus certain off-balance sheet exposures. 

(4) As discussed further below, the rules that permitted banking institutions to temporarily exclude U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from the denominator of their SLR expired on April 1, 2021. 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that provides the option to transition in the regulatory capital impacts of the new current expected credit loss accounting standard over a five-year period. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA have elected the five-year transition option and, as a result, beginning in 2020, our capital ratios are reported in accordance with the transition rules in the final rule. Accordingly, during 2020 and 2021, we will exclude from regulatory capital the change in retained earnings resulting from adoption of the new accounting standard on January 1, 2020 as well as 25 percent of the change in the allowance for credit losses recognized between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021. Beginning January 1, 2022, the excluded impacts will be phased in to regulatory capital over a three-year transition period and will be fully reflected at January 1, 2025. 

Also in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal banking agencies issued final rules that permitted intermediate holding companies, such as HSBC North America, and depository institutions, such as HSBC Bank USA, to temporarily exclude U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from the denominator of their SLR. The rules were designed to allow banking institutions to expand their balance sheets to accommodate increased customer deposits while continuing to provide credit to companies and households. These changes took effect in 2020 and expired on April 1, 2021. 

We manage capital in accordance with HSBC Group policy. The HSBC North America Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ("ICAAP") works in conjunction with the HSBC Group's ICAAP. The HSBC North America ICAAP applies to HSBC Bank USA and evaluates regulatory capital adequacy and capital adequacy under various stress scenarios. Our approach is to meet our capital needs for these stress scenarios locally through activities which reduce risk. To the extent that local alternatives are insufficient, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC, we would seek support from our ultimate parent. Regulatory capital requirements are based on the amount of capital required to be held, plus applicable capital buffers, as defined by regulations, and the amount of risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure, also calculated based on regulatory definitions. 

We are subject to regulatory capital rules issued by U.S. banking regulators including Basel III (the "Basel III rule"). The Basel III rule establishes minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for banks and bank holding companies ("BHCs"). In 2019, the FRB and the other federal banking agencies jointly finalized rules to implement the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act that tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards for large BHC and foreign banking organizations (the "Tailoring Rules"). The Tailoring Rules assign each BHC and IHC with $50 billion or more in total U.S. assets into one of five classifications (Categories I through IV, and 'other firms') based on its size and four risk-based indicators. Under the Tailoring Rules, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA are subject to Category III standards and calculate their risk-based capital requirements for credit risk solely using the generally-applicable Standardized Approach. For additional discussion of the Basel III final rule requirements, including required minimum capital ratios, as well as further discussion of the Tailoring Rules and other related regulatory developments and their expected impact see Part I, 

HSBC USA Inc. 

"Regulation and Competition - Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Requirements," in our 2020 Form 10-K. We continue to review the composition of our capital structure and capital buffers in light of these developments. 

Capital Planning and Stress Testing The FRB requires certain U.S. top-tier BHCs and IHCs, including HSBC North America, to comply with the FRB's capital plan rule and CCAR program, as well as the annual supervisory stress tests conducted by the FRB, and annual company-run stress tests as required under Dodd-Frank (collectively, "DFAST"). Disclosure of the company-run stress tests is required only every other year. The company-run stress tests are forward looking exercises to assess the impact of hypothetical macroeconomic baseline and severely adverse scenarios provided by the FRB (and internally developed scenarios for the company-run exercises) on the financial condition and capital adequacy of a CCAR firm over a nine quarter planning horizon. For further discussion of capital planning and stress testing, including detail regarding the FRB's supervisory assessment as part of the CCAR process, see Part I, "Regulation and Competition - Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Requirements," in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

HSBC North America submitted its 2021 CCAR capital plan and its 2021 annual company-run DFAST results in April 2021. In July 2021, HSBC North America publicly disclosed its 2021 annual DFAST results. In June 2021, the FRB publicly disclosed its own DFAST and CCAR results and informed HSBC North America that it did not object to HSBC North America's capital plan or the planned capital distributions included in its 2021 CCAR submission. The FRB previously announced that it intended to terminate restrictions on capital distributions put in place in connection with additional stress tests that the FRB conducted to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Firms with capital levels above the minimum requirements in the 2021 CCAR exercise, including HSBC North America, are no longer subject to the additional restrictions after June 30, 2021. Under these additional restrictions, CCAR firms were allowed to make certain capital distributions in the first two quarters of 2021, provided that the distributions generally did not exceed net income. Stress testing results are based solely on hypothetical adverse stress scenarios and should not be viewed or interpreted as forecasts of expected outcomes or capital adequacy or of the actual financial condition of HSBC North America. Capital planning and stress testing for HSBC North America may impact our future capital and liquidity. 

While BHC regulatory capital compliance is generally performed at the HSBC North America level, and also separately for HSBC Bank USA, as a BHC we are required to meet minimum capital requirements imposed by the FRB. We present our capital ratios, together with HSBC Bank USA's in Note 17, "Retained Earnings and Regulatory Capital Requirements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

2021 Funding Strategy Our current estimate for funding needs and sources for 2021 are summarized in the following table: 

Actual January 1 through June 30, 2021 Estimated July 1 through December 31, 2021 Estimated Full Year 2021 &#160; (in billions) Increase (decrease) in funding needs: Net change in loans $ (3) $ (1) $ (4) Net change in short-term investments and securities 1 (9) (8) Net change in trading and other assets 1 (1) &#8212; Total funding needs $ (1) $ (11) $ (12) Increase (decrease) in funding sources: Net change in deposits $ 2 $ (4) $ (2) Net change in trading and other short-term liabilities (3) (2) (5) Net change in long-term debt &#8212; (5) (5) Total funding sources $ (1) $ (11) $ (12) 

The above table reflects a long-term funding strategy. Daily balances fluctuate as we accommodate customer needs, while ensuring that we have liquidity in place to support the balance sheet maturity funding profile. Should market conditions deteriorate, we have contingency plans to generate additional liquidity through the sales of assets or financing transactions. We remain confident in our ability to access the market for long-term debt funding needs in the current market environment. We continue to seek well-priced and stable customer deposits. We also continue to sell new agency-eligible mortgage loan originations to third parties. The above funding plan assumes that the announced sale of our mass market retail banking business will not be completed in 2021. 

HSBC Bank USA is subject to significant restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to, and certain other 'covered transactions' with HSBC USA and other affiliates. For further discussion, see Part I, "Regulation and Competition - Affiliate Transaction Restrictions," in our 2020 Form 10-K.

See "Risk Management" in this MD&#38;A for further discussion relating to our liquidity contingency plans and our approach to liquidity and funding risk management. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Credit Derivatives and Other Contractual Obligations 

As part of our normal operations, we enter into credit derivatives and various off-balance sheet arrangements with affiliates and third parties. These arrangements arise principally in connection with our lending and client intermediation activities and involve primarily extensions of credit and, in certain cases, guarantees. 

As a financial services provider, we routinely extend credit through loan commitments and lines and letters of credit and provide financial guarantees, including derivative transactions having characteristics of a guarantee. The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent our maximum possible credit exposure in the event that a counterparty draws down the full commitment amount or we are required to fulfill our maximum obligation under a guarantee. 

The following table provides maturity information related to our credit derivatives and off-balance sheet arrangements. Many of these commitments and guarantees expire unused or without default. In addition, implementation of our business strategy (as described under the heading "Executive Overview" in our 2020 Form 10-K and in this MD&#38;A) will affect our contractual obligations over time, including with respect to credit derivatives and consumer commitments. As a result, we believe that the contractual amount is not representative of the actual future credit exposure or funding requirements.

(3) Includes $1,799 million and $2,475 million issued for the benefit of HSBC affiliates at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

Other Commitments to Extend Credit Other commitments to extend credit include arrangements whereby we are contractually obligated to extend credit in the form of loans, participations in loans, lease financing receivables, or similar transactions. Commercial commitments comprise primarily those related to secured and unsecured loans and lines of credit. Consumer commitments comprise certain unused MasterCard/Visa credit card lines, where we have the right to change terms or conditions upon notification to the customer, and commitments to extend credit secured by residential properties, where we have the right to change terms or conditions, for cause, upon notification to the customer. 

In addition to the above, we have established and manage a number of constant net asset value ("CNAV") money market funds that invest in shorter-dated highly-rated money market securities to provide investors with a highly liquid and secure investment. These funds price the assets in their portfolio on an amortized cost basis, which enables them to create and liquidate shares at a constant price. The funds, however, are not permitted to price their portfolios at amortized cost if that amount varies by more than 50 basis points from the portfolio's market value. In that case, the fund would be required to price its portfolio at market value and consequently would no longer be able to create or liquidate shares at a constant price. We do not consolidate the CNAV funds because we do not absorb the majority of the expected future risk associated with the fund's assets, including interest rate, liquidity, credit and other relevant risks that are expected to affect the value of the assets.

Fair Value 

Fair Value Hierarchy Fair value measurement accounting principles establish a fair value hierarchy structure that prioritizes the inputs to determine the fair value of an asset or liability (the "Fair Value Framework"). The Fair Value Framework distinguishes between inputs that are based on observed market data and unobservable inputs that reflect market participants' assumptions. It emphasizes the use of valuation methodologies that maximize observable market inputs. For financial instruments carried at fair value, the best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an actively traded market (Level 1). Where the market for a financial instrument is not active, valuation techniques are used. The majority of our valuation techniques use market inputs that are either observable or indirectly derived from and corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the financial instrument (Level 2). Because Level 1 and Level 2 instruments are determined by observable inputs, less judgment is applied in determining their fair values. In the absence of observable market inputs, the financial instrument is valued based on valuation techniques that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The determination of the level of fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement of an asset or a liability is classified often requires judgment and may change over time as market conditions evolve. We consider the following factors in developing the fair value hierarchy: 

&#8226; whether the asset or liability is transacted in an active market with a quoted market price; 

&#8226; the level of bid-ask spreads; 

&#8226; a lack of pricing transparency due to, among other things, complexity of the product and market liquidity; 

&#8226; whether only a few transactions are observed over a significant period of time; 

&#8226; whether the pricing quotations differ substantially among independent pricing services; 

&#8226; whether inputs to the valuation techniques can be derived from or corroborated with market data; and 

&#8226; whether significant adjustments are made to the observed pricing information or model output to determine the fair value. 

Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that the reporting entity has the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities. A financial instrument is classified as a Level 1 measurement if it is listed on an exchange or is an instrument actively traded in the over-the-counter ("OTC") market where transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume. We regard financial instruments such as debt securities, equity securities and derivative contracts listed on the primary exchanges of a country to be actively traded. Non-exchange-traded instruments classified as Level 1 assets include securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, to-be-announced securities, non-callable securities issued by U.S. Government sponsored enterprises and certain foreign government-backed debt. 

Level 2 inputs are those that are observable either directly or indirectly but do not qualify as Level 1 inputs. We classify mortgage pass-through securities, agency and certain non-agency mortgage collateralized obligations, non-exchange-traded derivative contracts, asset-backed securities, obligations of U.S. states and political subdivisions, corporate debt securities, certain foreign government-backed debt, preferred securities, securities purchased and sold under resale and repurchase agreements, precious metals, certain loans held for sale, certain student loans held for investment, residential mortgage loans whose carrying amount was reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral and real estate owned as Level 2 measurements. Where possible, at least two quotations from independent sources are obtained based on transactions involving comparable assets and liabilities to validate the fair value of these instruments. We have established a process to understand the methodologies and inputs used by the third party pricing services to ensure that pricing information meets the fair value objective and, where appropriate, this pricing data is back-tested to market trade executions. Where significant differences arise among the independent pricing quotes and the internally determined fair value, we investigate and reconcile the differences. If the investigation results in a significant adjustment to the fair value, the instrument will be classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. In general, we have observed that there is a correlation between the credit standing and the market liquidity of a non-derivative instrument. 

Level 2 derivative instruments are generally valued based on discounted future cash flows or an option pricing model adjusted for counterparty credit risk and market liquidity. The fair value of certain derivative products is determined using valuation techniques based on inputs derived from observable indices traded in the OTC market. Appropriate control processes and procedures have been applied to ensure that the derived inputs are applied to value only those instruments that share similar risks to the relevant benchmark indices and therefore demonstrate a similar response to market factors. 

Level 3 inputs are unobservable estimates that management expects market participants would use to determine the fair value of the asset or liability. That is, Level 3 inputs incorporate market participants' assumptions about risk and the risk premium required by market participants in order to bear that risk. We develop Level 3 inputs based on the best information available in the circumstances. At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, our Level 3 measurements included the following: certain structured deposits and structured notes for which the embedded credit, foreign exchange or equity derivatives have significant 

HSBC USA Inc. 

unobservable inputs (e.g., volatility or default correlations), asset-backed credit default swaps with certain inputs which are unobservable, certain asset-backed securities, individually assessed commercial loans, mortgage servicing rights, derivatives referenced to illiquid assets of less desirable credit quality, swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of Visa Class B Shares for which the fair value is dependent upon the final resolution of the related litigation and, at June 30, 2021, certain loans held for sale. See Note 20, "Fair Value Measurements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on Level 3 inputs. 

Level 3 Measurements The following table provides information about Level 3 assets/liabilities in relation to total assets/liabilities measured at fair value at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020:

(3) Includes $81,646 million of assets measured on a recurring basis and $1,206 million of assets measured on a non-recurring basis at June 30, 2021. Includes $97,982 million of assets measured on a recurring basis and $658 million of assets measured on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2020. 

Significant Changes in Fair Value for Level 3 Assets and Liabilities During the second quarter of 2021, we transferred certain loans to held for sale which were determined to be Level 3 assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. See Note 8, "Loans Held for Sale" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

See Note 20, "Fair Value Measurements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on additions to and transfers into (out of) Level 3 measurements during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 as well as for further details including the classification hierarchy associated with assets and liabilities measured at fair value. 

Effect of Changes in Significant Unobservable Inputs &#160; The fair value of certain financial instruments is measured using valuation techniques that incorporate pricing assumptions not supported by, derived from or corroborated by observable market data. The resultant fair value measurements are dependent on unobservable input parameters which can be selected from a range of estimates and may be interdependent. Changes in one or more of the significant unobservable input parameters may change the fair value measurements of these financial instruments. For the purpose of preparing the financial statements, the final valuation inputs selected are based on management's best judgment that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing similar assets or liabilities. 

The unobservable input parameters selected are subject to the internal valuation control processes and procedures. When we perform a test of all the significant input parameters to the extreme values within the range at the same time, it could result in an increase of the overall fair value measurement of approximately $4 million or a decrease of the overall fair value measurement of approximately $2 million at June 30, 2021. The effect of changes in significant unobservable input parameters are primarily driven by the uncertainty in determining the fair value of credit derivatives executed against certain insurers and certain deal-contingent forward starting interest rate derivatives. 

Risk Management 

Overview &#160; Managing risk effectively is fundamental to the delivery of our strategic priorities. 

We use a comprehensive risk management framework across the organization and across all risk types underpinned by our risk culture. This framework fosters continuous monitoring, promotes risk awareness and encourages sound operational and strategic decision-making. It also ensures a consistent approach to identifying, assessing, managing and reporting the risks we accept and incur in our activities. 

Our Board of Directors has the ultimate responsibility for effective management of risk. It is advised on risk matters by the Risk Committee and the Compliance and Conduct Committee of the Board of Directors. In particular, the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors advises the Board of Directors on risk appetite and its alignment with our strategy, risk governance and 

HSBC USA Inc. 

internal controls as well as high-level risk related matters. Robust risk governance and accountability are embedded throughout our business through an established framework that helps to ensure appropriate oversight of and accountability for the effective management of risk. 

Our material risks The principal risks associated with our operations include the following: 

&#8226; Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract; 

&#8226; Treasury risk is the risk of having insufficient capital, liquidity or funding resources to meet financial obligations and satisfy regulatory requirements, including pension risk. Treasury risk also includes the risk to our earnings due to changes in market interest rates; 

&#8226; Market risk is the risk that movements in market factors, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices and commodity prices, will reduce our income or the value of our portfolios; 

&#8226; Resilience risk is the risk that we are unable to provide critical services to our customers, affiliates and counterparties as a result of sustained and significant operational disruption; 

&#8226; Regulatory compliance risk is the risk that we fail to observe the letter and spirit of relevant laws, codes, rules, regulations and standards of good market practice, which as a consequence incur fines and penalties and suffer damage to our business; 

&#8226; Financial crime risk is the risk that we knowingly or unknowingly help parties to commit or to further potentially illegal activity, including money laundering, fraud, bribery and corruption, tax evasion, sanctions breaches, and terrorist and proliferation financing; 

&#8226; Strategic risk is the risk that the business will fail to identify, execute and react appropriately to opportunities and/or threats arising from changes in the market, some of which may emerge over a number of years such as changing economic and political circumstances, customer requirements, demographic trends, regulatory developments or competitor action; and 

&#8226; Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from business decisions informed by models, which can be exacerbated by errors in methodology, design or the way they are used. 

In the course of our regular risk management activities, we use models to help quantify the risk we are taking. We believe that the assumptions used in these models are reasonable within the parameters for which the models have been built and calibrated to operate, but events may unfold differently than what is assumed in the models. Consequently, actual results may differ significantly from model projections. The severe projections of macroeconomic variables during the current COVID-19 pandemic represent events outside the parameters for which the models have been built. As a result, adjustments to model outputs to reflect consideration of management judgment are used with stringent governance in place to ensure appropriate results. Where models do not require adjustments, enhanced model monitoring confirms models are performing as intended. 

See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2020 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of the objectives of our risk management system as well as our risk management policies and practices. Other than the change to financial crime risk management discussed below, there have been no material changes to our approach to risk management since December 31, 2020. 

Credit Risk Management Credit risk is managed through a robust risk identification and control framework which outlines clear and consistent policies, principles and guidance for risk managers. Credit risk is monitored using various internal risk management measures and within limits approved by individuals within a framework of delegated authorities. Our credit risk management procedures are designed for all stages of economic and financial cycles, including challenging periods of market volatility and economic uncertainty. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continued to create economic uncertainty during the first half of 2021. We continue to monitor the performance of our material commercial loans as conditions evolve and take necessary credit actions where warranted. See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2020 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our approach to credit risk. 

Treasury Risk Management We continuously monitor our capital ratios and the impact of market events on our liquidity positions and will continue to adapt our frameworks as necessary to reflect market events and the evolving regulatory landscape and view as to best practices. See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2020 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our approach to treasury risk. 

Capital risk See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in this MD&#38;A for a discussion of our approach to capital risk management, including our capital ratios and regulatory capital requirements. 

Liquidity and funding risk As part of our approach towards liquidity and funding risk management, we employ the measures discussed below to define, monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk in accordance with HSBC policy. 

The Basel Committee based Liquidity Coverage Ratio ("LCR") is designed to be a short-term liquidity measure to ensure banks have sufficient High Quality Liquid Assets ("HQLA") to cover net stressed cash outflows over the next 30 days. At both June 

HSBC USA Inc. 

30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, HSBC USA's LCR exceeded 100 percent. A LCR of 100 percent or higher reflects an unencumbered HQLA balance that is equal to or exceeds liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario. HQLA consists of cash or assets that can be converted into cash at little or no loss of value in private markets. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA are also subject to the U.S. LCR rule and are required to report their LCR to U.S. regulators on a daily basis. Under the Tailoring Rules, an 85 percent LCR requirement applies to Category III firms with weighted short-term wholesale funding under $75 billion, including HSBC North America, and their depository institution subsidiaries, such as HSBC Bank USA, from 100 to 85 percent beginning January 1, 2020. As a result, under the U.S. LCR rule, a LCR of 100 percent or higher reflects an unencumbered HQLA balance that is equal to or exceeds 85 percent of a Category III firm's liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario. During the six months ended June 30, 2021, HSBC Bank USA's LCR under the U.S. LCR rule remained above the 100 percent minimum requirement. 

The U.K. calibration of the Basel Committee based Net Stable Funding Ratio ("NSFR"), which is a longer term liquidity measure with a 12-month time horizon to ensure a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities, is still pending. Therefore, our calculation of NSFR is based on our current interpretation and understanding of the Basel Committee NSFR guidance, which may differ in future periods depending on completion of the U.K. calibration. The U.K. NSFR rules are expected to become effective in January 2022. At both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, HSBC USA's estimated NSFR exceeded 100 percent. A NSFR of 100 percent or more reflects an available stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next 12 months that is equal to or exceeds the required amount of funding for assets and off-balance sheet exposures. In October 2020, U.S. regulators issued a final rule to implement the NSFR in the United States, applicable to certain large banking organizations, including HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA, which took effect July 1, 2021. Consistent with the Tailoring Rules, an 85 percent NSFR requirement applies to Category III firms with weighted short-term wholesale funding under $75 billion, including HSBC North America, and their depository institution subsidiaries, such as HSBC Bank USA. As a result, under the U.S. NSFR rule, a NSFR of 100 percent or more reflects an available stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next 12 months that is equal to or exceeds 85 percent of a Category III firm's required amount of funding for assets and off-balance sheet exposures. At both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, HSBC Bank USA's estimated NSFR under the U.S. NSFR rule exceeded 100 percent. 

As a Category III firm, HSBC North America remains subject to liquidity stress testing on a monthly basis and related liquidity buffer and liquidity risk management requirements. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA have liquidity profiles to support compliance with these rules and may need to make changes to their liquidity profiles to support compliance with any future rules. 

Our liquidity and funding risk management approach includes deposits, supplemented by wholesale borrowing to fund our balance sheet, and using security sales or secured borrowings for liquidity stress situations in our liquidity contingency plans. In addition, regulations require banks to retain a portfolio of HQLA. As such, we are maintaining a large portfolio of high quality sovereign and sovereign guaranteed securities. 

Our ability to regularly attract wholesale funds at a competitive cost is enhanced by strong ratings from the major credit ratings agencies. The following table reflects the short and long-term credit ratings of HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA at June 30, 2021: 

&#160; &#160; 

Moody's S&#38;P Fitch HSBC USA: Short-term borrowings P-1 A-2 F1+ Long-term/senior debt A2 A- A+ HSBC Bank USA: Short-term borrowings P-1 A-1 F1+ Long-term/senior debt Aa3 A+ AA- 

Rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk management practices and legal matters, all of which could lead to adverse ratings actions. 

In June 2021, Moody's downgraded both the long-term deposit rating and the adjusted baseline credit assessment of HSBC Bank USA by one notch following similar downgrades to the senior unsecured rating and the notional baseline credit assessment of HSBC. These rating downgrades reflect Moody's view that the HSBC Group will face challenges in restoring profitability to levels in line with its main peers in the next 12-18 months, which could reduce the capacity of HSBC to provide support to HSBC Bank USA in case of need. Concurrently, Moody's affirmed the standalone baseline credit assessment and the short-term deposit rating of HSBC Bank USA. While these rating actions did not have a material financial impact on our borrowing costs or liquidity, any future actions could have such an impact. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Although we closely monitor and strive to manage factors influencing our credit ratings, there is no assurance that our credit ratings will not change in the future. At June 30, 2021, none of the ratings on the debt of HSBC USA or HSBC Bank USA from any of the rating agencies were under review for potential downgrade. 

See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in this MD&#38;A for further discussion of our liquidity position, including additional information regarding our outstanding borrowings, the remaining availability of our debt issuance programs and our funding strategy. 

Interest rate risk Various techniques are utilized to quantify and monitor risks associated with the repricing characteristics of our assets, liabilities and derivative contracts. See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2020 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our approach to interest rate risk. Interest rate metrics have been adjusted to reflect the impact of our decision to exit our mass market retail banking business as part of our Restructuring Plan. The risk metrics at June 30, 2021 reflect current assumed transaction dates, with balances reduced at projected sale dates and the associated impacts of those reductions is included in both base and shock scenarios. 

Economic value of equity ("EVE") EVE represents the present value of the banking book cash flows that could be provided to our equity holder under a managed run-off scenario. An EVE sensitivity represents the change in EVE due to a defined movement in interest rates. We manage to an immediate parallel upward shock of 200 basis points and an immediate parallel downward shock of 200 basis points to the market implied interest rates. At both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, our EVE remained within risk limits for the up 200 and down 200 basis point interest rate shock scenarios. 

Net interest income simulation modeling techniques We utilize simulation modeling to monitor a number of interest rate scenarios for their impact on projected net interest income. These techniques simulate the impact on projected net interest income under various scenarios, such as rate shock scenarios which assume immediate market rate movements by 100 basis points, as well as scenarios in which rates gradually rise or fall by 100 basis points over a twelve month period. In the gradual scenarios, 25 percent of the interest rate movement occurs at the beginning of each quarter. The following table reflects the impact on our projected net interest income of the scenarios utilized by these modeling techniques: 

June 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Amount % Amount % &#160; (dollars are in millions) Estimated increase (decrease) in projected net interest income (reflects projected rate movements on July 1, 2021 and January 1, 2021, respectively): Resulting from a gradual 100 basis point increase in the yield curve $ 301 &#160; 13 &#160; % $ 186 7 % Resulting from a gradual 100 basis point decrease in the yield curve (256) (11) (213) (8) Other significant scenarios monitored (reflects projected rate movements on July 1, 2021 and January 1, 2021, respectively): Resulting from an immediate 100 basis point increase in the yield curve 468 &#160; 20 &#160; 274 11 Resulting from an immediate 100 basis point decrease in the yield curve (486) (21) (379) (15) 

The projections do not take into consideration possible complicating factors such as the effect of changes in interest rates on the credit quality, size and composition of the balance sheet. Therefore, although this provides a reasonable estimate of interest rate sensitivity, actual results will differ from these estimates, possibly by significant amounts. 

Market Risk Management Exposure to market risk is separated into two portfolios: 

&#8226; Trading portfolios comprise positions arising from market-making and warehousing of client-derived positions. 

&#8226; Non-trading portfolios comprise positions that primarily arise from the interest rate management of our retail and commercial banking assets and liabilities and financial investments classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity. 

We apply similar risk management policies and measurement techniques to both trading and non-trading portfolios. Our objective is to manage and control market risk exposures to optimize return on risk while maintaining a market profile consistent with our established risk appetite. See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2020 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our approach to market risk. 

Value at risk ("VaR") VaR is a technique for estimating potential losses on risk positions as a result of movements in market rates and prices over a specified time horizon and to a given level of confidence. The use of VaR is integrated into market risk management and calculated for all trading positions regardless of how we capitalize them. In addition, we calculate VaR for non-trading portfolios to have a complete picture of risk. VaR measures are calculated to a 99 percent confidence level and use a one-day holding period. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Trading portfolios Trading VaR generates primarily from the Markets and Securities Services unit of our GBM business segment. Portfolios comprise mainly foreign exchange products, precious metals (i.e., gold, silver, platinum) and credit default swaps. 

The following graph summarizes daily VaR for our trading portfolios at a 99 percent confidence level (in millions): 

The following table summarizes our trading VaR for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and at December 31, 2020:

(1) Portfolio diversification is the market risk dispersion effect of holding a portfolio containing different risk types. It represents the reduction in unsystematic market risk that occurs when combining a number of different risk types, for example, foreign exchange, interest rate and credit spread, together in one portfolio. It is measured as the difference between the sum of the VaR by individual risk type and the combined total VaR. A negative number represents the benefit of portfolio diversification. As the maximum and minimum occur on different days for different risk types, it is not meaningful to calculate a portfolio diversification benefit for these measures. 

(2) The total VaR is non-additive across risk types due to diversification effects. For presentation purposes, portfolio diversification of the VaR for trading portfolios includes VaR-based risk-not-in-VaR. 

Back-testing We routinely validate the accuracy of our VaR models by back-testing them against hypothetical profit and loss that excludes non-modeled items such as fees, commissions and revenues of intra-day transactions from the actual reported profit and loss. We would expect, under stable market conditions, to see two or three losses in excess of VaR at the 99 percent confidence level over a one-year period. However, in periods of unstable market conditions, we could see an increase in the number of back-testing exceptions. 

During the six months ended June 30, 2021, we experienced no loss back-testing exceptions. 

Non-trading portfolios Non-trading VaR predominantly relates to Markets Treasury and represents the potential negative changes in the investment portfolio market value (which includes available-for-sale and held-to-maturity assets) and associated hedges. Our investment portfolio holdings comprise mainly U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed and U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities. Our non-trading VaR exposure is driven by interest rates and agency spread volatility.

(1) Refer to the Trading VaR table above for additional information. 

Non trading VaR was higher at June 30, 2021 as compared with December 31, 2021 due primarily to an increase in volatility of interest rates and spread volatility on U.S. Treasury and U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed securities. 

Non-trading VaR also includes the interest rate risk of non-trading financial assets and liabilities held by the global businesses and transfer priced into Markets Treasury which has the mandate to centrally manage and hedge it. See "Treasury Risk Management" above for a broader discussion on how interest rate risk is managed. 

Financial Crime Risk Management The Financial Crime Risk Management Committee ("FCRMC"), chaired by the U.S. Head of Financial Crime and Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Officer, served as the principal financial crime governance forum, responsible for the management of financial crime risk. As a reflection of the growing maturity and effectiveness of financial crime risk management, the functions of the FCRMC were integrated into the Risk Management Meeting ("RMM") during the first quarter of 2021. With this change, the RMM now oversees the risk management of both regulatory compliance and financial crime. There have been no other material changes to our approach to financial crime risk management since December 31, 2020.

CONSOLIDATED AVERAGE BALANCES AND INTEREST RATES 

The following table summarizes the quarter-to-date and year-to-date average daily balances of the principal components of assets, liabilities and equity together with their respective interest amounts and rates earned or paid. Net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by the average interest earning assets from which interest income is earned. Loan interest for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 included fees of $28 million and $48 million, respectively, compared with fees of $19 million and $36 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively.
