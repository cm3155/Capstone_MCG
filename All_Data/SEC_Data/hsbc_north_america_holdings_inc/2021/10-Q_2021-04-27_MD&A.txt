HSBC USA Inc. 

Executive Overview 

HSBC USA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC North America, which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC. HUSI may also be referred to in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&#38;A") as "we," "us" or "our." 

Economic Environment &#160; The U.S. economy continued its recovery during the first quarter of 2021 after deteriorating rapidly into recession during the second quarter of 2020 driven by the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in disruption to business and economic activity as well as to the capital markets. COVID-19's effects in the U.S. and globally have been extreme, and the duration of the pandemic and its ultimate repercussions continue to remain unclear. Unprecedented government economic intervention, including additional government support enacted during the first quarter of 2021, has likely dampened the pandemic's effects, but at uncertain long-term cost. However, these government support measures combined with accelerated progress on vaccinations and the easing of restrictions by many states, have helped speed the economic recovery along considerably. U.S. Gross Domestic Product ("GDP") is currently forecast to grow at an annual rate in excess of 6.0 percent in the first quarter of 2021 while the U.S. economy added over 400 thousand jobs during the first quarter of 2021 and the total unemployment rate fell to 6.0 percent at March 2021 as compared with 6.7 percent at December 2020. In March 2021, the FRB decided to hold short-term interest rates steady (at near zero) and indicated it expects short-term rates to remain low for some time. The FRB also announced that it will continue to increase its holdings of U.S. Treasury and U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed securities, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. 

Although the U.S. economy improved in the first quarter of 2021, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic conditions both in the United States and abroad continues to create global uncertainty about the future economic environment, including the pace and extent of an economic recovery. Concerns over interest rate levels, energy prices, domestic and global policy issues, including civil unrest in the U.S., trade policy in the U.S. and geopolitical events as well as the implications of those events on the markets in general further add to this global uncertainty. Interest rate levels and energy prices, in combination with global economic conditions, fiscal and monetary policy and the level of regulatory and government scrutiny of financial institutions will continue to impact our results in 2021 and beyond. 

Performance, Developments and Trends As mentioned above, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted global financial markets, negatively affected supply and demand across a broad range of industries and caused disruption to our customers, vendors and employees. This pandemic has had a significant impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Despite the improvement in economic conditions during the first quarter of 2021 as discussed above, the circumstances around this pandemic will continue to impact our business in future periods. The extent of such impact will depend on the outcome of certain developments, including but not limited to, the duration of the pandemic as well as its continuing impact on our customers, vendors and employees, all of which are uncertain. See Part II, Item 1A, "Risk Factors - Risks related to the impact of COVID-19," in our 2020 Form 10-K for further discussion. 

We continue to progress our strategic plan to restructure our operations ("Restructuring Plan") as discussed further in Note 2, "Strategic Initiatives," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We remain committed to our multi-year strategic plan to re-profile our business, and continue to explore strategic options with respect to our retail operations to focus on our high net worth client base and wealth management products.

(3) Prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the current period presentation. See Note 16, "Retained Earnings and Regulatory Capital Requirements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 

Net income (loss) was income of $339 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared with a loss of $1,283 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020. Income (loss) before income tax was income of $460 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared with a loss of $1,440 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase in income (loss) before income tax during the three months ended March 31, 2021 was due primarily to a lower provision for credit losses driven by improved economic conditions and lower operating expenses driven by the non-recurrence of a $784 million goodwill impairment charge recorded during the first quarter of 2020 and lower occupancy expense. Also contributing to the increase was higher net interest income. 

Our reported results in all periods were impacted by certain items management believes to be significant, which affect comparability between periods. Significant items are excluded to arrive at adjusted performance because management would ordinarily identify and consider them separately to better understand underlying business trends. The following table summarizes the impact of these significant items for all periods presented: 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 2020 &#160; (in millions) Income (loss) before income tax, as reported $ 460 &#160; $ (1,440) Goodwill impairment &#8212; &#160; 784 

Costs to achieve (1) 

25 &#160; 100 

Adjusted performance (2) 

$ 485 &#160; $ (556) 

(1) Reflects costs related to the delivery of our Restructuring Plan. Costs to achieve primarily consists of lease impairment and other related costs, severance costs, allocated costs from HSBC Technology &#38; Services ("HTSU"), and trading losses associated with the exit of certain derivative contracts. See Note 2, "Strategic Initiatives," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of these costs. The expense during the three months ended March 31, 2021 also includes $7 million of allocated costs from other HSBC affiliates related to the HSBC Group's restructuring activities. The expense during the three months ended March 31, 2020 also includes a $9 million gain on the sale of one of our owned retail branch properties. 

(2) Represents a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure. 

Excluding the impact of the items in the table above, our adjusted performance during the three months ended March 31, 2021 increased $1,041 million compared with the prior year period due primarily to a lower provision for credit losses driven by improved economic conditions. Also contributing to the increase was lower operating expenses and higher net interest income. 

See "Results of Operations" for a more detailed discussion of our operating trends. In addition, see "Balance Sheet Review" for further discussion on our asset and liability trends, "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for further discussion on funding and capital and "Credit Quality" for additional discussion on our credit trends. 

London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") Transition Regulators and central banks in various national jurisdictions continue to actively work to help transition from interbank offered rates ("IBORs") to acceptable alternative rates, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") recommended by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee convened by the FRB. We have a considerable number of contracts referencing IBORs, primarily U.S. dollar ("USD") LIBOR, such as loans, derivatives and long-term debt. 

In March 2021, the United Kingdom ("U.K.") Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA") confirmed that all LIBOR tenors will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after December 31, 2021, in the case of the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR tenors, and immediately after June 30, 2023, in the case of the remaining overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and twelve-month USD LIBOR tenors. The extension of certain USD LIBOR tenors until June 2023 will allow many legacy LIBOR-based contracts to mature naturally and significantly aids in reducing the risks associated with transitioning legacy contracts onto replacement rates. Separately, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association ("ISDA") has confirmed that the fallback spread adjustments to be used in its ISDA fallbacks have been fixed as of the date of the FCA announcement. As a result, the ISDA fallbacks (i.e. to the adjusted risk-free rate plus the fixed spread adjustment) will automatically occur for outstanding derivative contracts that incorporate the ISDA fallback language or adhere to the ISDA fallback protocol generally when each LIBOR tenor ceases or becomes non-representative. For all outstanding derivatives referenced to USD LIBOR tenors, the ISDA fallback will occur immediately after June 30, 2023. These announcements provide clarity on the future terms of the many derivative contracts which now incorporate the ISDA fallbacks. In addition, during the first quarter of 2021, central clearing counterparties amended their rules to incorporate the new ISDA fallback language and adhere to the ISDA fallback protocol for cleared derivative contracts. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

We continue to actively participate in HSBC's global transition program with the objective of facilitating an orderly transition of all products, processes, models and curves, as well as all legacy LIBOR-based contracts, onto replacement rates. In particular, during the first quarter of 2021, we: 

&#8226; implemented the capabilities to offer SOFR-based derivatives in our Markets Treasury function and SOFR-based bilateral loans in our Commercial Banking business; and 

&#8226; continued to reduce our LIBOR derivative exposures through the exit or transfer of certain derivative contracts as part of our Restructuring Plan. 

The ability of HUSI and its clients to transition legacy contracts onto replacement rates is dependent on the availability and market liquidity of products that reference replacement rates, including SOFR, and on our clients being ready and able to adapt their own processes and systems to accommodate the replacement products. We continue to engage with industry participants, the official sector and our clients to support an orderly transition and the mitigation of the risks resulting from the transition. For further discussion of our LIBOR transition program and the associated risks, see "Executive Overview" in MD&#38;A in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Other COVID-19 Related Developments 

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted economic activity in many countries, including the United States, and the U.S. Government has taken multiple actions to mitigate the magnitude and persistence of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The United States has been operating under a presidentially declared national emergency since March 2020. In March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act") was signed into law, which provided financial assistance for businesses and individuals and targeted regulatory relief for financial institutions. In December 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act was signed into law, which extended many of the CARES Act programs and provided additional financial assistance for businesses and individuals. 

Loan Forbearance Initiatives The CARES Act created a forbearance program for federally-backed mortgage loans and provided financial institutions with the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under U.S. GAAP related to troubled debt restructurings ("TDR Loans") beginning March 1, 2020. This TDR Loan guidance can be applied until the earlier of January 1, 2022 or 60 days following the termination of the presidentially declared national emergency. We elected to adopt the TDR Loan guidance in the CARES Act and are not applying TDR Loan classification to COVID-19 related loan modifications in the form of a long-term payment deferral (for commercial loans all payment modifications, including all payment deferrals) granted to borrowers that were current (less than 30 days past due) as of December 31, 2019 which otherwise may have been reported as TDR Loans. The CARES Act also prohibits servicers of federally-backed mortgage loans from initiating any foreclosure action on any residential property that is not vacant or abandoned for a period of 60 days. This moratorium has been extended until June 30, 2021. In addition to these federal measures, some state governments have taken action to require forbearance with respect to certain loans and fees. We are continuing to monitor federal, state and international regulatory developments in relation to COVID-19 and their potential impact on our operations. 

In 2020, federal banking regulators issued a revised interagency statement on loan modifications and the reporting for financial institutions working with customers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic ("Interagency Statement"). The Interagency Statement confirmed that COVID-19 related short-term loan modifications (e.g., payment deferrals of six months or less) provided to borrowers that were current (less than 30 days past due) at the time the relief was granted are not TDR Loans. Borrowers that do not meet the criteria in the CARES Act or the Interagency Statement are assessed for TDR Loan classification in accordance with our accounting policies. Through March 31, 2021, these loans were not significant. 

In addition, under the Interagency Statement, for COVID-19 related loan modifications in the form of a payment deferral, the borrower&#8217;s past due status will not be affected during the deferral period and, if the loan was accruing at the time the relief was granted, the loan will generally not be placed on nonaccrual status as long as the borrower utilizes a payment deferral of six months or less. For consumer mortgage loans, when a borrower utilizes a payment deferral of more than six months, the loan will generally be placed on nonaccrual status and, if the loan does not meet the criteria in the CARES Act, assessed for TDR Loan classification. Any accrued interest recorded on these loans is generally not reversed against income and will remain recorded as accrued interest receivable. We have not modified our commercial loan nonaccrual policies as a result of this guidance. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

We have implemented various loan modification payment deferral programs to provide borrowers relief from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The following table summarizes information about loans under these programs as of March 31, 2021. Not included in the following table are loans that have exited the programs as well as other forms of relief that we have provided to commercial clients affected by the impact of COVID-19, such as covenant waivers and amendments, and deferrals of financial statement and covenant compliance reporting requirements.

(1) Represents the percentage of loans under a COVID-19 related payment deferral program at March 31, 2021 for which at least one payment was collected during the first quarter of 2021. 

(2) Total number of commercial loans is less than 20. 

(3) Includes $675 million of consumer mortgage loans where the borrowers were provided with extended payment deferral relief of more than six months at March 31, 2021. Due to our CARES Act election, $646 million of these loans were exempted from TDR assessment. In addition, $535 million of these loans have been placed on nonaccrual status, because the borrowers utilized a payment deferral of more than six months. 

When the payment relief period ends, borrowers have various options, including repaying the deferred payments in full, repaying the deferred payments over an installment period or moving the deferred payments to the end of the loan. If a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty when the payment relief period ends, they may enter into a modification program to reduce the interest rate and extend the term of the loan which would result in the loan being classified as a TDR Loan. As of March 31, 2021, $674 million and $978 million of commercial and consumer loans, respectively, have exited a COVID-19 related payment deferral program, of which nil and $33 million, respectively, entered into a modification program upon exiting that resulted in the loans being classified as TDR Loans. Of the commercial and consumer loans that have exited a COVID-19 related payment deferral program, 100 percent and 82 percent, respectively, were current or less than 30 days past due as of March 31, 2021. 

Paycheck Protection Program The CARES Act created a new loan guarantee program entitled the Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP") targeted to provide small businesses with support to cover payroll and certain other expenses. Loans made under the PPP are fully guaranteed by the Small Business Administration ("SBA"), whose guarantee is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. PPP covered loans also afford borrowers forgiveness up to the principal amount of the PPP covered loan, plus accrued interest, if the loan proceeds are used to retain workers and maintain payroll or to make certain mortgage interest, lease and utility payments, and certain other criteria are satisfied. The SBA will reimburse PPP lenders for any amount of a PPP covered loan that is forgiven, and PPP lenders will not be held liable for any representations made by PPP borrowers in connection with their requests for loan forgiveness. Lenders receive pre-determined fees for processing and servicing PPP loans. In addition, PPP loans are risk-weighted at zero percent under the generally-applicable Standardized 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Approach used to calculate risk-weighted assets for regulatory capital purposes. HSBC Bank USA is a PPP participating lender and had loans funded under the PPP which totaled $1,294 million at March 31, 2021. The SBA deadline for accepting PPP loan applications from participating lenders has been extended until May 31, 2021. 

Basis of Reporting 

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"). 

Group Reporting Basis We report financial information to HSBC in accordance with HSBC Group accounting and reporting policies, which apply International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRSs") as issued by the IASB. As a result, our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the basis of HSBC Group's accounting and reporting policies ("Group Reporting Basis"). Because operating results on the Group Reporting Basis are used in managing our businesses and rewarding performance of employees, our management also separately monitors profit before tax under this basis of reporting. The following table reconciles our U.S. GAAP versus Group Reporting Basis profit before tax: 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 2020 &#160; (in millions) Profit (loss) before tax &#8211; U.S. GAAP basis $ 460 &#160; $ (1,440) Adjustments: Expected credit losses (139) 347 &#160; Loans held for sale (8) 2 &#160; Pension and other postretirement benefit costs (4) (5) Renewable energy tax credit investments 4 &#160; 2 &#160; Other long-lived assets 10 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Goodwill impairment &#8212; &#160; 91 &#160; Other 2 &#160; 5 &#160; Profit (loss) before tax &#8211; Group Reporting Basis $ 325 &#160; $ (998) 

The significant differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis as they impact our results are summarized in Note 24, "Business Segments," in the our 2020 Form 10-K. There have been no significant changes since December 31, 2020 in the differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis impacting our results. Differences in reported profit before tax in the table above that were individually significant for the periods presented are explained below. 

During the first quarter of 2021, expected credit losses were lower under U.S. GAAP than under the Group Reporting Basis. Under the Group Reporting Basis, a majority of our loans are considered to be in "stage 1" (which requires a 12-month expected credit losses estimate), while under U.S. GAAP such loans require a lifetime expected credit losses ("lifetime ECL") estimate. Primarily as a result of the different requirements, releases in credit reserves driven by improved economic conditions, which resulted in improved economic forecasts used to calculate expected credit losses and improvements in credit conditions associated with certain clients, were more pronounced under U.S. GAAP. Client paydowns also contributed to the higher releases in credit reserves under U.S. GAAP. 

During the first quarter of 2020, expected credit losses were higher under U.S. GAAP than under the Group Reporting Basis. Primarily as a result of the different requirements related to stage 1 loans discussed above, loss provisions driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts used to calculate expected credit losses, downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and loan growth as clients drew on their available lines of credit, were more pronounced under U.S. GAAP. 

During the first quarter of 2020, goodwill impairment charges were lower under the Group Reporting Basis than under U.S. GAAP. Under the Group Reporting Basis, goodwill was amortized until 2005, however goodwill was amortized under U.S. GAAP until 2002, which resulted in lower carrying amounts of goodwill and, therefore, lower impairment charges under the Group Reporting Basis.

Balance Sheet Review 

The following table provides balance sheet totals at March 31, 2021 and increases (decreases) since December 31, 2020: 

&#160; &#160; Increase (Decrease) From &#160; &#160; December 31, 2020 

&#160; &#160; 

March 31, 2021 Amount % &#160; (dollars are in millions) Period end assets: Short-term investments $ 58,814 &#160; $ 7,413 14.4 % Loans, net 60,673 &#160; (400) (.7) Loans held for sale 351 &#160; 14 4.2 Trading assets 25,822 &#160; (1,462) (5.4) Securities 42,496 &#160; (7,157) (14.4) All other assets 6,700 &#160; 14 .2 $ 194,856 &#160; $ (1,578) (.8) % Period end liabilities and equity: Total deposits $ 148,582 &#160; $ 3,432 2.4 % Trading liabilities 2,319 &#160; (3,078) (57.0) Short-term borrowings 5,243 &#160; 291 5.9 Long-term debt 18,179 &#160; (1,800) (9.0) Interest, taxes and other liabilities 2,559 &#160; (106) (4.0) Total equity 17,974 &#160; (317) (1.7) $ 194,856 &#160; $ (1,578) (.8) % 

Short-Term Investments Short-term investments include cash and due from banks, interest bearing deposits with banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell. Balances may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our liquidity position at the time and our strategy for deploying liquidity. Short-term investments increased compared with December 31, 2020 due to an increase in overall liquidity as we raised funds in advance of their usage. The increase in funds was driven by net sales, paydowns and maturities of securities as well as higher deposits as our customers increased their demand and savings deposits in response to the economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken by the U.S. Government to provide financial support to households and businesses. These increases were partially offset by repayments of precious metal trading liabilities and long-term debt.

(3) See "Credit Quality" in this MD&#38;A for a discussion of trends in our allowance for credit losses on loans. 

Commercial loans decreased compared with December 31, 2020 due primarily to the impact of our efforts to improve returns through disciplined lending, paydowns and lower demand from clients reflecting increased capital markets activity. These decreases were partially offset by higher loans to affiliates and PPP loan originations. The decline in commercial non-affiliate loans was primarily in the diversified financial, real estate, energy and semiconductor industries, partially offset by an increase in the banking industry. 

Consumer loans decreased modestly compared with December 31, 2020 due primarily to paydowns in credit card receivables reflecting seasonality and lower origination volumes. 

The following table presents loan-to-value ("LTV") ratios for our residential mortgage loan portfolio, excluding mortgage loans held for sale:

(1) LTVs for first liens are calculated using the loan balance as of the reporting date. LTVs for second liens are calculated using the loan balance as of the reporting date plus the senior lien amount at origination. Current estimated property values are derived from the property's appraised value at the time of loan origination updated by the change in the Federal Housing Finance Agency's House Price Index ("HPI") at either a Core Based Statistical Area or state level. The estimated value of the homes could differ from actual fair values due to changes in condition of the underlying property, variations in housing price changes within metropolitan statistical areas and other factors. As a result, actual property values associated with loans that end in foreclosure may be significantly lower than the estimates used for purposes of this disclosure. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

(2) Current estimated property values are calculated using the most current HPIs available and applied on an individual loan basis, which results in an approximate three month delay in the production of reportable statistics. Therefore, the information in the table above reflects current estimated property values using HPIs at December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively. 

Loans Held for Sale The following table summarizes loans held for sale at March 31, 2021 and increases (decreases) since December 31, 2020: 

&#160; &#160; Increase (Decrease) From &#160; &#160; December 31, 2020 

&#160; &#160; 

March 31, 2021 Amount % &#160; (dollars are in millions) Commercial loans: Real estate, including construction $ &#8212; &#160; $ (10) (100.0) % Global banking 256 &#160; 137 * Total commercial 256 &#160; 127 98.4 Consumer loans: Residential mortgages 95 &#160; (113) (54.3) Total consumer 95 &#160; (113) (54.3) Total loans held for sale $ 351 &#160; $ 14 4.2 % 

* Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. 

Commercial loans held for sale increased compared with December 31, 2020. Included in commercial loans held for sale are certain loans that we have elected to designate under the fair value option which consists of loans that we originate in connection with our participation in a number of syndicated credit facilities with the intent of selling them to unaffiliated third parties as well as loans that we purchase from the secondary market and hold as hedges against our exposure to certain total return swaps. The fair value of these loans totaled $83 million and $36 million at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Balances will fluctuate from period to period depending on the volume and level of activity. 

Commercial loans held for sale also includes certain loans that we no longer intend to hold for investment and were transferred to held for sale which totaled $173 million and $93 million at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

Consumer loans held for sale decreased compared with December 31, 2020. Included in residential mortgage loans held for sale are agency-eligible residential mortgage loans which are originated and held for sale to third parties, currently on a servicing retained basis. Balances will fluctuate from period to period depending on the volume and level of activity. Gains and losses from the sale of these residential mortgage loans are reflected as a component of other income in the accompanying consolidated statement of income (loss). 

Excluding the commercial loans designated under fair value option discussed above, loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value, with adjustments to fair value being recorded as a valuation allowance through other revenues. The valuation allowance on consumer loans held for sale was nil at both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The valuation allowance on commercial loans held for sale was $1 million at both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

Trading Assets and Liabilities The following table summarizes trading assets and liabilities at March 31, 2021 and increases (decreases) since December 31, 2020: 

&#160; &#160; Increase (Decrease) From &#160; &#160; December 31, 2020 

&#160; &#160; 

March 31, 2021 Amount % &#160; (dollars are in millions) Trading assets: Securities (1)

(1) See Note 3, "Trading Assets and Liabilities," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a breakout of trading securities by category. 

Trading securities balances were lower compared with December 31, 2020 due primarily to a decrease in U.S. Treasury positions, partially offset by an increase in equity positions. Trading security positions are held as economic hedges of interest rate, credit and equity derivative products issued to clients of domestic and emerging markets. Balances of securities sold, not yet purchased were lower compared with December 31, 2020 driven by a decrease in short U.S. Treasury positions related to economic hedges of derivatives in the interest rate trading portfolio. 

Precious metals trading assets decreased compared with December 31, 2020 due primarily to a decrease in our own silver inventory position, partially offset by an increase in our own palladium inventory position. Payables for precious metals were lower compared with December 31, 2020 reflecting a decrease in borrowing of gold inventory to support client activity levels. Precious metal positions may not represent our net underlying exposure as we may use derivatives contracts to reduce our risk associated with these positions, the fair value of which would appear in derivatives in the table above. 

Derivative asset and liability balances both decreased compared with December 31, 2020 mainly from market movements and reduced positions driven by the exit or transfer of certain derivative contracts as part of our Restructuring Plan. Market movements resulted in lower valuations of interest rate, foreign exchange, equity and credit derivatives. Market movements on commodity derivatives were mixed resulting in higher derivative asset valuations, but lower derivative liability valuations. 

Securities Securities include securities available-for-sale and securities held-to-maturity, net. Securities balances were lower compared with December 31, 2020 driven by net sales, paydowns and maturities as part of our continuing strategy to maximize returns while balancing the securities portfolio for risk management purposes as well as unfavorable market valuations due to increasing yields. The decline in securities balances was primarily in U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed and foreign sovereign securities which was partially offset by net purchases of U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities. 

All Other Assets &#160; All other assets includes, among other items, properties and equipment, net and goodwill. All other assets were flat compared with December 31, 2020 as higher tax assets and higher outstanding clearing receivables from correspondent banks were largely offset by lower cash collateral posted. 

During the third quarter of 2020, we completed a quantitative impairment test of goodwill and determined that the fair value of our Commercial Banking reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, with its fair value being approximately 110 percent of book value, including allocated goodwill. Our fair value calculations are highly sensitive to certain assumptions and estimates used. We will continue to monitor changes to our business forecasts as we continue to perform periodic analyses of the risks and strategies of our business and product offerings. If deterioration in economic and credit conditions, a change in the strategy or performance of our business or product offerings, or an increase in the capital requirements of our business occurs, interim goodwill impairment tests could again be required, which may result in an impairment charge.

Deposits The following table summarizes deposit balances by major depositor categories at March 31, 2021 and increases (decreases) since December 31, 2020: 

&#160; &#160; Increase (Decrease) From &#160; &#160; December 31, 2020 

&#160; &#160; 

March 31, 2021 Amount % &#160; (dollars are in millions) Individuals, partnerships and corporations $ 131,347 &#160; $ (1,118) (.8) % Domestic and foreign banks 14,299 &#160; 4,079 39.9 U.S. government and states and political subdivisions 339 &#160; 18 5.6 Foreign governments and official institutions 2,597 &#160; 453 21.1 Total deposits $ 148,582 &#160; $ 3,432 2.4 % 

Total core deposits (1) 

$ 131,230 &#160; $ 5,644 4.5 % 

(1) Core deposits, as calculated in accordance with Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council ("FFIEC") guidelines, generally include all domestic demand, money market and other savings accounts, as well as time deposits with balances not exceeding $250,000. 

Total deposits increased compared with December 31, 2020 as our customers increased their demand and savings deposits in response to the economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken by the U.S. Government to provide financial support to households and businesses. Also contributing to the increase was higher overall deposits from affiliates. However, a shift in mix resulted in an increase in deposits from bank affiliates, partially offset by a decline in deposits from non-bank affiliates which drove the reduction in deposits from individuals, partnerships and corporations. The increase in deposits was partially offset by a decline in time deposits. 

Short-Term Borrowings Short-term borrowings increased slightly compared with December 31, 2020 reflecting higher short-term borrowings from affiliates. 

Long-Term Debt Long-term debt decreased compared with December 31, 2020 as the impact of debt issuances, including $1,500 million of senior debt issued to HSBC North America during the first quarter of 2021, was more than offset by debt retirements. Debt issuances during the three months ended March 31, 2021 totaled $2,288 million, of which $82 million was issued by HSBC Bank USA. 

Incremental issuances from our shelf registration statement with the SEC totaled $706 million of senior structured notes during the three months ended March 31, 2021. Total long-term debt outstanding under this shelf was $8,364 million and $9,138 million at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

Incremental issuances from the HSBC Bank USA Global Bank Note Program totaled $82 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021. Total debt outstanding under this program was $1,743 million and $1,888 million at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

Borrowings from the FHLB totaled $2,750 million and $4,250 million at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

Interest, Taxes and Other Liabilities Interest, taxes and other liabilities were lower compared with December 31, 2020 due primarily to a lower liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures and lower accrued incentive compensation, partially offset by higher outstanding settlement balances related to security purchases.

Net Interest Income Net interest income is the total interest income on earning assets less the total interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds. An analysis of consolidated average balances and interest rates is presented in this MD&#38;A under the caption "Consolidated Average Balances and Interest Rates." 

The significant components of net interest margin are summarized in the following table: 

&#160; &#160; 2021 Compared with 2020 Increase (Decrease) &#160; Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 Volume Rate 2020 &#160; (dollars are in millions) Interest income: Short-term investments $ 16 &#160; $ 53 $ (124) $ 87 Trading securities 48 &#160; (18) (14) 80 Securities 177 &#160; (21) (45) 243 Commercial loans 282 &#160; (72) (94) 448 Consumer loans 169 &#160; 1 (22) 190 Other 9 &#160; (8) (2) 19 Total interest income 701 &#160; (65) (301) 1,067 Interest expense: Deposits 81 &#160; 38 (278) 321 Short-term borrowings 5 &#160; (13) (22) 40 Long-term debt 82 &#160; (37) (79) 198 Tax liabilities and other 2 &#160; (1) (1) 4 Total interest expense 170 &#160; (13) (380) 563 Net interest income $ 531 &#160; $ (52) $ 79 $ 504 Yield on total interest earning assets

(1) Represents the benefit associated with interest earning assets in excess of interest bearing liabilities. Increased percentages reflect growth in this excess or a higher cost of interest bearing liabilities, while decreased percentages reflect a reduction in this excess or a lower cost of interest bearing liabilities. 

Net interest income increased during the three months ended March 31, 2021 due primarily to lower interest expense from interest bearing liabilities driven by lower rates paid and a shift in mix to lower cost deposits. The increase was partially offset by lower interest income from interest earning assets driven by lower yields on short-term investments, loans and securities as well as the unfavorable impact of lower average interest earning asset balances, primarily commercial loans, securities and trading securities. 

Short-term investments Interest income decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2021 due to lower yields earned on these balances reflecting the impact of lower market rates, partially offset by higher average balances. 

Trading securities Interest income decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2021 due to lower average balances and lower yields reflecting the impact of lower market rates. The decrease in average balances was driven by declines in U.S. Treasury, foreign sovereign and corporate bond positions, partially offset by an increase in equity positions. Interest income associated with trading securities was partially offset within trading revenue by the performance of the associated derivatives as discussed further below. 

Securities Interest income was lower during the three months ended March 31, 2021 due to lower yields reflecting the impact of lower market rates and lower average balances. Lower average balances were driven by declines in U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury securities, partially offset by an increase in U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Commercial loans Interest income was lower during the three months ended March 31, 2021 due to lower yields reflecting the impact of lower market rates on variable rate loans and lower rates on newly originated PPP loans. Also contributing to the decrease was lower average balances driven by the impact of our efforts to improve returns through disciplined lending, lower demand from clients reflecting increased capital markets activity coupled with economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as lower loans to affiliates. 

Consumer loans Interest income decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2021 due to lower yields reflecting the impact of lower market rates on residential mortgage and home equity mortgage loans. 

Other Lower interest income during the three months ended March 31, 2021 was due primarily to lower average cash collateral balances. 

Deposits Interest expense decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2021 due to lower rates paid reflecting the impact of lower market rates, partially offset by higher average balances. Higher average balances were due primarily to growth in savings and demand deposits as we raised funds and our customers increased their deposits in response to the economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken by the U.S. Government to provide financial support to households and businesses. The increase in balances was partially offset by a decline in time deposits. 

Short-term borrowings Lower interest expense during the three months ended March 31, 2021 was due to lower rates paid reflecting the impact of lower market rates and lower average borrowings driven by a decline in securities sold under repurchase agreements. 

Long-term debt Interest expense decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2021 due to lower rates paid reflecting the impact of lower market rates on variable rate borrowings and lower average borrowings. 

Tax liabilities and other Interest expense was relatively flat during the three months ended March 31, 2021. 

Provision for Credit Losses &#160; The following table summarizes the components of the provision for credit losses: 

Increase (Decrease) Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 2020 Amount % &#160; (dollars are in millions) Loans: Commercial loans: Real estate, including construction $ (25) $ 51 $ (76) * Business and corporate banking (53) 213 (266) * Global banking (65) 110 (175) * Other commercial &#8212; &#160; 1 (1) (100.0) Total commercial loans (143) 375 (518) * Consumer loans: Residential mortgages (2) 30 (32) * Home equity mortgages (3) 3 (6) * Credit cards (1) 95 (96) * Other consumer 4 &#160; 9 (5) (55.6) Total consumer loans (2) 137 (139) * Total loans (145) 512 (657) * Other financial assets measured at amortized cost &#8212; &#160; 2 (2) (100.0) Securities available-for-sale &#8212; &#160; (1) 1 100.0 Off-balance sheet credit exposures (82) 213 (295) * Total provision for credit losses $ (227) $ 726 $ (953) * 

* Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. 

Our provision for credit losses decreased $953 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021 due to a lower provision for credit losses on both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios as well as a lower provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures. 

The provision for credit losses on our commercial loan portfolio decreased $518 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021 reflecting a release in credit loss reserves compared with a loss provision in the prior year period. The release in credit 

HSBC USA Inc. 

reserves in the current year period was driven by improved economic conditions which resulted in improved economic forecasts used for calculating lifetime ECL and improvements in credit conditions associated with certain clients as well as a decline in credit reserves for risk factors associated with economic uncertainty. Client paydowns also contributed to the release in credit reserves in the current year period. In the prior year period, the loss provision was driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts used for calculating lifetime ECL and provisions for risk factors associated with large loan exposures, downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and loan growth as clients drew on their available lines of credit. 

The provision for credit losses on our consumer loan portfolio decreased $139 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021 reflecting a modest release in credit loss reserves compared with a loss provision in the prior year period. The release in credit reserves in the current year period was driven by improved economic conditions which resulted in improved economic forecasts used for calculating lifetime ECL and a release in credit reserves for risk factors primarily associated with forbearance accounts as well as a release in credit reserves due to a decline in credit card balances. In the prior year period, the loss provision was driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts used for calculating lifetime ECL as well as higher dollars of delinquency in credit cards and, to a lesser extent, growth in personal loan balances due to new product promotions. 

The provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures decreased $295 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021 reflecting a release in credit loss reserves compared with a loss provision in the prior year period. The release in credit reserves in the current year period resulted from the improved economic conditions consistent with commercial loans as discussed above. In the prior year period, the loss provision resulted from the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic consistent with commercial loans as discussed above. 

See "Credit Quality" in this MD&#38;A for additional discussion on the allowance for credit losses associated with our various loan portfolios. 

Other Revenues The following table summarizes the components of other revenues:

* Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. 

Credit card fees, net Credit card fees, net were relatively flat during the three months ended March 31, 2021 as lower interchange fees due to lower customer spending were largely offset by lower cost estimates associated with our credit rewards program. 

Trust and investment management fees Trust and investment management fees decreased modestly during the three months ended March 31, 2021 reflecting a shift in mix to products with lower management fees. 

Other fees and commissions Other fees and commissions increased during the three months ended March 31, 2021 due primarily to higher fees from loan syndication, loan commitments, wire transfers and other account services. These increases were partially offset by lower debit card fees. See Note 13, "Fee Income from Contracts with Customers," in the accompanying 

HSBC USA Inc. 

consolidated financial statements for additional information including a summary of the components of other fees and commissions. 

Trading revenue Trading revenue is generated by participation in the foreign exchange, precious metals, rates, credit and equities markets. The following table presents trading revenue by business activity. Not included in the table below is the impact of net interest income associated with trading securities which is an integral part of trading activities' overall performance. Certain derivatives, such as total return swaps, are economically hedged by holding the underlying interest bearing referenced assets. Net interest income related to trading activities is recorded in net interest income in the consolidated statement of income (loss). Trading revenue related to the mortgage banking business is included as a component of other income. During the first quarter of 2021, we changed our presentation for the components of trading revenue to provide a more detailed view. As a result, we have reclassified prior year amounts in order to conform to the current year presentation. 

Increase (Decrease) Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 2020 Amount % &#160; (dollars are in millions) Business Activities: Foreign Exchange $ 60 &#160; $ 163 $ (103) (63.2) % Metals 19 &#160; (1) 20 * Debt Markets (1) (16) 15 93.8 Securities Financing (35) (18) (17) (94.4) Markets Treasury 2 &#160; (14) 16 * Legacy structured credit products 2 &#160; (74) 76 * Other trading (1) 

(6) (26) 20 76.9 Total trading revenue $ 41 &#160; $ 14 $ 27 * 

* Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. 

(1) Includes trading revenue related to Global Banking and Equities as well as trading revenue associated with the exit or transfer of certain derivative contracts as part of our Restructuring Plan, including trading losses of $4 million recorded during the first quarter of 2021. 

Trading revenue increased during the three months ended March 31, 2021 due primarily to the non-recurrence of valuation losses of approximately $70 million that were recorded in March 2020 due to market volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in higher revenue in legacy structured credit products, Metals, other trading and Markets Treasury. The increase in legacy structured credit products also reflects the impact of a structured note vehicle that was unwound during the third quarter of 2020 which was a key contributor to the loss recorded in the prior year period. Also contributing to the increase was higher revenue in Debt Markets due to better trading results and improved risk management in sovereign debt and other debt products. These increases were partially offset by lower revenue in Foreign Exchange as market volatility driven by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in increased trading opportunities in the prior year period as well as the impact of our decision to exit or transfer certain derivative contracts as part of our Restructuring Plan which resulted in lower revenue from emerging markets rate products. Securities Financing revenue was also lower due to higher losses related to swaps in prime brokerage. 

Other securities gains, net We maintain securities portfolios as part of our balance sheet diversification and risk management strategies. During the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, we sold $3,907 million and $4,630 million, respectively, of primarily U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed and U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities as part of a continuing strategy to maximize returns while balancing the securities portfolio for risk management purposes. Other securities gains, net was relatively flat during the three months ended March 31, 2021. The gross realized gains and losses from sales of securities, which are included as a component of other securities gains, net above, are summarized in Note 4, "Securities," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2021 due primarily to lower cost reimbursements associated with shared services performed on behalf of other HSBC affiliates, including internal audit, partially offset by higher cost reimbursements associated with trading activities performed on behalf of HSBC Bank plc. 

Gain (loss) on instruments designated at fair value and related derivatives We have elected to apply fair value option accounting to certain commercial loans held for sale, certain student loans held for investment, certain of our own fixed-rate debt issuances and all of our hybrid instruments issued, including structured notes and deposits. We also use derivatives to economically hedge the interest rate and other risks associated with certain financial assets and liabilities for which fair value option accounting has been elected. Gain (loss) on instruments designated at fair value and related derivatives increased during 

HSBC USA Inc. 

the three months ended March 31, 2021 attributable primarily to favorable movements related to the economic hedging of interest rate and other risks within our structured notes and the non-recurrence of unfavorable fair value adjustments recorded in the prior year period on certain commercial loans held for sale which were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable movements related to the economic hedging of interest rate risk within our own debt. See Note 10, "Fair Value Option," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information including a breakout of these amounts by individual component. 

Other income &#160; Other income was lower during the three months ended March 31, 2021 due primarily to a loss of $6 million in the first quarter of 2021 associated with credit default swap protection which largely reflects the hedging of a few client relationships compared with a gain of $51 million in the prior year period. Also contributing to the decrease was lower income associated with bank owned life insurance and the non-recurrence of miscellaneous gains recorded in the first quarter of 2020, including a $12 million gain on extinguishment of time deposits reflecting early client withdrawals and a $9 million gain on the sale of one of our owned retail branch properties. These decreases were partially offset by higher residential mortgage banking revenue driven by higher gains on sales of residential mortgage loans. 

Operating Expenses The following table summarizes the components of operating expenses: 

Increase (Decrease) Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 2020 Amount % &#160; (dollars are in millions) Salaries and employee benefits $ 176 &#160; $ 207 $ (31) (15.0) % Support services from HSBC affiliates: Fees paid to HSBC Technology &#38; Services (USA) ("HTSU") 244 &#160; 263 (19) (7.2) Fees paid to HSBC Markets (USA) Inc.

* Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. 

Salaries and employee benefits Salaries and employee benefits expense decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2021 due primarily to staff reductions related to our Restructuring Plan and, to a lesser extent, lower severance costs. 

Support services from HSBC affiliates Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2021 due primarily to lower cost allocations from our technology and support service functions driven by the execution of our Restructuring Plan. These decreases were partially offset by higher allocated restructuring related costs from HTSU and other HSBC affiliates, primarily severance costs and support service project costs. During the first quarter of 2021, we recorded $19 million of allocated restructuring related costs from HTSU and other HSBC affiliates compared with $8 million of allocated costs during the prior year period. A summary of the services received from various HSBC affiliates is included in Note 14, "Related Party Transactions," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Occupancy expense, net Occupancy expense, net was lower during the three months ended March 31, 2021 due to the non-recurrence of $92 million of lease impairment and other related costs that were recorded in the first quarter of 2020 related to the consolidation of our retail branch network as part of our Restructuring Plan. See Note 2, "Strategic Initiatives," in the 

HSBC USA Inc. 

accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. Also contributing to the decrease was lower operating lease costs driven by the execution of our Restructuring Plan. 

Goodwill impairment Reflects a goodwill impairment charge of $784 million recorded during the first quarter of 2020 representing the entire amount of goodwill allocated to our previously separate Retail Banking and Wealth Management and Private Banking reporting units. For additional discussion of the results of our goodwill impairment testing, see Note 8, "Goodwill," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Other expenses Other expenses were higher during the three months ended March 31, 2021 due primarily to lower levels of expense capitalization related to internally developed software and increased deposit insurance assessment fees driven primarily by lower unsecured debt balances. These increases were partially offset by lower marketing expense and lower travel expense. 

Efficiency ratio Our efficiency ratio improved during the three months ended March 31, 2021 due primarily to lower operating expenses driven by the non-recurrence of a goodwill impairment charge recorded in the first quarter of 2020 as discussed in detail above. 

Income tax expense (benefit) The following table summarizes our effective tax rate based on the provision for income taxes attributable to pretax income (loss): 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 2020 &#160; (dollars are in millions) Income (loss) before income tax $ 460 &#160; $ (1,440) Income tax expense (benefit) 121 &#160; (157) Effective tax rate 26.3 &#160; % (10.9) % 

Income tax expense (benefit) increased during the three months ended March 31, 2021 driven by higher income. The income tax benefit for the three months ended March 31, 2020 was computed as a discrete period actual tax calculation and the lower effective tax benefit rate was related primarily to a non-deductible goodwill impairment related to our previously separate Retail Banking and Wealth Management and Private Banking businesses. 

In April 2021, the New York State legislature approved comprehensive tax legislation as part of the State&#8217;s fiscal year 2022 budget which, among other things, will increase the entire net income tax rate from 6.5 percent to 7.25 percent and reinstate the capital tax with a $5 million cap. Given HSBC North America&#8217;s current tax position, we do not anticipate that these tax law changes will have a material impact on our current or deferred taxes or results of operations. 

Segment Results &#8211; Group Reporting Basis 

We have four distinct business segments that we utilize for management reporting and analysis purposes, which are aligned with HSBC's global business strategy: Wealth and Personal Banking ("WPB") which was created in 2020 and is discussed further below, Commercial Banking ("CMB"), Global Banking and Markets ("GBM") and a Corporate Center ("CC"). See Item 1, "Business," in our 2020 Form 10-K for a description of our segments which are based upon our global businesses, including a discussion of the main business activities of the segments and a summary of their products and services. 

We previously announced as part of our Restructuring Plan that we combined our Retail Banking and Wealth Management ("RBWM") and Private Banking ("PB") businesses to create a single WPB business. During the second quarter of 2020, we implemented a change to our internal management reporting to report what was historically RBWM and PB together within the newly created WPB segment and, as a result, we have aligned our segment reporting to reflect this change for all periods presented. 

During the second quarter of 2020, we also implemented a change to our internal management reporting to allocate Markets Treasury, which was historically reported within the CC segment, to the WPB, CMB and GBM businesses to better align the revenue and expense to the businesses generating or utilizing this activity. As a result, we have aligned our segment reporting to reflect this change for all periods presented. 

See Note 15, "Business Segments," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a table that summarizes the impact of these changes on reported segment profit (loss) before tax, total assets and total deposits as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2020. There have been no additional changes in the basis of our segmentation as compared with the presentation in our 2020 Form 10-K. We are currently reviewing the financial information used to manage our GBM business, including the scope and content of the financial data being reported to our management and our Board of Directors. We will evaluate any impact such changes may have on our segment reporting once completed. 

Net interest income of each segment represents the difference between actual interest earned on assets and interest incurred on liabilities of the segment, adjusted for a funding charge or credit that includes both interest rate and liquidity components. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Segments are charged a cost to fund assets (e.g. customer loans) and receive a funding credit for funds provided (e.g. customer deposits) based on equivalent market rates that incorporate both repricing (interest rate risk) and tenor (liquidity) characteristics. The objective of these charges/credits is to transfer interest rate risk to one centralized unit in Markets Treasury. Markets Treasury income statement and balance sheet results are allocated to each of the global businesses based upon tangible equity levels and levels of any surplus liabilities. 

Certain other revenue and operating expense amounts are also apportioned among the business segments based upon the benefits derived from this activity or the relationship of this activity to other segment activity. These inter-segment transactions have not been eliminated, and we generally account for them as if they were with third parties. 

We report financial information to our parent, HSBC, in accordance with HSBC Group accounting and reporting policies, which apply IFRSs as issued by the IASB. As a result, our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the Group Reporting Basis as operating results are monitored and reviewed, trends are evaluated and decisions about allocating resources, such as employees, are primarily made on this basis. We continue, however, to monitor capital adequacy and report to regulatory agencies on a U.S. GAAP basis. 

There have been no changes in the measurement of segment profit as compared with the presentation in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

The significant differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis as they impact our results are summarized in Note 24, "Business Segments," in our 2020 Form 10-K. There have been no significant changes since December 31, 2020 in the differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis impacting our results.

(2) Includes cost reimbursements associated with activities performed on behalf of other HSBC affiliates and allocated Markets Treasury revenue. 

Our WPB segment reported a profit before tax during the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared with a loss before tax in the prior year period due primarily to lower operating expenses driven by the non-recurrence of a goodwill impairment charge of $693 million recorded during the first quarter of 2020, representing the entire amount of remaining goodwill previously recorded. Also contributing to the improvement was lower expected credit losses and, to a lesser extent, higher other operating income, partially offset by lower net interest income. 

Net interest income decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2021 due primarily to lower deposit spreads reflecting the impact of lower market rates, partially offset by improved residential mortgage loan spreads. 

Other operating income increased during the three months ended March 31, 2021 due to higher residential mortgage banking revenue driven by higher gains on sales of residential mortgage loans as well as the non-recurrence of a loss of $7 million recorded during the first quarter of 2020 related to extending the maturity of the total return swap position used to economically hedge the periodic payments made under the swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of Visa Inc. Class B 

HSBC USA Inc. 

common shares. These increases were partially offset by lower credit card fees due to lower customer spending and lower investment management fees reflecting a shift in mix to products with lower management fees. 

Expected credit losses improved during the three months ended March 31, 2021 reflecting a modest release in credit loss reserves compared with a loss provision in the prior year period. The release in credit reserves in the current year period was driven by improved economic conditions which resulted in improved economic forecasts used for calculating ECL as well as a release in credit reserves due to a decline in credit card balances. In the prior year period, the loss provision was driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts used for calculating ECL as well as higher dollars of delinquency in credit cards and, to a lesser extent, growth in personal loan balances due to new product promotions. 

Excluding the goodwill impairment charge discussed above, operating expenses remained lower during the three months ended March 31, 2021 driven by the execution of our Restructuring Plan which resulted in lower staff costs, lower operating lease costs, lower marketing expense, lower fraud losses, lower severance costs and lower cost allocations from our technology support service function. These decreases were partially offset by higher deposit insurance assessment fees. 

Client Assets The following table provides information regarding private banking client assets during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020:

Our CMB segment reported a profit before tax during the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared with a loss before tax in the prior year period due primarily to lower expected credit losses and, to a lesser extent, higher other operating income. The improvement was partially offset by lower net interest income and higher operating expenses. 

Net interest income decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2021 due to lower deposit spreads reflecting the impact of lower market rates and lower average loan balances, partially offset by higher average deposit balances. 

Other operating income increased during the three months ended March 31, 2021 due primarily to higher allocated Markets Treasury revenue and higher account service fees, partially offset by lower loan syndication fees. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Expected credit losses improved during the three months ended March 31, 2021 reflecting a release in credit loss reserves compared with a loss provision in the prior year period. The release in credit reserves in the current year period was driven by improved economic conditions which resulted in improved economic forecasts used for calculating ECL and client paydowns. In the prior year period, the loss provision was driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts used for calculating ECL and provisions for downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and loan growth as clients drew on their available lines of credit. 

Operating expenses increased during the three months ended March 31, 2021 due primarily to higher deposit insurance assessment fees and higher incentive compensation expense, partially offset by lower salaries expense, lower travel expense and lower cost allocations from our support service functions, primarily branch network costs.

HSBC USA Inc. 

Our GBM segment reported a higher profit before tax during the three months ended March 31, 2021 due primarily to lower expected credit losses, partially offset by lower other operating income and higher operating expenses. 

MSS revenue increased during the three months ended March 31, 2021 due primarily to a gain from credit and funding valuation adjustments in the current year period due to compressed credit and funding spreads as well as widening interest rate spreads. In the prior year period, credit and funding valuation adjustments was a loss due to tightening interest rate spreads as well as widening credit spreads on derivative assets driven by market volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Also contributing to the increase was higher revenue in Debt Markets due to better trading results and improved risk management, higher revenue in Equities due to improved trading in structured derivatives and higher revenue in Securities Financing due to stronger revenue in short-term lending. The increase in MSS revenue was partially offset by lower Foreign Exchange and Metals revenue as market volatility driven by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in increased trading opportunities in Foreign Exchange in the prior year period as well as lower other revenue reflecting the impact of our decision to exit or transfer certain derivative contracts as part of our Restructuring Plan, including trading losses of $4 million recorded during the first quarter of 2021. 

Global Banking revenue decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2021 due primarily to lower revenue in Global Banking other due to lower revenue associated with credit default swap protection which largely reflects the hedging of a few client relationships. Also contributing to the decrease was lower GLCM revenue due to lower net interest income driven by lower deposit spreads reflecting the impact of lower market rates, partially offset by the impact of higher average deposit balances. The decrease in Global Banking revenue was partially offset by increased Capital Markets revenue due to higher loan syndication fees and higher revenue associated with the collection of a nonaccrual loan during the first quarter of 2021. The increase in Capital Markets revenue was partially offset by lower net interest income from lower average loan balances driven by the impact of our efforts to improve returns through disciplined lending as well as lower demand reflecting increased capital markets activity by clients coupled with economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

GBM other revenue increased during the three months ended March 31, 2021 due to higher allocated Markets Treasury revenue, lower corporate funding charges and lower liquidity charges, partially offset by lower cost reimbursements. 

Expected credit losses improved during the three months ended March 31, 2021 reflecting a release in credit loss reserves compared with a loss provision in the prior year period. The release in credit reserves in the current year period was driven by improved economic conditions which resulted in improved economic forecasts used for calculating ECL and improvements in credit conditions associated with certain clients. Client paydowns also contributed to the release in credit reserves in the current year period. In the prior year period, the loss provision was driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts used for calculating ECL and provisions for risk factors associated with oil and gas industry loan exposures, downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and loan growth as clients drew on their available lines of credit. 

Operating expenses increased during the three months ended March 31, 2021 due primarily to higher cost allocations from our support service functions, higher incentive compensation expense and higher deposit insurance assessment fees, partially offset by lower salaries expense.

(1) The following table summarizes the impact of key activities on the total operating income (expense) of our CC segment: 

Increase (Decrease) Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 2020 Amount % &#160; (dollars are in millions) Legacy structured credit products $ 3 &#160; $ (74) $ 77 * Other 7 &#160; 37 (30) (81.1) Total operating income (expense) $ 10 &#160; $ (37) $ 47 * 

Our CC segment reported a lower loss before tax during the three months ended March 31, 2021 due to lower operating expenses, higher other operating income and lower net interest expense. 

Net interest expense was lower during the three months ended March 31, 2021 driven by lower retained liquidity charges and lower net interest expense from legacy structured credit products. 

Other operating income increased during the three months ended March 31, 2021 due primarily to the non-recurrence of valuation losses on legacy structured credit products that were recorded in March 2020 due to market volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in legacy structured credit products also reflects the impact of a structured note vehicle that was unwound during the third quarter of 2020 which was a key contributor to the loss recorded in the prior year period. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable movements related to the economic hedging of interest rate risk within our own debt and the non-recurrence of a $9 million gain recorded during the first quarter of 2020 on the sale of one of our owned retail branch properties. 

Operating expenses were lower during the three months ended March 31, 2021 due primarily to the non-recurrence of $97 million of lease impairment and other related costs that were recorded in the first quarter of 2020 related to the consolidation of our retail branch network as part of our Restructuring Plan. Also contributing to the decrease was lower cost allocations from our technology and support service functions. These decreases were partially offset by higher allocated restructuring related costs from HTSU and other HSBC affiliates, primarily severance costs and support service project costs. 

Reconciliation of Segment Results As previously discussed, segment results are reported on a Group Reporting Basis. See Note 15, "Business Segments," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of our Group Reporting Basis segment results to U.S. GAAP consolidated totals. 

Credit Quality 

In the normal course of business, we enter into a variety of transactions that involve both on and off-balance sheet credit risk. Principal among these activities is lending to various commercial, institutional, governmental and individual customers. We participate in lending activity throughout the United States and, on a limited basis, internationally. 

COVID-19 Loan Forbearance Initiatives We have implemented various loan modification payment deferral programs to provide borrowers relief from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Substantially all of the loans under these programs are not classified as TDR Loans due to our election to suspend TDR Loan classification under the CARES Act or their short-term nature as discussed under the Interagency Statement. In addition, under the Interagency Statement, for COVID-19 related loan modifications in the form of a payment deferral, the borrower&#8217;s past due status will not be affected during the deferral period and, if the loan was accruing at the time the relief was granted, the loan will generally not be placed on nonaccrual status as long as the borrower utilizes a payment deferral of six months or less. For consumer mortgage loans, when a borrower utilizes a payment deferral of more than six months, the loan will generally be placed on nonaccrual status and, if the loan does not meet the criteria in the CARES Act, assessed for TDR Loan classification. We have not modified our commercial loan nonaccrual policies as a result of this guidance. These COVID-19 related payment deferral programs could delay the recognition of delinquencies, nonaccrual status, and net charge-offs for those customers who may have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual status had such relief not been offered. See "Executive Overview," in this MD&#38;A for additional information. 

Allowance for Credit Losses / Liability for Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures &#160; Our accounting policies and methodologies related to the allowance for credit losses and liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures in prior periods are presented under the caption "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" in MD&#38;A and in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements," in our 2020 Form 10-K. Our approach toward credit risk management is summarized under the caption "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2020 Form 10-K. There have been no significant revisions to our policies or methodologies during the first quarter of 2021. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

The following table summarizes our allowance for credit losses and the liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures: 

March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 &#160; (in millions) Allowance for credit losses: Loans: Commercial loans $ 670 &#160; $ 814 Consumer loans 183 &#160; 201 Total loans 853 &#160; 1,015 Securities held-to-maturity 2 &#160; 2 

Other financial assets measured at amortized cost (1)

(1) Primarily includes accrued interest receivables and customer acceptances. 

The total allowance for credit losses at March 31, 2021 decreased $162 million or 16 percent as compared with December 31, 2020 due to lower loss estimates on our commercial loan portfolio and, to a lesser extent, our consumer loan portfolio. 

Our commercial allowance for credit losses at March 31, 2021 decreased $144 million or 18 percent as compared with December 31, 2020 driven by improved economic conditions which resulted in improved economic forecasts used for calculating lifetime ECL and improvements in credit conditions associated with certain clients as well as a decline in credit reserves for risk factors associated with economic uncertainty. Also contributing to the decrease were client paydowns. 

Our consumer allowance for credit losses at March 31, 2021 decreased $18 million or 9 percent as compared with December 31, 2020 due primarily to a lower allowance for credit losses in credit cards driven by improved economic conditions which resulted in improved economic forecasts used for calculating lifetime ECL and a release in credit reserves for risk factors primarily associated with forbearance accounts. Also contributing to the decrease was a release in credit reserves due to a decline in credit card balances reflecting seasonality and lower origination volumes. 

The liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures at March 31, 2021 decreased $82 million or 35 percent as compared with December 31, 2020 resulting from the improved economic conditions consistent with commercial loans as discussed above.

(1) Ratios exclude loans held for sale as these loans are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. 

(2) Ratios at March 31, 2021 reflect year-to-date net charge-offs, annualized. Ratios at December 31, 2020 reflect full year net charge-offs. 

(3) Our commercial net charge-off coverage ratio for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 and year ended December 31, 2020 was 2,010 months and 90 months, respectively. The net charge-off coverage ratio represents the commercial allowance for credit losses at period end divided by average monthly commercial net charge-offs during the period. 

(4) Represents our commercial and consumer allowance for credit losses, as appropriate, divided by the corresponding outstanding balance of total nonperforming loans held for investment. Nonperforming loans include accruing loans contractually past due 90 days or more. 

See Note 6, "Allowance for Credit Losses," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a rollforward of credit losses by general loan categories for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. 

The allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment at March 31, 2021 decreased as compared with December 31, 2020 as the decrease in our allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above outpaced a decrease in total loans held for investment. 

The allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of net charge-offs at March 31, 2021 increased as compared with December 31, 2020 as a decrease in dollars of net charge-offs driven by lower charge-offs in our commercial loan portfolio and, to a lesser extent, our consumer loan portfolio outpaced the decrease in our allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above. 

The allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of nonperforming loans held for investment at March 31, 2021 decreased as compared with December 31, 2020 as the decrease in our allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above outpaced a decrease in nonperforming loans driven by lower nonperforming loans in our commercial loan portfolio, partially offset by higher nonperforming loans in our consumer loan portfolio.

Delinquency The following table summarizes dollars of two-months-and-over contractual delinquency and two-months-and-over contractual delinquency as a percentage of total loans ("delinquency ratio"). For COVID-19 related loan modifications in the form of a payment deferral, the borrower's past due status will not be affected during the deferral period.

(1) At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, consumer mortgage loan delinquency includes $273 million and $281 million, respectively, of loans that are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. 

(2) The following table reflects dollars of contractual delinquency and delinquency ratios for interest-only loans and adjustable rate mortgage loans: 

&#160; March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Delinquent Loan Delinquency Ratio Delinquent Loan Delinquency Ratio &#160; (dollars are in millions) Interest-only loans $ 33 &#160; .89 &#160; % $ 34 .94 % ARM loans 201 &#160; 1.54 &#160; 191 1.46 

Our two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio increased 16 basis points compared with December 31, 2020 due primarily to higher dollars of delinquency in our commercial loan portfolio. 

Our commercial loan two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio increased 21 basis points compared with December 31, 2020 due to higher dollars of delinquency driven by a global banking client and a commercial real estate client, both of which became 60 days delinquent during the first quarter. The increase in commercial loan dollars of delinquency was partially offset by collections on several corporate banking loans. 

Our consumer loan two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio increased slightly compared with December 31, 2020 as an increase in dollars of delinquency in credit cards driven by customers that exited forbearance relief was partially offset by lower dollars of delinquency in residential mortgages.

Our net charge-off ratio as a percentage of average loans decreased 16 basis points during the three months ended March 31, 2021 due primarily to a lower level of net charge-offs in our commercial loan portfolio driven by the sale of a global banking loan and deterioration of a corporate banking loan in the prior year period. Also contributing to the decrease, to a lesser extent, was a lower level of net charge-offs in our consumer loan portfolio due primarily to lower charge-offs in credit cards reflecting a decline in credit card balances. The decrease in our net charge-off ratio was partially offset by lower average loan balances driven by a decline in the commercial loan portfolio.

At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, total nonperforming loans include $31 million and $21 million, respectively, of accruing loans contractually 90 days or more past due, primarily credit cards and other consumer loans. 

(2) At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, nonperforming consumer mortgage loans include $371 million and $375 million, respectively, of loans that are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell. 

(3) Nonperforming consumer mortgage loans held for investment include all loans which are 90 or more days contractually delinquent as well as loans discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not re-affirmed and second lien loans where the first lien loan that we own or service is 90 or more days contractually delinquent. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, nonaccrual consumer mortgage loans also included $535 million and $590 million, respectively, of loans under COVID-19 related payment deferral programs where the borrowers utilized a payment deferral of more than six months and, as a result, have been placed on nonaccrual status. 

(4) Nonperforming consumer mortgage loans for all periods does not include guaranteed loans purchased from the Government National Mortgage Association. Repayment of these loans is predominantly insured by the Federal Housing Administration and as such, these loans have different risk characteristics from the rest of our customer loan portfolio. 

(5) Includes $1 million or less of commercial other real estate owned at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Our nonperforming loans ratio decreased 3 basis points compared with December 31, 2020 due to lower nonperforming loans in our commercial loan portfolio, partially offset by higher nonperforming loans in our consumer loan portfolio. Our commercial nonperforming loans ratio decreased 15 basis points compared with December 31, 2020 due to lower nonperforming loans driven by the paydown of two global banking loans, partially offset by downgrades. Our consumer nonperforming loans ratio increased 19 basis points compared with December 31, 2020 due primarily to higher nonperforming loans in residential mortgages reflecting an increase in customers that utilized a forbearance relief payment deferral of more than six months and, to a lesser extent, higher nonperforming loans in credit cards driven by customers that exited forbearance relief. 

Our policies and practices for problem loan management and placing loans on nonaccrual status are summarized in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements," in our 2020 Form 10-K.

Concentration of Credit Risk A concentration of credit risk is defined as a significant credit exposure with an individual or group engaged in similar activities or affected similarly by economic conditions. We enter into a variety of transactions in the normal course of business that involve both on and off-balance sheet credit risk. Principal among these activities is lending to various commercial, institutional, governmental and individual customers throughout the United States and internationally. We manage the varying degrees of credit risk associated with on and off-balance sheet transactions through specific credit policies and procedures which provide for a strict approval, monitoring and reporting process. It is our policy to require collateral when it is deemed appropriate. Varying degrees and types of collateral are secured depending upon management's credit evaluation. 

Commercial Credit Exposure Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Commercial loans outstanding and unused commercial commitments by industry are presented in the table below:

Residential Mortgage Loans Our consumer loan portfolio includes the following types of loans: 

&#8226; Interest-only loans &#8211; A loan which allows a customer to pay the interest-only portion of the monthly payment for a period of time which results in lower payments during the initial loan period. 

&#8226; Adjustable rate mortgage ("ARM") loans &#8211; A loan which allows us to adjust pricing on the loan in line with market movements. 

The following table summarizes the balances of interest-only and ARM loans in our loan portfolios at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Each category is not mutually exclusive and loans may appear in more than one category below.

Credit Risks Associated with Derivative Contracts Credit risk associated with derivatives is measured as the net replacement cost of derivative contracts in a receivable position in the event the counterparties of such contracts fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. In managing derivative credit risk, both the current exposure, which is the replacement cost of contracts on the measurement date, as well as an estimate of the potential change in value of contracts over their remaining lives are considered. Counterparties to our derivative activities include financial institutions, central clearing parties, foreign and domestic government agencies, corporations, funds (mutual funds, hedge funds, etc.), insurance companies and private clients as well as other HSBC entities. These counterparties are subject to regular credit review by the credit risk management department. To minimize credit risk, we may enter into legally enforceable master netting agreements which reduce risk by permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon occurrence of certain events. In addition, we reduce credit risk by obtaining collateral from counterparties. The determination of the need for and the levels of collateral will differ based on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty and/or regulatory requirements. 

The total risk in a derivative contract is a function of a number of variables, such as: 

&#8226; volatility of interest rates, currencies, equity or corporate reference entity used as the basis for determining contract payments; 

&#8226; current market events or trends; 

&#8226; country risk; 

&#8226; maturity and liquidity of contracts; 

&#8226; creditworthiness of the counterparties in the transaction; 

&#8226; the existence of a master netting agreement among the counterparties; and 

&#8226; existence and value of collateral received from counterparties to secure exposures. 

The table below presents total credit risk exposure calculated using the general risk-based capital rules of the Basel III Standardized Approach which includes the net positive mark-to-market of the derivative contracts plus any adjusted potential future exposure as measured in reference to the notional amount. The regulatory capital rules recognize that bilateral netting agreements reduce credit risk and, therefore, allow for reductions of risk-weighted assets when netting requirements have been met and collateral exists. As a result, risk-weighted amounts for regulatory capital purposes are a portion of the original gross exposures. Furthermore, many contracts contain provisions that allow us to close out the transaction if the counterparty fails to post required collateral. In addition, many contracts give us the right to break the transactions earlier than the final maturity date. As a result, these contracts have potential future exposures that are often much smaller than the future exposures derived from the regulatory capital rules. 

March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 &#160; (in millions) Risk associated with derivative contracts: Total credit risk exposure $ 19,073 &#160; $ 21,624 Less: collateral held against exposure 6,060 &#160; 5,907 Net credit risk exposure $ 13,013 &#160; $ 15,717 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Effective liquidity management is defined as ensuring we can meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities/withdrawals and other cash commitments efficiently under both normal operating conditions and under unpredictable circumstances of industry or market stress. To achieve this objective, we have guidelines that require sufficient liquidity to cover potential funding requirements and to avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. Guidelines are set for the consolidated balance sheet of HSBC USA to ensure that it is a source of strength for our regulated, deposit-taking banking subsidiary, as well as to address the more limited sources of liquidity available to it as a holding company. Similar guidelines are set for HSBC Bank USA to ensure that it can meet its liquidity needs in various stress scenarios. Cash flow analysis, including stress testing scenarios, forms the basis for liquidity management and contingency funding plans. 

During the first quarter of 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact business and economic activity. We continue to actively monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk in accordance with HSBC policy. To date, we have not experienced any significant impact to our liquidity or funding capabilities as a result of the pandemic. See "Risk Management" in this MD&#38;A for further discussion of our approach towards liquidity and funding risk management, including information regarding the key measures employed to define, monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk. We continuously monitor the impact of market events on our liquidity positions and will continue to adapt our framework as necessary to reflect market events.

Deposits totaled $148,582 million and $145,150 million at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, which included $131,230 million and $125,586 million, respectively, of core deposits as calculated in accordance with FFIEC guidelines. See "Balance Sheet Review" in this MD&#38;A for further analysis and discussion on deposit trends. 

Long-Term Debt decreased to $18,179 million at March 31, 2021 from $19,979 million at December 31, 2020. The following table presents the maturities of long-term debt at March 31, 2021:

Under our shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, we may issue certain securities including debt securities and preferred stock. We satisfy the eligibility requirements for designation as a "well-known seasoned issuer," which allows us to file a registration statement that does not have a limit on issuance capacity. The ability to issue under the registration statement is limited by the authority granted by the Board of Directors. During the first quarter of 2021, due to an anticipated decrease in utilization of the shelf registration statement, the Board of Directors approved a reduction in the amount we are authorized to issue from $25,000 million at December 31, 2020 to $20,000 million, of which $11,636 million was available at March 31, 2021. HSBC Bank USA has a $40,000 million Global Bank Note Program that provides for the issuance of subordinated and senior notes, of which $12,867 million was available at March 31, 2021. We anticipate using the Global Bank Note Program more in the future as part of our efforts designed to minimize overall funding costs while accessing diverse funding channels. 

As a member of the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, we have secured borrowing facilities which are collateralized by loans and investment securities. At March 31, 2021, long-term debt included $2,750 million of borrowings from the FHLB facility. Based upon the amounts pledged as collateral under these facilities, we have additional borrowing capacity of up to $14,392 million. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Preferred Equity See Note 18, "Preferred Stock," in our 2020 Form 10-K for information regarding all outstanding preferred share issues. 

Common Equity During the first quarter of 2021, HSBC USA did not receive any cash capital contributions from its parent, HSBC North America, and did not make any capital contributions to its subsidiary, HSBC Bank USA. 

Capital Ratios In managing capital, we develop targets for common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, total capital to risk-weighted assets, Tier 1 capital to adjusted quarterly average assets (i.e., the "Tier 1 leverage ratio") and Tier 1 capital to total leverage exposure (i.e., the "supplementary leverage ratio" or "SLR"). Capital targets are reviewed at least semi-annually to ensure they reflect our business mix and risk profile, as well as real-time conditions and circumstances. The following table summarizes HSBC USA's Basel III capital ratios calculated as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020: 

March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 

Common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets (1) 

15.1 &#160; % 14.5 % 

Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets (1)

Supplementary leverage ratio (3)(4) 

8.3 &#160; 7.8 

(1) Prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the current period presentation. See Note 16, "Retained Earnings and Regulatory Capital Requirements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 

(2) Adjusted quarterly average assets, the Tier 1 leverage ratio denominator, reflects quarterly average assets adjusted for amounts permitted to be deducted from Tier 1 capital. 

(3) Total leverage exposure, the SLR denominator, includes adjusted quarterly average assets plus certain off-balance sheet exposures. 

(4) As discussed further below, the rules that permitted banking institutions to temporarily exclude U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from the denominator of their SLR expired on April 1, 2021. As a result, HSBC USA's SLR decreased to approximately 6.7 percent at April 1, 2021. 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that provides the option to transition in the regulatory capital impacts of the new current expected credit loss accounting standard over a five-year period. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA have elected the five-year transition option and, as a result, beginning in 2020, our capital ratios are reported in accordance with the transition rules in the final rule. Accordingly, during 2020 and 2021, we will exclude from regulatory capital the change in retained earnings resulting from adoption of the new accounting standard on January 1, 2020 as well as 25 percent of the change in the allowance for credit losses recognized between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021. Beginning January 1, 2022, the excluded impacts will be phased in to regulatory capital over a three-year transition period and will be fully reflected at January 1, 2025. 

Also in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal banking agencies issued final rules that permitted intermediate holding companies, such as HSBC North America, and depository institutions, such as HSBC Bank USA, to temporarily exclude U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from the denominator of their SLR. The rules were designed to allow banking institutions to expand their balance sheets to accommodate increased customer deposits while continuing to provide credit to companies and households. These changes took effect in 2020 and expired on April 1, 2021. 

We manage capital in accordance with HSBC Group policy. The HSBC North America Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ("ICAAP") works in conjunction with the HSBC Group's ICAAP. The HSBC North America ICAAP applies to HSBC Bank USA and evaluates regulatory capital adequacy and capital adequacy under various stress scenarios. Our approach is to meet our capital needs for these stress scenarios locally through activities which reduce risk. To the extent that local alternatives are insufficient, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC, we would seek support from our ultimate parent. Regulatory capital requirements are based on the amount of capital required to be held, plus applicable capital buffers, as defined by regulations, and the amount of risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure, also calculated based on regulatory definitions. 

We are subject to regulatory capital rules issued by U.S. banking regulators including Basel III (the "Basel III rule"). The Basel III rule establishes minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for banks and bank holding companies ("BHCs"). In 2019, the FRB and the other federal banking agencies jointly finalized rules to implement the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act that tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards for large BHC and foreign banking organizations (the "Tailoring Rules"). The Tailoring Rules assign each BHC and IHC with $50 billion or more in total U.S. assets into one of five classifications (Categories I through IV, and 'other firms') based on its size and four risk-based indicators. Under the Tailoring Rules, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA are subject to Category III standards and calculate their risk-based capital requirements for credit risk solely using the generally-applicable Standardized Approach. For additional discussion of the Basel III final rule requirements, including required minimum capital ratios, as well 

HSBC USA Inc. 

as further discussion of the Tailoring Rules and other related regulatory developments and their expected impact see Part I, "Regulation and Competition - Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Requirements," in our 2020 Form 10-K. We continue to review the composition of our capital structure and capital buffers in light of these developments. 

Capital Planning and Stress Testing The FRB requires certain U.S. top-tier BHCs and IHCs, including HSBC North America, to comply with the FRB's capital plan rule and CCAR program, as well as the annual supervisory stress tests conducted by the FRB, and annual company-run stress tests as required under Dodd-Frank (collectively, "DFAST"). Disclosure of the company-run stress tests is required only every other year. The company-run stress tests are forward looking exercises to assess the impact of hypothetical macroeconomic baseline and severely adverse scenarios provided by the FRB (and internally developed scenarios for the company-run exercises) on the financial condition and capital adequacy of a CCAR firm over a nine quarter planning horizon. For further discussion of capital planning and stress testing, including detail regarding the FRB's supervisory assessment as part of the CCAR process, see Part I, "Regulation and Competition - Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Requirements," in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

In March 2021, the FRB announced that it intends to terminate restrictions on capital distributions put in place in connection with additional stress tests that the FRB conducted to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These additional restrictions on CCAR firms' distributions will remain in place through the second quarter of 2021, but will terminate for firms with capital levels above the minimum requirements in the 2021 CCAR exercise, the results of which will be made public on or before June 30, 2021. Under these additional restrictions, CCAR firms may make certain capital distributions in the first two quarters of 2021, provided that the distributions generally do not exceed net income. 

HSBC North America submitted its 2021 CCAR capital plan and its 2021 annual company-run DFAST results in April 2021. HSBC North America will publicly disclose their latest annual DFAST results, as required, within 15 days of the FRB disclosing the results of its own DFAST results. The FRB will publicly disclose its own DFAST and CCAR results on or before June 30, 2021. Stress testing results are based solely on hypothetical adverse stress scenarios and should not be viewed or interpreted as forecasts of expected outcomes or capital adequacy or of the actual financial condition of HSBC North America. Capital planning and stress testing for HSBC North America may impact our future capital and liquidity. 

While BHC regulatory capital compliance is generally performed at the HSBC North America level, and also separately for HSBC Bank USA, as a BHC we are required to meet minimum capital requirements imposed by the FRB. We present our capital ratios, together with HSBC Bank USA's in Note 16, "Retained Earnings and Regulatory Capital Requirements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

2021 Funding Strategy Our current estimate for funding needs and sources for 2021 are summarized in the following table: 

Actual January 1 through March 31, 2021 Estimated April 1 through December 31, 2021 Estimated Full Year 2021 &#160; (in billions) Increase (decrease) in funding needs: Net change in loans $ &#8212; $ 3 $ 3 Net change in short-term investments and securities &#8212; (4) (4) Net change in trading and other assets (2) &#8212; (2) Total funding needs $ (2) $ (1) $ (3) Increase (decrease) in funding sources: Net change in deposits $ 3 $ 3 $ 6 Net change in trading and other short-term liabilities (3) (2) (5) Net change in long-term debt (2) (2) (4) Total funding sources $ (2) $ (1) $ (3) 

The above table reflects a long-term funding strategy. Daily balances fluctuate as we accommodate customer needs, while ensuring that we have liquidity in place to support the balance sheet maturity funding profile. Should market conditions deteriorate, we have contingency plans to generate additional liquidity through the sales of assets or financing transactions. We remain confident in our ability to access the market for long-term debt funding needs in the current market environment. We continue to seek well-priced and stable customer deposits. We also continue to sell new agency-eligible mortgage loan originations to third parties. 

HSBC Bank USA is subject to significant restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to, and certain other 'covered transactions' with HSBC USA and other affiliates. For further discussion, see Part I, "Regulation and Competition - Affiliate Transaction Restrictions," in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

See "Risk Management" in this MD&#38;A for further discussion relating to our liquidity contingency plans and our approach to liquidity and funding risk management. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Credit Derivatives and Other Contractual Obligations 

As part of our normal operations, we enter into credit derivatives and various off-balance sheet arrangements with affiliates and third parties. These arrangements arise principally in connection with our lending and client intermediation activities and involve primarily extensions of credit and, in certain cases, guarantees. 

As a financial services provider, we routinely extend credit through loan commitments and lines and letters of credit and provide financial guarantees, including derivative transactions having characteristics of a guarantee. The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent our maximum possible credit exposure in the event that a counterparty draws down the full commitment amount or we are required to fulfill our maximum obligation under a guarantee. 

The following table provides maturity information related to our credit derivatives and off-balance sheet arrangements. Many of these commitments and guarantees expire unused or without default. In addition, implementation of our business strategy (as described under the heading "Executive Overview - 2020 Events" in our 2020 Form 10-K) will affect our contractual obligations over time, including with respect to credit derivatives. As a result, we believe that the contractual amount is not representative of the actual future credit exposure or funding requirements.

(3) Includes $1,552 million and $2,475 million issued for the benefit of HSBC affiliates at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

Other Commitments to Extend Credit Other commitments to extend credit include arrangements whereby we are contractually obligated to extend credit in the form of loans, participations in loans, lease financing receivables, or similar transactions. Consumer commitments comprise certain unused MasterCard/Visa credit card lines, where we have the right to change terms or conditions upon notification to the customer, and commitments to extend credit secured by residential properties, where we have the right to change terms or conditions, for cause, upon notification to the customer. Commercial commitments comprise primarily those related to secured and unsecured loans and lines of credit. 

In addition to the above, we have established and manage a number of constant net asset value ("CNAV") money market funds that invest in shorter-dated highly-rated money market securities to provide investors with a highly liquid and secure investment. These funds price the assets in their portfolio on an amortized cost basis, which enables them to create and liquidate shares at a constant price. The funds, however, are not permitted to price their portfolios at amortized cost if that amount varies by more than 50 basis points from the portfolio's market value. In that case, the fund would be required to price its portfolio at market value and consequently would no longer be able to create or liquidate shares at a constant price. We do not consolidate the CNAV funds because we do not absorb the majority of the expected future risk associated with the fund's assets, including interest rate, liquidity, credit and other relevant risks that are expected to affect the value of the assets. 

Fair Value 

Fair Value Hierarchy Fair value measurement accounting principles establish a fair value hierarchy structure that prioritizes the inputs to determine the fair value of an asset or liability (the "Fair Value Framework"). The Fair Value Framework distinguishes between inputs that are based on observed market data and unobservable inputs that reflect market participants' assumptions. It emphasizes the use of valuation methodologies that maximize observable market inputs. For financial 

HSBC USA Inc. 

instruments carried at fair value, the best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an actively traded market (Level 1). Where the market for a financial instrument is not active, valuation techniques are used. The majority of our valuation techniques use market inputs that are either observable or indirectly derived from and corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the financial instrument (Level 2). Because Level 1 and Level 2 instruments are determined by observable inputs, less judgment is applied in determining their fair values. In the absence of observable market inputs, the financial instrument is valued based on valuation techniques that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The determination of the level of fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement of an asset or a liability is classified often requires judgment and may change over time as market conditions evolve. We consider the following factors in developing the fair value hierarchy: 

&#8226; whether the asset or liability is transacted in an active market with a quoted market price; 

&#8226; the level of bid-ask spreads; 

&#8226; a lack of pricing transparency due to, among other things, complexity of the product and market liquidity; 

&#8226; whether only a few transactions are observed over a significant period of time; 

&#8226; whether the pricing quotations differ substantially among independent pricing services; 

&#8226; whether inputs to the valuation techniques can be derived from or corroborated with market data; and 

&#8226; whether significant adjustments are made to the observed pricing information or model output to determine the fair value. 

Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that the reporting entity has the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities. A financial instrument is classified as a Level 1 measurement if it is listed on an exchange or is an instrument actively traded in the over-the-counter ("OTC") market where transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume. We regard financial instruments such as debt securities, equity securities and derivative contracts listed on the primary exchanges of a country to be actively traded. Non-exchange-traded instruments classified as Level 1 assets include securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, to-be-announced securities, non-callable securities issued by U.S. Government sponsored enterprises and certain foreign government-backed debt. 

Level 2 inputs are those that are observable either directly or indirectly but do not qualify as Level 1 inputs. We classify mortgage pass-through securities, agency and certain non-agency mortgage collateralized obligations, non-exchange-traded derivative contracts, asset-backed securities, obligations of U.S. states and political subdivisions, corporate debt securities, certain foreign government-backed debt, preferred securities, securities purchased and sold under resale and repurchase agreements, precious metals, certain loans held for sale, certain student loans held for investment, residential mortgage loans whose carrying amount was reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral and real estate owned as Level 2 measurements. Where possible, at least two quotations from independent sources are obtained based on transactions involving comparable assets and liabilities to validate the fair value of these instruments. We have established a process to understand the methodologies and inputs used by the third party pricing services to ensure that pricing information meets the fair value objective and, where appropriate, this pricing data is back-tested to market trade executions. Where significant differences arise among the independent pricing quotes and the internally determined fair value, we investigate and reconcile the differences. If the investigation results in a significant adjustment to the fair value, the instrument will be classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. In general, we have observed that there is a correlation between the credit standing and the market liquidity of a non-derivative instrument. 

Level 2 derivative instruments are generally valued based on discounted future cash flows or an option pricing model adjusted for counterparty credit risk and market liquidity. The fair value of certain derivative products is determined using valuation techniques based on inputs derived from observable indices traded in the OTC market. Appropriate control processes and procedures have been applied to ensure that the derived inputs are applied to value only those instruments that share similar risks to the relevant benchmark indices and therefore demonstrate a similar response to market factors. 

Level 3 inputs are unobservable estimates that management expects market participants would use to determine the fair value of the asset or liability. That is, Level 3 inputs incorporate market participants' assumptions about risk and the risk premium required by market participants in order to bear that risk. We develop Level 3 inputs based on the best information available in the circumstances. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, our Level 3 measurements included the following: certain structured deposits and structured notes for which the embedded credit, foreign exchange or equity derivatives have significant unobservable inputs (e.g., volatility or default correlations), asset-backed credit default swaps with certain inputs which are unobservable, certain asset-backed securities, individually assessed commercial loans, mortgage servicing rights, derivatives referenced to illiquid assets of less desirable credit quality and swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of Visa Class B Shares for which the fair value is dependent upon the final resolution of the related litigation. See Note 19, "Fair Value Measurements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on Level 3 inputs. 

HSBC USA Inc.

(3) Includes $83,954 million of assets measured on a recurring basis and $555 million of assets measured on a non-recurring basis at March 31, 2021. Includes $97,982 million of assets measured on a recurring basis and $658 million of assets measured on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2020. 

Significant Changes in Fair Value for Level 3 Assets and Liabilities See Note 19, "Fair Value Measurements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on additions to and transfers into (out of) Level 3 measurements during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 as well as for further details including the classification hierarchy associated with assets and liabilities measured at fair value. 

Effect of Changes in Significant Unobservable Inputs &#160; The fair value of certain financial instruments is measured using valuation techniques that incorporate pricing assumptions not supported by, derived from or corroborated by observable market data. The resultant fair value measurements are dependent on unobservable input parameters which can be selected from a range of estimates and may be interdependent. Changes in one or more of the significant unobservable input parameters may change the fair value measurements of these financial instruments. For the purpose of preparing the financial statements, the final valuation inputs selected are based on management's best judgment that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing similar assets or liabilities. 

The unobservable input parameters selected are subject to the internal valuation control processes and procedures. When we perform a test of all the significant input parameters to the extreme values within the range at the same time, it could result in an increase of the overall fair value measurement of approximately $11 million or a decrease of the overall fair value measurement of approximately $10 million at March 31, 2021. The effect of changes in significant unobservable input parameters are primarily driven by the uncertainty in determining the fair value of credit derivatives executed against certain insurers and certain deal-contingent forward starting interest rate derivatives. 

Risk Management 

Overview &#160; Managing risk effectively is fundamental to the delivery of our strategic priorities. 

We use a comprehensive risk management framework across the organization and across all risk types underpinned by our risk culture. This framework fosters continuous monitoring, promotes risk awareness and encourages sound operational and strategic decision-making. It also ensures a consistent approach to identifying, assessing, managing and reporting the risks we accept and incur in our activities. 

Our Board of Directors has the ultimate responsibility for effective management of risk. It is advised on risk matters by the Risk Committee and the Compliance and Conduct Committee of the Board of Directors. In particular, the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors advises the Board of Directors on risk appetite and its alignment with our strategy, risk governance and internal controls as well as high-level risk related matters. Robust risk governance and accountability are embedded throughout our business through an established framework that helps to ensure appropriate oversight of and accountability for the effective management of risk. 

Our material risks The principal risks associated with our operations include the following: 

&#8226; Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract; 

&#8226; Treasury risk is the risk of having insufficient capital, liquidity or funding resources to meet financial obligations and satisfy regulatory requirements, including pension risk. Treasury risk also includes the risk to our earnings due to changes in market interest rates; 

HSBC USA Inc. 

&#8226; Market risk is the risk that movements in market factors, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices and commodity prices, will reduce our income or the value of our portfolios; 

&#8226; Resilience risk is the risk that we are unable to provide critical services to our customers, affiliates and counterparties as a result of sustained and significant operational disruption; 

&#8226; Regulatory compliance risk is the risk that we fail to observe the letter and spirit of relevant laws, codes, rules, regulations and standards of good market practice, which as a consequence incur fines and penalties and suffer damage to our business; 

&#8226; Financial crime risk is the risk that we knowingly or unknowingly help parties to commit or to further potentially illegal activity, including money laundering, fraud, bribery and corruption, tax evasion, sanctions breaches, and terrorist and proliferation financing; 

&#8226; Strategic risk is the risk that the business will fail to identify, execute and react appropriately to opportunities and/or threats arising from changes in the market, some of which may emerge over a number of years such as changing economic and political circumstances, customer requirements, demographic trends, regulatory developments or competitor action; and 

&#8226; Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from business decisions informed by models, which can be exacerbated by errors in methodology, design or the way they are used. 

In the course of our regular risk management activities, we use models to help quantify the risk we are taking. We believe that the assumptions used in these models are reasonable within the parameters for which the models have been built and calibrated to operate, but events may unfold differently than what is assumed in the models. Consequently, actual results may differ significantly from model projections. The severe projections of macroeconomic variables during the current COVID-19 pandemic represent events outside the parameters for which the models have been built. As a result, adjustments to model outputs to reflect consideration of management judgment are used with stringent governance in place to ensure appropriate results. Where models do not require adjustments, enhanced model monitoring confirms models are performing as intended. 

See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2020 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of the objectives of our risk management system as well as our risk management policies and practices. Other than the change to financial crime risk management discussed below, there have been no material changes to our approach to risk management since December 31, 2020. 

Credit Risk Management Credit risk is managed through a robust risk identification and control framework which outlines clear and consistent policies, principles and guidance for risk managers. Credit risk is monitored using various internal risk management measures and within limits approved by individuals within a framework of delegated authorities. Our credit risk management procedures are designed for all stages of economic and financial cycles, including challenging periods of market volatility and economic uncertainty. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continued to create economic uncertainty during the first quarter of 2021. We continue to monitor the performance of our material commercial loans as conditions evolve and take necessary credit actions where warranted. See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2020 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our approach to credit risk. 

Treasury Risk Management We continuously monitor our capital ratios and the impact of market events on our liquidity positions and will continue to adapt our frameworks as necessary to reflect market events and the evolving regulatory landscape and view as to best practices. See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2020 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our approach to treasury risk. 

Capital risk See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in this MD&#38;A for a discussion of our approach to capital risk management, including our capital ratios and regulatory capital requirements. 

Liquidity and funding risk As part of our approach towards liquidity and funding risk management, we employ the measures discussed below to define, monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk in accordance with HSBC policy. 

The Basel Committee based Liquidity Coverage Ratio ("LCR") is designed to be a short-term liquidity measure to ensure banks have sufficient High Quality Liquid Assets ("HQLA") to cover net stressed cash outflows over the next 30 days. At both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, HSBC USA's LCR exceeded 100 percent. A LCR of 100 percent or higher reflects an unencumbered HQLA balance that is equal to or exceeds liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario. HQLA consists of cash or assets that can be converted into cash at little or no loss of value in private markets. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA are also subject to the U.S. LCR rule and are required to report their LCR to U.S. regulators on a daily basis. Under the Tailoring Rules, an 85 percent LCR requirement applies to Category III firms with weighted short-term wholesale funding under $75 billion, including HSBC North America, and their depository institution subsidiaries, such as HSBC Bank USA, from 100 to 85 percent beginning January 1, 2020. As a result, under the U.S. LCR rule, a LCR of 100 percent or higher reflects an unencumbered HQLA balance that is equal to or exceeds 85 percent of a Category III firm's 

HSBC USA Inc. 

liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, HSBC Bank USA's LCR under the U.S. LCR rule remained above the 100 percent minimum requirement. 

The U.K. calibration of the Basel Committee based Net Stable Funding Ratio ("NSFR"), which is a longer term liquidity measure with a 12-month time horizon to ensure a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities, is still pending. Therefore, our calculation of NSFR is based on our current interpretation and understanding of the Basel Committee NSFR guidance, which may differ in future periods depending on completion of the U.K. calibration. The U.K. NSFR rules are expected to become effective in January 2022. At both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, HSBC USA's estimated NSFR exceeded 100 percent. A NSFR of 100 percent or more reflects an available stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next 12 months that is equal to or exceeds the required amount of funding for assets and off-balance sheet exposures. In October 2020, U.S. regulators issued a final rule to implement the NSFR in the United States, applicable to certain large banking organizations, including HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA, that will take effect July 1, 2021. Consistent with the Tailoring Rules, an 85 percent NSFR requirement will apply to Category III firms with weighted short-term wholesale funding under $75 billion, including HSBC North America, and their depository institution subsidiaries, such as HSBC Bank USA, when the final rule becomes effective July 1, 2021. As a result, under the U.S. NSFR rule, a NSFR of 100 percent or more reflects an available stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next 12 months that is equal to or exceeds 85 percent of a Category III firm's required amount of funding for assets and off-balance sheet exposures. At both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, HSBC Bank USA's estimated NSFR, based on our interpretation and understanding of the U.S. NSFR rule, exceeded 100 percent. 

As a Category III firm, HSBC North America remains subject to liquidity stress testing on a monthly basis and related liquidity buffer and liquidity risk management requirements. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA have liquidity profiles to support compliance with these rules. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA may need to make changes to their liquidity profiles to support compliance with any future rules and will continue to evaluate the impact of the final U.S. NSFR rule on our operations. 

Our liquidity and funding risk management approach includes deposits, supplemented by wholesale borrowing to fund our balance sheet, and using security sales or secured borrowings for liquidity stress situations in our liquidity contingency plans. In addition, regulations require banks to retain a portfolio of HQLA. As such, we are maintaining a large portfolio of high quality sovereign and sovereign guaranteed securities. 

Our ability to regularly attract wholesale funds at a competitive cost is enhanced by strong ratings from the major credit ratings agencies. The following table reflects the short and long-term credit ratings of HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA at March 31, 2021: 

&#160; &#160; 

Moody's S&#38;P Fitch HSBC USA: Short-term borrowings P-1 A-2 F1+ Long-term/senior debt A2 A- A+ HSBC Bank USA: Short-term borrowings P-1 A-1 F1+ Long-term/senior debt Aa3 A+ AA- 

Rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk management practices and legal matters, all of which could lead to adverse ratings actions. 

Although we closely monitor and strive to manage factors influencing our credit ratings, there is no assurance that our credit ratings will not change in the future. At March 31, 2021, there were no pending actions in terms of changes to ratings on the debt of HSBC USA or HSBC Bank USA from any of the rating agencies. 

See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in this MD&#38;A for further discussion of our liquidity position, including additional information regarding our outstanding borrowings, the remaining availability of our debt issuance programs and our funding strategy. 

Interest rate risk Various techniques are utilized to quantify and monitor risks associated with the repricing characteristics of our assets, liabilities and derivative contracts. See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2020 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our approach to interest rate risk.

Economic value of equity ("EVE") EVE represents the present value of the banking book cash flows that could be provided to our equity holder under a managed run-off scenario. An EVE sensitivity represents the change in EVE due to a defined movement in interest rates. We manage to an immediate parallel upward shock of 200 basis points and an immediate parallel downward shock of 200 basis points to the market implied interest rates. At both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, our EVE remained within risk appetite for the up 200 and down 200 basis point interest rate shock scenarios. 

Net interest income simulation modeling techniques We utilize simulation modeling to monitor a number of interest rate scenarios for their impact on projected net interest income. These techniques simulate the impact on projected net interest income under various scenarios, such as rate shock scenarios which assume immediate market rate movements by 100 basis points, as well as scenarios in which rates gradually rise or fall by 100 basis points over a twelve month period. In the gradual scenarios, 25 percent of the interest rate movement occurs at the beginning of each quarter. The following table reflects the impact on our projected net interest income of the scenarios utilized by these modeling techniques: 

March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Amount % Amount % &#160; (dollars are in millions) Estimated increase (decrease) in projected net interest income (reflects projected rate movements on April 1, 2021 and January 1, 2021, respectively): Resulting from a gradual 100 basis point increase in the yield curve $ 241 &#160; 10 &#160; % $ 186 7 % Resulting from a gradual 100 basis point decrease in the yield curve (261) (11) (213) (8) Other significant scenarios monitored (reflects projected rate movements on April 1, 2021 and January 1, 2021, respectively): Resulting from an immediate 100 basis point increase in the yield curve 361 &#160; 15 &#160; 274 11 Resulting from an immediate 100 basis point decrease in the yield curve (485) (20) (379) (15) 

The projections do not take into consideration possible complicating factors such as the effect of changes in interest rates on the credit quality, size and composition of the balance sheet. Therefore, although this provides a reasonable estimate of interest rate sensitivity, actual results will differ from these estimates, possibly by significant amounts. 

Market Risk Management Exposure to market risk is separated into two portfolios: 

&#8226; Trading portfolios comprise positions arising from market-making and warehousing of client-derived positions. 

&#8226; Non-trading portfolios comprise positions that primarily arise from the interest rate management of our retail and commercial banking assets and liabilities and financial investments classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity. 

We apply similar risk management policies and measurement techniques to both trading and non-trading portfolios. Our objective is to manage and control market risk exposures to optimize return on risk while maintaining a market profile consistent with our established risk appetite. See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2020 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our approach to market risk. 

Value at risk ("VaR") VaR is a technique for estimating potential losses on risk positions as a result of movements in market rates and prices over a specified time horizon and to a given level of confidence. The use of VaR is integrated into market risk management and calculated for all trading positions regardless of how we capitalize them. In addition, we calculate VaR for non-trading portfolios to have a complete picture of risk. VaR measures are calculated to a 99 percent confidence level and use a one-day holding period. 

Trading portfolios Trading VaR generates primarily from the Markets and Securities Services unit of our GBM business segment. Portfolios comprise mainly foreign exchange products, interest rate swaps, credit default swaps and precious metals (i.e., gold, silver, platinum) in both North America and emerging markets.

The following graph summarizes daily VaR for our trading portfolios at a 99 percent confidence level (in millions): 

The following table summarizes our trading VaR for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and at December 31, 2020:

(1) Portfolio diversification is the market risk dispersion effect of holding a portfolio containing different risk types. It represents the reduction in unsystematic market risk that occurs when combining a number of different risk types, for example, foreign exchange, interest rate and credit spread, together in one portfolio. It is measured as the difference between the sum of the VaR by individual risk type and the combined total VaR. A negative number represents the benefit of portfolio diversification. As the maximum and minimum occur on different days for different risk types, it is not meaningful to calculate a portfolio diversification benefit for these measures. 

(2) The total VaR is non-additive across risk types due to diversification effects. For presentation purposes, portfolio diversification of the VaR for trading portfolios includes VaR-based risk-not-in-VaR. 

Back-testing We routinely validate the accuracy of our VaR models by back-testing them against hypothetical profit and loss that excludes non-modeled items such as fees, commissions and revenues of intra-day transactions from the actual reported profit and loss. We would expect, under stable market conditions, to see two or three losses in excess of VaR at the 99 percent confidence level over a one-year period. However, in periods of unstable market conditions, we could see an increase in the number of back-testing exceptions. 

During the first quarter of 2021, we experienced no loss back-testing exceptions. 

Non-trading portfolios Non-trading VaR predominantly relates to Markets Treasury and represents the potential negative changes in the investment portfolio market value (which includes available-for-sale and held-to-maturity assets) and associated hedges. Our investment portfolio holdings comprise mainly U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed and U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities. Our non-trading VaR exposure is driven by interest rates and agency spread volatility.

(1) Refer to the Trading VaR table above for additional information. 

Non trading VaR was higher at March 31, 2021 as compared with December 31, 2021 due primarily to an increase in volatility of interest rates and spread volatility on U.S. Treasury and U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed securities. 

Non-trading VaR also includes the interest rate risk of non-trading financial assets and liabilities held by the global businesses and transfer priced into Markets Treasury which has the mandate to centrally manage and hedge it. See "Treasury Risk Management" above for a broader discussion on how interest rate risk is managed. 

Financial Crime Risk Management The Financial Crime Risk Management Committee ("FCRMC"), chaired by the U.S. Head of Financial Crime and Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Officer, served as the principal financial crime governance forum, responsible for the management of financial crime risk. As a reflection of the growing maturity and effectiveness of financial crime risk management, the functions of the FCRMC were integrated into the Risk Management Meeting ("RMM") during the first quarter of 2021. With this change, the RMM now oversees the risk management of both regulatory compliance and financial crime. There have been no other material changes to our approach to financial crime risk management since December 31, 2020.

CONSOLIDATED AVERAGE BALANCES AND INTEREST RATES 

The following table summarizes the quarter-to-date average daily balances of the principal components of assets, liabilities and equity together with their respective interest amounts and rates earned or paid. Net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by the average interest earning assets from which interest income is earned. Loan interest for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 included fees of $20 million and $17 million, respectively.
