 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Forward-Looking Statements 

Certain matters discussed throughout this Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, we may make or approve certain statements in future filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), in press releases, or oral or written presentations by representatives of HSBC USA Inc.

HSBC USA Inc. 

Executive Overview 

HSBC USA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC North America Holdings Inc. ("HSBC North America"), which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC. HUSI may also be referred to in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&#38;A") as "we," "us" or "our." 

Economic Environment &#160; U.S. economic activity slowed during the first half of 2022. U.S. Gross Domestic Product ("GDP") contracted at an estimated annual rate of 0.9 percent in the second quarter of 2022. Repercussions from the Russia-Ukraine war alongside the economic impacts that continue to result from the COVID-19 pandemic have disrupted supply chains and increased energy prices. There has also been a significant rise in inflation, which reached a 40-year high in June. The personal consumption expenditures price index increased to an estimated annual rate of 6.8 percent in the second quarter of 2022, well above the FRB's target inflation rate. The FRB increased short-term interest rates by a total of 150 basis points during the first half of 2022 and has announced that it will increase short-term interest rates further during the second half of 2022 in order to fight inflation. 

These conditions have created significant uncertainty about the future economic environment which will continue to evolve and impact our business in future periods. While our credit risk exposure to Russia was immaterial at June 30, 2022, it is difficult to anticipate the full effect of sanctions announced to date on our business and on our customers. Concerns over interest rate levels, energy prices, domestic and global policy issues, trade policy in the U.S. and geopolitical events, as well as the implications of those events on the markets in general, further add to the global uncertainty. There is also a risk that interest rate increases to fight inflation could lead to a recession. Interest rate levels and energy prices, in combination with global economic conditions, fiscal and monetary policy and the level of regulatory and government scrutiny of financial institutions will continue to impact our results in 2022 and beyond. 

Performance, Developments and Trends We continue to progress our strategic plan to restructure our operations ("Restructuring Plan") as discussed further in Note 2, "Strategic Initiatives," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We remain committed to our multi-year strategic plan to re-profile our business. 

As previously announced, in February 2022, we completed the sale of the branch disposal group associated with the exit of our mass market retail banking business to third parties and recognized a gain on sale of approximately $111 million, net of transaction costs. See Note 3, "Branch Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

In addition to the branch disposal group discussed above, during the first quarter of 2022, we sold a portfolio of consumer loans consisting primarily of certain non-performing mortgage loans and government-backed mortgage loans that we previously transferred to held for sale in 2021 as part of our Restructuring Plan. These mortgage loans had a carrying value of $904 million, including $865 million of residential mortgages and $39 million of home equity mortgages, and we recognized a loss on sale of $35 million, largely reflecting changes in the final terms of the sale. 

The following tables set forth selected financial metrics of HUSI for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 and at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021:

Net income was $90 million and $291 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared with $193 million and $532 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. Income before income tax was $113 million and $379 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared with $254 million and $714 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. The decrease in income before income tax during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 was due primarily to a higher provision for credit losses which reflected loss provisions in the current year periods driven by the weakening of economic conditions compared with releases in credit loss reserves in the prior year periods driven by improved economic conditions and the impact of our decision to exit our mass market retail banking business which resulted in a release of credit loss reserves and a reduction to the provision for credit losses of approximately $101 million during the second quarter of 2021. This decrease was partially offset by lower operating expenses and higher other revenues driven by higher trading revenue and, in the year-to-date period, the gain on sale of the branch disposal group as discussed above. While net interest income was lower and contributed to the decrease in the year-to-date period, it was higher in the three-month period. 

Our reported results in all periods were impacted by certain items management believes to be significant, which affect comparability between periods. Significant items are excluded to arrive at adjusted performance because management would ordinarily identify and consider them separately to better understand underlying business trends. The following table summarizes the impact of these significant items for all periods presented:

Costs to achieve primarily consists of lease impairment and other related costs, severance costs, allocated costs from HSBC Technology &#38; Services ("HTSU"), and in the prior year periods, trading losses associated with the exit of certain derivative contracts. See Note 2, "Strategic Initiatives," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of these

costs. The expense during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 also includes $25 million and $42 million, respectively, of allocated costs from other HSBC affiliates related to the HSBC Group's restructuring activities as well as a loss of $3 million on the sale of certain global banking loans and, in the year-to-date period, a loss of $35 million on the sale of a portfolio of consumer mortgage loans. The expense during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 also includes $11 million and $18 million, respectively, of allocated costs from other HSBC affiliates related to the HSBC Group's restructuring activities. 

(2) Reflects a loss on the swap agreements we entered into to retain the litigation risk associated with the Visa Inc. ("Visa") Class B common shares ("Class B Shares") we sold to a third party in 2016 and 2017. The loss recorded in the second quarter of 2022 related to an increase in the expected timing of the final resolution of the related litigation and, to a lesser extent, a change in the Visa Class B Share conversion rate. See Note 18, "Guarantee Arrangements, Pledged Assets and Repurchase Agreements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

(3) Represents a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure. 

Excluding the impact of the items in the table above, our adjusted performance during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 decreased $170 million and $417 million, respectively, compared with the prior year periods due primarily to a higher provision for credit losses as discussed above. This decrease was partially offset by lower operating expenses and higher other revenues driven by higher trading revenue. While net interest income was lower and contributed to the decrease in the year-to-date period, it was higher in the three-month period. 

See "Results of Operations" for a more detailed discussion of our operating trends. In addition, see "Balance Sheet Review" for further discussion on our asset and liability trends, "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for further discussion on funding and capital and "Credit Quality" for additional discussion on our credit trends. 

London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") Transition Regulators and central banks in various national jurisdictions continue to actively work to help transition from interbank offered rates to acceptable alternative rates, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") recommended by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee convened by the FRB. In March 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate Act ("LIBOR Act") was signed into law in order to provide a federal solution for replacing USD LIBOR with a SOFR-based rate in certain legacy LIBOR-based contracts. Under the LIBOR Act, the FRB is required to issue a regulation within 180 days identifying which version of SOFR will apply. This federal legislation is expected to facilitate the transition of certain of our legacy LIBOR-based contracts which do not specify a replacement rate or contain an adequate fallback mechanism. 

We continue to actively participate in HSBC's global transition program with the objective of facilitating an orderly transition of all products, processes, models and curves, as well as all legacy LIBOR-based contracts, onto replacement rates. The current focus of our client transition efforts is on those remaining contracts that will be impacted by USD LIBOR tenors ceasing or becoming non-representative immediately after June 30, 2023. Such contracts outstanding at June 30, 2022 included contracts for non-derivative financial assets with a carrying value of approximately $21.8 billion, primarily consisting of USD LIBOR-based loans, contracts for non-derivative financial liabilities with a carrying value of approximately $1.1 billion, primarily consisting of USD LIBOR-based long-term debt ($1.0 billion of which is already set to transition to SOFR as of July 1, 2023), and contracts for USD LIBOR-based derivatives with a notional value of approximately $22.6 billion. The substantial majority of our outstanding USD LIBOR-based derivative contracts adhere to and are covered by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association fallback protocol. 

The ability of HUSI and its clients to transition legacy contracts onto replacement rates is dependent on the availability of products that reference replacement rates, including SOFR, and on our customers being ready and able to adapt their own processes and systems to accommodate the replacement products. Market readiness in support of USD LIBOR transition could slow the transition and we remain prepared that the transition of outstanding contracts could be concentrated in late 2022 and the first half of 2023. We continue to engage with industry participants, the official sector and our clients to support an orderly transition and the mitigation of the risks resulting from the transition. For further discussion of our LIBOR transition program and the associated risks, see "Executive Overview" in MD&#38;A in our 2021 Form 10-K. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Basis of Reporting 

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"). 

Group Reporting Basis We report financial information to HSBC in accordance with HSBC Group accounting and reporting policies, which apply International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRSs") as issued by the IASB. As a result, our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the basis of HSBC Group's accounting and reporting policies ("Group Reporting Basis"). Because operating results on the Group Reporting Basis are used in managing our businesses and rewarding performance of employees, our management also separately monitors profit before tax under this basis of reporting. The following table reconciles our U.S. GAAP versus Group Reporting Basis profit before tax: 

Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 &#160; (in millions) Profit before tax &#8211; U.S. GAAP basis $ 113 &#160; $ 254 $ 379 &#160; $ 714 Adjustments: Expected credit losses 22 &#160; (49) 74 &#160; (188) Other long-lived assets 12 &#160; 29 23 &#160; 39 Loans held for sale 11 &#160; (96) 6 &#160; (104) Renewable energy tax credit investments 6 &#160; 5 13 &#160; 9 Pension and other postretirement benefit costs &#8212; &#160; (1) (3) (5) Other (4) &#8212; 1 &#160; 2 Profit before tax &#8211; Group Reporting Basis $ 160 &#160; $ 142 $ 493 &#160; $ 467 

The significant differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis as they impact our results are summarized in Note 25, "Business Segments," in our 2021 Form 10-K. There have been no significant changes since December 31, 2021 in the differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis impacting our results. Differences in reported profit before tax in the table above that were individually significant for the periods presented are explained below. 

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, expected credit losses were higher under U.S. GAAP than under the Group Reporting Basis. Under the Group Reporting Basis, a majority of our loans are considered to be in "stage 1" (which requires a 12-month expected credit losses estimate), while under U.S. GAAP such loans require a lifetime expected credit losses ("ECL") estimate. Primarily as a result of the different requirements, loss provisions driven by the weakening of economic conditions, including a worsening of economic forecasts in the three-month period, as well as higher provisions associated with loan growth and maturity extensions were more pronounced under U.S. GAAP. 

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, expected credit losses were lower under U.S. GAAP than under the Group Reporting Basis. Primarily as a result of the different requirements related to stage 1 loans discussed above, releases in credit reserves driven by improved economic conditions, which resulted in improved economic forecasts as well as client paydowns, were more pronounced under U.S. GAAP. 

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, amortization expense for long-lived assets was higher under U.S. GAAP. During the third quarter of 2020, we recorded an impairment charge under the Group Reporting Basis related to the write-off of all the capitalized software and a portion of the leasehold improvements primarily associated with our Wealth and Personal Banking business segment, while under U.S. GAAP, no impairment charge was required. Consequently, the carrying amounts for capitalized software and leasehold improvements are higher under U.S. GAAP than under the Group Reporting Basis and, as a result, corresponding amortization expense is higher under U.S. GAAP. In addition, during the second quarter of 2021, we determined we would exit certain branches as part of our Restructuring Plan and, as a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $18 million under U.S. GAAP to write-off the leasehold improvements associated with these branches. These leasehold improvements were previously written-off under the Group Reporting Basis as discussed above. 

During the six months ended June 30, 2022, loans held for sale in the table above reflects a higher gain on loan sales under the Group Reporting Basis than under U.S. GAAP, which includes the gain on sale of the branch disposal group. The higher gain under the Group Reporting Basis was due primarily to the releases of credit loss reserves previously recorded on the loans under U.S. GAAP when they were transferred to held for sale in 2021. Also contributing to the higher gain under the Group Reporting Basis was the higher carrying amount of leasehold improvements associated with the sold branches under U.S. GAAP at the time of sale. These leasehold improvements were previously determined to be impaired and written-off under the Group Reporting Basis as discussed above. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, we transferred certain loans to held for sale which under U.S. GAAP requires the loans to be carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value which resulted in a release of credit loss reserves on the loans. Under the Group Reporting Basis, loans held for sale continue to be accounted for and credit losses continue to be measured in accordance with IFRS 9, "Financial Instruments," with any gain or loss recorded at the time of sale. In addition, a portion of the loans transferred under U.S. GAAP did not meet the more stringent criteria for held for sale classification under the Group Reporting Basis. 

Balance Sheet Review 

The following table provides balance sheet totals at June 30, 2022 and increases (decreases) since December 31, 2021: 

&#160; &#160; Increase (Decrease) From December 31, 2021

Short-Term Investments Short-term investments include cash and due from banks, interest bearing deposits with banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell. Balances may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our liquidity position at the time and our strategy for deploying liquidity. Short-term investments decreased compared with December 31, 2021 due primarily to lower deposits and higher loans as discussed in detail below as well as completion of the sale of the branch disposal group during the first quarter of 2022 which resulted in a net cash payment to the buyers. These decreases were partially offset by net sales of trading security positions and securities available-for-sale.

(3) See "Credit Quality" in this MD&#38;A for a discussion of trends in our allowance for credit losses on loans. 

Commercial loans increased compared with December 31, 2021 driven by new business activity as we continued to apply a disciplined lending approach to grow the business and, to a lesser extent, higher loans to affiliates. The increase in commercial non-affiliate loans was primarily in the software, real estate, banking, commercial services and retailing industries. 

Consumer loans increased compared with December 31, 2021 due primarily to the transfer of certain residential mortgage and home equity mortgage loans from held for sale to held for investment during the second quarter of 2022 with a carrying value which collectively totaled $538 million as discussed further below. Also contributing to the increase was growth in residential mortgage loans. 

The following table presents loan-to-value ("LTV") ratios for our residential mortgage loan portfolio, excluding mortgage loans held for sale:

(1) LTVs for first liens are calculated using the loan balance as of the reporting date. LTVs for second liens are calculated using the loan balance as of the reporting date plus the senior lien amount at origination. Current estimated property values are derived from the property's appraised value at the time of loan origination updated by the change in the Federal Housing Finance Agency's House Price Index ("HPI") at either a Core Based Statistical Area or state level. The estimated value of the homes could differ from actual fair values due to changes in condition of the underlying property, variations in housing price changes within metropolitan statistical areas and other factors. As a result, actual property values associated with loans that end in foreclosure may be significantly lower than the estimates used for purposes of this disclosure. 

(2) Current estimated property values are calculated using the most current HPIs available and applied on an individual loan basis, which results in an approximate three month delay in the production of reportable statistics. Therefore, the information in the table above reflects current estimated property values using HPIs at March 31, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively.

Loans Held for Sale The following table summarizes loans held for sale at June 30, 2022 and increases (decreases) since December 31, 2021: 

&#160; &#160; Increase (Decrease) From December 31, 2021 

&#160; &#160; 

June 30, 2022 Amount % &#160; (dollars are in millions) Commercial loans: Business and corporate banking $ 7 &#160; $ (116) (94.3) % Global banking 366 &#160; 28 8.3 Total commercial 373 &#160; (88) (19.1) Consumer loans: Residential mortgages 12 &#160; (3,070) (99.6) Home equity mortgages &#8212; &#160; (275) (100.0) Credit cards 8 &#160; (187) (95.9) Other consumer 96 &#160; (108) (52.9) Total consumer 116 &#160; (3,640) (96.9) Total loans held for sale $ 489 &#160; $ (3,728) (88.4) % 

Commercial loans held for sale decreased compared with December 31, 2021. During the first quarter of 2022, we completed the sale of the branch disposal group that we previously transferred to held for sale in 2021 as part of our Restructuring Plan. The sale included certain retail business banking loans with a carrying value at the time of sale of $37 million. See Note 3, "Branch Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale," for additional information. 

Also included in commercial loans held for sale are certain other loans that we no longer intend to hold for investment and were transferred to held for sale which totaled $201 million and $359 million at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The decrease compared with December 31, 2021 was due to loan sales. 

In addition, commercial loans held for sale includes certain loans that we have elected to designate under the fair value option which consists of loans that we originate in connection with our participation in a number of syndicated credit facilities with the intent of selling them to unaffiliated third parties as well as loans that we purchase from the secondary market and hold as hedges against our exposure to certain total return swaps. The fair value of these loans totaled $172 million and $23 million at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Balances will fluctuate from period to period depending on the volume and level of activity. 

During the second quarter of 2022, we also sold certain global banking loans to third parties in order to reduce risk-weighted assets as part of our Restructuring Plan. These global banking loans had a carrying value at the time of sale of $44 million and we recognized a loss on sale of $3 million. 

Consumer loans held for sale decreased compared with December 31, 2021. As discussed above, during the first quarter of 2022, we completed the sale of the branch disposal group that we previously transferred to held for sale in 2021 as part of our Restructuring Plan. The sale included certain consumer loans with a carrying value which collectively totaled $2,102 million, including $1,665 million of residential mortgages, $185 million of home equity mortgages, $168 million of credit cards and $84 million of other consumer loans. See Note 3, "Branch Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale," for additional information. 

In addition to the branch disposal group discussed above, during the first quarter of 2022, we sold a portfolio of consumer loans to a third party consisting primarily of certain non-performing mortgage loans and government-backed mortgage loans that we previously transferred to held for sale in 2021 as part of our Restructuring Plan. These mortgage loans had a carrying value which collectively totaled $904 million, including $865 million of residential mortgages and $39 million of home equity mortgages, and we recognized a loss on sale of $35 million, largely reflecting changes in the final terms of the sale. 

Subsequent to completion of the sales discussed above, during the second quarter of 2022, the remaining mass market residential mortgage and home equity mortgage loans not sold, with a carrying value which collectively totaled $538 million, were transferred back to held for investment as we now intend to hold these loans as a run-off portfolio for the foreseeable future. 

At June 30, 2022, additional consumer loans that we previously transferred to held for sale in 2021 as part of our Restructuring Plan remained in loans held for sale, including $8 million of credit cards and $96 million of other consumer loans (of which $22 million are student loans that we have previously elected to designate under the fair value option and are therefore carried at fair value). 

HSBC USA Inc. 

In addition, residential mortgage loans held for sale includes agency-eligible conforming residential mortgage loans which are originated and held for sale to third parties, currently on a servicing retained basis. Balances will fluctuate from period to period depending on the volume and level of activity. Gains and losses from the sale of these residential mortgage loans are reflected as a component of other income (loss) in the accompanying consolidated statement of income. 

Excluding the loans designated under fair value option discussed above, loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value, with adjustments to fair value being recorded as a valuation allowance through other revenues. The valuation allowance on consumer loans held for sale was $13 million and $7 million at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The valuation allowance on commercial loans held for sale was $1 million and $5 million at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

Trading Assets and Liabilities The following table summarizes trading assets and liabilities at June 30, 2022 and increases (decreases) since December 31, 2021: 

&#160; &#160; Increase (Decrease) From December 31, 2021 

&#160; &#160;

* Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. 

(1) See Note 4, "Trading Assets and Liabilities," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a breakout of trading securities by category. 

Trading securities balances were lower compared with December 31, 2021 due primarily to a decrease in equity positions, partially offset by an increase in foreign sovereign positions. Trading security positions are held as economic hedges of interest rate, credit and equity derivative products issued to clients of domestic and emerging markets. Balances of securities sold, not yet purchased were lower compared with December 31, 2021 driven by a decline in short U.S. Treasury positions related to economic hedges of derivatives in the interest rate trading portfolio. 

Precious metals trading assets decreased compared with December 31, 2021 due to a decrease in our own gold inventory position and lower spot prices, partially offset by an increase in our own silver inventory position. Payables for precious metals were higher compared with December 31, 2021 reflecting an increase in borrowing of gold inventory to support client activity levels. Precious metal positions may not represent our net underlying exposure as we may use derivatives contracts to reduce our risk associated with these positions, the fair value of which would appear in derivatives in the table above. 

Derivative asset and liability balances both increased compared with December 31, 2021 mainly from market movements which resulted in higher valuations of foreign exchange, commodity and credit derivatives, partially offset by lower valuations of interest rate derivatives. Market movements on equity derivatives were mixed, resulting in high derivative asset valuations, but lower derivative liability valuations. 

Securities Securities include securities available-for-sale and securities held-to-maturity, net. Securities balances were lower compared with December 31, 2021 driven by unfavorable market valuations due to increasing yields as well as net sales and paydowns as part of our continuing strategy to maximize returns while balancing the securities portfolio for risk management purposes. The decline in securities balances was primarily in U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed securities, U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities and U.S. Treasury securities. 

All Other Assets &#160; All other assets include, among other items, properties and equipment, net, goodwill and other branch related assets held for sale. All other assets were higher compared with December 31, 2021 due primarily to increases in deferred tax assets, cash collateral posted and outstanding settlement balances related to security sales. These increases were partially offset by completion of the sale of other branch related assets held for sale during the first quarter of 2022.

Deposits The following table summarizes deposit balances by major depositor categories at June 30, 2022 and increases (decreases) since December 31, 2021: 

&#160; &#160; Increase (Decrease) From December 31, 2021

&#8212; &#160; (8,750) (100.0) Total deposits $ 127,263 &#160; $ (15,769) (11.0) % 

(1) Represented deposits associated with the exit of our mass market retail banking business as part of our Restructuring Plan. 

Total deposits decreased compared with December 31, 2021 due primarily to lower demand and savings deposits driven by the attrition of balances our clients had previously built up during the COVID-19 pandemic and clients deploying cash to their businesses, as well as completion of the sale of the branch disposal group during the first quarter of 2022. These decreases were partially offset by increased deposits from affiliates and higher time deposits. 

Short-Term Borrowings &#160; Short-term borrowings were lower compared with December 31, 2021 due to a decline in securities sold under repurchase agreements, partially offset by an increase in commercial paper outstanding. 

Long-Term Debt Long-term debt decreased compared with December 31, 2021 as the impact of debt issuances was more than offset by debt retirements and fair value movements on fair value option debt. Debt issuances during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 totaled $2,198 million and $2,845 million, respectively, of which $14 million and $102 million, respectively, was issued by HSBC Bank USA. 

Incremental issuances from our shelf registration statement with the SEC totaled $2,743 million of senior debt during the six months ended June 30, 2022, which included $1,000 million of senior notes that were issued by HSBC USA in May as well as $1,743 million of structured notes. Total long-term debt outstanding under this shelf was $8,331 million and $7,346 million at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

Incremental issuances from the HSBC Bank USA Global Bank Note Program totaled $102 million during the six months ended June 30, 2022. Total debt outstanding under this program was $1,955 million and $1,966 million at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

Borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") totaled $1,000 million at both June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

Interest, Taxes and Other Liabilities Interest, taxes and other liabilities include, among other items, other branch related liabilities held for sale. Interest, taxes and other liabilities were higher compared with December 31, 2021 due primarily to increases in derivative balances associated with hedging activities and outstanding settlement balances related to security purchases. These increases were partially offset by completion of the sale of other branch related liabilities held for sale during the first quarter of 2022.

Results of Operations 

Net Interest Income Net interest income is the total interest income on earning assets less the total interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds. An analysis of consolidated average balances and interest rates is presented in this MD&#38;A under the caption "Consolidated Average Balances and Interest Rates." 

The significant components of net interest margin are summarized in the following table:

Net interest income increased during the three months ended June 30, 2022 due primarily to higher interest income from short-term investments, commercial loans and securities driven by higher yields and higher commercial loan average balances. The increase in the three-month period was partially offset by higher interest expense from interest bearing liabilities driven by higher rates paid as well as lower interest income from consumer loans driven by lower average balances and lower yields. In the year-to-date period, net interest income decreased due primarily to higher interest expense from deposits and short-term borrowings driven by higher rates paid as well as lower interest income from consumer loans and securities driven by lower average balances and lower consumer loan yields. The decrease in the year-to-date period was partially offset by higher interest income from short-term investments and trading securities driven by higher yields on these investments. 

Short-term investments Interest income increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 due to higher yields reflecting the impact of higher market rates. 

Trading securities Interest income was relatively flat during the three months ended June 30, 2022 and increased in the year-to-date period as the impact of higher yields reflecting the impact of higher market rates and a shift in mix to higher yielding equity positions was largely offset in the three-month period and partially offset in the year-to-date period by lower average balances. Lower average balances were driven by declines in foreign sovereign and U.S. Treasury positions, which were partially offset in the year-to-date period by an increase in equity positions. Interest income associated with trading securities was partially offset within trading revenue by the performance of the associated derivatives as discussed further below. 

Securities Interest income increased during the three months ended June 30, 2022 and decreased in the year-to-date period as the impact of higher yields reflecting the impact of higher market rates was partially offset in the three-month period and more than offset in the year-to-date period by lower average balances. Lower average balances were due primarily to declines in U.S. Treasury and foreign sovereign securities. 

Commercial loans Interest income increased during the three months ended June 30, 2022 due to higher average balances driven by new business activity and higher yields reflecting the impact of higher market rates. In the year-to-date period, interest income decreased as the impact of higher average balances driven by new business activity was more than offset by 

HSBC USA Inc. 

lower yields reflecting the impact of low market rates on loans originated or refinanced during the second half of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022. 

Consumer loans Interest income decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 due primarily to the impact of loan sales which resulted in lower average balances and lower yields, including a lower mix of higher yielding credit card receivables. 

Other Higher interest income during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 was due to higher yields reflecting the impact of higher market rates on cash collateral posted and investments in Federal Reserve Bank stock and FHLB stock. 

Deposits Interest expense increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 due to higher rates paid reflecting the impact of higher market rates. The increase was partially offset by lower average balances reflecting lower demand and savings deposits driven by the attrition of balances our clients had previously built up during the COVID-19 pandemic and clients deploying cash to their businesses, as well as completion of the sale of the branch disposal group during the first quarter of 2022. Also contributing to lower average balances was a decline in time deposits which was partially offset by higher savings deposits from a few large private banking clients. 

Short-term borrowings Higher interest expense during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 was due primarily to higher rates paid reflecting the impact of higher market rates. 

Long-term debt Interest expense increased during the three months ended June 30, 2022 and decreased in the year-to-date period as the impact of higher rates paid reflecting the impact of higher market rates was partially offset in the three-month period and more than offset in the year-to-date period by lower average borrowings. 

Tax liabilities and other Interest expense increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 due primarily to higher rates paid on securities sold, not yet repurchased reflecting the impact of higher market rates. 

Provision for Credit Losses The following table summarizes the components of the provision for credit losses:

* Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. 

Our provision for credit losses increased $298 million and $536 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, due to a higher provision for credit losses on both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios as well as a higher provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures. 

The provision for credit losses on our commercial loan portfolio increased $166 million and $345 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, reflecting loss provisions compared with releases in credit loss reserves in the prior year periods. The loss provisions in the current year periods were driven by the weakening of economic conditions which resulted in increases in credit reserves for risk factors associated with large loan and higher risk industry exposures, supply chain disruptions and energy price uncertainty, as well as weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and, in the current three-month period, a worsening of economic forecasts. Also contributing to the loss provisions in the current year periods were higher provisions associated with loan growth and maturity extensions. In the prior year periods, the releases in credit reserves were driven by improved economic conditions which resulted in improved economic forecasts and improvements in the credit condition of certain clients as well as declines in credit reserves for risk factors associated with higher risk client exposures and, in the year-to-date period, economic uncertainty. Client paydowns and loan sales also contributed to the releases in the prior year periods. 

The provision for credit losses on our consumer loan portfolio increased $98 million and $95 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, due primarily to releases in credit loss reserves in the prior year periods driven by our decision to exit our mass market retail banking business which resulted in a release of credit loss reserves and a reduction to the provision for credit losses of approximately $100 million during the second quarter of 2021, including declines in credit reserves for risk factors primarily associated with economic uncertainty and forbearance accounts. Also contributing to the releases in credit reserves in the prior year periods were improved economic conditions which resulted in improved economic forecasts. In the current year three-month period, a modest loss provision was driven by the weakening of economic conditions which resulted in a worsening of economic forecasts. In the current year-to-date period, the provision for credit losses was relatively flat as an increase in credit reserves for risk factors associated with economic uncertainty was more than offset by the impact of net recoveries. 

The provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures increased $32 million during the three months ended June 30, 2022 reflecting a modest loss provision in the current year period resulting from the weakening of economic conditions compared with a release in credit loss reserves in the prior year period resulting from improved economic conditions. In the 

HSBC USA Inc. 

year-to-date period, the provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures increased $95 million reflecting a lower release in credit loss reserves. The modest release in credit reserves in the current year period resulted from improvements in the credit condition of certain clients while the release in the prior year period resulted from improved economic conditions.

Credit card fees, net Credit card fees, net was relatively flat during the three months ended June 30, 2022 and increased in the year-to-date period as lower income from retail credit cards reflecting the impact of loan sales was largely offset in the three-month period and more than offset in the year-to-date period by higher income from commercial credit cards. The increase in income from commercial credit cards reflects higher interchange fees driven by higher client spending, partially offset by higher cost estimates associated with our credit card rewards program. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Trust and investment management fees Trust and investment management fees increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 due to higher fees from liquidity funds driven by lower fee waivers reflecting the impact of higher market interest rates and higher average liquidity assets under management. The increase was partially offset by lower fees from fixed income funds driven by unfavorable market performance. 

Other fees and commissions Other fees and commissions decreased during the three months ended June 30, 2022 due primarily to lower fees from loan syndication, loan commitments and wire transfers reflecting lower business activity compared with the prior year period. The decrease was partially offset by higher loan servicing fees reflecting the temporary servicing agreement we entered into associated with the sale of a portfolio of mass market retail credit cards to a third party during the fourth quarter of 2021. In the year-to-date period, other fees and commissions were relatively flat as higher loan servicing fees were largely offset by lower fees from wire transfers. See Note 13, "Fee Income from Contracts with Customers," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information including a summary of the components of other fees and commissions. 

Trading revenue Trading revenue is generated by participation in the foreign exchange, precious metals, rates, credit and equities markets. The following table presents trading revenue by business activity. Not included in the table below is the impact of net interest income associated with trading securities which is an integral part of trading activities' overall performance. Certain derivatives, such as total return swaps, are economically hedged by holding the underlying interest bearing referenced assets. Net interest income related to trading activities is recorded in net interest income in the consolidated statement of income. Trading revenue related to the mortgage banking business is included as a component of other income (loss).

(1) Includes trading revenue related to Global Banking and Equities. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, other trading revenue also included $6 million and $10 million, respectively, of trading losses associated with the exit of certain derivative contracts as part of our Restructuring Plan. 

Trading revenue increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 due primarily to higher revenue in Securities Financing, Markets Treasury and Metals. Higher revenue in Securities Financing was due to lower losses related to swaps in prime brokerage. Revenue was higher in Markets Treasury due to the improved performance of economic hedge positions used 

HSBC USA Inc. 

to manage interest rate risk and revenue was higher in Metals as market volatility resulted in increased trading opportunities. Also contributing to the increase in trading revenue was the non-recurrence of Other trading losses recorded in the prior year periods associated with the exit of certain derivative contracts as part of our Restructuring Plan. 

Other securities gains, net We maintain securities portfolios as part of our balance sheet diversification and risk management strategies. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, we sold $686 million and $1,002 million, respectively, of primarily U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed and U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities compared with $2,263 million and $6,170 million during the prior year periods as part of a continuing strategy to maximize returns while balancing the securities portfolio for risk management purposes. Other securities gains, net decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 reflecting the impact of lower sales activity. The gross realized gains and losses from sales of securities, which are included as a component of other securities gains, net above, are summarized in Note 5, "Securities," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 due primarily to higher performance fees associated with trading activity booked on the balance sheet of HSBC Bank plc and, in the year-to-date period, higher cost reimbursements associated with shared services performed on behalf of other HSBC affiliates. 

Gain on instruments designated at fair value and related derivatives We have elected to apply fair value option accounting to certain commercial loans held for sale, certain student loans, certain of our own fixed-rate debt issuances and all of our hybrid instruments issued, including structured notes and deposits. We also use derivatives to economically hedge the interest rate and other risks associated with certain financial assets and liabilities for which fair value option accounting has been elected. Gain on instruments designated at fair value and related derivatives increased during the three months ended June 30, 2022 and was flat in the year-to-date period as favorable movements related to the economic hedging of interest rate and other risks within our hybrid instruments were partially offset in the three-month period and offset in the year-to-date period by valuation losses in the current year periods on certain commercial loans as well as unfavorable movements related to the economic hedging of interest rate risk within our own debt. See Note 11, "Fair Value Option," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information including a breakout of these amounts by individual component. 

Gain on sale of branch disposal group, net During the first quarter of 2022, we completed the sale of the branch disposal group associated with the exit of our mass market retail banking business to third parties and recognized a gain on sale of approximately $111 million, net of transaction costs. See Note 3, "Branch Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

Other income (loss) &#160; Other income (loss) was lower during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 due primarily to a loss of $31 million recorded during the second quarter of 2022 on the swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of Visa Class B Shares primarily related to an increase in the expected timing of the final resolution of the related litigation and, in the year-to-date period, a loss of $35 million recorded during the first quarter of 2022 on the sale of a portfolio of consumer mortgage loans. Also contributing to the decrease in both periods were higher losses associated with bank owned life insurance, lower gains on sales of commercial loans and lower residential mortgage banking revenue driven by lower gains on sales of residential mortgage loans. These decreases were partially offset by higher income associated with credit default swap protection which largely reflects the hedging of a few client relationships.

Operating Expenses The following table summarizes the components of operating expenses: 

Increase (Decrease) Three Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 Amount % &#160; (dollars are in millions) Salaries and employee benefits $ 138 &#160; $ 182 $ (44) (24.2) % Support services from HSBC affiliates: Fees paid to HTSU 244 &#160; 268 (24) (9.0) Fees paid to HSBC Markets (USA) Inc.

* Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. 

Salaries and employee benefits Salaries and employee benefits expense decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 due primarily to lower salaries and incentive compensation expense driven by staff reductions related to our 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Restructuring Plan, including completion of the sale of the branch disposal group during the first quarter of 2022. Also contributing to the decrease, to a lesser extent, was lower salaries expense reflecting the impact of certain wholesale operations staff which were transferred from HSBC Bank USA to HTSU support services during the first quarter of 2022. 

Support services from HSBC affiliates Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 due primarily to higher allocated restructuring related costs from HTSU and other HSBC affiliates. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, we recorded $55 million and $95 million, respectively, of allocated restructuring related costs from HTSU and other HSBC affiliates, primarily support service project costs and severance costs, compared with $29 million and $48 million of allocated costs during the prior year periods. Also contributing to the increase were higher cost allocations from HMUS associated with Global Banking activities reflecting the impacts of higher staff costs and an updated service level agreement as well as higher costs associated with our investments in systems infrastructure and new technologies. In addition, the increase reflects higher expense due to the transfer of certain wholesale operations staff from HSBC Bank USA to HTSU support services as discussed above. These increases were partially offset by lower cost allocations from our support service functions driven by the execution of our Restructuring Plan. A summary of the services received from various HSBC affiliates is included in Note 14, "Related Party Transactions," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Occupancy expense, net Occupancy expense, net was lower during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 due primarily to the non-recurrence of $82 million of lease impairment and other related costs recorded during the second quarter of 2021 related to the exit of certain branches and office space as part of our Restructuring Plan. Also contributing to the decrease were lower operating lease costs and depreciation expense driven by the execution of our Restructuring Plan, including completion of the sale of the branch disposal group during the first quarter of 2022. 

Other expenses Other expenses increased during the three months ended June 30, 2022 due primarily to higher professional fees driven by higher attorney's fees, partially offset by higher levels of expense capitalization related to internally developed software as well as declines in equipment costs, deposit insurance assessment fees and marketing expense. In the year-to-date period, other expenses were flat as higher professional fees driven by higher attorney's fees were offset by higher levels of expense capitalization related to internally developed software as well as declines in equipment costs, deposit insurance assessment fees and marketing expense. 

Efficiency ratio Our efficiency ratio improved during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 due to lower operating expenses driven by lease impairment and other related costs recorded during the second quarter of 2021 as discussed above and higher other revenues driven by higher trading revenue and, in the year-to-date period, the gain on sale of the branch disposal group recorded during the first quarter of 2022 as discussed above. While net interest income was higher and contributed to the improvement in the three-month period, it was lower in the year-to-date period. 

Income tax expense The following table summarizes our effective tax rate based on the provision for income taxes attributable to pretax income: 

Three Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 &#160; (dollars are in millions) Income before income tax $ 113 &#160; $ 254 Income tax expense 23 &#160; 61 Effective tax rate 20.4 &#160; % 24.0 % Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 &#160; (dollars are in millions) Income before income tax $ 379 &#160; $ 714 Income tax expense 88 &#160; 182 Effective tax rate 23.2 &#160; % 25.5 % 

Income tax expense and the effective tax rate decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022. The decrease in income tax expense was driven by lower pre-tax income, while the decrease in the effective tax rate resulted from higher expected investment tax credits in the current year periods. 

Management evaluated the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets at June 30, 2022 and it was determined that a valuation allowance was not required at this time. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Segment Results &#8211; Group Reporting Basis 

We have distinct businesses, which are aligned with HSBC's global business strategy: Wealth and Personal Banking ("WPB"), Commercial Banking ("CMB"), and Global Banking and Markets ("GBM"). These businesses and a Corporate Center ("CC") serve as our reportable segments with the exception of GBM. Our GBM business is comprised of three distinct operating segments: Global Banking ("GB"), Markets and Securities Services ("MSS"), and Global Banking and Markets Other ("GBM Other"), which are separately reported as discussed further below, effective as of the fourth quarter of 2021 for all periods presented. 

See Note 15, "Business Segments," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a table that summarizes the impact of this change on reported segment profit (loss) before tax, total assets and total deposits as of and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021. There have been no changes in the basis of our segmentation as compared with the presentation in our 2021 Form 10-K. See Item 1, "Business," in our 2021 Form 10-K for a description of our segments, including a discussion of the main business activities of the segments and a summary of their products and services. 

Net interest income of each segment represents the difference between actual interest earned on assets and interest incurred on liabilities of the segment, adjusted for a funding charge or credit that includes both interest rate and liquidity components. Segments are charged a cost to fund assets (e.g. customer loans) and receive a funding credit for funds provided (e.g. customer deposits) based on equivalent market rates that incorporate both repricing (interest rate risk) and tenor (liquidity) characteristics. The objective of these charges/credits is to transfer interest rate risk to one centralized unit in Markets Treasury. Markets Treasury income statement and balance sheet results are allocated to each of the global businesses based upon tangible equity levels and levels of any surplus liabilities. 

Certain other revenue and operating expense amounts are also apportioned among the business segments based upon the benefits derived from this activity or the relationship of this activity to other segment activity. These inter-segment transactions have not been eliminated, and we generally account for them as if they were with third parties. 

We report financial information to our parent, HSBC, in accordance with HSBC Group accounting and reporting policies, which apply IFRSs as issued by the IASB. As a result, our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the Group Reporting Basis as operating results are monitored and reviewed, trends are evaluated and decisions about allocating resources, such as employees, are primarily made on this basis. We continue, however, to monitor capital adequacy and report to regulatory agencies on a U.S. GAAP basis. 

There have been no changes in the measurement of segment profit as compared with the presentation in our 2021 Form 10-K. 

The significant differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis as they impact our results are summarized in Note 25, "Business Segments," in our 2021 Form 10-K. There have been no significant changes since December 31, 2021 in the differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis impacting our results.

During the six months ended June 30, 2022, retail business banking and other also reflects a gain of $148 million on the sale of the branch disposal group associated with the exit of our mass market retail banking business and a loss on the sale of a portfolio of consumer mortgage loans as discussed below. 

Our WPB segment reported a profit before tax during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared with a loss before tax in the prior year periods. The improvement in the three-month period was due primarily to lower operating expenses, partially offset by lower other operating income and lower net interest income. In the year-to-date period, the improvement was due primarily to lower operating expenses and higher other operating income driven by completion of the sale of the branch disposal group associated with the exit of our mass market retail banking business which resulted in a gain of $148 million during the first quarter of 2022. The improvement in the year-to-date period was partially offset by lower net interest income. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Net interest income decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 due primarily to the impact of loan sales and completion of the sale of the branch disposal group during the first quarter of 2022 which resulted in lower average loan and deposit balances as well as lower spreads. Also contributing to the decrease was the unfavorable impact of lower deposits driven by the attrition of balances our customers had previously built up during the COVID-19 pandemic which was partially offset by higher savings deposits from a few large private banking clients. 

Excluding the gain on sale of the branch disposal group as discussed above, other operating income decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 due primarily to a loss of $31 million recorded during the second quarter of 2022 on the swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of Visa Class B Shares primarily related to an increase in the expected timing of the final resolution of the related litigation and, in the year-to-date period, a loss of $55 million recorded during the first quarter of 2022 on the sale of a portfolio of consumer mortgage loans. Also contributing to the decrease in both periods was lower residential mortgage banking revenue driven by unfavorable fair value adjustments on residential mortgage loans held for trading as well as lower allocated Markets Treasury revenue. These decreases were partially offset by higher investment management fees driven by lower liquidity fee waivers reflecting the impact of higher market interest rates and higher average assets under management. 

Expected credit losses improved during the three months ended June 30, 2022 driven by improvements in the credit quality of the portfolio, partially offset by the weakening of economic conditions which resulted in a worsening of economic forecasts. In the year-to-date period, expected credit losses were relatively flat as the impact of improvements in the credit quality of the portfolio was largely offset by an increase in credit reserves for risk factors associated with economic uncertainty. 

Operating expenses decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 driven by the execution of our Restructuring Plan, including completion of the sale of the branch disposal group during the first quarter of 2022, which resulted in declines in staff costs, operating lease costs, marketing expense and cost allocations from our technology and support service functions. Also contributing to the decrease was the non-recurrence of $57 million of lease impairment and other related costs recorded during the second quarter of 2021 primarily related to the exit of certain branches as part of our Restructuring Plan as well as lower deposit insurance assessment fees. 

Client Assets The following table provides information regarding private banking client assets during the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021:

Our CMB segment reported a lower profit before tax during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 due to higher expected credit losses, partially offset by higher net interest income, lower operating expenses and, in the year-to-date period, higher other operating income. 

Net interest income increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 due to higher deposit spreads reflecting the impacts of higher market rates and higher average loan balances, partially offset in the three-month period by lower average deposit balances. 

Other operating income was relatively flat during the three months ended June 30, 2022. In the year-to-date period, other operating income increased due primarily to higher fees from loan syndication, account services and letters of credit. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Expected credit losses increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 reflecting loss provisions compared with releases in credit loss reserves in the prior year periods. The loss provisions in the current year periods were driven by the weakening of economic conditions which resulted in weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and increases in credit reserves for risk factors associated with service industry loan exposures. Also contributing to the loss provisions in the current year periods were higher provisions associated with loan growth. In the prior year periods, the releases in credit reserves were driven by improved economic conditions which resulted in improved economic forecasts as well as client paydowns. 

Operating expenses decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 due primarily to lower incentive compensation expense and lower branch network costs, partially offset by higher cost allocations from our technology and support service functions. 

Global Banking and Markets Our GBM business is comprised of three reportable operating segments:

Our GB segment reported a lower profit before tax during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 due to higher expected credit losses and higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher other operating income and higher net interest income. 

Revenue increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 due to higher revenue in GB Other and GLCM, partially offset by lower revenue in Capital Markets and Credit and Lending. Higher revenue in GB Other was driven by valuation gains recorded in the current year periods on certain credit-linked structured notes and higher income associated with credit default swap protection which largely reflects the hedging of a few client relationships. Higher GLCM revenue was due primarily to higher net interest income reflecting the impact of higher market rates as well as higher account service fees. Lower Capital Markets revenue was due primarily to lower fees from loan syndication, valuations losses in the current year periods on certain commercial loans and the non-recurrence of revenue associated with the collection of a nonaccrual loan in the prior year periods. Lower revenue in Credit and Lending was driven by lower fees from loan commitments and the non-recurrence of revenue associated with the collection of a nonaccrual loan in the prior year periods, partially offset by higher net interest income from improved spreads. 

Expected credit losses increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 reflecting lower releases in credit loss reserves. The modest releases in credit reserves in the current year periods were driven by improvements in the credit condition of certain clients and declines in credit reserves for risk factors associated with oil and gas industry loan exposures. In the prior year periods, the releases in credit reserves were driven by improved economic conditions which resulted in improved economic forecasts and improvements in the credit condition of certain clients. Client paydowns and loan sales also contributed to the releases in the prior year periods. 

Operating expenses increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 due primarily to higher cost allocations from our technology and support service functions, including higher cost allocations from HMUS reflecting the impacts of higher staff costs and an updated service level agreement.

net interest income. In the year-to-date period, our MSS segment reported a higher profit before tax due primarily to higher other operating income, partially offset by lower net interest income. 

Revenue increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 due primarily to higher revenue in Foreign Exchange and Metals, Equities, Securities Financing and MSS Other. Higher revenue in Foreign Exchange and Metals was due to market volatility which resulted in increased trading opportunities. Higher Equities revenue was driven by higher performance fees associated with trading activity booked on the balance sheet of HSBC Bank plc. Higher revenue in Securities Financing was due to increased business activity and improved yields while higher revenue in MSS Other was driven by the non-recurrence of trading losses recorded in the prior year periods associated with the exit of certain derivative contracts as part of our Restructuring Plan. These increases were partially offset in the year-to-date period by unfavorable Credit and funding valuation adjustments attributable primarily to lower gains from credit valuation adjustments on derivative assets. 

Operating expenses increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 due primarily to higher cost allocations from our technology and support service functions, partially offset by lower staff costs.

Our GBM Other segment reported a profit before tax during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared with a loss before tax during the prior year periods due primarily to lower operating expenses driven by lower administrative expenses and lower cost allocations from our support service functions as well as lower net interest expense driven by lower liquidity charges.

Our CC segment reported a higher loss before tax during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 due primarily to higher operating expenses, higher interest expense and, in the year-to-date period, lower other operating income. 

Net interest expense increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 reflecting higher retained liquidity charges. 

Other operating income was relatively flat during the three months ended June 30, 2022. In the year-to-date period, other operating income decreased due primarily to unfavorable movements related to the economic hedging of interest rate risk within our own debt, lower income from equity investments and higher losses on certain investments held for Community Reinvestment Act purposes. 

Operating expenses increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 due primarily to higher professional fees driven by higher attorney's fees, higher allocated restructuring related costs from HTSU and other HSBC affiliates, primarily support service project costs and severance costs, as well as higher costs associated with our investments in systems infrastructure and new technologies. These increases were partially offset by higher levels of expense capitalization related to internally developed software and the non-recurrence of $10 million of lease impairment and other related costs recorded during the second quarter of 2021 associated with closed branches and certain office space as part of our Restructuring Plan.

Reconciliation of Segment Results As previously discussed, segment results are reported on a Group Reporting Basis. See Note 15, "Business Segments," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of our Group Reporting Basis segment results to U.S. GAAP consolidated totals. 

Credit Quality 

In the normal course of business, we enter into a variety of transactions that involve both on and off-balance sheet credit risk. Principal among these activities is lending to various commercial, institutional, governmental and individual customers. We participate in lending activity throughout the United States and, on a limited basis, internationally. 

Allowance for Credit Losses / Liability for Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures &#160; Our accounting policies and methodologies related to the allowance for credit losses and liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures are presented under the caption "Critical Accounting Estimates" in MD&#38;A and in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements," in our 2021 Form 10-K. Our approach toward credit risk management is summarized under the caption "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2021 Form 10-K. There have been no significant revisions to our policies or methodologies during the first half of 2022. 

The following table summarizes our allowance for credit losses and the liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures: 

June 30, 2022 March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 &#160; (in millions) Allowance for credit losses: Loans: Commercial loans $ 499 &#160; $ 441 $ 420 Consumer loans 35 &#160; 26 27 Total loans 534 &#160; 467 447 Securities held-to-maturity &#8212; &#160; 1 1

(1) Primarily includes accrued interest receivables and customer acceptances. 

The total allowance for credit losses at June 30, 2022 increased $68 million or 14 percent as compared with March 31, 2022 and increased $87 million or 19 percent as compared with December 31, 2021 due primarily to a higher loss estimate on our commercial loan portfolio and, to a lesser extent, our consumer loan portfolio. 

Our commercial allowance for credit losses at June 30, 2022 increased $58 million or 13 percent as compared with March 31, 2022 and increased $79 million or 19 percent as compared with December 31, 2021 driven by the weakening of economic conditions which resulted in increases in credit reserves for risk factors associated with large loan and higher risk industry exposures, supply chain disruptions and energy price uncertainty, as well as weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and, as compared with March 31, 2022, a worsening of economic forecasts. Also contributing to the increase in both periods were higher loss estimates associated with loan growth and maturity extensions. The increase as compared with December 31, 2021 was partially offset by charge-offs. 

Our consumer allowance for credit losses at June 30, 2022 increased $9 million or 35 percent as compared with March 31, 2022 and increased $8 million or 30 percent as compared with December 31, 2021 driven by the weakening of economic conditions which resulted in a worsening of economic forecasts as compared with March 31, 2022 and an increase in credit reserves for risk factors associated with economic uncertainty as compared with December 31, 2021. 

The liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures at June 30, 2022 increased $5 million or 6 percent as compared with March 31, 2022 resulting from the weakening of economic conditions. As compared with December 31, 2021, the liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures decreased $14 million or 14 percent resulting from improvements in the credit condition of certain clients.

(2) Represents our commercial and consumer allowance for credit losses, as appropriate, divided by the corresponding outstanding balance of total nonperforming loans held for investment. Nonperforming loans include accruing loans contractually past due 90 days or more. 

See Note 7, "Allowance for Credit Losses," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a rollforward of credit losses by loan categories for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. 

The allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment at June 30, 2022 increased as compared with both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 as the increase in our allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above outpaced an increase in total loans held for investment. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

The allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of nonperforming loans held for investment at June 30, 2022 decreased as compared with March 31, 2022 as an increase in nonperforming loans as discussed further below in both our consumer and commercial loan portfolios outpaced the increase in our allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above. As compared with December 31, 2021, the allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of nonperforming loans held for investment increased due to the increase in our allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above and a decrease in nonperforming loans as discussed further below in both our consumer and commercial loan portfolios. 

Delinquency The following table summarizes dollars of two-months-and-over contractual delinquency and two-months-and-over contractual delinquency as a percentage of total loans, excluding loans held for sale ("delinquency ratio"). 

&#160; June 30, 2022 March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021

(1) At June 30, 2022, March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, consumer mortgage loan delinquency includes $46 million, $7 million and $24 million, respectively, of loans that are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. 

(2) The following table reflects dollars of contractual delinquency and delinquency ratios for interest-only loans and adjustable rate mortgage ("ARM") loans: 

&#160; June 30, 2022 March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Delinquent Loans Delinquency Ratio Delinquent Loan Delinquency Ratio Delinquent Loans Delinquency Ratio &#160; (dollars are in millions) Interest-only loans $ 4 &#160; .10 &#160; % $ &#8212; &#8212; % $ 3 .07 % ARM loans 62 &#160; .50 &#160; 31 .26 67 .56 

Our two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio increased 26 basis points compared with March 31, 2022 and was flat compared with December 31, 2021. The increase in the ratio as compared with March 31, 2022 was due to higher dollars of delinquency in both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios, partially offset by higher outstanding loan balances. As compared with December 31, 2021, higher dollars of delinquency in both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios were offset by higher outstanding loan balances. 

Our commercial loan two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio increased 22 basis points compared with March 31, 2022 and was relatively flat compared with December 31, 2021. The increase in the ratio as compared with March 31, 2022 was due to higher dollars of delinquency driven primarily by two commercial real estate loans which became 60 days past due, partially offset by higher outstanding loan balances. As compared with December 31, 2021, the impact of higher dollars of delinquency in the second quarter was largely offset by collections and the partial charge-off of a global banking loan in the first quarter as well as higher outstanding loan balances. 

Our consumer loan two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio increased 39 basis points compared with March 31, 2022 and was flat compared with December 31, 2021. The increase in the ratio as compared with March 31, 2022 was due to higher dollars of delinquency driven by the impact of transferring certain loans from held for sale to held for investment during the second quarter of 2022, which collectively included $44 million of delinquent consumer mortgage loans, as well as certain private banking mortgage customers which became 60 days past due. The increase in the ratio as compared with March 31, 2022 was partially offset by higher outstanding loan balances. As compared with December 31, 2021, the impact of transferring certain loans from held for sale to held for investment in the second quarter was largely offset by the sale of certain non-performing mortgage loans during the first quarter of 2022 as well as higher outstanding loan balances.

Our net charge-off ratio decreased 74 basis points during the three months ended June 30, 2022 due primarily to a lower level of net charge-offs in our consumer loan portfolio driven by the non-recurrence of $56 million of charge-offs recorded during the second quarter of 2021 on certain loans that were transferred to held for sale as well as lower charge-offs in credit cards reflecting the impact of lower balances due to loan sales. Also contributing to the decrease in the ratio was a lower level of net charge-offs in our commercial loan portfolio driven by the sale of a global banking loan and the deterioration of a corporate banking loan in the prior year. 

In the year-to-date period, our net charge-off ratio decreased 39 basis points due primarily to a lower level of net charge-offs in our consumer loan portfolio due primarily to the non-recurrence of charge-offs recorded during the second quarter of 2021 on certain loans that were transferred to held for sale as discussed above as well as lower charge-offs in credit cards reflecting the impact of lower balances due to loan sales. Also contributing to the decrease in the ratio was a lower level of net charge-offs in our commercial loan portfolio driven by lower charge-offs associated with loan sales.

(1) See Note 6, "Loans," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a breakout of nonaccrual loans and accruing loans contractually 90 days or more past due. At June 30, 2022, March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, total nonperforming loans include $2 million, $2 million and $3 million, respectively, of accruing loans contractually 90 days or more past due. 

(2) At June 30, 2022, March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, nonperforming consumer mortgage loans include $95 million, $63 million and $86 million, respectively, of loans that are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell. 

(3) Nonperforming consumer mortgage loans held for investment include all loans which are 90 or more days contractually delinquent as well as loans discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not re-affirmed and second lien loans where the first lien loan that we own or service is 90 or more days contractually delinquent. 

(4) Nonperforming consumer mortgage loans for all periods does not include guaranteed loans purchased from the Government National Mortgage Association. Repayment of these loans is predominantly insured by the Federal Housing Administration and as such, these loans have different risk characteristics from the rest of our customer loan portfolio. 

(5) Includes $1 million or less of commercial other real estate owned at June 30, 2022, March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

Our nonperforming loans ratio increased 11 basis points compared with March 31, 2022 due to higher nonperforming loans in our consumer loan portfolio, and to a lesser extent, our commercial loan portfolio, partially offset by higher outstanding loan balances. As compared with December 31, 2021, our nonperforming loans ratio decreased 27 basis points due to lower nonperforming loans in both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios as well as higher outstanding loan balances. 

Our commercial nonperforming loans ratio was flat compared with March 31, 2022 as higher nonperforming loans due primarily to the downgrade of a corporate banking loan was offset by higher outstanding loan balances. As compared with December 31, 2021, our commercial nonperforming loans ratio decreased 26 basis points due to lower nonperforming loans driven by the paydown of a commercial real estate loan, loan sales and the partial charge-off of a global banking loan. Also contributing to the decrease in the ratio as compared with December 31, 2021 was higher outstanding loan balances. 

Our consumer nonperforming loans ratio increased 37 basis points compared with March 31, 2022 due to higher nonperforming loans driven primarily by the impact of transferring certain loans from held for sale to held for investment during the second quarter of 2022, which collectively included $63 million of consumer mortgage nonperforming loans. The increase in the ratio as compared with March 31, 2022 was partially offset by higher outstanding loan balances. As compared with December 31, 2021, our consumer nonperforming loans ratio decreased 27 basis points due to lower nonperforming loans as the impact of transferring certain loans from held for sale to held for investment in the second quarter was more than offset by the sale of certain non-performing mortgage loans and customers who were previously on forbearance relief returning to accrual status during the first quarter of 2022. Also contributing to the decrease in the ratio as compared with December 31, 2021 were higher outstanding loan balances. 

Our policies and practices for problem loan management and placing loans on nonaccrual status are summarized in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements," in our 2021 Form 10-K.

Concentration of Credit Risk A concentration of credit risk is defined as a significant credit exposure with an individual or group engaged in similar activities or affected similarly by economic conditions. We enter into a variety of transactions in the normal course of business that involve both on and off-balance sheet credit risk. Principal among these activities is lending to various commercial, institutional, governmental and individual customers throughout the United States and internationally. We manage the varying degrees of credit risk associated with on and off-balance sheet transactions through specific credit policies and procedures which provide for a strict approval, monitoring and reporting process. It is our policy to require collateral when it is deemed appropriate. Varying degrees and types of collateral are secured depending upon management's credit evaluation. 

Commercial Credit Exposure Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Commercial loans outstanding, excluding loans held for sale, and unused commercial commitments by industry are presented in the table below:

Residential Mortgage Loans Our consumer loan portfolio includes the following types of loans: 

&#8226; Interest-only loans &#8211; A loan which allows a customer to pay the interest-only portion of the monthly payment for a period of time which results in lower payments during the initial loan period. 

&#8226; ARM loans &#8211; A loan which allows us to adjust pricing on the loan in line with market movements. 

The following table summarizes the balances of interest-only and ARM loans in our loan portfolios, excluding mortgages held for sale, at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Each category is not mutually exclusive and loans may appear in more than one category below.

Credit Risks Associated with Derivative Contracts Credit risk associated with derivatives is measured as the net replacement cost of derivative contracts in a receivable position in the event the counterparties of such contracts fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. In managing derivative credit risk, both the current exposure, which is the replacement cost of contracts on the measurement date, as well as an estimate of the potential change in value of contracts over their remaining lives are considered. Counterparties to our derivative activities include financial institutions, central clearing parties, foreign and domestic government agencies, corporations, funds (mutual funds, hedge funds, etc.), insurance companies and private clients as well as other HSBC entities. These counterparties are subject to regular credit review by the credit risk management department. To minimize credit risk, we may enter into legally enforceable master netting agreements which reduce risk by permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon occurrence of certain events. In addition, we reduce credit risk by obtaining collateral from counterparties. The determination of the need for and the levels of collateral will differ based on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty and/or regulatory requirements. 

The total risk in a derivative contract is a function of a number of variables, such as: 

&#8226; volatility of interest rates, currencies, equity or corporate reference entity used as the basis for determining contract payments; 

&#8226; current market events or trends; 

&#8226; country risk; 

&#8226; maturity and liquidity of contracts; 

&#8226; creditworthiness of the counterparties in the transaction; 

&#8226; the existence of a master netting agreement among the counterparties; and 

&#8226; existence and value of collateral received from counterparties to secure exposures. 

The table below presents total credit risk exposure calculated using the general risk-based capital rules of the Basel III Standardized Approach which includes the net positive mark-to-market of the derivative contracts plus any adjusted potential future exposure as measured in reference to the notional amount. The regulatory capital rules recognize that bilateral netting agreements reduce credit risk and, therefore, allow for reductions of risk-weighted assets when netting requirements have been met and collateral exists. As a result, risk-weighted amounts for regulatory capital purposes are a portion of the original gross exposures. Furthermore, many contracts contain provisions that allow us to close out the transaction if the counterparty fails to post required collateral. In addition, many contracts give us the right to break the transactions earlier than the final maturity date. As a result, these contracts have potential future exposures that are often much smaller than the future exposures derived from the regulatory capital rules. 

June 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 &#160; (in millions) Risk associated with derivative contracts: Total credit risk exposure $ 14,405 &#160; $ 11,896 Less: collateral held against exposure 4,260 &#160; 3,894 Net credit risk exposure $ 10,145 &#160; $ 8,002 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Effective liquidity management is defined as ensuring we can meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities/withdrawals and other cash commitments efficiently under both normal operating conditions and under unpredictable circumstances of industry or market stress. To achieve this objective, we have guidelines that require sufficient liquidity to cover potential funding requirements in both the short- and long-term and to avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. Guidelines are set for the consolidated balance sheet of HSBC USA to ensure that it is a source of strength for our regulated, deposit-taking banking subsidiary, as well as to address the more limited sources of liquidity available to it as a holding company. Similar guidelines are set for HSBC Bank USA to ensure that it can meet its liquidity needs in various stress scenarios. Cash flow analysis, including stress testing scenarios, forms the basis for liquidity management and contingency funding plans. See "Risk Management" in this MD&#38;A for further discussion of our approach towards liquidity and funding risk management, including information regarding the key measures employed to define, monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk. 

Interest Bearing Deposits with Banks totaled $42,538 million and $47,400 million at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, of which $42,238 million and $47,259 million, respectively, were held with the Federal Reserve Bank. Balances may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our liquidity position at the time and our strategy for deploying liquidity.

See "Balance Sheet Review" in this MD&#38;A for further analysis and discussion on long-term debt trends, including additional information on debt issued and repaid during the six months ended June 30, 2022. 

Under our shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, we may issue certain securities including debt securities and preferred stock. We satisfy the eligibility requirements for designation as a "well-known seasoned issuer," which allows us to file a registration statement that does not have a limit on issuance capacity. The ability to issue under the registration statement is limited by the authority granted by the Board of Directors. During the first quarter of 2022, due to an anticipated decrease in utilization of the shelf registration statement, the Board of Directors approved a reduction in the amount we are authorized to issue from $20,000 million at December 31, 2021 to $15,000 million, of which $6,669 million was available at June 30, 2022. HSBC Bank USA has a $40,000 million Global Bank Note Program that provides for the issuance of subordinated and senior notes, of which $11,981 million was available at June 30, 2022. 

As a member of the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, we have secured borrowing facilities which are collateralized by loans and investment securities. At June 30, 2022, long-term debt included $1,000 million of borrowings from the FHLB facility. Based upon the amounts pledged as collateral under these facilities, we have additional borrowing capacity of up to $13,430 million. 

Preferred Equity See Note 19, "Preferred Stock," in our 2021 Form 10-K for information regarding all outstanding preferred share issues. 

Common Equity During the six months ended June 30, 2022, HSBC USA did not receive any cash capital contributions from its parent, HSBC North America, and did not make any capital contributions to its subsidiary, HSBC Bank USA. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Capital Ratios In managing capital, we develop targets for common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, total capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier 1 capital to adjusted quarterly average assets (i.e., the "Tier 1 leverage ratio"). Capital targets are reviewed at least semi-annually to ensure they reflect our business mix and risk profile, as well as real-time conditions and circumstances. The following table summarizes HSBC USA's Basel III capital ratios calculated as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021: 

June 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 15.0 &#160; % 15.1 % Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 16.2 &#160; 16.3 Total capital to risk-weighted assets 18.4 &#160; 18.5 

Tier 1 leverage ratio (1) 

9.8 &#160; 8.5 

(1) Adjusted quarterly average assets, the Tier 1 leverage ratio denominator, reflects quarterly average assets adjusted for amounts permitted to be deducted from Tier 1 capital. 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that provided the option to transition in the regulatory capital impacts of the current expected credit loss accounting standard over a five-year period. In 2020, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA elected the five-year transition option and, as a result, our capital ratios were being reported in accordance with the transition rules in the final rule. However, as of December 31, 2021, there was no remaining impact to regulatory capital under the transition rules and, therefore, there are no amounts being phased into regulatory capital in subsequent periods. 

We manage capital in accordance with HSBC Group policy. The HSBC North America Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ("ICAAP") works in conjunction with the HSBC Group's ICAAP. The HSBC North America ICAAP applies to HSBC Bank USA and evaluates regulatory capital adequacy and capital adequacy under various stress scenarios. Our approach is to meet our capital needs for these stress scenarios locally through activities which reduce risk. To the extent that local alternatives are insufficient, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC, we would seek support from our ultimate parent. Regulatory capital requirements are based on the amount of capital required to be held, plus applicable capital buffers, as defined by regulations, and the amount of risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure, also calculated based on regulatory definitions. 

We are subject to regulatory capital rules issued by U.S. banking regulators including Basel III (the "Basel III rule"). The Basel III rule establishes minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for banks and bank holding companies ("BHCs"). HSBC North America, HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA each calculate their risk-based capital requirements for credit risk under the Standardized Approach in the Basel III rule. In 2019, the FRB and the other federal banking agencies jointly finalized rules to implement the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act that tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards for large BHC and foreign banking organizations (the "Tailoring Rules"). The Tailoring Rules assign each BHC and IHC with $50 billion or more in total U.S. assets into one of five classifications (Categories I through IV, and 'other firms') based on its size and four risk-based indicators. As of January 1, 2022, HSBC North America met the criteria to be re-classified as a Category IV firm and, as a result of this classification change, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA are no longer subject to the supplementary leverage ratio or the countercyclical capital buffer. Prior to January 1, 2022, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA were subject to Category III standards. For additional discussion of the Basel III rule requirements, including required minimum capital ratios, as well as further discussion of the Tailoring Rules, Category IV standards and other related regulatory developments and their expected impact see Part I, "Regulation and Competition - Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Requirements," in our 2021 Form 10-K. We continue to review the composition of our capital structure and capital buffers in light of these developments. 

Capital Planning and Stress Testing The FRB requires certain U.S. top-tier BHCs and IHCs, including HSBC North America, to comply with the FRB's capital plan rule and CCAR program, as well as the supervisory stress tests conducted by the FRB. The stress tests are forward looking exercises to assess the impact of hypothetical macroeconomic baseline and severely adverse scenarios provided by the FRB on the financial condition and capital adequacy of a CCAR firm over a nine quarter planning horizon. As a result of its re-classification as a Category IV firm, HSBC North America is no longer subject to company-run stress testing and related disclosure requirements. Category IV firms are subject to supervisory stress testing on an every-other-year basis, although they may opt into such testing in an "off year" in order to recalibrate their stress capital buffer based on their most recent supervisory stress test. The FRB continues to supervise Category IV firms on an ongoing basis, including evaluation of the capital adequacy and capital planning processes during off-cycle years. For further discussion of capital planning and stress testing, including detail regarding the FRB's supervisory assessment as part of the CCAR process, see Part I, "Regulation and Competition - Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Requirements," in our 2021 Form 10-K. 

HSBC North America submitted its 2022 CCAR capital plan in April 2022. In June 2022, the FRB publicly disclosed its supervisory stress test results for all CCAR firms, including HSBC North America. Stress testing results are based solely on 

HSBC USA Inc. 

hypothetical adverse stress scenarios and should not be viewed or interpreted as forecasts of expected outcomes or capital adequacy or of the actual financial condition of HSBC North America. Capital planning and stress testing for HSBC North America may impact our future capital and liquidity. 

While BHC regulatory capital compliance is generally performed at the HSBC North America level, and also separately for HSBC Bank USA, as a BHC we are required to meet minimum capital requirements imposed by the FRB. We present our capital ratios, together with HSBC Bank USA's in Note 16, "Retained Earnings and Regulatory Capital Requirements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

2022 Funding Strategy Our current estimate for funding needs and sources for 2022 are summarized in the following table: 

Actual January 1 through 

June 30, 2022 

Estimated July 1 through 

December 31, 2022 

Estimated Full Year 2022 

&#160; (in billions) Increase (decrease) in funding needs: Net change in loans $ 2 $ &#8212; $ 2 Net change in short-term investments and securities (15) (1) (16) Net change in trading and other assets (5) 1 (4) Total funding needs $ (18) $ &#8212; $ (18) Increase (decrease) in funding sources: Net change in deposits $ (16) $ 2 $ (14) Net change in trading and other short-term liabilities (1) (3) (4) Net change in long-term debt (1) 1 &#8212; Total funding sources $ (18) $ &#8212; $ (18) 

The above table reflects a long-term funding strategy. Daily balances fluctuate as we accommodate customer needs, while ensuring that we have liquidity in place to support the balance sheet maturity funding profile. Should market conditions deteriorate, we have contingency plans to generate additional liquidity through the sales of assets or financing transactions. We remain confident in our ability to access the market for long-term debt funding needs in the current market environment. We continue to seek well-priced and stable customer deposits. We also continue to sell new agency-eligible conforming residential mortgage loans to third parties. 

HSBC Bank USA is subject to significant restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to, and certain other 'covered transactions' with HSBC USA and other affiliates. For further discussion, see Part I, "Regulation and Competition - Affiliate Transaction Restrictions," in our 2021 Form 10-K. 

See "Risk Management" in this MD&#38;A for further discussion relating to our liquidity contingency plans and our approach to liquidity and funding risk management. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our normal operations, we enter into credit derivatives and various off-balance sheet arrangements with affiliates and third parties. These arrangements arise principally in connection with our lending and client intermediation activities and involve primarily commitments to extend credit and, in certain cases, guarantees. 

Commitments to extend credit include arrangements whereby we are contractually obligated to extend credit in the form of loans, participations in loans or similar transactions. At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had commitments to extend credit totaling $90.3 billion and $94.1 billion, respectively, comprised primarily of commercial commitments and, to a lesser extent, consumer commitments. Commercial commitments comprise primarily those related to secured and unsecured loans and lines of credit. Consumer commitments comprise unused MasterCard/Visa credit card lines, where we have the right to change terms or conditions upon notification to the customer, and commitments to extend credit secured by residential properties, where we have the right to change terms or conditions, for cause, upon notification to the customer. For a summary of guarantees, including standby letters of credit and certain credit derivative transactions, as well as the contractual amounts outstanding at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, see Note 18, "Guarantee Arrangements, Pledged Asset and Repurchase Agreements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent our maximum possible credit exposure in the event that a counterparty draws down the full commitment amount or we are required to fulfill our maximum obligation under a guarantee. Many of these commitments and guarantees expire unused or without default. In addition, implementation of our business strategy (as described under the heading "Executive Overview - 2021 Events" in our 2021 Form 10-K) will affect our 

HSBC USA Inc. 

contractual obligations over time, including with respect to consumer commitments. As a result, we believe that the contractual amount is not representative of the actual future credit exposure or funding requirements. 

Our off-balance sheet arrangements also include transactions with unconsolidated variable interest entities ("VIEs"). See Note 17, "Variable Interest Entities," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of these unconsolidated VIEs. 

Fair Value 

Fair Value Hierarchy Fair value measurement accounting principles establish a fair value hierarchy structure that prioritizes the inputs to determine the fair value of an asset or liability (the "Fair Value Framework"). The Fair Value Framework distinguishes between inputs that are based on observed market data and unobservable inputs that reflect market participants' assumptions. It emphasizes the use of valuation methodologies that maximize observable market inputs. For financial instruments carried at fair value, the best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an actively traded market (Level 1). Where the market for a financial instrument is not active, valuation techniques are used. The majority of our valuation techniques use market inputs that are either observable or indirectly derived from and corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the financial instrument (Level 2). Because Level 1 and Level 2 instruments are determined by observable inputs, less judgment is applied in determining their fair values. In the absence of observable market inputs, the financial instrument is valued based on valuation techniques that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The determination of the level of fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement of an asset or a liability is classified often requires judgment and may change over time as market conditions evolve. We consider the following factors in developing the fair value hierarchy: 

&#8226; whether the asset or liability is transacted in an active market with a quoted market price; 

&#8226; the level of bid-ask spreads; 

&#8226; a lack of pricing transparency due to, among other things, complexity of the product and market liquidity; 

&#8226; whether only a few transactions are observed over a significant period of time; 

&#8226; whether the pricing quotations differ substantially among independent pricing services; 

&#8226; whether inputs to the valuation techniques can be derived from or corroborated with market data; and 

&#8226; whether significant adjustments are made to the observed pricing information or model output to determine the fair value. 

Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that the reporting entity has the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities. A financial instrument is classified as a Level 1 measurement if it is listed on an exchange or is an instrument actively traded in the over-the-counter ("OTC") market where transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume. We regard financial instruments such as debt securities, equity securities and derivative contracts listed on the primary exchanges of a country to be actively traded. Non-exchange-traded instruments classified as Level 1 assets include securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, to-be-announced securities, non-callable securities issued by U.S. Government sponsored enterprises and certain foreign government-backed debt. 

Level 2 inputs are those that are observable either directly or indirectly but do not qualify as Level 1 inputs. We classify mortgage pass-through securities, agency and certain non-agency mortgage collateralized obligations, non-exchange-traded derivative contracts, asset-backed securities, obligations of U.S. states and political subdivisions, corporate debt securities, certain foreign government-backed debt, preferred securities, securities purchased and sold under resale and repurchase agreements, precious metals, certain loans held for sale, certain student loans, residential mortgage loans whose carrying amount was reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral and real estate owned as Level 2 measurements. Where possible, at least two quotations from independent sources are obtained based on transactions involving comparable assets and liabilities to validate the fair value of these instruments. We have established a process to understand the methodologies and inputs used by the third party pricing services to ensure that pricing information meets the fair value objective and, where appropriate, this pricing data is back-tested to market trade executions. Where significant differences arise among the independent pricing quotes and the internally determined fair value, we investigate and reconcile the differences. If the investigation results in a significant adjustment to the fair value, the instrument will be classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. In general, we have observed that there is a correlation between the credit standing and the market liquidity of a non-derivative instrument. 

Level 2 derivative instruments are generally valued based on discounted future cash flows or an option pricing model adjusted for counterparty credit risk and market liquidity. The fair value of certain derivative products is determined using valuation techniques based on inputs derived from observable indices traded in the OTC market. Appropriate control processes and 

HSBC USA Inc. 

procedures have been applied to ensure that the derived inputs are applied to value only those instruments that share similar risks to the relevant benchmark indices and therefore demonstrate a similar response to market factors. 

Level 3 inputs are unobservable estimates that management expects market participants would use to determine the fair value of the asset or liability. That is, Level 3 inputs incorporate market participants' assumptions about risk and the risk premium required by market participants in order to bear that risk. We develop Level 3 inputs based on the best information available in the circumstances. At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our Level 3 measurements included the following: certain structured deposits and structured notes for which the embedded derivatives have significant unobservable inputs (e.g., volatility or default correlations), certain asset-backed securities, individually assessed commercial loans, mortgage servicing rights, derivatives with certain inputs which are unobservable, certain credit default swaps, certain loans held for sale and swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of Visa Class B Shares for which the fair value is dependent upon the final resolution of the related litigation. See Note 19, "Fair Value Measurements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on Level 3 inputs. 

Level 3 Measurements The following table provides information about Level 3 assets/liabilities in relation to total assets/liabilities measured at fair value at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021:

(3) Includes $69,478 million of assets measured on a recurring basis and $264 million of assets measured on a non-recurring basis at June 30, 2022. Includes $74,511 million of assets measured on a recurring basis and $2,202 million of assets measured on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2021. 

Significant Changes in Fair Value for Level 3 Assets and Liabilities During the first quarter of 2022, we sold certain loans which were transferred to held for sale during 2021 and were Level 3 assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. See Note 8, "Loans Held for Sale," in the accompany consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

See Note 19, "Fair Value Measurements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on additions to and transfers into (out of) Level 3 measurements during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 as well as for further details including the classification hierarchy associated with assets and liabilities measured at fair value. 

Effect of Changes in Significant Unobservable Inputs &#160; The fair value of certain financial instruments is measured using valuation techniques that incorporate pricing assumptions not supported by, derived from or corroborated by observable market data. The resultant fair value measurements are dependent on unobservable input parameters which can be selected from a range of estimates and may be interdependent. Changes in one or more of the significant unobservable input parameters may change the fair value measurements of these financial instruments. For the purpose of preparing the financial statements, the final valuation inputs selected are based on management's best judgment that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing similar assets or liabilities. 

The unobservable input parameters selected are subject to the internal valuation control processes and procedures. When we perform a test of all the significant input parameters to the extreme values within the range at the same time, it could result in an increase of the overall fair value measurement of approximately $22 million or a decrease of the overall fair value measurement of approximately $24 million at June 30, 2022. The effect of changes in significant unobservable input parameters are primarily driven by the uncertainty in determining the fair value of certain credit-linked structured notes.

Risk Management 

Overview &#160; Managing risk effectively is fundamental to the delivery of our strategic priorities. 

We use a comprehensive risk management framework across the organization and across all risk types underpinned by our risk culture. This framework fosters continuous monitoring, promotes risk awareness and encourages sound operational and strategic decision-making. It also ensures a consistent approach to identifying, assessing, managing and reporting the risks we accept and incur in our activities. 

Our Board of Directors has the ultimate responsibility for effective oversight of risk management. It is advised on risk matters by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors, notably risk appetite and its alignment with our strategy, risk governance and internal controls, as well as high-level risk related matters. Robust risk governance and accountability are embedded throughout our business through an established framework that helps to ensure appropriate oversight of and accountability for the effective management of risk. 

Our material risks The principal risks associated with our operations include the following: 

&#8226; Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract; 

&#8226; Treasury risk is the risk of having insufficient capital, liquidity or funding resources to meet financial obligations and satisfy regulatory requirements, including pension risk. Treasury risk also includes the risk to our earnings due to changes in market interest rates; 

&#8226; Market risk is the risk that movements in market factors, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices and commodity prices, will reduce our income or the value of our portfolios; 

&#8226; Resilience risk is the risk that we are unable to provide critical services to our customers, affiliates and counterparties as a result of sustained and significant operational disruption; 

&#8226; Regulatory compliance risk is the risk that we fail to observe the letter and spirit of relevant laws, codes, rules, regulations and standards of good market practice, which as a consequence incur fines and penalties and suffer damage to our business; 

&#8226; Financial crime risk is the risk that we knowingly or unknowingly help parties to commit or to further potentially illegal activity, including money laundering, fraud, bribery and corruption, tax evasion, sanctions breaches, and terrorist and proliferation financing; 

&#8226; Strategic risk is the risk that the business will fail to identify, execute and react appropriately to opportunities and/or threats arising from changes in the market, some of which may emerge over a number of years such as changing economic and political circumstances, customer requirements, demographic trends, regulatory developments or competitor action; and 

&#8226; Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from business decisions informed by models, which can be exacerbated by errors in methodology, design or the way they are used. 

In the course of our regular risk management activities, we use models to help quantify the risk we are taking. We believe that the assumptions used in these models are reasonable within the parameters for which the models have been built and calibrated to operate, but events may unfold differently than what is assumed in the models. Consequently, actual results may differ significantly from model projections. The severe projections of macroeconomic variables during the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent recovery represent events outside the parameters for which the models have been built. As a result, adjustments to model outputs to reflect consideration of management judgment are used with stringent governance in place to ensure appropriate results. Where models do not require adjustments, enhanced model monitoring confirms models are performing as intended. 

See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2021 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of the objectives of our risk management system as well as our risk management policies and practices. There have been no material changes to our approach to risk management since December 31, 2021. 

Credit Risk Management Credit risk is managed through a robust risk identification and control framework which outlines clear and consistent policies, principles and guidance for risk managers. Credit risk is monitored using various internal risk management measures and within limits approved by individuals within a framework of delegated authorities. Our credit risk management procedures are designed for all stages of economic and financial cycles, including challenging periods of market volatility and economic uncertainty. During the first half of 2022, the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine war and the COVID-19 pandemic continued to create significant uncertainty about the future economic environment. While our credit risk exposure to Russia was immaterial at June 30, 2022, the impact of the war on general economic conditions, especially inflation, will continue to evolve and, therefore, the impact on our customers remains uncertain. We continue to monitor the performance of 

HSBC USA Inc. 

our material commercial loans as conditions evolve and take necessary credit actions where warranted. See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2021 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our approach to credit risk. 

Treasury Risk Management We continuously monitor our capital ratios and the impact of market events on our liquidity positions and will continue to adapt our frameworks as necessary to reflect market events and the evolving regulatory landscape and view as to best practices. See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2021 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our approach to treasury risk. 

Capital risk See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in this MD&#38;A for a discussion of our approach to capital risk management, including our capital ratios and regulatory capital requirements. 

Liquidity and funding risk As part of our approach towards liquidity and funding risk management, we employ the measures discussed below to define, monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk in accordance with HSBC policy. 

As of January 1, 2022, HSBC North America met the criteria to be re-classified as a Category IV firm and, as a result of this classification change, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA are subject to a further reduced U.S. liquidity coverage ratio ("LCR") and net stable funding ratio ("NSFR") requirement of 70 percent so long as HSBC North America's weighted short-term wholesale funding equals or exceeds $50 billion. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA elected to report subject to the reduced U.S. LCR and NSFR requirement of 70 percent beginning April 1, 2022, whereas they were previously subject to the requirement of 85 percent applicable under Category III standards. 

The United Kingdom ("U.K.") Prudential Regulatory Authority ("PRA") based LCR is designed to be a short-term liquidity measure to ensure banks have sufficient High Quality Liquid Assets ("HQLA") to cover net stressed cash outflows over the next 30 days. At both June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, HSBC USA's LCR exceeded 100 percent. A LCR of 100 percent or higher reflects an unencumbered HQLA balance that is equal to or exceeds liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario. HQLA consists of cash or assets that can be converted into cash at little or no loss of value in private markets. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA are also subject to the U.S. LCR rule and are required to report their LCR to U.S. regulators on a daily basis. Under the Tailoring Rules, a 70 percent LCR requirement applies to Category IV firms with weighted short-term wholesale funding that equals or exceeds $50 billion and their depository institution subsidiaries. As a result, under the U.S. LCR rule, a LCR of 100 percent or higher reflects an unencumbered HQLA balance that is equal to or exceeds 70 percent of a Category IV firm's liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, HSBC Bank USA's LCR under the U.S. LCR rule remained above the 100 percent minimum requirement. 

The U.K. PRA based NSFR, which is a longer term liquidity measure with a 12-month time horizon to ensure a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities, took effect on January 1, 2022. At both June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, HSBC USA's NSFR exceeded 100 percent. The ratio at December 31, 2021 was estimated based on our interpretation and understanding of the Basel Committee NSFR guidance at that time. A NSFR of 100 percent or more reflects an available stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next 12 months that is equal to or exceeds the required amount of funding for assets and off-balance sheet exposures. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA are also subject to the U.S. NSFR rule. Under the Tailoring Rules, a 70 percent NSFR requirement applies to Category IV firms with weighted short-term wholesale funding that equals or exceeds $50 billion and their depository institution subsidiaries. As a result, under the U.S. NSFR rule, a NSFR of 100 percent or more reflects an available stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next 12 months that is equal to or exceeds 70 percent of a Category IV firm's required amount of funding for assets and off-balance sheet exposures. At both June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, HSBC Bank USA's NSFR under the U.S. NSFR rule exceeded 100 percent. 

As a Category IV firm, HSBC North America remains subject to liquidity stress testing and related liquidity buffer and liquidity risk management requirements. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA have liquidity profiles to support compliance with these rules and may need to make changes to their liquidity profiles to support compliance with any future rules. 

Our liquidity and funding risk management approach includes deposits, supplemented by wholesale borrowing to fund our balance sheet, and using security sales or secured borrowings for liquidity stress situations in our liquidity contingency plans. In addition, regulations require banks to retain a portfolio of HQLA. As such, we are maintaining a large portfolio of high quality sovereign and sovereign guaranteed securities. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Our ability to regularly attract wholesale funds at a competitive cost is enhanced by strong ratings from the major credit ratings agencies. The following table reflects the short and long-term credit ratings of HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA at June 30, 2022: 

&#160; &#160; 

Moody's S&#38;P Fitch HSBC USA: Short-term borrowings P-1 A-2 F1+ Long-term/senior debt A1 A- A+ HSBC Bank USA: Short-term borrowings P-1 A-1 F1+ Long-term/senior debt Aa3 A+ AA- 

Rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk management practices and legal matters, all of which could lead to adverse ratings actions. 

Although we closely monitor and strive to manage factors influencing our credit ratings, there is no assurance that our credit ratings will not change in the future. At June 30, 2022, none of the ratings on the debt of HSBC USA or HSBC Bank USA from any of the rating agencies were under review for potential downgrade. 

See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in this MD&#38;A for further discussion of our liquidity position, including additional information regarding our outstanding borrowings, the remaining availability of our debt issuance programs and our funding strategy. 

Interest rate risk Various techniques are utilized to quantify and monitor risks associated with the repricing characteristics of our assets, liabilities and derivative contracts. See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2021 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our approach to interest rate risk. 

Economic value of equity ("EVE") EVE represents the present value of the banking book cash flows that could be provided to our equity holder under a managed run-off scenario. An EVE sensitivity represents the change in EVE due to a defined movement in interest rates. We manage to an immediate parallel upward shock of 200 basis points and an immediate parallel downward shock of 200 basis points to the market implied interest rates. At both June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our EVE remained within risk limits for the up 200 and down 200 basis point interest rate shock scenarios. 

Net interest income simulation modeling techniques We utilize simulation modeling to monitor a number of interest rate scenarios for their impact on projected net interest income. These techniques simulate the impact on projected net interest income under various scenarios, such as rate shock scenarios which assume immediate market rate movements by 100 basis points, as well as scenarios in which rates gradually rise or fall by 100 basis points over a twelve month period. In the gradual scenarios, 25 percent of the interest rate movement occurs at the beginning of each quarter. The following table reflects the impact on our projected net interest income of the scenarios utilized by these modeling techniques: 

June 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Amount % Amount % &#160; (dollars are in millions) Estimated increase (decrease) in projected net interest income (reflects projected rate movements on July 1, 2022 and January 1, 2022, respectively): 

Resulting from a gradual 100 basis point increase in the yield curve $ 198 &#160; 6 &#160; % $ 225 9 % Resulting from a gradual 100 basis point decrease in the yield curve (203) (6) (130) (5) Other significant scenarios monitored (reflects projected rate movements on July 1, 2022 and January 1, 2022, respectively): 

Resulting from an immediate 100 basis point increase in the yield curve 339 &#160; 11 &#160; 308 13 Resulting from an immediate 100 basis point decrease in the yield curve (337) (11) (334) (14) 

The projections do not take into consideration possible complicating factors such as the effect of changes in interest rates on the credit quality, size and composition of the balance sheet. Therefore, although this provides a reasonable estimate of interest rate sensitivity, actual results will differ from these estimates, possibly by significant amounts. 

Market Risk Management Exposure to market risk is separated into two portfolios: 

&#8226; Trading portfolios comprise positions arising from market-making and warehousing of client-derived positions. 

&#8226; Non-trading portfolios comprise positions that primarily arise from the interest rate management of our retail and commercial banking assets and liabilities and financial investments classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

We apply similar risk management policies and measurement techniques to both trading and non-trading portfolios. Our objective is to manage and control market risk exposures to optimize return on risk while maintaining a market profile consistent with our established risk appetite. See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2021 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our approach to market risk. 

Value at risk ("VaR") VaR is a technique for estimating potential losses on risk positions as a result of movements in market rates and prices over a specified time horizon and to a given level of confidence. The use of VaR is integrated into market risk management and calculated for all trading positions regardless of how we capitalize them. In addition, we calculate VaR for non-trading portfolios to have a complete picture of risk. VaR measures are calculated to a 99 percent confidence level and use a one-day holding period. 

Trading portfolios Trading VaR generates primarily from the MSS segment of GBM. Portfolios comprise mainly foreign exchange products, precious metals (i.e., gold, silver, platinum) and credit default swaps. 

The following graph summarizes daily VaR for our trading portfolios at a 99 percent confidence level (in millions): 

The following table summarizes our trading VaR for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and at December 31, 2021: 

Credit Spread Foreign Exchange and Commodity Interest Rate Portfolio Diversification (1)

(1) Portfolio diversification is the market risk dispersion effect of holding a portfolio containing different risk types. It represents the reduction in unsystematic market risk that occurs when combining a number of different risk types, for example, foreign exchange, interest rate and credit spread, together in one portfolio. It is measured as the difference between the sum of the VaR by individual risk type and the combined total VaR. A negative number represents the benefit of portfolio diversification. As the maximum and minimum occur on different days for different risk types, it is not meaningful to calculate a portfolio diversification benefit for these measures. 

(2) The total VaR is non-additive across risk types due to diversification effects. For presentation purposes, portfolio diversification of the VaR for trading portfolios includes VaR-based risk-not-in-VaR. 

Back-testing We routinely validate the accuracy of our VaR models by back-testing them against hypothetical profit and loss that excludes non-modeled items such as fees, commissions and revenues of intra-day transactions from the actual reported profit and loss. We would expect, under stable market conditions, to see two or three losses in excess of VaR at the 99 percent confidence level over a one-year period. However, in periods of unstable market conditions, we could see an increase in the number of back-testing exceptions. 

During the three months ended June 30, 2022, we experienced six loss back-testing exceptions due primarily to significant increases in market volatility in the second quarter of 2022. These loss exceptions were driven by substantial market volatility in interest rates and metals arising from inflationary pressures, changes in the FRB's stance on interest rate hikes and geopolitical conditions. 

Performance of the VaR model was in line with expectations given observed market movements. During the period, market risk exposures and actual reported losses remained within the entity's risk limits. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Non-trading portfolios Non-trading VaR predominantly relates to Markets Treasury and represents the potential negative changes in the investment portfolio market value (which includes available-for-sale and held-to-maturity assets) and associated hedges. Our investment portfolio holdings comprise mainly U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed and U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities. Our non-trading VaR exposure is driven by interest rates and agency spread volatility. 

The following table summarizes our non-trading VaR for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and at December 31, 2021:

Non-trading VaR also includes the interest rate risk of non-trading financial assets and liabilities held by the global businesses and transfer priced into Markets Treasury which has the mandate to centrally manage and hedge it. See "Treasury Risk Management" above for a broader discussion on how interest rate risk is managed.
