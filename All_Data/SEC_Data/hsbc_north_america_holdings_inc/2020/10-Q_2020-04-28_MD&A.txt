HSBC USA Inc. 

Executive Overview &#160; 

HSBC USA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC North America, which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC. HUSI may also be referred to in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&#38;A") as "we," "us" or "our." 

Economic Environment The U.S. economy began to deteriorate rapidly in March as the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the globe, including into the United States, causing severe disruption to the capital markets as well as business and economic activity. Over the course of the month of March, individual municipalities and entire states adopted travel and work location restrictions, social distancing requirements, and in some cases shelter in place protocols in order to slow the spread of the virus. These measures have shut down normal life in much of the United States resulting in a collapse of spending as well as shutdowns of many schools, stores, offices, restaurants and manufacturing plants creating a surge in layoffs. U.S. Gross Domestic Product ("GDP") is now expected to contract for at least the first two quarters of 2020 and in total for the year, while the total unemployment rate increased to 4.4 percent at March 2020 and is expected to significantly increase in future months. In March 2020, with the U.S. economy in decline as a result of increased economic uncertainty driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, the FRB decided to cut short-term interest rates by 150 basis points (to near zero) and also announced various other initiatives to enhance liquidity and support the flow of credit to households and businesses. 

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic conditions both in the United States and abroad during the first quarter of 2020 has created global uncertainty about the future economic environment including the length and depth of any global recession which most believe will occur. Concerns over interest rate levels, domestic and global policy issues, U.S. trade policy and geopolitical events as well as the implications of those events on the markets in general further add to this global uncertainty. Interest rate levels, in combination with global economic conditions, fiscal and monetary policy and the level of regulatory and government scrutiny of financial institutions will continue to impact our results in 2020 and beyond. 

Performance, Developments and Trends &#32;&#32;As mentioned above, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread throughout the United States and has caused disruption to our customers, vendors and employees. The outbreak of this virus has disrupted global financial markets and negatively affected supply and demand across a broad range of industries. This pandemic has had a significant impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations during the first quarter, including the impairment of goodwill associated with our Retail Banking and Wealth Management and Private Banking reporting units, an increase to the provision for credit losses on our loan portfolio and valuation losses associated with certain financial instruments due to market volatility. Additionally, in April 2020, Fitch changed the rating outlook for both HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA to negative from stable following a similar change in outlook to negative from stable for HSBC. The circumstances around this pandemic are evolving rapidly and will continue to impact our business in future periods. Should the COVID-19 pandemic continue to cause disruption to economic activity through 2020, there could be further impacts on our income due to lower interest rates, lower lending and transaction volumes and lower wealth management revenue due to equity markets volatility and weakness. Other potential risks include credit rating migration which could negatively impact our risk-weighted assets and capital position, and potential liquidity stress due, among other factors, to increased customer drawdowns, notwithstanding the significant initiatives that the U.S. Government and the FRB have put in place to support funding and liquidity. This matter could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and credit ratings in future periods. The extent of such impact will depend on the outcome of certain developments, including but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak as well as its continuing impact on our customers, vendors and employees, all of which are uncertain. See Part II, Item 1A, "Risk Factors - Risks related to the impact of COVID-19" for further discussion. 

During the first quarter of 2020, we decided to pause the vast majority of head count reductions relating to our restructuring plan due to the extraordinary impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, many elements of our restructuring plan are moving forward as planned, including consolidation of our retail branch network and wholesale back office functions, and the creation of our Wealth and Personal Banking business. While we remain committed to our multi-year strategic plan to re-profile our business, the timing of the strategic actions as outlined in our 2019 Form 10-K may be re-sequenced or delayed beyond 24 months as the situation continues to develop. In light of COVID-19, we continue to re-assess our strategic plan and may take additional actions in future periods. See Note 2, "Strategic Initiatives," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

HSBC USA Inc. 

Net income (loss) was a loss of $1,283 million &#32;during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;compared with income of $109 million &#32;during the three months ended March 31, 2019 . Income (loss) before income tax was a loss of $1,440 million &#32;during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;compared with income of $144 million &#32;during the three months ended March 31, 2019 . The decrease in income (loss) before income tax during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;was due primarily to higher operating expenses driven by a goodwill impairment charge recorded during the first quarter of 2020 as discussed below and a higher provision for credit losses driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Also contributing to the decrease was lower net interest income. 

During the first quarter of 2020, as a result of the deterioration in economic conditions caused by the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic across the globe, including into the United States, and its impact on our businesses including changes to the interest rate environment as a result of recent FRB actions to combat the economic effects of the virus and the amount of headroom calculated in our previous annual impairment test for certain reporting units, we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of one or more of our reporting units was lower than their carrying amounts, including goodwill. Based on this analysis, we determined that an interim goodwill impairment test should be performed for all of our reporting units as of March 31, 2020 and prepared updated cash flow projections for each reporting unit, resulting in a reduction in the long-term forecasts of profitability for both our Retail Banking and Wealth Management and our Private Banking reporting units as compared to the prior year forecasts. These projections were reviewed by senior management in early April in connection with the preparation of our first quarter financial statements and it was determined that these forecasts represent our current best estimate of future profitability and would be used to conduct our interim impairment test. We completed our interim impairment test of goodwill utilizing cash flow projections based on these forecasts under a present value approach and, in conjunction with valuation estimates determined under a market approach, concluded that the fair value of our Commercial Banking reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, including goodwill. However, the cash flow projections for our Retail Banking and Wealth Management and our Private Banking reporting units were significantly lower which, in conjunction with valuation estimates under a market approach and in consideration of a challenging macroeconomic outlook, resulted in a fair value that was significantly lower than their book values, including goodwill. As a result, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $784 million &#32;in the first quarter of 2020, representing the entire amount of goodwill previously allocated to these reporting units. As discussed in our 2019 Form 10-K, our goodwill impairment testing is highly sensitive to certain assumptions and estimates used. We will continue to monitor changes to our business forecasts as we continue to perform periodic analyses of the risks and strategies of our business and product offerings. If further deterioration in economic and credit conditions, a change in the strategy or performance of our business or product offerings, or an increase in the capital requirements of our business occurs, interim goodwill impairment tests could again be required, which may result in an impairment charge. 

Our reported results in certain periods were impacted by certain items management believes to be significant, which affect comparability between periods. Significant items are excluded to arrive at adjusted performance because management would ordinarily identify and consider them separately to better understand underlying business trends. The following table summarizes the impact of these significant items for all periods presented:

Costs to achieve during the three months ended March 31, 2020 primarily related to the consolidation of our retail branch network and included lease impairment and other related costs of $92 million , severance costs of $9 million &#32;and allocated costs from HSBC Technology &#38; Services ("HTSU") of $8 million . See Note 2, "Strategic Initiatives," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. The expense during the three months ended March 31, 2020 also includes a $9 million &#32;gain on the sale of one of our owned retail branch properties. 

(2) &#160; 

Represents a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure. 

Excluding the impact of the items in the table above, our adjusted performance during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;decreased $700 million &#32;compared with prior year period due primarily to a higher provision for credit losses driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and, to a lesser extent, lower net interest income. These increases were partially offset by lower operating expenses. 

See "Results of Operations" for a more detailed discussion of our operating trends. In addition, see "Balance Sheet Review" for further discussion on our asset and liability trends, "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for further discussion on funding and capital and "Credit Quality" for additional discussion on our credit trends. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") Transition &#32;&#32;Regulators and central banks in various national jurisdictions continue to actively work to help transition from interbank offered rates ("IBORs") to acceptable alternative rates, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") recommended by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee ("ARRC") convened by the FRB. In March 2020, the FASB issued changes to the U.S. GAAP guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens associated with this transition. Under the new guidance, an entity can elect by accounting topic or industry subtopic to account for the modification of a contract affected by reference rate reform as a continuation of the existing contract, if certain conditions are met. In addition, the new guidance allows an entity to elect on a hedge-by-hedge basis to continue to apply hedge accounting for hedging relationships in which the critical terms change due to reference rate reform, if certain conditions are met. 

We have a considerable number of contracts referencing IBORs, primarily LIBOR, such as loans, derivatives and long-term debt, extending past 2021 when the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority has announced it will no longer require banks to submit rates for LIBOR. We continue to actively participate in HSBC's global transition program with the objective of facilitating an orderly transition of all products, processes, models and curves, as well as all legacy LIBOR contracts, onto replacement rates. In particular, during the first quarter of 2020, we implemented risk disclosures for new sales of LIBOR-based products across all of our business lines and incorporated the new fallback language recommended by the ARRC into new LIBOR-based contracts for adjustable rate mortgage loans. 

While we continued to progress in developing plans for transitioning legacy contracts onto replacement rates, given the focus on the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting market volatility that began in March, we are currently targeting to have pricing and data/workflow requirements finalized in the second quarter of 2020. For further discussion of our LIBOR transition program and the associated risks, see "Executive Overview" in MD&#38;A in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Other Developments 

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted economic activity in many countries, including the United States, and the U.S. Government has taken multiple actions to mitigate the magnitude and persistence of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The United States has been operating under a presidentially declared national emergency since March 13, 2020. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act"), which provides financial assistance for businesses and individuals and targeted regulatory relief for financial institutions, was signed into law. 

Paycheck Protection Program The CARES Act creates a new loan guarantee program called the Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP") targeted to provide small businesses with support to cover payroll and certain other expenses. Loans made under the PPP are fully guaranteed by the Small Business Administration ("SBA"), whose guarantee is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. PPP covered loans also afford borrowers forgiveness up to the principal amount of the PPP covered loan, plus accrued interest, if the loan proceeds are used to retain workers and maintain payroll or to make certain mortgage interest, lease and utility payments, and certain other criteria are satisfied. The SBA will reimburse PPP lenders for any amount of a PPP covered loan that is forgiven, and PPP lenders will not be held liable for any representations made by PPP borrowers in connection with their requests for loan forgiveness. HSBC Bank USA is a PPP participating lender. 

Loan Forbearance Initiatives The CARES Act also creates a forbearance program for federally-backed mortgage loans and provides financial institutions with the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under U.S. GAAP related to troubled debt restructurings. We are currently evaluating whether to elect this option. The CARES Act also prohibits servicers of federally-backed mortgage loans from initiating any foreclosure action on any residential property that is not vacant or abandoned for a period of 60 days, beginning on March 18, 2020. In addition to these federal measures, some state governments have taken action to require forbearance with respect to certain loans and fees. For example, New York&#8217;s Governor issued an executive order on March 21, 2020 that requires the Superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services ("NYDFS") to ensure that regulated entities provide forbearance of mortgage payments for New York State persons or entities facing financial hardship due to COVID-19, and empowers the NYDFS to restrict or modify fees for ATM use, overdraft fees and credit card late fees. The NYDFS issued emergency regulations on March 24, 2020 clarifying that the executive order, as implemented through the emergency regulations, applies only to banking organizations regulated by the NYDFS and therefore does not apply to us. However, we are continuing to monitor federal, state and international regulatory developments in relation to COVID-19 and their potential impact on our operations. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Basis of Reporting 

&#160; 

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"). 

Group Reporting Basis &#32;We report financial information to HSBC in accordance with HSBC Group accounting and reporting policies, which apply International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRSs") as issued by the IASB and endorsed by the EU and, as a result, our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the basis of HSBC Group's accounting and reporting policies ("Group Reporting Basis"). Because operating results on the Group Reporting Basis are used in managing our businesses and rewarding performance of employees, our management also separately monitors profit before tax under this basis of reporting. The following table reconciles our U.S. GAAP versus Group Reporting Basis profit before tax:

The significant differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis as they impact our results are summarized in Note 24, "Business Segments," in our 2019 Form 10-K. In addition, see Note 15, "Business Segments," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of significant changes since December 31, 2019 in the differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis impacting our results. Differences in reported profit before tax in the table above that were individually significant for the periods presented are explained below. 

During the first quarter of 2020, expected credit losses were higher under U.S. GAAP than under the Group Reporting Basis. Under the Group Reporting Basis, a majority of our commercial loans are considered to be in 'stage 1' (which requires a 12-month expected credit losses estimate), while under U.S. GAAP such loans require a lifetime expected credit losses estimate. As a result of the different approaches, the impact of the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a worsening of economic forecasts used to calculate ECL and provisions for downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and loan growth as clients drew on their available lines of credit, was more pronounced under U.S. GAAP. 

During the first quarter of 2020, goodwill impairment charges were lower under the Group Reporting Basis than under U.S. GAAP. Under the Group Reporting Basis, goodwill was amortized until 2005, however goodwill was amortized under U.S. GAAP until 2002, which resulted in a lower carrying amount of goodwill and, therefore, a lower impairment charge under the Group Reporting Basis. 

During the first quarter of 2019, credit loss estimates were higher under U.S. GAAP than under the Group Reporting Basis due primarily to the impact of downgrades in the commercial loan portfolio, which was more pronounced under U.S. GAAP. In addition, expected credit losses under the Group Reporting Basis reflect a release in credit loss reserves due to the upgrade of a single oil and gas industry client which resulted in reclassification from 'stage 2' (which requires a lifetime expected credit losses estimate) to 'stage 1' (which requires a 12-month expected credit losses estimate).

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates &#160; 

Of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we have identified certain items as critical accounting estimates based on the associated degree of judgment and complexity. See "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" in MD&#38;A in our 2019 Form 10-K for further discussion. 

Determining the allowance for credit losses on loans has historically been identified as a critical accounting estimate. On January 1, 2020, we adopted new accounting guidance which requires entities to estimate and recognize an allowance for lifetime expected credit losses ("lifetime ECL") for loans and other financial assets measured at amortized cost. Previously, an allowance for credit losses on loans was recognized based on probable incurred losses. See Note 6, "Allowance for Credit Losses" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our accounting policies and methodologies for establishing the allowance for credit losses and liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures beginning in 2020. 

The accounting estimates relating to the allowance for credit losses remains a "critical accounting estimate" for the following reasons: 

&#8226; 

Changes in the provision for credit losses can materially affect our financial results; 

&#8226; 

Estimates relating to the allowance for credit losses require us to project future borrower performance, including cash flows, delinquencies and charge-offs, along with, when applicable, collateral values, based on a reasonable and supportable forecast period utilizing forward-looking economic scenarios in order to estimate probability of default and loss given default; and 

&#8226; 

The allowance for credit losses is influenced by factors outside of our control such as industry and business trends, geopolitical events and the effects of laws and regulations as well as economic conditions such as trends in housing prices, interest rates, GDP, inflation, energy prices and unemployment; and 

&#8226; 

Judgment is required to determine whether the models used to generate the allowance for credit losses produce an estimate that is sufficient to encompass the current view of lifetime ECL. 

Because our estimates of the allowance for credit losses involve judgment and are influenced by factors outside our control, there is uncertainty inherent in these estimates. Our estimate of lifetime ECL is inherently uncertain because it is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors outside of our control. Changes in such estimates could significantly impact our allowance and provision for credit losses. 

As discussed further in Note 6, "Allowance for Credit Losses," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, as a result of the deterioration in economic conditions caused by the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic during the first quarter of 2020 and the related increase in economic uncertainty, three new COVID-19 forward-looking economic scenarios were developed and utilized for estimating lifetime ECL at March 31, 2020. The three new COVID-19 scenarios, referred to as mild, moderate and severe, were assigned weightings with the majority of the weighting placed on the mild scenario and progressively lower weights placed on the moderate and severe scenarios. This weighting was deemed appropriate for the estimation of lifetime ECL under current conditions. 

As an illustration of the effect of changes in estimates relating to the allowance for credit losses, using a 100 percent weighting for the severe COVID-19 scenario instead of using the three weighted COVID-19 scenarios as described above at March 31, 2020 would have resulted in a combined increase to our allowance for credit losses and liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures of approximately $420 million. This illustration only represents the effect of changes in the weighting of these scenarios on our existing portfolios and does not consider changes in the allowance related to management judgment that might occur.

Short-Term Investments Short-term investments include cash and due from banks, interest bearing deposits with banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell. Balances may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our liquidity position at the time and our strategy for deploying liquidity. Short-term investments increased compared with December 31, 2019 &#32;due to an increase in overall liquidity as we actively raised funds in advance of their usage to support anticipated elevated client demand. The increase in funds was driven by higher deposits and short-term borrowings.

See "Credit Quality" in this MD&#38;A for a discussion of trends in our allowance for credit losses on loans. 

Commercial loans increased compared with December 31, 2019 &#32;due primarily to elevated demand as clients drew on their available lines of credit during the current deterioration in economic conditions and, to a lesser extent, higher loans to affiliates. The increase in commercial non-affiliate loans was primarily in the consumer services, consumer durables and apparel, commercial and professional services, retailing, and capital goods industries. 

Consumer loans increased modestly compared with December 31, 2019 &#32;as higher residential mortgage loans were largely offset by seasonal paydowns in credit card receivables and a continued decline in home equity mortgages. The increase in other consumer loans reflects higher personal loans driven by new product promotions.

LTVs for first liens are calculated using the loan balance as of the reporting date. LTVs for second liens are calculated using the loan balance as of the reporting date plus the senior lien amount at origination. Current estimated property values are derived from the property's appraised value at the time of loan origination updated by the change in the Federal Housing Finance Agency's house pricing index ("HPI") at either a Core Based Statistical Area or state level. The estimated value of the homes could differ from actual fair values due to changes in condition of the underlying property, variations in housing price changes within metropolitan statistical areas and other factors. As a result, actual property values associated with loans that end in foreclosure may be significantly lower than the estimates used for purposes of this disclosure. 

HSBC USA Inc.

Current estimated property values are calculated using the most current HPIs available and applied on an individual loan basis, which results in an approximate three month delay in the production of reportable statistics. Therefore, the information in the table above reflects current estimated property values using HPIs at December 31, 2020 &#32;and September 30, 2019, respectively.

Commercial loans held for sale increased compared with December 31, 2019 . Included in commercial loans held for sale are certain loans that we have elected to designate under the fair value option which consists of loans that we originate in connection with our participation in a number of syndicated credit facilities with the intent of selling them to unaffiliated third parties as well as loans that we purchase from the secondary market and hold as hedges against our exposure to certain total return swaps. The fair value of these loans totaled $206 million &#32;and $178 million &#32;at March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , respectively. Balances will fluctuate from period to period depending on the volume and level of activity. 

Commercial loans held for sale also includes certain loans that we no longer intend to hold for investment and were transferred to held for sale which totaled $28 million &#32;and $34 million &#32;at March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , respectively. 

Consumer loans held for sale decreased compared with December 31, 2019 . Included in residential mortgage loans held for sale are agency-eligible residential mortgage loans which are originated and held for sale to third parties, currently on a servicing retained basis. Balances will fluctuate from period to period depending on the volume and level of activity. Gains and losses from the sale of these residential mortgage loans are reflected as a component of other income (loss) in the accompanying consolidated statement of income (loss). 

Excluding the commercial loans designated under fair value option discussed above, loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value, with adjustments to fair value being recorded as a valuation allowance through other revenues. The valuation allowance on consumer loans held for sale was $1 million &#32;and $2 million &#32;at March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , respectively. The valuation allowance on commercial loans held for sale was nil &#32;at both March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 .

See Note 3, "Trading Assets and Liabilities," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a breakout of trading securities by category. 

Trading securities balances decreased compared with December 31, 2019 &#32;due to decreases in equity and foreign sovereign positions, partially offset by an increase in U.S. Treasury positions. Trading security positions are held as economic hedges of interest rate, credit and equity derivative products issued to clients of domestic and emerging markets. Balances of securities sold, not yet purchased were lower compared with December 31, 2019 &#32;driven by a decrease in short U.S. Treasury positions related to economic hedges of derivatives in the interest rate trading portfolio. 

Precious metals trading assets increased compared with December 31, 2019 &#32;due primarily to an increase in our own gold inventory position held as economic hedges for client derivative activity. Payables for precious metals were lower compared with December 31, 2019 &#32;reflecting a decline in borrowing of gold inventory to support client activity levels. Precious metal positions may not represent our net underlying exposure as we may use derivatives contracts to reduce our risk associated with these positions, the fair value of which would appear in derivatives in the table above. 

Derivative asset and liability balances both increased compared with December 31, 2019 &#32;mainly from market movements which resulted in higher valuations of foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and credit derivatives. Market movements on equity derivatives were mixed resulting in higher derivative asset valuations, but lower derivative liability valuations. 

Securities Securities include securities available-for-sale and securities held-to-maturity, net. Securities balances were higher compared with December 31, 2019 &#32;driven by net purchases of securities available-for-sale as part of our continuing strategy to maximize returns while balancing the securities portfolio for risk management purposes and, to a lesser extent, favorable market valuations due to decreasing yields. The increase in securities balances was primarily in U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed, U.S. Treasury and U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed securities. 

All Other Assets All other assets includes, among other items, properties and equipment, net and goodwill. All other assets increased compared with December 31, 2019 &#32;due primarily to higher outstanding settlement balances related to security sales, higher cash collateral posted and increased investments in Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") stock. These increases were partially offset by a goodwill impairment charge of $784 million &#32;recorded during the first quarter of 2020, representing the entire amount of goodwill previously allocated to our Retail Banking and Wealth Management and our Private Banking reporting units, and lower deferred tax assets. For additional discussion of the results of our interim goodwill impairment testing, see Note 8, "Goodwill," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Core deposits, as calculated in accordance with Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council ("FFIEC") guidelines, generally include all domestic demand, money market and other savings accounts, as well as time deposits with balances not exceeding $250,000. 

Total deposits increased compared with December 31, 2019 &#32;as we actively raised funds to support elevated client demand for loans driven by deteriorating economic conditions in March while maintaining adequate liquidity, which resulted in higher deposits from affiliates and increased commercial demand deposits with a continued focus on high quality balances. The higher deposits from affiliates also reflects $3.0 billion &#32;of long-term debt obligations issued to HSBC North America that were recharacterized as time deposits during the first quarter of 2020 as discussed below. Also contributing to the increase in deposits was higher retail deposits driven by promotional rates offered on savings accounts as well as higher deposits in Private Banking. These increases in deposits were partially offset by a decline in commercial time deposits reflecting early client withdrawals. 

Short-Term Borrowings Short-term borrowings increased compared with December 31, 2019 &#32;as we actively raised funds to support elevated client demand for loans driven by deteriorating economic conditions in March while maintaining adequate liquidity, which resulted in higher securities sold under repurchase agreements and, to a lesser extent, higher federal funds purchased. 

Long-Term Debt Long-term debt decreased compared with December 31, 2019 &#32;as the impact of debt issuances, including increased borrowings from the FHLB, was more than offset by debt retirements, fair value movements on fair value option debt and $3.0 billion &#32;of long-term debt obligations issued to HSBC North America that were recharacterized as time deposits during the first quarter of 2020. See Note 14, "Related Party Transactions," for additional information. Debt issuances during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;totaled $5,844 million , of which $4,885 million &#32;was issued by HSBC Bank USA. 

Incremental issuances from our shelf registration statement with the SEC totaled $959 million &#32;of senior structured notes during the three months ended March 31, 2020 . &#32; Total long-term debt outstanding under this shelf was $11,421 million &#32;and $13,295 million &#32;at March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , respectively. 

Incremental issuances from the HSBC Bank USA Global Bank Note Program totaled $135 million &#32;during the three months ended March 31, 2020 . Total debt outstanding under this program was $3,021 million &#32;and $2,908 million &#32;at March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , respectively. 

Borrowings from the FHLB totaled $5,750 million &#32;and $1,000 million &#32;at March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , respectively. 

Interest, Taxes and Other Liabilities Interest, taxes and other liabilities were lower compared with December 31, 2019 &#32;due primarily to lower margin requirements related to futures trading and a decline in accrued interest payable, partially offset by a higher liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures.

Net Interest Income Net interest income is the total interest income on earning assets less the total interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds. An analysis of consolidated average balances and interest rates is presented in this MD&#38;A under the caption "Consolidated Average Balances and Interest Rates." 

The significant components of net interest margin are summarized in the following table:

Represents the benefit associated with interest earning assets in excess of interest bearing liabilities. Increased percentages reflect growth in this excess or a higher cost of interest bearing liabilities, while decreased percentages reflect a reduction in this excess or a lower cost of interest bearing liabilities. 

Net interest income decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;due primarily to the unfavorable net impact of lower market rates, which resulted in lower interest income from short-term investments, loans and securities, partially offset by lower interest expense from long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits. The unfavorable net impact of lower market rates was partially offset by the favorable impact of higher average securities and trading securities balances. 

Short-term investments &#32;&#32;Interest income decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;due primarily to lower yields earned on these balances reflecting the impact of lower market rates. 

Trading securities &#32;&#32;Interest income increased during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;driven by higher average balances due primarily to increases in equity and U.S. Treasury positions, partially offset by a decrease in corporate bond positions. Interest income associated with trading securities was partially offset within trading revenue by the performance of the associated derivatives as discussed further below. 

Securities &#32;&#32;Interest income was lower during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;due to lower yields reflecting the impact of lower market rates, partially offset by higher average balances. Higher average balances were due primarily to increases in U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury securities, partially offset by a decline in U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Commercial loans Interest income was lower during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;driven by lower yields reflecting the impact of lower market rates on variable rate loans, partially offset by higher average balances. 

Consumer loans &#32;&#32;Interest income decreased slightly during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;as the impact of higher average balances due to growth in residential mortgage loans and credit card receivables was more than offset by lower yields reflecting the impact of lower market rates. 

Other Interest income was relatively flat during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;as the impact of higher average cash collateral balances was largely offset by lower yields reflecting the impact of lower market rates on these balances. 

Deposits &#32;&#32;Interest expense decreased slightly during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;as the impact of higher average balances was more than offset by lower rates paid reflecting the impact of lower market rates. Higher average balances were due to growth in commercial time deposits and demand deposits as well as higher retail deposits driven by promotional rates offered on savings accounts. 

Short-term borrowings &#32;&#32;Lower interest expense during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;was due to lower rates paid reflecting the impact of lower market rates, partially offset by higher average borrowings in securities sold under repurchase agreements. 

Long-term debt &#32;&#32;Interest expense decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;due to lower rates paid reflecting the impact of lower market rates on variable rate borrowings and lower average borrowings. 

Tax liabilities and other &#32;&#32;Interest expense was lower during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;due to lower average borrowings in securities sold, not yet repurchased and lower rates paid on these borrowings. 

Provision for Credit Losses As discussed further in Note 21, "New Accounting Pronouncements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, beginning January 1, 2020, the provision for credit losses is recognized based on lifetime ECL for loans, off-balance sheet credit exposures, securities held-to-maturity and certain other financial assets measured at amortized cost, as well as credit losses on securities available-for-sale. Prior to January 1, 2020, the provision for credit losses was recognized based on probable incurred losses for loans only while debt securities were assessed for other-than-temporary impairment and credit loss expense for probable incurred losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures was separately recorded as a component of other expense within operating expenses as discussed below. As a result, current period amounts in the table below are not directly comparable to the prior year period. The following table summarizes the components of the provision for credit losses:

As discussed below, prior to January 1, 2020, credit loss expense for off-balance sheet credit exposures was recorded in other expense. &#32; 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Our provision for credit losses increased $668 million &#32;during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;due primarily to a higher provision for credit losses on both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios as well as the provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures recorded in the first quarter of 2020. 

The provision for credit losses on our commercial loan portfolio increased $336 million &#32;during the three months ended March 31, 2020 . The loss provision in the current year period was driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts we use for calculating lifetime ECL in 2020 and provisions for risk factors associated with large loan exposures, downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and loan growth as clients drew on their available lines of credit. In the prior year period, the loss provision was driven by downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain client relationships and loan growth, partially offset by releases in credit loss reserves due to paydowns. 

The provision for credit losses on our consumer loan portfolio was higher by $118 million &#32;during the three months ended March 31, 2020 . The loss provision in the current year period was driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts we use for calculating lifetime ECL in 2020. Also contributing to the loss provision in the current year period was higher dollars of delinquency in credit cards and, to a lesser extent, growth in personal loan balances due to new product promotions. In the prior year period, the loss provision was due primarily to a provision for credit losses on credit cards reflecting growth in balances due to increased customer activity and new product promotions, including higher dollars of delinquency. 

The provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures reflects a loss provision during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;resulting from the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic consistent with commercial loans as discussed above. 

See "Credit Quality" in this MD&#38;A for additional discussion on the allowance for credit losses and the liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures.

(2) &#160; 

Derivatives trading revenue in all periods does not reflect associated net interest income as certain derivatives, such as total return swaps, were economically hedged by holding the underlying interest bearing referenced assets. 

Trading revenue decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;due primarily to the deterioration of economic conditions and market volatility caused by the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in valuation losses, primarily in the form of bid-offer and funding spread adjustments, of approximately $70 million in March 2020. These valuation losses drove trading revenue lower in Derivatives, Other trading, Metals, Balance Sheet Management and Global Banking, which was partially offset by higher revenue in Foreign Exchange. 

Derivatives revenue decreased due to unfavorable valuation adjustments, primarily related to funding spread adjustments, on legacy structured credit products as well as lower revenue from emerging markets rate products and interest rate swaps. These decreases were partially offset by the non-recurrence of a loss of approximately $39 million &#32;recorded during the first quarter of 2019 related to the unwind of one of our unconsolidated variable interest entities ("VIEs"). 

Foreign Exchange revenue was higher as market volatility driven by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in increased trading activity in both emerging market and G10 currencies. 

Metals revenue decreased from market volatility and unfavorable valuation adjustments on exchange for physical transactions. 

Balance Sheet Management revenue was lower due to unfavorable valuation adjustments related to economic hedge positions used to manage interest rate risk. 

Global Banking revenue was lower due to unfavorable valuation adjustments on credit default swap economic hedge positions. 

The decrease in other trading revenue reflects the impact of unfavorable funding spread adjustments and a loss of $7 million recorded during the first quarter of 2020 related to extending the maturity of the total return swap position used to economically hedge the periodic payments made under the swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of Visa Inc. Class B common shares. 

Other securities gains, net We maintain securities portfolios as part of our balance sheet diversification and risk management strategies. During the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;and 2019 , we sold $4,630 million &#32;and $2,145 million , respectively, of primarily U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed and U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities as part of a continuing strategy to maximize returns while balancing the securities portfolio for risk management purposes. Other securities gains, net increased during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;reflecting the impact of higher sales activity compared with 2019. The gross realized gains and losses from sales of securities, which are included as a component of other securities gains, net above, are summarized in Note 4, "Securities," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates &#32;&#32;Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates were higher during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;due primarily to higher cost reimbursements associated with trading activities performed on behalf of HSBC Bank plc and higher sales commissions paid by HSBC Bank plc. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Loss on instruments designated at fair value and related derivatives We have elected to apply fair value option accounting to certain commercial loans held for sale, certain securities purchased and sold under resale and repurchase agreements, certain of our own fixed-rate debt issuances, all of our hybrid instruments issued, including structured notes and deposits, and, beginning January 1, 2020, certain student loans held for investment. We also use derivatives to economically hedge the interest rate and other risks associated with certain financial assets and liabilities for which fair value option accounting has been elected. Loss on instruments designated at fair value and related derivatives reflected higher losses during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;attributable to unfavorable movements related to the economic hedging of interest rate and other risks within our structured notes and unfavorable fair value adjustments on certain commercial loans held for sale which were impacted by the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. These losses were partially offset by favorable movements related to the economic hedging of interest rate risk within our own debt. See Note 10, "Fair Value Option," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information including a breakout of these amounts by individual component. 

Other income (loss) &#160; Other income (loss) was higher in the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;due primarily to a gain of $51 million in the current year period associated with credit default swap protection which largely reflects the hedging of a few client relationships compared with a loss of $10 million in the prior year period. Also contributing to the increase were miscellaneous gains recorded during the first quarter of 2020, including a $12 million gain on extinguishment of time deposits reflecting early client withdrawals and a $9 million &#32;gain on the sale of one of our owned retail branch properties, as well as higher income associated with bank owned life insurance.

As discussed above, beginning January 1, 2020, credit loss expense for off-balance sheet credit exposures is recorded in the provision for credit losses. 

Salaries and employee benefits Salaries and employee benefits expense decreased slightly during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;as lower incentive compensation expense was largely offset by higher severance costs. While continued cost management efforts, including targeted staff reductions to optimize staffing and improve efficiency throughout 2019 as well as reductions in staff related to the consolidation of our retail branch network, resulted in a decline in the average number of personnel, the impact of these reductions on salaries expense was offset by the addition of higher cost personnel associated with growth initiatives in certain businesses.

Support services from HSBC affiliates Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates was relatively flat during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;as increased costs associated with our business systems and $8 million &#32;of allocated costs from HTSU recorded in the first quarter of 2020 related to the consolidation of our retail branch network were largely offset by lower cost allocations from our technology, risk and compliance support service functions. A summary of the services received from various HSBC affiliates is included in Note 14, "Related Party Transactions," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Occupancy expense, net Occupancy expense, net was higher during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;due primarily to lease impairment and other related costs of $92 million &#32;recorded in the first quarter of 2020 related to the consolidation of our retail branch network and higher rent expense. See Note 2, "Strategic Initiatives," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

Goodwill impairment Reflects a goodwill impairment charge of $784 million &#32;recorded during the first quarter of 2020, representing the entire amount of goodwill previously allocated to our Retail Banking and Wealth Management and our Private Banking reporting units. For additional discussion of the results of our interim goodwill impairment testing, see Note 8, "Goodwill," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Other expenses Excluding the impact of off-balance sheet credit reserves recorded in the prior year period, other expenses remained lower during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;due primarily to lower marketing expense and lower losses associated with card fraud. 

Efficiency ratio Our efficiency ratio increased during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;due primarily to higher operating expenses driven by a goodwill impairment charge recorded during the first quarter of 2020 as discussed in detail above.

The provision for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2020 has been computed as a discrete period actual tax calculation with disclosure of the material tax rate adjustment items listed in the reconciliation table above. We do not expect that this approach has resulted in any material overstatement or understatement of the current period tax expense (benefit). 

Segment Results &#8211; Group Reporting Basis 

&#160; 

We have five distinct business segments that we utilize for management reporting and analysis purposes, which are aligned with HSBC's global business strategy: Retail Banking and Wealth Management ("RBWM"), Commercial Banking ("CMB"), Global Banking and Markets ("GB&#38;M"), Private Banking ("PB") and a Corporate Center ("CC"). See Item 1, "Business," in our 2019 Form 10-K for a description of our segments, which are based upon our global businesses, including a discussion of the main business activities of the segments and a summary of their products and services. There have been no changes in the basis of our segmentation as compared with the presentation in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Net interest income of each segment represents the difference between actual interest earned on assets and interest incurred on liabilities of the segment, adjusted for a funding charge or credit that includes both interest rate and liquidity components. Segments are charged a cost to fund assets (e.g. customer loans) and receive a funding credit for funds provided (e.g. customer deposits) based on equivalent market rates that incorporate both repricing (interest rate risk) and tenor (liquidity) characteristics. The objective of these charges/credits is to transfer interest rate risk from the segments to one centralized unit in Balance Sheet Management, recognize term funding costs/benefits and more appropriately reflect the profitability of the segments. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Certain other revenue and operating expense amounts are also apportioned among the business segments based upon the benefits derived from this activity or the relationship of this activity to other segment activity. These inter-segment transactions have not been eliminated, and we generally account for them as if they were with third parties. 

We report financial information to our parent, HSBC, in accordance with HSBC Group accounting and reporting policies, which apply IFRS issued by the IASB and endorsed by the EU, and, as a result, our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the Group Reporting Basis as operating results are monitored and reviewed, trends are evaluated and decisions about allocating resources, such as employees, are primarily made on this basis. We continue, however, to monitor capital adequacy and report to regulatory agencies on a U.S. GAAP basis. 

There have been no changes in the measurement of segment profit as compared with the presentation in our 2019 Form 10-K. We are currently reviewing the financial information used to manage our business, including the scope and content of the financial data being reported to our management and our Board of Directors within the Corporate Center, any changes to which would impact our other business segments. In February 2020 as part of a business update, we also announced certain changes involving our global businesses including RBWM and PB. To the extent we make changes to the financial information being reported to our management and our Board of Directors in the future, we will evaluate any impact such changes may have on our segment reporting. 

The significant differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis as they impact our results are summarized in Note 24, "Business Segments," in our 2019 Form 10-K. In addition, see Note 15, "Business Segments," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of significant changes since December 31, 2019 in the differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis impacting our results.

Our RBWM segment reported a higher loss before tax during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;due primarily to higher operating expenses driven by a goodwill impairment charge of $372 million &#32;recorded during the first quarter of 2020, representing the entire amount of remaining goodwill previously allocated to this segment, as well as higher expected credit losses and lower net interest income. See Note 8, "Goodwill," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the factors which led to the impairment. 

Net interest income decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;due primarily to lower deposit spreads, partially offset by improved loan spreads and higher loan balances in residential mortgages and credit cards. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Other operating income decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;due to a loss of $7 million recorded during the first quarter of 2020 related to extending the maturity of the total return swap position used to economically hedge the periodic payments made under the swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of Visa Inc. Class B common shares. 

Expected credit losses were higher during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts used for calculating ECL. Also contributing to the increase was higher ECL in credit cards reflecting higher balances due to increased customer activity and new product promotions, including higher dollars of delinquency. 

Excluding the goodwill impairment as discussed above, operating expenses decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;due to lower marketing expense, lower losses associated with card fraud, lower incentive compensation expense and lower cost allocations from our technology and risk support service functions. These decreases were partially offset by higher severance costs.

Net interest income increased during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;due to the favorable impact of higher loan and deposit balances, partially offset by lower deposit spreads reflecting the impact of lower market rates.

Expected credit losses were higher during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts used for calculating ECL and higher loss estimates for downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and loan growth as clients drew on their available lines of credit.

Our GB&#38;M segment reported a lower profit before tax during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;due to higher expected credit losses and lower net interest income, partially offset by higher other operating income and lower operating expenses. 

Credit revenue decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;due to lower revenue from structuring and collateralized financing related activity. 

Rates revenue decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;due to lower revenue from emerging markets rate products, interest rate swaps and hedging activities. 

Foreign Exchange and Metals revenue increased during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;due to higher revenue in Foreign Exchange as market volatility driven by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in increased trading activity in both emerging market and G10 currencies. This increase was partially offset by lower revenue in Metals from market volatility and unfavorable valuation adjustments on exchange for physical transactions. 

Equities revenue increased during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;due to higher client activity in structured equity derivatives as well as increased activity in prime brokerage. 

Global Banking revenue increased during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;due primarily to a gain in the current year period associated with credit default swap protection which largely reflects the hedging of a few client relationships compared with a loss in the prior year period. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable fair value adjustments on loans held for sale and lower net interest income from spread compression. 

Global Liquidity and Cash Management revenue decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;due to lower net interest income driven by lower deposit spreads reflecting the impact of lower market rates, partially offset by higher deposit balances. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Securities Services revenue was lower during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;due to lower interest income reflecting the impact of lower market rates. 

Global Trade and Receivables Finance revenue was flat during the three months ended March 31, 2020 . 

Credit and funding valuation adjustments resulted in losses during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;attributable primarily to unfavorable credit valuation adjustments on derivative assets due to deteriorating credit spreads driven by market volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the impact of lower market rates. In the prior year period, credit and funding valuation adjustments resulted in gains attributable primarily to favorable movements in our own credit spreads within our derivative liability balances. 

Other revenue improved during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;due to favorable corporate revenue allocations, partially offset by higher liquidity charges. 

Expected credit losses were higher during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts used for calculating ECL and higher loss estimates for risk factors associated with oil and gas industry loan exposures, downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and loan growth as clients drew on their available lines of credit. 

Operating expenses were lower during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;due to lower incentive compensation expense, lower deposit insurance assessment fees and lower cost allocations from our technology, risk and compliance support service functions.

Our PB segment reported a loss before tax during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;compared with a profit before tax in the prior year period due primarily to higher operating expenses driven by a goodwill impairment charge of $321 million &#32;recorded during the first quarter of 2020, representing the entire amount of goodwill previously allocated to this segment, as well as lower net interest income. See Note 8, "Goodwill," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the factors which led to the impairment.

Balance Sheet Management includes gains on the sale of securities of $28 million and $7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;and 2019, respectively. 

Our CC segment reported a higher loss before tax during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;due to higher operating expenses, lower other operating income (expense) and lower net interest income. 

Net interest income was lower during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;due to lower net interest income in Balance Sheet Management reflecting the impact of lower market rates, partially offset by improved net interest income from legacy structured credit products. 

Other operating income decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;due primarily to the deterioration of economic conditions and disruption to the capital markets caused by the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in unfavorable valuation adjustments, primarily related to funding spread adjustments, on legacy structured credit products and unfavorable valuation adjustments related to economic hedge positions used to manage interest rate risk in Balance Sheet Management. These decreases were partially offset by the non-recurrence of a loss of approximately $39 million &#32;recorded during the first quarter of 2019 related to the unwind of one of our unconsolidated VIEs, favorable movements related to the economic hedging of interest rate risk within our own debt, higher gains on asset sales in Balance Sheet Management and miscellaneous gains recorded during the first quarter of 2020, including a $12 million gain on extinguishment of time deposits reflecting early client withdrawals and a $9 million gain on the sale of one of our owned retail branch properties. 

Expected credit losses were flat during the three months ended March 31, 2020 . 

Operating expenses were higher during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;due to costs recorded during the first quarter of 2020 related to the consolidation of our retail branch network, including lease impairment and other related costs of $97 million &#32;and allocated costs from HTSU of $8 million . 

Reconciliation of Segment Results As previously discussed, segment results are reported on a Group Reporting Basis.

Credit Quality &#160; 

In the normal course of business, we enter into a variety of transactions that involve both on and off-balance sheet credit risk. Principal among these activities is lending to various commercial, institutional, governmental and individual customers. We participate in lending activity throughout the United States and, on a limited basis, internationally. 

Allowance for Credit Losses / Liability for Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures As discussed further in Note 21, "New Accounting Pronouncements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, beginning January 1, 2020, an allowance for credit losses is recognized based on lifetime ECL for loans, securities held-to-maturity and certain other financial assets measured at amortized cost, and an allowance for credit losses is also recognized for securities available-for-sale. Prior to January 1, 2020, an allowance for credit losses was recognized based on probable incurred losses for loans only while debt securities were assessed for other-than-temporary impairment. In addition, beginning January 1, 2020, the liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures is recognized based on lifetime ECL while, prior to January 1, 2020, it was recognized based on probable incurred losses. The new guidance also requires inclusion of expected recoveries of amounts previously written off, limited to the cumulative amount of prior write-offs, when estimating the allowance for credit losses for in scope financial assets (including collateral-dependent assets). Prior to January 1, 2020, these expected recoveries were not recognized. See Note 6, "Allowance for Credit Losses," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our accounting policies and methodologies used to estimate ECL beginning in 2020. There have been no additional significant changes to our policies or methodologies during the first quarter of 2020. 

&#160; Our accounting policies and methodologies related to the allowance for credit losses and liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures in prior periods are presented under the caption "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" in MD&#38;A and in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements," in our 2019 Form 10-K. Our approach toward credit risk management is summarized under the caption "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Comparative credit information at January 1, 2020, reflecting the adoption of the new accounting guidance, has been included in the tables below where available. Comparative credit information at December 31, 2019, which is not comparable as it does not reflect the adoption of the new accounting guidance, has been retained as previously reported.

See Note 21, "New Accounting Pronouncements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the changes in our allowance for credit losses and liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures at January 1, 2020 as compared with December 31, 2019. 

The total allowance for credit losses at March 31, 2020 &#32;increased $465 million &#32;or 98 percent &#32;as compared with January 1, 2020 due to higher loss estimates on both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios. 

Our commercial allowance for credit losses at March 31, 2020 &#32;increased $346 million &#32;or 91 percent &#32;as compared with January 1, 2020 driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts we use for calculating lifetime ECL in 2020 and higher loss estimates for risk factors associated 

HSBC USA Inc. 

with large loan exposures, downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and loan growth as clients drew on their available lines of credit. 

Our consumer allowance for credit losses at March 31, 2020 &#32;increased $118 million &#32;or 137 percent &#32;as compared with January 1, 2020 driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts we use for calculating lifetime ECL in 2020. Also contributing to the increase was a higher allowance for credit losses in credit cards reflecting higher dollars of delinquency, and, to a lesser extent, a higher allowance for credit losses in other consumer loans reflecting growth in balances due to new product promotions. 

The liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures at March 31, 2020 &#32;increased $213 million &#32;or 135 percent &#32;as compared with January 1, 2020 resulting from the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic consistent with commercial loans as discussed above, including an increase in expected future draws.

Ratios exclude loans held for sale as these loans are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value.

Ratios at March 31, 2020 reflect year-to-date net charge-offs, annualized. Ratios at January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2019 reflect full year net charge-offs for 2019. 

(3) &#160; 

Our commercial net charge-off coverage ratio for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 &#32;and year ended December 31, 2019 &#32;was 75 months and 135 months, respectively. The net charge-off coverage ratio represents the commercial allowance for credit losses at period end divided by average monthly commercial net charge-offs during the period. Our commercial net charge-off coverage ratio for January 1, 2020, calculated by dividing the commercial allowance for credit losses at January 1, 2019 by average monthly commercial net charge-offs during 2019, was 102 months. 

(4) &#160; 

Represents our commercial and consumer allowance for credit losses, as appropriate, divided by the corresponding outstanding balance of total nonperforming loans held for investment. Nonperforming loans include accruing loans contractually past due 90 days or more. 

See Note 6, "Allowance for Credit Losses," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a rollforward of credit losses by general loan categories for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019. 

The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment at March 31, 2020 &#32;increased as compared with January 1, 2020 as the increase in our allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above outpaced an increase in total loans held for investment driven by higher commercial loans. 

The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of net charge-offs at March 31, 2020 &#32;increased slightly as compared with January 1, 2020 as the increase in our allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above was largely offset by an increase in dollars of net charge-offs driven by higher charge-offs in our commercial loan portfolio and, to a lesser extent, our consumer loan portfolio. 

The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans held for investment at March 31, 2020 &#32;increased as compared with January 1, 2020 due to the increase in our allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above while total nonperforming loans was flat.

Our two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio decreased 9 &#32;basis points as compared with December 31, 2019 &#32;due to higher outstanding loan balances driven by an increase in the commercial loan portfolio. This decrease was partially offset by a modest increase in total dollars of delinquency as higher dollars of delinquency in our consumer loan portfolio was largely offset by lower dollars of delinquency in our commercial loan portfolio. 

Our commercial loan two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio decreased 4 &#32;basis points compared with December 31, 2019 &#32;due primarily to the collection of a corporate banking loan which became 60 days delinquent in the fourth quarter of 2019 as well as higher outstanding loan balances. 

Our consumer loan two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio increased 9 &#32;basis points compared with December 31, 2019 &#32;due to higher dollars of delinquency in residential mortgages driven primarily by a few Private Banking customers which became 60 days delinquent in the first quarter and higher dollars of delinquency in credit cards reflecting growth in balances due to increased customer activity and new product promotions.

Our net charge-off ratio as a percentage of average loans increased 18 basis points during the three months ended March 31, 2020 due primarily to a higher level of net charge-offs in our commercial loan portfolio driven by the sale of a global banking loan and deterioration of a corporate banking loan during the first quarter of 2020. Also contributing to the increase was a higher level of net charge-offs in our consumer loan portfolio due primarily to higher charge-offs in credit cards reflecting growth in balances due to increased customer activity and new product promotions.

Nonperforming consumer mortgage loans held for investment include all loans which are 90 or more days contractually delinquent as well as loans discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not re-affirmed and second lien loans where the first lien loan that we own or service is 90 or more days contractually delinquent. 

(4) &#160; 

Nonperforming consumer mortgage loans for all periods does not include guaranteed loans purchased from the Government National Mortgage Association. Repayment of these loans is predominantly insured by the Federal Housing Administration and as such, these loans have different risk characteristics from the rest of our customer loan portfolio. 

(5) &#160; 

Includes $1 million or less of commercial other real estate owned at March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 . 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Our nonperforming loan ratio decreased 16 basis points compared with December 31, 2019 &#32;due to higher outstanding loan balances driven by an increase in the commercial loan portfolio. Total nonperforming loans was relatively flat as higher nonperforming loans in our commercial loan portfolio was largely offset by lower nonperforming loans in our consumer loan portfolio. 

Our commercial nonperforming loan ratio decreased 7 basis points compared with December 31, 2019 &#32;due to higher outstanding loan balances, partially offset by higher nonperforming loans driven by downgrades. 

Our consumer nonperforming loan ratio decreased 10 basis points compared with December 31, 2019 &#32;largely due to lower nonperforming loans in residential mortgages and home equity mortgages reflecting improved collections, partially offset by higher nonperforming loans in credit cards reflecting growth in balances due to increased customer activity and new product promotions. 

Our policies and practices for problem loan management and placing loans on nonaccrual status are summarized in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements," in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Concentration of Credit Risk A concentration of credit risk is defined as a significant credit exposure with an individual or group engaged in similar activities or affected similarly by economic conditions. We enter into a variety of transactions in the normal course of business that involve both on and off-balance sheet credit risk. Principal among these activities is lending to various commercial, institutional, governmental and individual customers throughout the United States and internationally. We manage the varying degrees of credit risk associated with on and off-balance sheet transactions through specific credit policies and procedures which provide for a strict approval, monitoring and reporting process. It is our policy to require collateral when it is deemed appropriate. Varying degrees and types of collateral are secured depending upon management's credit evaluation. 

Our consumer loan portfolio includes the following types of loans: 

&#8226; 

Interest-only loans &#8211; A loan which allows a customer to pay the interest-only portion of the monthly payment for a period of time which results in lower payments during the initial loan period. 

&#8226; 

Adjustable rate mortgage ("ARM") loans &#8211; A loan which allows us to adjust pricing on the loan in line with market movements. 

The following table summarizes the balances of interest-only and ARM loans in our loan portfolios at March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 . Each category is not mutually exclusive and loans may appear in more than one category below.

Credit Risks Associated with Derivative Contracts Credit risk associated with derivatives is measured as the net replacement cost of derivative contracts in a receivable position in the event the counterparties of such contracts fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. In managing derivative credit risk, both the current exposure, which is the replacement cost of contracts on the measurement date, as well as an estimate of the potential change in value of contracts over their remaining lives are considered. Counterparties to our derivative activities include financial institutions, central clearing parties, foreign and domestic government agencies, corporations, funds (mutual funds, hedge funds, etc.), insurance companies and private clients as well as other HSBC entities. These counterparties are subject to regular credit review by the credit risk management department. To minimize credit risk, we may enter into legally enforceable master netting agreements which reduce risk by permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon occurrence of certain events. In addition, we reduce credit risk by obtaining collateral from counterparties. The determination of the need for and the levels of collateral will differ based on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty and/or regulatory requirements. 

The total risk in a derivative contract is a function of a number of variables, such as: 

&#8226; 

volatility of interest rates, currencies, equity or corporate reference entity used as the basis for determining contract payments; 

&#8226; 

current market events or trends; 

&#8226; 

country risk; 

&#8226; 

maturity and liquidity of contracts; 

&#8226; 

creditworthiness of the counterparties in the transaction; 

&#8226; 

the existence of a master netting agreement among the counterparties; and 

&#8226; 

existence and value of collateral received from counterparties to secure exposures. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

The table below presents total credit risk exposure calculated using the general risk-based capital rules of the Basel III Standardized Approach which includes the net positive mark-to-market of the derivative contracts plus any adjusted potential future exposure as measured in reference to the notional amount. The regulatory capital rules recognize that bilateral netting agreements reduce credit risk and, therefore, allow for reductions of risk-weighted assets when netting requirements have been met and collateral exists. As a result, risk-weighted amounts for regulatory capital purposes are a portion of the original gross exposures. Furthermore, many contracts contain provisions that allow us to close out the transaction if the counterparty fails to post required collateral. In addition, many contracts give us the right to break the transactions earlier than the final maturity date. As a result, these contracts have potential future exposures that are often much smaller than the future exposures derived from the regulatory capital rules.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

&#160; 

Effective liquidity management is defined as ensuring we can meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities/withdrawals and other cash commitments efficiently under both normal operating conditions and under unpredictable circumstances of industry or market stress. To achieve this objective, we have guidelines that require sufficient liquidity to cover potential funding requirements and to avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. Guidelines are set for the consolidated balance sheet of HSBC USA to ensure that it is a source of strength for our regulated, deposit-taking banking subsidiary, as well as to address the more limited sources of liquidity available to it as a holding company. Similar guidelines are set for HSBC Bank USA to ensure that it can meet its liquidity needs in various stress scenarios. Cash flow analysis, including stress testing scenarios, forms the basis for liquidity management and contingency funding plans. 

In March 2020, the financial markets became extremely volatile as the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated causing severe disruption to business and economic activity. We continue to actively monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk in accordance with HSBC policy. See "Risk Management" in this MD&#38;A for further discussion of our approach towards liquidity and funding risk management, including information regarding the key measures employed to define, monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk. To date, we have not experienced any significant impact to our liquidity or funding capabilities as a result of this disruption. There was elevated commercial loan demand during the quarter as clients drew on their available lines of credit during the current deterioration in economic conditions. We actively raised deposits, short-term borrowings in the form of securities sold under repurchase agreements, and borrowed from the FHLB to support elevated client demand for loans while maintaining adequate liquidity and increasing cash. We continuously monitor the impact of market events on our liquidity positions and will continue to adapt our framework as necessary to reflect market events. 

Interest Bearing Deposits with Banks totaled $26,496 million &#32;and $2,038 million &#32;at March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , respectively, of which $26,012 million &#32;and $1,801 million , respectively, were held with the Federal Reserve Bank. Balances may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our liquidity position at the time and our strategy for deploying liquidity. Surplus interest bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank may be deployed into securities purchased under agreements to resell or other investments depending on market conditions and the opportunity to maximize returns. 

Federal Funds Sold and Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell totaled $4,643 million &#32;and $17,838 million &#32;at March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , respectively. Balances may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our liquidity position at the time and our strategy for deploying liquidity. 

Trading Assets includes securities totaling $19,220 million &#32;and $23,488 million &#32;at March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , respectively. See "Balance Sheet Review" in this MD&#38;A for further analysis and discussion on trends. 

Securities includes securities available-for-sale and securities held-to-maturity totaling $53,773 million &#32;and $48,956 million &#32;at March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , respectively. See "Balance Sheet Review" in this MD&#38;A for further analysis and discussion on trends.

Under our shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, we may issue certain securities including debt securities and preferred stock. We satisfy the eligibility requirements for designation as a "well-known seasoned issuer," which allows us to file a registration statement that does not have a limit on issuance capacity. The ability to issue under the registration statement is limited by the authority granted by the Board of Directors. At March 31, 2020 , we were authorized to issue up to $30,000 million , of which $18,579 million &#32;was available. HSBC Bank USA has a $40,000 million &#32;Global Bank Note Program that provides for the issuance of subordinated and senior notes, of which $13,158 million &#32;was available at March 31, 2020 . We anticipate using the Global Bank Note Program more in the future as part of our efforts designed to minimize overall funding costs while accessing diverse funding channels. 

As a member of the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, we have secured borrowing facilities which are collateralized by loans and investment securities. At March 31, 2020 , long-term debt included $5,750 million &#32;of borrowings from the FHLB facility. Based upon the amounts pledged as collateral under these facilities, we have additional borrowing capacity of up to $8,128 million . 

Preferred Equity See Note 18, "Preferred Stock," in our 2019 Form 10-K for information regarding all outstanding preferred share issues. 

Common Equity During the first quarter of 2020 , HSBC USA did not receive any cash capital contributions from its parent, HSBC North America, and did not make any capital contributions to its subsidiary, HSBC Bank USA. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Capital Ratios In managing capital, we develop targets for common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, total capital to risk-weighted assets, Tier 1 capital to adjusted quarterly average assets (i.e., the "Tier 1 leverage ratio") and Tier 1 capital to total leverage exposure (i.e., the "supplementary leverage ratio" or "SLR"). Capital targets are reviewed at least semi-annually to ensure they reflect our business mix and risk profile, as well as real-time conditions and circumstances. The following table summarizes HSBC USA's Basel III capital ratios calculated as of March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 :

(3) &#160; 

As discussed further below, beginning April 1, 2020, bank holding companies are permitted to temporarily exclude U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from the denominator of their SLR. As a result of this relief, HSBC USA's SLR increased to approximately 7.7 percent at April 1, 2020. 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 31, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule that provides the option to transition in the regulatory capital impacts of the new current expected credit loss accounting standard over a five-year period. This option comes in addition to the separate three-year transition option already available. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA elected the five-year transition option and, as a result, beginning in 2020, capital ratios are reported in accordance with the transition rules in the interim final rule. 

We manage capital in accordance with HSBC Group policy. The HSBC North America Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ("ICAAP") works in conjunction with the HSBC Group's ICAAP. The HSBC North America ICAAP applies to HSBC Bank USA and evaluates regulatory capital adequacy and capital adequacy under various stress scenarios. Our approach is to meet our capital needs for these stress scenarios locally through activities which reduce risk. To the extent that local alternatives are insufficient, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC, we would seek support from our ultimate parent. Regulatory capital requirements are based on the amount of capital required to be held, plus applicable capital buffers, as defined by regulations, and the amount of risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure, also calculated based on regulatory definitions. 

We are subject to regulatory capital rules issued by U.S. banking regulators including Basel III (the "Basel III rule"). Under the Basel III rule, there are two methods available to calculate risk-weighted assets, the generally-applicable Standardized Approach and the Advanced Approaches, which are required in addition to the Standardized Approach for large banking organizations that meet certain thresholds. In 2019, the FRB and the other federal banking agencies jointly finalized rules to implement the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act ("Relief Act") that tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards for large bank holding companies ("BHCs") and foreign banking organizations (the "Tailoring Rules"). The Tailoring Rules assign each BHC and IHC with $50 billion or more in total U.S. assets into one of five classifications (Categories I through IV, and 'other firms') based on its size and four risk-based indicators. Under the Tailoring Rules, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA are subject to Category III standards beginning January 1, 2020 and are no longer considered "Advanced Approaches banking organizations." However, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA remain subject to certain other capital requirements that were previously applicable only to Advanced Approaches banking organizations, including the SLR and the countercyclical capital buffer. Prior to adoption of the Tailoring Rules, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA had requested and received regulatory approval to opt out of the Advanced Approaches and therefore have previously calculated and will continue to calculate their risk-based capital requirements for credit risk solely under the Standardized Approach. The Tailoring Rules also permit Category III firms and their depository institution subsidiaries to opt-out of the requirement to recognize most elements of accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") in regulatory capital. As a result, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA, made a one-time election to opt-out of the requirement to include all components of AOCI (with the exception of accumulated net gains and losses on cash flow hedges related to items that are not carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet) in common equity Tier 1 capital, effective beginning with March 31, 2020 reporting. 

Category III firms and their depository institution subsidiaries will also benefit from (i) simpler capital requirements for mortgage servicing assets, certain deferred tax assets, and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions, and (ii) a simplified treatment for the amount of capital issued by consolidated subsidiaries to third parties (generally known as minority interests) which can be included in regulatory capital. These simplifying amendments were adopted in a separate rulemaking 

HSBC USA Inc. 

finalized by the federal banking agencies in 2019 and are effective beginning April 1, 2020 although firms may choose to apply the simplifications as early as January 1, 2020. As such, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA implemented both the Tailoring Rules and the simplifying amendments beginning with March 31, 2020 reporting. In 2019, the federal banking agencies also jointly amended the Basel III rule to implement a provision of the Relief Act by reducing the risk weighting applicable to high-volatility commercial real estate exposures and also finalized a rule to include a revised standardized approach for measuring counterparty credit risk ("SA-CCR") to calculate total risk-weighted asset amounts for derivative transactions in addition to the existing current exposure method ("CEM"). These changes are also effective beginning April 1, 2020. The Tailoring Rules clarify that Category III firms and their depository institution subsidiaries are not required to use SA-CCR to measure their derivative exposure. Instead, they have the option to use either SA-CCR or CEM for their risk-based capital ratios and the SLR. As such, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA have elected not to use SA-CCR at this time, but will continue to evaluate the impact of adopting SA-CCR in the future. 

For additional discussion of the Basel III final rule requirements, including required minimum capital ratios, as well as further discussion of the Tailoring Rules and other recent regulatory developments and their expected impact see Part I, "Regulation and Competition - Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Requirements," in our 2019 Form 10-K and also below under the caption, "Other Regulatory Developments." We continue to review the composition of our capital structure and capital buffers in light of these developments. 

Capital Planning and Stress Testing &#32;&#32;The FRB requires IHCs and BHCs, including HSBC North America, to comply with the FRB's capital plan rule and CCAR program, as well as the annual supervisory stress tests conducted by the FRB and annual company-run stress tests as required under Dodd-Frank (collectively, "DFAST"), as amended by the Relief Act. Under the Tailoring Rules, HSBC North America as a Category III firm, is no longer subject to a mid-cycle stress testing requirement beginning January 1, 2020 and is now required to disclose its company-run stress test results only every other year. The company-run stress tests are forward looking exercises to assess the impact of hypothetical macroeconomic baseline and severely adverse scenarios provided by the FRB, and internally developed scenarios for the company-run exercises, on the financial condition and capital adequacy of a bank-holding company over a nine quarter planning horizon. 

On March 4, 2020, the FRB adopted a final rule on the stress capital buffer ("SCB") which will, among other things, replace the current fixed 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer with a dynamic, institution-specific risk-based SCB. It is expected that the SCB will vary in size throughout the economic cycle depending on a firm&#8217;s risk exposures and the severity of its stress scenarios. Under the final rule, the SCB would be recalibrated annually based on the sum of: (i) a firm&#8217;s projected losses under the severely adverse scenario in supervisory stress tests and (ii) four quarters of a firm&#8217;s planned future dividends. If HSBC North America's risk-based capital ratios were to fall to levels within the SCB, it would become subject to increasing restrictions on their capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The final rule also eliminates the quantitative objection component of CCAR, and instead relies on the capital rule&#8217;s automatic restrictions on capital distributions that are triggered if a firm breaches its buffer requirements. The SCB will be determined initially based on 2020 supervisory stress testing results conducted as part of CCAR, and will become effective October 1, 2020. HSBC North America already utilizes an internal capital assessment approach that is analogous to the SCB and will continue to review the composition of its capital structures and capital buffers in light of the final rule. The SCB applies only to HSBC North America; HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA remain subject to a static 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer. 

For further discussion on capital planning and stress testing, including detail regarding the FRB's supervisory assessment as part of the CCAR process, as well as further discussion of the Tailoring Rules and other recent regulatory developments and their expected impact see Part I, "Regulation and Competition - Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Requirements," in our 2019 Form 10-K and also below under the caption, "Other Regulatory Developments." 

HSBC North America submitted its latest CCAR capital plan and their latest annual company-run DFAST results in April 2020. HSBC North America will publicly disclose their latest annual DFAST results, as required, within 15 days of the FRB disclosing the results of its own DFAST results. The FRB will publicly disclose its own DFAST and CCAR results on or before June 30, 2020. Stress testing results are based solely on hypothetical adverse stress scenarios and should not be viewed or interpreted as forecasts of expected outcomes or capital adequacy or of the actual financial condition of HSBC North America. Capital planning and stress testing for HSBC North America may impact our future capital and liquidity. 

While bank holding company regulatory capital compliance is generally performed at the HSBC North America level, and also separately for HSBC Bank USA, as a bank holding company we are required to meet minimum capital requirements imposed by the FRB. We present our capital ratios, together with HSBC Bank USA's in Note 16, "Retained Earnings and Regulatory Capital Requirements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Other Regulatory Developments 

FRB Liquidity Facilities The FRB announced the creation of several facilities aimed at stabilizing the markets, addressing immediate liquidity concerns, and facilitating lending and other assistance to businesses and individuals affected by shutdowns due to COVID-19. These programs include, among others, the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, the Term Asset-Backed 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Securities Loan Facility, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility and the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility. We are evaluating whether to utilize any of these programs as an additional source of funding. 

Regulatory Capital Revision The federal banking agencies have also announced certain changes to the regulatory capital requirements designed to address concerns arising from COVID-19. On April 1, 2020, the FRB issued an interim final rule adopting a temporary change to the calculation of the SLR that permits bank holding companies such as HSBC North America, to exclude U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from the denominator of their SLR. This change, which took effect April 1, 2020, will remain in place until March 31, 2021 and is designed to allow banking institutions to expand their balance sheets to accommodate increased customer deposits while continuing to provide credit to companies and households. We continue to assess this SLR relief and the composition of our balance sheet, particularly given that the exclusion does not apply to Tier 1 leverage ratios.

Reductions to trading assets estimated during the April 1 through December 31, 2020 period are mainly related to select Fixed Income activities which will be consolidated in and operated from Europe to better utilize HSBC's global scale, which allows us to record revenue as a business introducer and hold fewer assets on our balance sheet. As previously discussed, the timing of our strategic actions may be re-sequenced or delayed. In light of COVID-19, we continue to reassess our strategic plan and may take additional actions in future periods. 

The above table reflects a long-term funding strategy. Daily balances fluctuate as we accommodate customer needs, while ensuring that we have liquidity in place to support the balance sheet maturity funding profile. Should market conditions deteriorate, we have contingency plans to generate additional liquidity through the sales of assets or financing transactions. We remain confident in our ability to access the market for long-term debt funding needs in the current market environment. We continue to seek well-priced and stable customer deposits. We also continue to sell new agency-eligible mortgage loan originations to third parties. 

HSBC Bank USA is subject to significant restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to, and certain other 'covered transactions' with HSBC USA and other affiliates. For further discussion, see Part I, "Regulation and Competition - Affiliate Transaction Restrictions," in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

See "Risk Management" in this MD&#38;A for further discussion relating to our liquidity contingency plans and our approach to liquidity and funding risk management.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Credit Derivatives and Other Contractual Obligations 

&#160; 

As part of our normal operations, we enter into credit derivatives and various off-balance sheet arrangements with affiliates and third parties. These arrangements arise principally in connection with our lending and client intermediation activities and involve primarily extensions of credit and, in certain cases, guarantees. 

As a financial services provider, we routinely extend credit through loan commitments and lines and letters of credit and provide financial guarantees, including derivative transactions having characteristics of a guarantee. The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent our maximum possible credit exposure in the event that a counterparty draws down the full commitment amount or we are required to fulfill our maximum obligation under a guarantee. 

The following table provides maturity information related to our credit derivatives and off-balance sheet arrangements. Many of these commitments and guarantees expire unused or without default. In addition, implementation of our business strategy (as described under the heading "Executive Overview - 2020 Business Update" in our 2019 Form 10-K) will affect our contractual obligations over time, including with respect to credit derivatives. As a result, we believe that the contractual amount is not representative of the actual future credit exposure or funding requirements. &#160;

Other Commitments to Extend Credit Other commitments to extend credit include arrangements whereby we are contractually obligated to extend credit in the form of loans, participations in loans, lease financing receivables, or similar transactions. Consumer commitments are comprised of certain unused MasterCard/Visa credit card lines, where we have the right to change terms or conditions upon notification to the customer, and commitments to extend credit secured by residential properties, where we have the right to change terms or conditions, for cause, upon notification to the customer. Commercial commitments comprise primarily those related to secured and unsecured loans and lines of credit. 

In addition to the above, we have established and manage a number of constant net asset value ("CNAV") money market funds that invest in shorter-dated highly-rated money market securities to provide investors with a highly liquid and secure investment. These funds price the assets in their portfolio on an amortized cost basis, which enables them to create and liquidate shares at a constant price. The funds, however, are not permitted to price their portfolios at amortized cost if that amount varies by more than 50 basis points from the portfolio's market value. In that case, the fund would be required to price its portfolio at market value and consequently would no longer be able to create or liquidate shares at a constant price. We do not consolidate the CNAV funds because we do not absorb the majority of the expected future risk associated with the fund's assets, including interest rate, liquidity, credit and other relevant risks that are expected to affect the value of the assets.

Fair Value 

&#160; 

Fair Value Hierarchy Fair value measurement accounting principles establish a fair value hierarchy structure that prioritizes the inputs to determine the fair value of an asset or liability (the "Fair Value Framework"). The Fair Value Framework distinguishes between inputs that are based on observed market data and unobservable inputs that reflect market participants' assumptions. It emphasizes the use of valuation methodologies that maximize observable market inputs. For financial instruments carried at fair value, the best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an actively traded market (Level 1). Where the market for a financial instrument is not active, valuation techniques are used. The majority of our valuation techniques use market inputs that are either observable or indirectly derived from and corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the financial instrument (Level 2). Because Level 1 and Level 2 instruments are determined by observable inputs, less judgment is applied in determining their fair values. In the absence of observable market inputs, the financial instrument is valued based on valuation techniques that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The determination of the level of fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement of an asset or a liability is classified often requires judgment and may change over time as market conditions evolve. We consider the following factors in developing the fair value hierarchy: 

&#8226; 

whether the asset or liability is transacted in an active market with a quoted market price; 

&#8226; 

the level of bid-ask spreads; 

&#8226; 

a lack of pricing transparency due to, among other things, complexity of the product and market liquidity; 

&#8226; 

whether only a few transactions are observed over a significant period of time; 

&#8226; 

whether the pricing quotations differ substantially among independent pricing services; 

&#8226; 

whether inputs to the valuation techniques can be derived from or corroborated with market data; and 

&#8226; 

whether significant adjustments are made to the observed pricing information or model output to determine the fair value. 

Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that the reporting entity has the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities. A financial instrument is classified as a Level 1 measurement if it is listed on an exchange or is an instrument actively traded in the over-the-counter ("OTC") market where transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume. We regard financial instruments such as debt securities, equity securities and derivative contracts listed on the primary exchanges of a country to be actively traded. Non-exchange-traded instruments classified as Level 1 assets include securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, to-be-announced securities, non-callable securities issued by U.S. Government sponsored enterprises and certain foreign government-backed debt. 

Level 2 inputs are those that are observable either directly or indirectly but do not qualify as Level 1 inputs. We classify mortgage pass-through securities, agency and certain non-agency mortgage collateralized obligations, non-exchange-traded derivative contracts, asset-backed securities, obligations of U.S. states and political subdivisions, corporate debt securities, certain foreign government-backed debt, preferred securities, securities purchased and sold under resale and repurchase agreements, precious metals, certain loans held for sale, residential mortgage loans whose carrying amount was reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, real estate owned and, beginning January 1, 2020, certain student loans held for investment as Level 2 measurements. Where possible, at least two quotations from independent sources are obtained based on transactions involving comparable assets and liabilities to validate the fair value of these instruments. We have established a process to understand the methodologies and inputs used by the third party pricing services to ensure that pricing information meets the fair value objective and, where appropriate, this pricing data is back-tested to market trade executions. Where significant differences arise among the independent pricing quotes and the internally determined fair value, we investigate and reconcile the differences. If the investigation results in a significant adjustment to the fair value, the instrument will be classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. In general, we have observed that there is a correlation between the credit standing and the market liquidity of a non-derivative instrument. 

Level 2 derivative instruments are generally valued based on discounted future cash flows or an option pricing model adjusted for counterparty credit risk and market liquidity. The fair value of certain derivative products is determined using valuation techniques based on inputs derived from observable indices traded in the OTC market. Appropriate control processes and procedures have been applied to ensure that the derived inputs are applied to value only those instruments that share similar risks to the relevant benchmark indices and therefore demonstrate a similar response to market factors. 

Level 3 inputs are unobservable estimates that management expects market participants would use to determine the fair value of the asset or liability. That is, Level 3 inputs incorporate market participants' assumptions about risk and the risk premium required by market participants in order to bear that risk. We develop Level 3 inputs based on the best information available in the circumstances. At March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , our Level 3 measurements included the following: certain structured deposits and structured notes for which the embedded credit, foreign exchange or equity derivatives that have significant unobservable inputs (e.g., volatility or default correlations), asset-backed credit default swaps with certain inputs which are unobservable, certain corporate debt securities, certain asset-backed securities, individually assessed commercial loans, derivatives

referenced to illiquid assets of less desirable credit quality and swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of Visa Class B Shares for which the fair value is dependent upon the final resolution of the related litigation.

Significant Changes in Fair Value for Level 3 Assets and Liabilities See Note 19, "Fair Value Measurements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on additions to and transfers into (out of) Level 3 measurements during the three months ended March 31, 2020 &#32;and 2019 &#32;as well as for further details including the classification hierarchy associated with assets and liabilities measured at fair value. 

Effect of Changes in Significant Unobservable Inputs &#160; The fair value of certain financial instruments is measured using valuation techniques that incorporate pricing assumptions not supported by, derived from or corroborated by observable market data. The resultant fair value measurements are dependent on unobservable input parameters which can be selected from a range of estimates and may be interdependent. Changes in one or more of the significant unobservable input parameters may change the fair value measurements of these financial instruments. For the purpose of preparing the financial statements, the final valuation inputs selected are based on management's best judgment that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing similar assets or liabilities. 

The unobservable input parameters selected are subject to the internal valuation control processes and procedures. When we perform a test of all the significant input parameters to the extreme values within the range at the same time, it could result in an increase of the overall fair value measurement of approximately $15 million &#32;or a decrease of the overall fair value measurement of approximately $23 million &#32;at March 31, 2020 . The effect of changes in significant unobservable input parameters are primarily driven by the uncertainty in determining the fair value of credit derivatives executed against certain insurers and certain deal-contingent forward starting interest rate derivatives. 

Risk Management 

&#160; 

Overview &#160; Managing risk effectively is fundamental to the delivery of our strategic priorities. 

We use a comprehensive risk management framework across the organization and across all risk types underpinned by our risk culture. This framework fosters continuous monitoring, promotes risk awareness and encourages sound operational and strategic decision-making. It also ensures a consistent approach to identifying, assessing, managing and reporting the risks we accept and incur in our activities. 

Our Board of Directors has the ultimate responsibility for effective management of risk. It is advised on risk matters by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors and the Compliance and Conduct Committee. In particular, the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors advises the Board of Directors on risk appetite and its alignment with our strategy, risk governance and internal controls as well as high-level risk related matters. Robust risk governance and accountability are embedded throughout our business through an established framework that helps to ensure appropriate oversight of and accountability for the effective management of risk. 

Our material risks The principal risks associated with our operations include the following: 

&#8226; 

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract; 

HSBC USA Inc. 

&#8226; 

Capital and liquidity risk is the risk of having insufficient capital, liquidity or funding resources to meet financial obligations and satisfy regulatory requirements, including pension risk; 

&#8226; 

Market risk is the risk that movements in market factors, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices and commodity prices, will reduce our income or the value of our portfolios; 

&#8226; 

Resilience risk &#32;is the risk that we are unable to provide critical services to our customers, affiliates and counterparties as a result of sustained and significant operational disruption; 

&#8226; 

Regulatory compliance risk is the risk that we fail to observe the letter and spirit of relevant laws, codes, rules, regulations and standards of good market practice, which as a consequence incur fines and penalties and suffer damage to our business; 

&#8226; 

Financial crime and fraud risk &#32;is the risk that we knowingly or unknowingly help parties to commit or to further potentially illegal activity, including both internal and external fraud; 

&#8226; 

Strategic risk is the risk that the business will fail to identify, execute and react appropriately to opportunities and/or threats arising from changes in the market, some of which may emerge over a number of years such as changing economic and political circumstances, customer requirements, demographic trends, regulatory developments or competitor action; 

&#8226; 

Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from business decisions informed by models, which can be exacerbated by errors in methodology, design or the way they are used. 

In the course of our regular risk management activities, we use models to help quantify the risk we are taking. We believe that the assumptions used in these models are reasonable, but events may unfold differently than what is assumed in the models. Consequently, model results may be considered reasonable estimates, with the understanding that actual results may differ significantly from model projections. 

See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2019 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of the objectives of our risk management system as well as our risk management policies and practices. There have been no material changes to our approach to risk management since December 31, 2019 . 

Credit Risk Management &#32;&#32;Credit risk is managed through a robust risk identification and control framework which outlines clear and consistent policies, principles and guidance for risk managers. Credit risk is monitored using various internal risk management measures and within limits approved by individuals within a framework of delegated authorities. Our credit risk management procedures are designed for all stages of economic and financial cycles, including challenging periods of market volatility and economic uncertainty. See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2019 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our approach to credit risk. 

ASU 2016-13 process &#32;On January 1, 2020, we adopted the requirements of ASU 2016-13, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses" ("ASU 2016-13"). The implementation of ASU 2016-13 represents a significant challenge to our Risk and Finance functions. The ASU introduces new concepts and measures such as lifetime ECL. Some of these new concepts and measures differ significantly from the IFRS 9, "Financial Instruments" ("IFRS 9") credit loss reporting that we implemented in 2018 for segment reporting under the Group Reporting Basis. As a result of ASU 2016-13 adoption, management has additional insight and measures not previously utilized which, over time, may influence our risk appetite and risk management processes. The ASU 2013-16 process comprises three main areas: 

&#8226; 

Modeling - The Risk function had pre-existing models developed in conjunction with our IFRS 9 reporting to HSBC. These models were enhanced or supplemented to address the requirements of ASU 2016-13 such as incorporating forward economic guidance for a reasonable and supportable forecast period, reversion to historical losses, the expectation for zero losses under certain conditions, and lifetime ECL for undrawn credit exposures, with the appropriate governance and independent review. The models vary in complexity and inputs depending upon the size of the portfolio, the amount of data available and the sophistication of the market concerned. 

&#8226; 

Implementation &#32;- A centralized impairment engine has been implemented to perform the lifetime ECL calculation. The impairment engine receives data, which is subject to a number of validation checks and enhancements, from a variety of client, finance and risk systems. Once the lifetime ECL calculation has been calculated, there are further data analysis checks and review and challenge of the results prior to commencing formal governance. Risk and Finance work closely together throughout the execution of this process. 

&#8226; 

Governance &#32;- A Management Review Committee has been established in order to review and approve the results of the lifetime ECL calculation. The Management Review Committee has representatives from Credit Risk and Finance and is responsible for final approval of our lifetime ECL for the period. The Chief Credit Officer and the RBWM Chief Risk Officer share responsibility with the Chief Financial Officer for establishing appropriate levels of allowances for credit losses inherent in various loan and other portfolios carried at amortized cost. 

Capital and Liquidity Risk Management Although our overall approach to capital and liquidity risk management has not changed, we continuously monitor our capital ratios and the impact of market events on our liquidity positions and will continue to adapt our frameworks as necessary to reflect market events and the evolving regulatory landscape and view as to best practices. See 

HSBC USA Inc. 

"Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2019 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our approach to capital and liquidity risk. 

Capital risk &#32;See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in this MD&#38;A for a discussion of our approach to capital risk, including our capital ratios and regulatory capital requirements. 

Liquidity and funding risk &#32;As part of our approach towards liquidity and funding risk management, we employ the measures discussed below to define, monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk in accordance with HSBC policy. 

The Basel Committee based Liquidity Coverage Ratio ("LCR") is designed to be a short-term liquidity measure to ensure banks have sufficient High Quality Liquid Assets ("HQLA") to cover net stressed cash outflows over the next 30 days. At both March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , HSBC USA's LCR under the European LCR rule exceeded 100 percent. A LCR of 100 percent or higher reflects an unencumbered HQLA balance that is equal to or exceeds liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario. HQLA consists of cash or assets that can be converted into cash at little or no loss of value in private markets. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA are also subject to the U.S. LCR rule and are required to report LCR to U.S. regulators on a daily basis. The Tailoring Rules reduced the U.S. LCR requirement for Category III firms with weighted short-term wholesale funding under $75 billion and their depository institution subsidiaries, including HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA, from 100 to 85 percent beginning January 1, 2020. As a result, under the U.S. LCR rule, a LCR of 100 percent or higher reflects an unencumbered HQLA balance that is equal to or exceeds 85 percent of liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario. During the three months ended March 31, 2020 , HSBC Bank USA's LCR under the U.S. LCR rule remained above the 100 percent minimum requirement. 

The European calibration of the Basel Committee based Net Stable Funding Ratio ("NSFR"), which is a longer term liquidity measure with a 12-month time horizon to ensure a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities, is still pending. Therefore, our calculation of NSFR is based on our current interpretation and understanding of the Basel Committee NSFR guidance, which may differ in future periods depending on completion of the European calibration and further implementation guidance from regulators. At both March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , HSBC USA's estimated NSFR exceeded 100 percent. A NSFR of 100 percent or more reflects an available stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next 12 months that is equal to or exceeds the required amount of funding for assets and off-balance sheet exposures. In April 2016, U.S. regulators issued for public comment a proposal to implement the NSFR in the United States, applicable to certain large banking organizations, including HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA. The Tailoring Rules also indicate that an 85 percent NSFR requirement will apply to Category III firms with weighted short-term wholesale funding under $75 billion and their depository institution subsidiaries, including HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA, once the NSFR is finalized. As a result, under the proposed U.S. NSFR rule, a NSFR of 100 percent or more reflects an available stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next 12 months that is equal to or exceeds 85 percent of the required amount of funding for assets and off-balance sheet exposures. At both March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , HSBC Bank USA's estimated NSFR, based on our current interpretation and understanding of the proposed U.S. NSFR rule, exceeded 100 percent. 

As a Category III firm, HSBC North America remains subject to liquidity stress testing on a monthly basis and related liquidity buffer and liquidity risk management requirements. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA have adjusted their liquidity profiles to support compliance with these rules. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA may need to make further changes to their liquidity profiles to support compliance with any future rules. 

Our liquidity and funding risk management approach includes deposits, supplemented by wholesale borrowing to fund our balance sheet, and using security sales or secured borrowings for liquidity stress situations in our liquidity contingency plans. In addition, current regulatory initiatives require banks to retain a portfolio of HQLA. As such, we are maintaining a large portfolio of high quality sovereign and sovereign guaranteed securities. 

Our ability to regularly attract wholesale funds at a competitive cost is enhanced by strong ratings from the major credit ratings agencies. The following table reflects the short and long-term credit ratings of HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA at March 31, 2020 :

Rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk management practices and legal matters, all of which could lead to adverse ratings actions. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

In April 2020, Fitch changed the rating outlook for both HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA to negative from stable following a similar change in outlook to negative from stable for HSBC. The outlook change reflects the economic disruption driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. While the outlook changed, Fitch affirmed the long-term credit rating for HSBC USA. Concurrently, Fitch upgraded the long-term credit rating for HSBC Bank USA by one notch to AA- following a review of HSBC's resolution plan. While these rating actions did not have a material financial impact on our borrowing costs or liquidity, any future actions could have such an impact. 

Although we closely monitor and strive to manage factors influencing our credit ratings, there is no assurance that our credit ratings will not change in the future. At March 31, 2020 , there were no pending actions in terms of changes to ratings on the debt of HSBC USA or HSBC Bank USA from any of the rating agencies. 

See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in this MD&#38;A for further discussion of our liquidity position, including information regarding our outstanding borrowings, the remaining availability of our debt issuance programs and our funding strategy. 

Market Risk Management Exposure to market risk is separated into two portfolios: 

&#8226; 

Trading portfolios &#32;comprise positions arising from market-making and warehousing of client-derived positions. 

&#8226; 

Non-trading portfolios &#32;comprise positions that primarily arise from the interest rate management of our retail and commercial banking assets and liabilities and financial investments classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity. 

We apply similar risk management policies and measurement techniques to both trading and non-trading portfolios. Our objective 

is to manage and control market risk exposures to optimize return on risk while maintaining a market profile consistent with our established risk appetite. See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2019 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our approach to market risk. 

Value at Risk ("VaR") &#32;VaR is a technique for estimating potential losses on risk positions as a result of movements in market rates and prices over a specified time horizon and to a given level of confidence. The use of VaR is integrated into market risk management and calculated for all trading positions regardless of how we capitalize them. In addition, we calculate VaR for non-trading portfolios to have a complete picture of risk. VaR measures are calculated to a 99 percent confidence level and use a one-day holding period. 

Trading portfolios Trading VaR generates from the Global Markets unit of the GB&#38;M business segment. Portfolios are mainly comprised of foreign exchange products, interest rate swaps, credit default swaps and precious metals (i.e., gold, silver, platinum) in both North America and emerging markets. 

The following graph summarizes daily VaR for our trading portfolios at a 99 percent confidence level (in millions):

Portfolio diversification is the market risk dispersion effect of holding a portfolio containing different risk types. It represents the reduction in unsystematic market risk that occurs when combining a number of different risk types, for example, foreign exchange, interest rate and credit spread, together in one portfolio. It is measured as the difference between the sum of the VaR by individual risk type and the combined total VaR. A negative number represents the benefit of portfolio diversification. As the maximum and minimum occur on different days for different risk types, it is not meaningful to calculate a portfolio diversification benefit for these measures. 

(2) &#160; 

The total VaR is non-additive across risk types due to diversification effects. For presentation purposes, portfolio diversification of the VaR for trading portfolios includes VaR-based risk-not-in-VaR. 

Back-testing &#32;We routinely validate the accuracy of our VaR models by back-testing them against hypothetical profit and loss that excludes non-modeled items such as fees, commissions and revenues of intra-day transactions from the actual reported profit and loss. We would expect, on average, to see two or three profits and two or three losses in excess of VaR at the 99 percent confidence level over a one-year period. The actual number of profits or losses in excess of VaR over this period can therefore be used to gauge how well the models are performing. To ensure a conservative approach to calculating our risk exposures, it is important to note that profits in excess of VaR are only considered when back-testing the accuracy of models and are not used for capital purposes. 

During the first quarter of 2020 , we experienced nine profit and six loss back-testing exceptions. Two profit exceptions and one loss exception in January were mainly driven by palladium volatility. Seven profit exceptions and five loss exceptions in March were primarily driven by intensified market volatility as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic shutting down the global economy, including delivery disruptions in the gold market, which became highly illiquid on news of refinery closings, dramatic volatility in credit spreads, and heightened rates volatility. This global event caused price disruptions that have not been observed in the past two years, which is the period used in the historical VaR calculation. The volatility highlighted in back-testing exceptions were greater than the 99 percent confidence level used to determine VaR quantum. 

Non-trading portfolios Non-trading VaR predominantly relates to Balance Sheet Management ("BSM") and represents the potential negative changes in the investment portfolio market value (which includes available-for-sale and held-to-maturity assets) and associated hedges. Our investment portfolio holdings are mainly comprised of U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed and U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities. Our non-trading VaR exposure is driven by interest rates and agency spread volatility. 

The following table summarizes our non-trading VaR for the three months ended March 31, 2020 :

Refer to the Trading VaR table above for additional information. 

The increase in non-trading VaR at March 31, 2019 was due primarily to an increase in price and rate volatility driven by the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Non-trading VaR also includes the interest rate risk of non-trading financial assets and liabilities held by the global businesses and transfer priced into BSM which has the mandate to centrally manage and hedge it. See below for a broader discussion on how interest rate risk is managed. 

Interest rate risk Various techniques are utilized to quantify and monitor risks associated with the repricing characteristics of our assets, liabilities and derivative contracts. See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2019 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our approach to interest rate risk. 

Economic value of equity ("EVE") &#32;EVE represents the present value of the banking book cash flows that could be provided to our equity holder under a managed run-off scenario. An EVE sensitivity represents the change in EVE due to a defined movement in interest rates. We manage to an immediate parallel upward shock of 200 basis points and an immediate parallel downward shock of 200 basis points to the market implied interest rates. At both March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , our EVE remained within risk appetite for the up 200 and down 200 basis point interest rate shock scenarios.

Net interest income simulation modeling techniques &#32; We utilize simulation modeling to monitor a number of interest rate scenarios for their impact on projected net interest income. These techniques simulate the impact on projected net interest income under various scenarios, such as rate shock scenarios which assume immediate market rate movements by 100 basis points, as well as scenarios in which rates gradually rise or fall by 100 basis points over a twelve month period. In the gradual scenarios, 25 percent of the interest rate movement occurs at the beginning of each quarter. The following table reflects the impact on our projected net interest income of the scenarios utilized by these modeling techniques:

Changes in the sensitivities since December 31, 2019 have been primarily driven by the addition of pay-fixed positions and the acceleration of expected mortgage prepayments as a result of the significant drop in interest rates. The projections do not take into consideration possible complicating factors such as the effect of changes in interest rates on the credit quality, size and composition of the balance sheet. Therefore, although this provides a reasonable estimate of interest rate sensitivity, actual results will differ from these estimates, possibly by significant amounts. 

Capital risk/sensitivity of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) &#32;Large movements of interest rates could directly affect some reported capital balances and ratios. The mark-to-market valuation of available-for-sale securities is recorded on a tax effected basis to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). This valuation mark is included in two important accounting based capital ratios: common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and total equity to total assets. At March 31, 2020 , we had an available-for-sale securities portfolio of approximately $40,792 million &#32;with a positive &#32;mark-to-market adjustment of $927 million . An increase of 25 basis points in interest rates of all maturities would lower the mark-to-market by approximately $359 million &#32;to a net gain &#32;of $568 million &#32;with the following results on our capital ratios:
