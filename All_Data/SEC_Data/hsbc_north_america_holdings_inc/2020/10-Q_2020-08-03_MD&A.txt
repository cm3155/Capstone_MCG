 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

&#160; 

Forward-Looking Statements &#160; 

Certain matters discussed throughout this Form 10-Q &#32;are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, we may make or approve certain statements in future filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), in press releases, or oral or written presentations by representatives of HSBC USA Inc. ("HSBC USA" and, together with its subsidiaries, "HUSI") that are not statements of historical fact and may also constitute forward-looking statements. Words such as "may," "will," "should," "would," "could," "appears," "believe," "intends," "expects," "estimates," "targeted," "plans," "anticipates," "goal," and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements but should not be considered as the only means through which these statements may be made. All discussions related to strategy, including the matters discussed under the heading "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Overview" and discussions of those matters elsewhere in this Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements. These matters or statements will relate to our future structure, operations, strategy, financial condition, economic forecast, results of operations, plans, objectives, performance or business developments and will involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from that which was expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

HSBC USA Inc. 

Executive Overview &#160; 

HSBC USA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC North America, which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC. HUSI may also be referred to in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&#38;A") as "we," "us" or "our." 

Economic Environment The U.S. economy deteriorated rapidly into recession during the second quarter of 2020 driven by the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in disruption to business and economic activity as well as to the capital markets. COVID-19's effects in the U.S. and globally have been extreme, and neither the magnitude nor the duration of the pandemic and its repercussions is clear. Unprecedented government economic intervention has likely dampened the pandemic's effects, but at uncertain long-term cost. U.S. Gross Domestic Product ("GDP") contracted at an estimated annual rate of 32.9 percent in the second quarter of 2020, while the total unemployment rate increased significantly to 11.1 percent at June 2020. After cutting short-term interest rates by 150 basis points (to near zero) in March 2020 and announcing various other initiatives to enhance liquidity and support the flow of credit to households and businesses, the FRB decided to hold short-term interest rates steady in June 2020 and indicated it expects short-term rates to remain unchanged until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events. 

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic conditions both in the United States and abroad during the first half of 2020 has created global uncertainty about the future economic environment including the length and depth of a global recession. Concerns over interest rate levels, energy prices, domestic and global policy issues, including civil unrest in the U.S., trade policy in the U.S. and geopolitical events as well as the implications of those events on the markets in general further add to this global uncertainty. Interest rate levels and energy prices, in combination with global economic conditions, fiscal and monetary policy and the level of regulatory and government scrutiny of financial institutions will continue to impact our results in 2020 and beyond. 

Performance, Developments and Trends &#32;As mentioned above, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause disruption to our customers, vendors and employees. The outbreak of this virus has disrupted global financial markets and negatively affected supply and demand across a broad range of industries. This pandemic has had a significant impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations during the first half of the year, including the impairment of goodwill associated with our Retail Banking and Wealth Management and Private Banking reporting units in the first quarter, an increase to the provision for credit losses on our loan portfolio and valuation losses associated with certain financial instruments due to market volatility, which have largely recovered during the second quarter. Additionally, in April 2020, Fitch changed the rating outlook for both HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA to negative from stable and, in May 2020, Standard and Poor's ("S&#38;P") downgraded the long- and short-term issuer credit ratings of HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA by one notch, following similar rating actions for HSBC. The circumstances around this pandemic are evolving and will continue to impact our business in future periods as it may not be fully contained for an extended period of time. Should the current economic conditions persist or deteriorate further, we expect that this environment will continue to adversely impact our business which could include, but not be limited to, further impacts on our income due to lower interest rates, lower lending and transaction volumes, higher expected credit losses, lower wealth management revenue due to equity markets volatility and weakness and increased model risk including credit loss models, capital models and asset/liability management models due to the unprecedented impact on economic and market drivers related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Other potential risks include the impact of postponed health screenings on the well-being of our employees, credit rating migration which could negatively impact our risk-weighted assets and capital position, and potential liquidity stress due, among other factors, to increased customer drawdowns, notwithstanding the significant initiatives that the U.S. Government and the FRB have put in place to support funding and liquidity. This matter could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and credit ratings in future periods. The extent of such impact will depend on the outcome of certain developments, including but not limited to, the duration of the pandemic given that the pandemic may not be fully contained until a vaccine and/or widely accepted treatment becomes available which might not occur for an extended period of time, as well as its continuing impact on our customers, vendors and employees, all of which are uncertain. See Part II, Item 1A, "Risk Factors - Risks related to the impact of COVID-19" for further discussion. 

Late in the second quarter of 2020, we decided to lift the pause we had put in place in March on the staff reductions relating to our restructuring plan as COVID-19 restrictions have begun to ease. As a result, we recorded $43 million of severance related costs during the second quarter, including $13 million of direct costs and $30 million of allocated costs from HSBC Technology &#38; Services ("HTSU"). Our restructuring plan is moving forward as planned, including consolidation of our retail branch network and wholesale and retail middle and back office functions, each under a single operations structure, and the creation of our Wealth and Personal Banking business which was completed in the second quarter. While we remain committed to our multi-year strategic plan to re-profile our business, the timing of the strategic actions as outlined in our 2019 Form 10-K may be re-sequenced or delayed beyond 24 months as the circumstances around the COVID-19 pandemic continue to develop. We continue to re-assess our strategic plan and may take additional actions in future periods. See Note 2, "Strategic Initiatives," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Represents period end loans, net of allowance for credit losses, as a percentage of core deposits as calculated in accordance with Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council guidelines which generally include all domestic demand, money market and other savings accounts, as well as time deposits with balances not exceeding $250,000. 

Net income (loss) was income of $7 million &#32;and a loss of $1,276 million &#32;during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively, compared with income of $121 million &#32;and $230 million &#32;during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , respectively. Income (loss) before income tax was income of $56 million &#32;and a loss of $1,384 million &#32;during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively, compared with income of $156 million &#32;and $300 million &#32;during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , respectively. The decrease in income (loss) before income tax during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 &#32;was due primarily to a higher provision for credit losses driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and, in the year-to-date period, higher operating expenses driven by a goodwill impairment charge recorded during the first quarter of 2020 as discussed below. Also contributing to the decrease in the year-to-date period was lower net interest income. 

During the first quarter of 2020, as a result of the deterioration in economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the amount of headroom calculated in our previous annual impairment test for certain reporting units, we determined that an interim goodwill impairment test should be performed for all of our reporting units as of March 31, 2020 and prepared updated cash flow projections for each reporting unit, resulting in a reduction in the long-term forecasts of profitability for both our Retail Banking and Wealth Management and our Private Banking reporting units as compared to the prior year forecasts. We completed our interim impairment test of goodwill utilizing cash flow projections based on these forecasts under a present value approach and, in conjunction with valuation estimates determined under a market approach, concluded that the fair value of our Commercial Banking reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, including goodwill. However, the cash flow projections for our Retail Banking and Wealth Management and our Private Banking reporting units were significantly lower which, in conjunction with valuation estimates under a market approach and in consideration of a challenging macroeconomic outlook, resulted in a fair value that was significantly lower than their book values, including goodwill. As a result, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $784 million &#32;in the first quarter of 2020, representing the entire amount of goodwill previously allocated to these reporting units. Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, our Retail Banking and Wealth Management and our Private Banking reporting units are being reported together within a newly created Wealth and Personal Banking segment for segment reporting purposes. As discussed in our 2019 Form 10-K, our goodwill impairment testing is highly sensitive to certain assumptions and estimates used. We will continue to monitor changes to our business forecasts as we continue to perform periodic analysis of the risks and strategies of our business and product offerings. If further deterioration in economic and credit conditions, a change in the strategy or performance of our business or product offerings, or an increase in the capital requirements of our business occurs, interim goodwill impairment tests could again be required, which may result in an impairment charge. For additional discussion of the results of our interim goodwill impairment testing, see Note 8, "Goodwill," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Our reported results in all periods were impacted by certain items management believes to be significant, which affect comparability between periods. Significant items are excluded to arrive at adjusted performance because management would ordinarily identify and consider them separately to better understand underlying business trends.

Costs to achieve primarily consisted of lease impairment and other related costs, severance costs, allocated costs from HTSU, and trading losses associated with the exit of certain derivative contracts. See Note 2, "Strategic Initiatives," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of these costs. The expense during the six months ended June 30, 2020 &#32;also includes a $9 million &#32;gain on the sale of one of our owned retail branch properties.

Excluding the impact of the items in the table above, our adjusted performance during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 &#32;decreased $67 million &#32;and $766 million &#32;compared with prior year periods due primarily to a higher provision for credit losses 

HSBC USA Inc. 

driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and, in the year-to-date period, lower net interest income. These decreases were partially offset by lower operating expenses. 

See "Results of Operations" for a more detailed discussion of our operating trends. In addition, see "Balance Sheet Review" for further discussion on our asset and liability trends, "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for further discussion on funding and capital and "Credit Quality" for additional discussion on our credit trends. 

London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") Transition &#32;&#32;Regulators and central banks in various national jurisdictions continue to actively work to help transition from interbank offered rates ("IBORs") to acceptable alternative rates, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") recommended by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee ("ARRC") convened by the FRB. In March 2020, the FASB issued changes to the U.S. GAAP guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens associated with this transition. Under the new guidance, an entity can elect by accounting topic or industry subtopic to account for the modification of a contract affected by reference rate reform as a continuation of the existing contract, if certain conditions are met. In addition, the new guidance allows an entity to elect on a hedge-by-hedge basis to continue to apply hedge accounting for hedging relationships in which the critical terms change due to reference rate reform, if certain conditions are met. 

We have a considerable number of contracts referencing IBORs, primarily LIBOR, such as loans, derivatives and long-term debt, extending past 2021 when the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority has announced it will no longer require banks to submit rates for LIBOR. We continue to actively participate in HSBC's global transition program with the objective of facilitating an orderly transition of all products, processes, models and curves, as well as all legacy LIBOR contracts, onto replacement rates. In particular, during the first half of 2020, we: 

&#8226; 

implemented risk disclosures for new sales of LIBOR-based products across all of our business lines; 

&#8226; 

incorporated the new fallback language recommended by the ARRC into new LIBOR-based contracts for adjustable rate mortgage loans; and 

&#8226; 

sold substantially all of our LIBOR-linked variable rate debt securities maturing beyond 2021. 

While our global businesses continue to develop their capabilities to offer alternative rate products and the supporting processes and systems, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the speed at which they are able to develop these capabilities and the readiness of our customers to use alternative rate products. Consequently, the sale of LIBOR-based products with maturities beyond 2021 will continue for longer than initially anticipated and is likely to increase the volume of legacy contracts that will need to be transitioned. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has likely affected the pace at which many of our customers will have been preparing to use alternative rate products and therefore also to transition their legacy contracts onto replacement rates. Therefore, we expect the transition of legacy contracts onto replacement rates to occur over a shortened time period. In combination with the greater number of legacy contracts requiring transition, this increases the overall level of execution risk on the transition process, which could potentially increase the level of conduct and operational risks. We are currently targeting to have pricing and data/workflow requirements related to transitioning legacy contracts onto replacement rates finalized in the third quarter of 2020. For further discussion of our LIBOR transition program and the associated risks, see "Executive Overview" in MD&#38;A in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Other COVID-19 Related Developments 

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted economic activity in many countries, including the United States, and the U.S. Government has taken multiple actions to mitigate the magnitude and persistence of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The United States has been operating under a presidentially declared national emergency since March 2020. In March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act"), which provides financial assistance for businesses and individuals and targeted regulatory relief for financial institutions, was signed into law. 

Loan Forbearance Initiatives The CARES Act created a forbearance program for federally-backed mortgage loans and provided financial institutions with the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under U.S. GAAP related to troubled debt restructurings. We have currently not elected this option, because of the accounting treatment otherwise afforded under the interagency statement on short-term loan modifications discussed below. The CARES Act also prohibits servicers of federally-backed mortgage loans from initiating any foreclosure action on any residential property that is not vacant or abandoned for a period of 60 days, beginning on March 18, 2020. This moratorium has been extended until August 31, 2020. In addition to these federal measures, some state governments have taken action to require forbearance with respect to certain loans and fees. We are continuing to monitor federal, state and international regulatory developments in relation to COVID-19 and their potential impact on our operations. 

In April 2020, federal banking regulators issued a revised interagency statement on loan modifications and the reporting for financial institutions working with customers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic ("Interagency Statement"). The Interagency Statement confirmed that COVID-19 related short-term loan modifications (e.g., payment deferrals of six months or less) provided to borrowers that were current (less than 30 days past due) at the time the relief was granted are not troubled debt restructurings

("TDR Loans"). We are applying the guidance in the Interagency Statement. Borrowers that were not current at the time the relief was granted are assessed for TDR Loan classification in accordance with our accounting policies. These loans were not significant at June 30, 2020. 

In addition, under the Interagency Statement, for COVID-19 related loan modifications in the form of a payment deferral, the borrower&#8217;s past due status will not be impacted during the deferral period and, if the loan was accruing at the time the relief was granted, the loan will generally not be placed on nonaccrual status as long as the payment deferral is for six months or less. For consumer loans, when a borrower requests and is provided with extended relief in the form of a payment deferral of more than six months, the loan will generally be placed on nonaccrual status and assessed for TDR Loan classification. Any accrued interest recorded on these loans is generally not reversed against income and will remain recorded as accrued interest receivable. We have not modified our commercial loan nonaccrual policies as a result of this guidance. 

We have implemented various loan modification payment deferral programs to provide borrowers relief from the economic impacts of COVID-19. The following table summarizes information about loans under these programs as of June 30, 2020. Not included in the following table are other forms of relief that we have provided to commercial clients affected by the impact of COVID-19, such as covenant waivers and amendments, and deferrals of financial statement and covenant compliance reporting requirements.

Includes approximately $380 million of commercial loans where the borrowers were provided with extended payment deferral relief of more than six months at June 30, 2020, none of which have been placed on nonaccrual status or classified as TDR Loans. 

(2) &#160; 

Consumer mortgage loans where the borrowers were provided with extended payment deferral relief of more than six months and, as a result, have been placed on nonaccrual status and classified as TDR Loans were not significant at June 30, 2020. 

When the payment relief period ends, we expect to offer borrowers various options, including repaying the deferred payments in full, repaying the deferred payments over an installment period or moving the deferred payments to the end of the loan. Depending on which actions a borrower takes at the end of their relief period, some of these options would result in TDR Loan classification. If a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty when the payment relief period ends, they may enter into a modification program to reduce the interest rate and extend the term of the loan which would result in the loan being classified as a TDR Loan. 

Paycheck Protection Program The CARES Act created a new loan guarantee program entitled the Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP") targeted to provide small businesses with support to cover payroll and certain other expenses. Loans made under the PPP are fully guaranteed by the Small Business Administration ("SBA"), whose guarantee is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. PPP covered loans also afford borrowers forgiveness up to the principal amount of the PPP covered loan, plus accrued interest, if the loan proceeds are used to retain workers and maintain payroll or to make certain mortgage interest, lease and utility payments, and certain other criteria are satisfied. The SBA will reimburse PPP lenders for any amount of a PPP covered loan that is forgiven, and PPP lenders will not be held liable for any representations made by PPP borrowers in connection with their requests for loan forgiveness. Lenders receive pre-determined fees for processing and servicing PPP loans. In addition, PPP loans are risk-weighted at zero percent under the generally-applicable Standardized Approach used to calculate risk-weighted assets for regulatory capital purposes. HSBC Bank USA is a PPP participating lender and had loans funded under the PPP which totaled $1,197 million &#32;at June 30, 2020. In July 2020, the Paycheck Protection Program Extension Act was signed into law, establishing August 8, 2020 as the new deadline to apply for a PPP loan. 

Main Street Lending Program &#32;&#32;In July 2020, the Main Street Lending Program ("MSLP") became fully operational. The MSLP was established by the FRB under the CARES Act to support lending to small and medium-sized businesses that were in sound financial condition before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The MSLP operates under various facilities depending on the 

HSBC USA Inc. 

size and other characteristics of the eligible businesses. The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston has set up a special purpose vehicle which will purchase 95 percent of each MSLP loan that is submitted to the program, provided that the required documentation is complete and the transactions are consistent with the relevant MSLP facility's requirements. As such, MSLP lenders will retain only 5 percent of an MSLP loan. We are evaluating whether we will participate in the MSLP. 

Basis of Reporting 

&#160; 

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"). 

Group Reporting Basis &#32;We report financial information to HSBC in accordance with HSBC Group accounting and reporting policies, which apply International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRSs") as issued by the IASB and endorsed by the EU and, as a result, our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the basis of HSBC Group's accounting and reporting policies ("Group Reporting Basis"). Because operating results on the Group Reporting Basis are used in managing our businesses and rewarding performance of employees, our management also separately monitors profit before tax under this basis of reporting. The following table reconciles our U.S. GAAP versus Group Reporting Basis profit before tax:

The significant differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis as they impact our results are summarized in Note 24, "Business Segments," in our 2019 Form 10-K. In addition, see Note 15, "Business Segments," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of significant changes since December 31, 2019 in the differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis impacting our results. Differences in reported profit before tax in the table above that were individually significant for the periods presented are explained below. 

During the six months ended June 30, 2020, expected credit losses were higher under U.S. GAAP than under the Group Reporting Basis. Under the Group Reporting Basis, a majority of our commercial loans are considered to be in 'stage 1' (which requires a 12-month expected credit losses estimate), while under U.S. GAAP such loans require a lifetime expected credit losses estimate. As a result of the different approaches, the impact of the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a worsening of economic forecasts used to calculate expected credit losses and provisions for downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and loan growth as clients drew on their available lines of credit, was more pronounced under U.S. GAAP. 

During the six months ended June 30, 2020, goodwill impairment charges were lower under the Group Reporting Basis than under U.S. GAAP. Under the Group Reporting Basis, goodwill was amortized until 2005, however goodwill was amortized under U.S. GAAP until 2002, which resulted in a lower carrying amount of goodwill and, therefore, a lower impairment charge under the Group Reporting Basis. 

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , credit loss estimates were higher under U.S. GAAP than under the Group Reporting Basis due primarily to the impact of downgrades in the commercial loan portfolio, which was more pronounced under U.S. GAAP, partially offset by a release in credit loss reserves under U.S. GAAP for risk factors associated with fraud. In addition, expected credit losses under the Group Reporting Basis in the year-to-date period reflect a release in credit loss reserves due to 

HSBC USA Inc. 

the upgrade of a single oil and gas industry client which resulted in reclassification from 'stage 2' (which requires a lifetime expected credit losses estimate) to 'stage 1' (which requires a 12-month expected credit losses estimate). 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates &#160; 

Of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we have identified certain items as critical accounting estimates based on the associated degree of judgment and complexity. See "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" in MD&#38;A in our 2019 Form 10-K for further discussion. 

Determining the allowance for credit losses on loans has historically been identified as a critical accounting estimate. On January 1, 2020, we adopted new accounting guidance which requires entities to estimate and recognize an allowance for lifetime expected credit losses ("lifetime ECL") for loans and other financial assets measured at amortized cost. Previously, an allowance for credit losses on loans was recognized based on probable incurred losses. See Note 6, "Allowance for Credit Losses" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our accounting policies and methodologies for establishing the allowance for credit losses and liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures. 

The accounting estimates relating to the allowance for credit losses remains a "critical accounting estimate" for the following reasons: 

&#8226; 

Changes in the provision for credit losses can materially affect our financial results; 

&#8226; 

Estimates relating to the allowance for credit losses require us to project future borrower performance, including cash flows, delinquencies and charge-offs, along with, when applicable, collateral values, based on a reasonable and supportable forecast period utilizing forward-looking economic scenarios in order to estimate probability of default and loss given default; and 

&#8226; 

The allowance for credit losses is influenced by factors outside of our control such as industry and business trends, geopolitical events and the effects of laws and regulations as well as economic conditions such as trends in housing prices, interest rates, GDP, inflation, energy prices and unemployment; and 

&#8226; 

Judgment is required to determine whether the models used to generate the allowance for credit losses produce an estimate that is sufficient to encompass the current view of lifetime ECL. 

Because our estimates of the allowance for credit losses involve judgment and are influenced by factors outside our control, there is uncertainty inherent in these estimates. Our estimate of lifetime ECL is inherently uncertain because it is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors outside of our control. Changes in such estimates could significantly impact our allowance and provision for credit losses. 

As discussed further in Note 6, "Allowance for Credit Losses," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we use three forward-looking economic scenarios to estimate lifetime ECL. They represent a 'most likely outcome' (the "Central Scenario") and two less likely 'outer' scenarios, referred to as the "Upside scenario" and the "Downside scenario". During the second quarter of 2020, economic conditions remained weak and economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic continued to remain high. Given the high level of economic uncertainty in the current environment, we developed and utilized a fourth scenario for estimating lifetime ECL at June 30, 2020, referred to as the "Alternative Downside scenario", to reflect the possibility that the adverse impact associated with the deterioration in economic conditions could manifest itself over a far longer period of time. Each of the four scenarios were assigned weightings with the majority of the weighting placed on the Central scenario, the second most weighting placed on the Downside scenario and lower equal weights placed on the Upside and Alternative Downside scenarios. This weighting was deemed appropriate for the estimation of lifetime ECL under current conditions. 

As an illustration of the effect of changes in estimates relating to the allowance for credit losses, using a 100 percent weighting for the Alternative Downside scenario instead of using the four weighted scenarios as described above at June 30, 2020 would have resulted in a combined increase to our allowance for credit losses and liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures of approximately $1,040 million. This illustration only represents the effect of changes in the weighting of these scenarios on our existing portfolios and does not consider changes in the allowance related to management judgment that might occur.

Short-Term Investments Short-term investments include cash and due from banks, interest bearing deposits with banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell. Balances may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our liquidity position at the time and our strategy for deploying liquidity. Short-term investments increased compared with December 31, 2019 &#32;due to an increase in overall liquidity driven primarily by higher deposits as we actively raised funds in advance of their usage and our customers increased their demand and savings deposits in response to the economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken by the U.S. Government to provide financial support to households and businesses.

See "Credit Quality" in this MD&#38;A for a discussion of trends in our allowance for credit losses on loans. 

Commercial loans increased compared with December 31, 2019 &#32;due to elevated demand driven by the deterioration in economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic as clients drew on their available lines of credit and we funded new loans largely associated with the Paycheck Protection Program. The increase in commercial non-affiliate loans was primarily in the consumer services, automobiles, retailing, capital goods, and consumer durables and apparel industries, partially offset by a decline in the diversified financials industry. 

Consumer loans increased modestly compared with December 31, 2019 &#32;as higher residential mortgage loans were largely offset by paydowns in credit card receivables due to lower customer spending and changes in underwriting criteria driven by the current economic environment as well as a continued decline in home equity mortgages. The increase in other consumer loans reflects higher personal loans driven by new product promotions.

LTVs for first liens are calculated using the loan balance as of the reporting date. LTVs for second liens are calculated using the loan balance as of the reporting date plus the senior lien amount at origination. Current estimated property values are derived from the property's appraised value at the time of loan origination updated by the change in the Federal Housing Finance Agency's house pricing index ("HPI") at either a Core Based Statistical Area or state level. The estimated value of the homes could differ from actual fair values due to changes in condition of the underlying property, variations in housing 

HSBC USA Inc. 

price changes within metropolitan statistical areas and other factors. As a result, actual property values associated with loans that end in foreclosure may be significantly lower than the estimates used for purposes of this disclosure. 

(2) &#160; 

Current estimated property values are calculated using the most current HPIs available and applied on an individual loan basis, which results in an approximate three month delay in the production of reportable statistics. Therefore, the information in the table above reflects current estimated property values using HPIs at March 31, 2020 &#32;and September 30, 2019, respectively.

Commercial loans held for sale decreased compared with December 31, 2019 . Included in commercial loans held for sale are certain loans that we have elected to designate under the fair value option which consists of loans that we originate in connection with our participation in a number of syndicated credit facilities with the intent of selling them to unaffiliated third parties as well as loans that we purchase from the secondary market and hold as hedges against our exposure to certain total return swaps. The fair value of these loans totaled $45 million &#32;and $178 million &#32;at June 30, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , respectively. Balances will fluctuate from period to period depending on the volume and level of activity. 

Commercial loans held for sale also includes certain loans that we no longer intend to hold for investment and were transferred to held for sale which totaled $58 million &#32;and $34 million &#32;at June 30, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , respectively.

Included in residential mortgage loans held for sale are agency-eligible residential mortgage loans which are originated and held for sale to third parties, currently on a servicing retained basis. Balances will fluctuate from period to period depending on the volume and level of activity. Gains and losses from the sale of these residential mortgage loans are reflected as a component of other income (loss) in the accompanying consolidated statement of income (loss). 

Excluding the commercial loans designated under fair value option discussed above, loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value, with adjustments to fair value being recorded as a valuation allowance through other revenues. The valuation allowance on consumer loans held for sale was $1 million &#32;and $2 million &#32;at June 30, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , respectively. The valuation allowance on commercial loans held for sale was $1 million &#32;and nil &#32;at June 30, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , respectively.

See Note 3, "Trading Assets and Liabilities," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a breakout of trading securities by category. 

Trading securities balances decreased compared with December 31, 2019 &#32;due primarily to decreases in equity and foreign sovereign positions. Trading security positions are held as economic hedges of interest rate, credit and equity derivative products issued to clients of domestic and emerging markets. Balances of securities sold, not yet purchased were lower compared with December 31, 2019 &#32;driven by a decrease in short U.S. Treasury positions related to economic hedges of derivatives in the interest rate trading portfolio. 

Precious metals trading assets increased compared with December 31, 2019 &#32;due primarily to increases in our own gold and silver inventory positions reflecting a redeployment of liquidity in the short term which is economically hedged with derivative positions to protect against changes in market pricing and an increase in positions held as economic hedges for client derivative activity as well as higher spot prices. Payables for precious metals were lower compared with December 31, 2019 &#32;reflecting a decline in borrowing of gold inventory to support client activity levels. Precious metal positions may not represent our net underlying exposure as we may use derivatives contracts to reduce our risk associated with these positions, the fair value of which would appear in derivatives in the table above. 

Derivative asset and liability balances both increased compared with December 31, 2019 &#32;mainly from market movements, partially offset by a reduction in positions driven by the exit of certain derivative contracts as part of our restructuring plan. Market movements resulted in higher valuations of interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity derivatives, partially offset by lower valuations of credit and equity derivatives. 

Securities Securities include securities available-for-sale and securities held-to-maturity, net. Securities balances were higher compared with December 31, 2019 &#32;driven by net purchases of U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed and foreign sovereign securities as part of our continuing strategy to maximize returns while balancing the securities portfolio for risk management purposes and, to a lesser extent, favorable market valuations due to decreasing yields. These increases were partially offset by the sale of $340 million &#32;of LIBOR-linked variable rate securities out of our held-to-maturity portfolio during the second quarter of 2020. See Note 5, "Securities," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 

All Other Assets All other assets includes, among other items, properties and equipment, net and goodwill. All other assets decreased compared with December 31, 2019 &#32;due primarily to a goodwill impairment charge of $784 million &#32;recorded during the first quarter of 2020, representing the entire amount of goodwill previously allocated to our Retail Banking and Wealth Management and our Private Banking reporting units, and lower deferred tax assets. Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, our Retail Banking and Wealth Management and our Private Banking reporting units are being reported together within a newly created Wealth and Personal Banking segment for segment reporting purposes. For additional discussion of the results of our interim goodwill impairment testing, see Note 8, "Goodwill," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. These decreases were partially offset by higher outstanding settlement balances related to security sales and increased investments in Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") stock.

Core deposits, as calculated in accordance with Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council ("FFIEC") guidelines, generally include all domestic demand, money market and other savings accounts, as well as time deposits with balances not exceeding $250,000. 

Total deposits increased compared with December 31, 2019 &#32;as we actively raised funds to support elevated client demand for loans and our customers increased their demand and savings deposits in response to the economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken by the U.S. Government to provide financial support to households and businesses. Also contributing to the increase in deposits was higher deposits from affiliates which reflects $3.0 billion &#32;of long-term debt obligations issued to HSBC North America that were recharacterized as time deposits during the first quarter of 2020 as discussed below. These increases were partially offset by a decline in time deposits due in part to early client withdrawals. 

Short-Term Borrowings Short-term borrowings increased compared with December 31, 2019 &#32;reflecting higher securities sold under repurchase agreements and higher commercial paper outstanding. 

Long-Term Debt Long-term debt decreased compared with December 31, 2019 &#32;as the impact of debt issuances, including increased borrowings from the FHLB, was more than offset by debt retirements, fair value movements on fair value option debt and $3.0 billion &#32;of long-term debt obligations issued to HSBC North America that were recharacterized as time deposits during the first quarter of 2020. See Note 14, "Related Party Transactions," for additional information. Debt issuances during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 &#32;totaled $506 million &#32;and $6,350 million , respectively, of which $31 million &#32;and $4,916 million , respectively, was issued by HSBC Bank USA. 

Incremental issuances from our shelf registration statement with the SEC totaled $1,434 million &#32;of senior structured notes during the six months ended June 30, 2020 . &#32; Total long-term debt outstanding under this shelf was $11,117 million &#32;and $13,295 million &#32;at June 30, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , respectively. 

Incremental issuances from the HSBC Bank USA Global Bank Note Program totaled $166 million &#32;during the six months ended June 30, 2020 . Total debt outstanding under this program was $3,043 million &#32;and $2,908 million &#32;at June 30, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , respectively. 

Borrowings from the FHLB totaled $5,750 million &#32;and $1,000 million &#32;at June 30, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , respectively. 

Interest, Taxes and Other Liabilities Interest, taxes and other liabilities were lower compared with December 31, 2019 &#32;due primarily to lower margin requirements related to futures trading and a decline in accrued interest payable which were partially offset by higher outstanding settlement balances related to security purchases and a higher liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures.

Represents the benefit associated with interest earning assets in excess of interest bearing liabilities. Increased percentages reflect growth in this excess or a higher cost of interest bearing liabilities, while decreased percentages reflect a reduction in this excess or a lower cost of interest bearing liabilities. 

Net interest income was relatively flat during the three months ended June 30, 2020 and decreased in the year-to-date period as the unfavorable net impact of lower market rates and the unfavorable impact of higher average interest bearing liability balances, primarily deposits, was largely offset in the three-month period and partially offset in the year-to-date period by the favorable impact of higher average interest earning asset balances, primarily short-term investments, loans and securities. 

Short-term investments &#32;&#32;Interest income decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 &#32;due to lower yields earned on these balances reflecting the impact of lower market rates, partially offset by higher average balances. 

Trading securities &#32;&#32;Interest income decreased during the three months ended June 30, 2020 due to lower yields reflecting the impact of lower market rates and lower average balances driven by decreases in foreign sovereign and U.S. Treasury positions. In the year-to-date period, interest income was relatively flat as the impact of lower yields was largely offset by higher average balances due primarily to an increase in equity positions. Interest income associated with trading securities was partially offset within trading revenue by the performance of the associated derivatives as discussed further below. 

Securities &#32;&#32;Interest income was lower during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 &#32;due to lower yields reflecting the impact of lower market rates, partially offset by higher average balances. Higher average balances were driven by increases in U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed, U.S. Treasury and foreign sovereign securities, partially offset by a decline in U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities. 

Commercial loans Interest income was lower during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 &#32;due to lower yields reflecting the impact of lower market rates on variable rate loans, partially offset by higher average balances driven by elevated demand as clients drew on their available lines of credit in March during the deterioration in economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant portion of the commercial lines of credit that were drawn in March were repaid during the second quarter of 2020. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Consumer loans &#32;&#32;Interest income decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 &#32;due to lower yields reflecting the impact of lower market rates, partially offset by higher average balances due to growth in residential mortgage loans and credit card receivables. 

Other Lower interest income during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 &#32;was due to lower yields on cash collateral posted reflecting the impact of lower market rates, partially offset by higher average cash collateral balances. 

Deposits &#32;&#32;Interest expense decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 &#32;due to lower rates paid reflecting the impact of lower market rates, partially offset by higher average balances. Higher average balances were due primarily to growth in savings and demand deposits as we actively raised funds to support elevated client demand for loans and our customers increased their deposits in response to the economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken by the U.S. Government to provide financial support to households and businesses. 

Short-term borrowings &#32;&#32;Lower interest expense during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 &#32;was due to lower rates paid reflecting the impact of lower market rates, partially offset by higher average borrowings primarily in securities sold under repurchase agreements. 

Long-term debt &#32;&#32;Interest expense decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 &#32;due to lower rates paid reflecting the impact of lower market rates on variable rate borrowings and lower average borrowings. 

Tax liabilities and other &#32;&#32;Interest expense was lower during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 &#32;driven by lower average borrowings in securities sold, not yet repurchased. 

Provision for Credit Losses As discussed further in Note 21, "New Accounting Pronouncements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, beginning January 1, 2020, the provision for credit losses is recognized based on lifetime ECL for loans, off-balance sheet credit exposures, securities held-to-maturity and certain other financial assets measured at amortized cost, as well as credit losses on securities available-for-sale. Prior to January 1, 2020, the provision for credit losses was recognized based on probable incurred losses for loans only while debt securities were assessed for other-than-temporary impairment and credit loss expense for probable incurred losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures was separately recorded as a component of other expense within operating expenses as discussed below. As a result, current period amounts in the table below are not directly comparable to the prior year period. The following table summarizes the components of the provision for credit losses:

As discussed below, prior to January 1, 2020, credit loss expense for off-balance sheet credit exposures was recorded in other expense. 

Our provision for credit losses increased $173 million &#32;during the three months ended June 30, 2020 due primarily to a higher provision for credit losses on our commercial loan portfolio and, to a lesser extent, a higher provision for credit losses on our consumer loan portfolio, partially offset by a release in the provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures recorded in the second quarter of 2020. In the year-to-date period, our provision for credit losses increased $841 million &#32;due to a higher provision for credit losses on our commercial loan portfolio and, to a lesser extent, a higher provision for credit losses on our consumer loan portfolio as well as a provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures recorded in the first half of 2020. 

The provision for credit losses on our commercial loan portfolio increased $281 million &#32;and $617 million &#32;during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively. The loss provisions in the current year periods were driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts we use for calculating lifetime ECL in 2020 and provisions for downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and risk factors associated with large loan exposures. While a loss provision associated with loan growth as clients drew on their available lines of credit contributed to the loss provision in the 2020 year-to-date period, a significant portion of commercial lines of credit that were drawn in March were repaid during the second quarter of 2020 resulting in a release of credit loss reserves, partially offsetting the loss provision in the three months ended June 30, 2020. In the prior year periods, the loss provisions were driven by downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain client relationships, loan growth and an update to the loss emergence period factors which were partially offset by a release in credit loss reserves for risk factors associated with fraud as well as releases in credit loss reserves due to paydowns. 

The provision for credit losses on our consumer loan portfolio was higher by $10 million &#32;and $128 million &#32;during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively. The loss provisions in the current year periods were driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts we use for calculating lifetime ECL in 2020 and higher dollars of delinquency. Also contributing to the loss provisions in the current year periods was growth in personal loan balances due to new product promotions. While loss provisions were recorded for credit cards in the current year periods, the provision in the second quarter of 2020 was not as significant due to lower customer spending and changes in underwriting criteria driven by the current economic environment which resulted in a decline in credit card balances. In the prior year periods, the loss provisions were due primarily to provisions for credit losses on credit cards reflecting growth in balances due to increased customer activity and new product promotions, including higher dollars of delinquency. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

The provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures reflects a release in credit loss reserves during the three months ended June 30, 2020 as lower outstanding exposure and a lower estimate of expected future draws more than offset the impact of the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic consistent with commercial loans as discussed above. In the year-to-date period, the provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures reflects a loss provision resulting from the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic consistent with commercial loans as discussed above, partially offset by the impact of lower outstanding exposure. 

See "Credit Quality" in this MD&#38;A for additional discussion on the allowance for credit losses and the liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures.

Credit card fees, net Credit card fees, net declined during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 &#32;driven by lower interchange fees due to lower customer spending, partially offset by lower cost estimates associated with our credit rewards program. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Trust and investment management fees Trust and investment management fees increased modestly during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 &#32;due to higher average assets under management. 

Other fees and commissions Other fees and commissions decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 &#32;due primarily to lower fees from loan syndication, loan commitments, wire transfers and other account services. See Note 13, "Fee Income from Contracts with Customers," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information including a summary of the components of other fees and commissions. 

Trading revenue Trading revenue is generated by participation in the foreign exchange, rates, credit, equities and precious metals markets. The following table presents trading revenue by business activity. Not included in the table below is the impact of net interest income associated with trading securities which is an integral part of trading activities' overall performance. Net interest income related to trading activities is recorded in net interest income in the consolidated statement of income (loss).

(2) &#160; 

Derivatives trading revenue in all periods does not reflect associated net interest income as certain derivatives, such as total return swaps, were economically hedged by holding the underlying interest bearing referenced assets. 

Trading revenue increased during the three months ended June 30, 2020 as valuation losses of approximately $70 million that were recorded in March 2020 due to market volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic largely recovered during the second quarter resulting in higher trading revenue primarily in Derivatives and Metals. The recovery of valuation losses in Derivatives was largely attributed to legacy structured credit products. Also contributing to the increase was higher revenue in Metals from a higher redeployment of liquidity to Metals and increased trading activity. These increases were partially offset by lower revenue in Derivatives from emerging markets rate products and $10 million of trading losses recorded during the second quarter of 2020 associated with the exit of certain derivative contracts as part of our restructuring plan as well as lower Balance Sheet Management revenue due to the unfavorable performance of economic hedge positions used to manage interest rate risk. 

In the year-to-date period, trading revenue decreased due primarily to lower Derivatives revenue driven by lower revenue from rate products and interest rate swaps, unfavorable valuation adjustments on legacy structured credit products and $10 million of trading losses recorded during the second quarter of 2020 associated with the exit of certain derivative contracts as part of our restructuring plan. Also contributing to the decrease was lower Balance Sheet Management revenue due to the unfavorable 

HSBC USA Inc. 

performance of economic hedge positions used to manage interest rate risk as well as lower other trading revenue due primarily to unfavorable funding spread adjustments. These decreases were partially offset by higher Foreign Exchange revenue as higher market volatility driven by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in increased trading activity in both emerging markets and G10 currencies, higher revenue from credit derivative products due to increased client activity, and the non-recurrence of a loss of approximately $39 million recorded during the first quarter of 2019 related to the unwind of one of our unconsolidated variable interest entities ("VIEs"). 

Other securities gains, net We maintain securities portfolios as part of our balance sheet diversification and risk management strategies. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , we sold $3,609 million &#32;and $8,239 million , respectively, of primarily U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed and U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities compared with sales of $2,044 million &#32;and $4,189 million &#32;during the prior year periods as part of a continuing strategy to maximize returns while balancing the securities portfolio for risk management purposes. Other securities gains, net increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 &#32;reflecting the impact of higher sales activity compared with 2019. The gross realized gains and losses from sales of securities, which are included as a component of other securities gains, net above, are summarized in Note 4, "Securities," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates &#32;&#32;Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates were lower during the three months ended June 30, 2020 and were relatively flat in the year-to-date period as lower cost reimbursements associated with shared services performed on behalf of other HSBC affiliates, including internal audit, was partially offset in the three-month period and offset in the year-to-date period by higher cost reimbursements associated with trading activities performed on behalf of HSBC Bank plc and higher sales commissions paid by HSBC Bank plc. 

Gain (loss) on instruments designated at fair value and related derivatives We have elected to apply fair value option accounting to certain commercial loans held for sale, certain securities purchased and sold under resale and repurchase agreements, certain of our own fixed-rate debt issuances, all of our hybrid instruments issued, including structured notes and deposits, and, beginning January 1, 2020, certain student loans held for investment. We also use derivatives to economically hedge the interest rate and other risks associated with certain financial assets and liabilities for which fair value option accounting has been elected. Gain (loss) on instruments designated at fair value and related derivatives increased during the three months ended June 30, 2020 attributable primarily to favorable movements related to the economic hedging of interest rate and other risks within our own debt and structured notes. In the year-to-date period, gain (loss) on instruments designated at fair value and related derivatives increased attributable primarily to favorable movements related to the economic hedging of interest rate risk within our own debt, partially offset by unfavorable fair value adjustments on certain commercial loans held for sale which were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. See Note 10, "Fair Value Option," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information including a breakout of these amounts by individual component. 

Other income (loss) &#160; Other income (loss) was lower during the three months ended June 30, 2020 due primarily to higher losses associated with credit default swap protection which largely reflects the hedging of a few client relationships and a valuation loss on a loan held for sale in the current year period. In the year-to-date period, other income (loss) was higher due primarily to a gain in the current year period associated with credit default swap protection which largely reflects the hedging of a few client relationships compared with a loss in the prior year period, as well as miscellaneous gains recorded during the first quarter of 2020, including a $12 million &#32;gain on extinguishment of time deposits reflecting early client withdrawals and a $9 million &#32;gain on the sale of one of our owned retail branch properties. These increases were partially offset by a valuation loss on a loan held for sale in the current year period.

As discussed above, beginning January 1, 2020, credit loss expense for off-balance sheet credit exposures is recorded in the provision for credit losses. 

Salaries and employee benefits Salaries and employee benefits expense decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 &#32;driven by lower incentive compensation expense and lower pension expense, partially offset by higher severance costs. While continued cost management efforts, including targeted staff reductions to optimize staffing and improve efficiency throughout 2019 as well as reductions in staff related to the consolidation of our retail branch network and restructuring plan, resulted in a decline in the average number of personnel, salaries expense was flat as the impact of these reductions was offset by the addition of higher cost personnel associated with growth initiatives in certain businesses. 

Support services from HSBC affiliates Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 &#32;due primarily to lower cost allocations from our technology, risk, compliance and finance support service functions. These decreases were partially offset by higher allocated costs driven by the execution of our restructuring plan, primarily severance costs and, in the year-to-date period, contract cancellation and equipment removal charges associated with the branch exits discussed above. A summary of the services received from various HSBC affiliates is included in Note 14, "Related Party Transactions," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Occupancy expense, net Occupancy expense, net was lower during the three months ended June 30, 2020 due primarily to lower operating lease costs driven by the consolidation of our retail branch network. In the year-to-date period, occupancy expense, net increased due to lease impairment and other related costs of $86 million &#32;recorded during the first half of 2020 related to the consolidation of our retail branch network. See Note 2, "Strategic Initiatives," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

Goodwill impairment Reflects a goodwill impairment charge of $784 million &#32;recorded during the first quarter of 2020, representing the entire amount of goodwill previously allocated to our Retail Banking and Wealth Management and our Private Banking reporting units. Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, our Retail Banking and Wealth Management and our Private Banking reporting units are being reported together within a newly created Wealth and Personal Banking segment for segment reporting purposes. For additional discussion of the results of our interim goodwill impairment testing, see Note 8, "Goodwill," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Other expenses Excluding the impact of off-balance sheet credit reserves recorded in the prior year periods, other expenses remained higher during the three months ended June 30, 2020 and remained lower in the year-to-date period as higher deposit insurance assessment fees were partially offset in the three-month period and more than offset in the year-to-date period by lower marketing expense. Also contributing to the decrease in the year-to-date period was lower losses associated with card fraud. 

Efficiency ratio Our efficiency ratio improved during the three months ended June 30, 2020 due to lower operating expenses and higher other revenues as discussed in detail above. In the year-to-date period, our efficiency ratio increased due primarily to higher operating expenses driven by a goodwill impairment charge recorded during the first quarter of 2020 as discussed in detail above.

For 2020, the amounts include $25 million related to the tax benefit limitation on interim period ordinary losses. 

The provision for income taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2020 has been computed based on tax reporting guidance under ASC 740 for interim period ordinary losses. The year to date tax benefit reported above has been limited to not exceed the anticipated full year tax benefit from the ordinary losses. The provision for income taxes for the three months ended June 30, 2020 represents the difference between the provision for income taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and the three months ended March 31, 2020. All material tax rate adjustment items are disclosed in the reconciliation table above. 

Segment Results &#8211; Group Reporting Basis 

&#160; 

We have four distinct business segments that we utilize for management reporting and analysis purposes, which are aligned with HSBC's global business strategy: Wealth and Personal Banking ("WPB") which was created in the second quarter of 2020 and is discussed further below, Commercial Banking ("CMB"), Global Banking and Markets ("GB&#38;M") and a Corporate Center ("CC"). See Item 1, "Business," in our 2019 Form 10-K for a description of our segments at December 31, 2019, which are based upon our global businesses, including a discussion of the main business activities of the segments and a summary of their products and services. 

We previously announced as part of our Restructuring Plan that we would combine our Retail Banking and Wealth Management ("RBWM") and Private Banking ("PB") businesses to create a single WPB business. During the second quarter of 2020, we implemented a change to our internal management reporting to begin reporting what was historically RBWM and PB together within a newly created WPB segment and, as a result, we have aligned our segment reporting to reflect this change for all periods presented. 

During the second quarter of 2020, we also decided to implement a change to our internal management reporting to begin allocating Balance Sheet Management ("BSM"), which was historically reported within the CC segment, to the WPB, CMB and GB&#38;M businesses to better align the revenue and expense to the businesses generating or utilizing this activity. As a result, we have aligned our segment reporting to reflect this change for all periods presented. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

See Note 15, "Business Segments," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a table that summarizes the impact of these changes on reported segment profit (loss) before tax, total assets and total deposits as of and for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2019. There have been no additional changes in the basis of our segmentation as compared with the presentation in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Net interest income of each segment represents the difference between actual interest earned on assets and interest incurred on liabilities of the segment, adjusted for a funding charge or credit that includes both interest rate and liquidity components. Segments are charged a cost to fund assets (e.g. customer loans) and receive a funding credit for funds provided (e.g. customer deposits) based on equivalent market rates that incorporate both repricing (interest rate risk) and tenor (liquidity) characteristics. The objective of these charges/credits is to transfer interest rate risk to one centralized unit in BSM. BSM income statement and balance sheet results are allocated to each of the global businesses based upon tangible equity levels and levels of any surplus liabilities. 

Certain other revenue and operating expense amounts are also apportioned among the business segments based upon the benefits derived from this activity or the relationship of this activity to other segment activity. These inter-segment transactions have not been eliminated, and we generally account for them as if they were with third parties. 

We report financial information to our parent, HSBC, in accordance with HSBC Group accounting and reporting policies, which apply IFRS issued by the IASB and endorsed by the EU, and, as a result, our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the Group Reporting Basis as operating results are monitored and reviewed, trends are evaluated and decisions about allocating resources, such as employees, are primarily made on this basis. We continue, however, to monitor capital adequacy and report to regulatory agencies on a U.S. GAAP basis. 

There have been no changes in the measurement of segment profit as compared with the presentation in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

The significant differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis as they impact our results are summarized in Note 24, "Business Segments," in our 2019 Form 10-K. In addition, see Note 15, "Business Segments," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of significant changes since December 31, 2019 in the differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis impacting our results.

Our WPB segment reported a higher loss before tax during the three months ended June 30, 2020 due primarily to lower net interest income and higher expected credit losses, partially offset by lower operating expenses. In the year-to-date period, our WPB segment reported a higher loss before tax due to higher operating expenses driven by a goodwill impairment charge of $693 million recorded during the first quarter of 2020, representing the entire amount of remaining goodwill previously recorded, as well as higher expected credit losses, lower net interest income and lower other operating income. See Note 8, "Goodwill," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the factors which led to the impairment. 

Net interest income decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 &#32;due primarily to lower deposit spreads reflecting the impact of lower market rates, partially offset by improved loan spreads and higher loan balances in residential mortgages and credit cards. 

Other operating income decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 &#32;driven by lower credit card fees due to lower customer spending and, in the year-to-date period, a loss of $7 million recorded during the first quarter of 2020 related to extending the maturity of the total return swap position used to economically hedge the periodic payments made under the swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of Visa Inc. Class B common shares. 

Expected credit losses were higher during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 &#32;driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts used for calculating ECL and higher dollars of delinquency. Also contributing to the increases was growth in personal loan balances due to new product promotions. While ECL in credit cards was higher and contributed to the increase in the year-to-date period, lower customer spending and changes in underwriting criteria driven by the current economic environment resulted in a decline in credit card balances and lower ECL in the three-month period. 

Excluding the goodwill impairment as discussed above, operating expenses decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 &#32;due to lower marketing expense, lower incentive compensation expense, lower cost allocations from our technology and risk support service functions and, in the year-to-date period, lower losses associated with card fraud. These decreases were partially offset by higher severance costs and higher deposit insurance assessment fees.

Our CMB segment reported a loss before tax during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 &#32;compared with a profit before tax in the prior year periods due primarily to higher expected credit losses and, to a lesser extent, lower other operating income. 

Net interest income was relatively flat during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 &#32;as the favorable impact of higher loan and deposit balances was partially offset in the year-to-date period and more than offset in the three-month period by lower deposit spreads reflecting the impact of lower market rates, lower loan spreads reflecting compression and higher liquidity recharges. 

Other operating income decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 &#32;due primarily to a loss on sale of a loan and lower fees from loan commitments. 

Expected credit losses were higher during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 &#32;driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts used for calculating ECL and higher loss estimates for downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients. Also contributing to the increase in the year-to-date period was a higher loss estimate for loan growth as clients drew on their available lines of credit. 

Operating expenses were relatively flat during the three months ended June 30, 2020 as lower incentive compensation expense, lower marketing expense and lower cost allocations from our technology and finance support service functions was largely offset by higher deposit insurance assessment fees. In the year-to-date period, operating expenses increased as lower incentive compensation expense and lower marketing expense was more than offset by higher deposit insurance assessment fees and higher cost allocations from our compliance support service function.

Beginning in June 2020, we changed our presentation for issuer services revenue that was previously reported in Securities Services and began reporting this revenue in Global Banking. As a result, we have reclassified $9 million and $18 million of operating income from Securities Services to Global Banking during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, to conform to the current year presentation. 

(3) &#160; 

Includes cost reimbursements associated with activities performed on behalf of other HSBC affiliates, allocated BSM revenue and certain corporate funding charges not assigned to products. 

Our GB&#38;M segment reported a higher profit before tax during the three months ended June 30, 2020 due to higher other operating income and lower operating expenses, partially offset by lower net interest income and higher expected losses. In the year-to-date period, our GB&#38;M segment reported a lower profit before tax due to higher expected credit losses and lower net interest income, partially offset by higher other operating income and lower operating expenses. 

Credit revenue was relatively flat during the three months ended June 30, 2020 and decreased in the year-to-date period due to lower revenue from structuring and collateralized financing related activity. 

Rates revenue increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 &#32;due to higher revenue from emerging markets rate products and interest rate swaps, partially offset by $10 million of trading losses recorded during the second quarter of 2020 associated with the exit of certain derivative contracts as part of our restructuring plan. In addition, while hedging activities resulted in higher revenue and contributed to the increase in the three-month period, they resulted in lower revenue and partially offset the increase in the year-to-date period. 

Foreign Exchange and Metals revenue increased during the three months ended June 30, 2020 due primarily to higher Metals revenue as valuation losses that were recorded in March 2020 due to market volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic largely recovered during the second quarter. In the year-to-date period, Foreign Exchange and Metals revenue increased due to higher Foreign Exchange revenue as market volatility driven by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in increased trading activity in both emerging market and G10 currencies. Also contributing to the increase in both periods was higher revenue in Metals from a higher redeployment of liquidity to Metals and increased trading activity. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Equities revenue was relatively flat during the three months ended June 30, 2020 and increased in the year-to-date period due to increased client activity in prime brokerage. 

Global Banking revenue decreased during the three months ended June 30, 2020 due primarily to lower net interest income from spread compression, lower fees from loan syndication and loan commitments and higher losses associated with credit default swap protection which largely reflects the hedging of a few client relationships. In the year to date period, Global Banking revenue decreased due primarily to lower net interest income from spread compression and lower fees from loan syndication and loan commitments, partially offset by a gain in the current year period associated with credit default swap protection which largely reflects the hedging of a few client relationships compared with a loss in the prior year period. 

Global Liquidity and Cash Management revenue decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 &#32;due to lower net interest income driven by lower deposit spreads reflecting the impact of lower market rates, partially offset by higher deposit balances. 

Securities Services revenue was relatively flat during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 . 

Global Trade and Receivables Finance revenue was higher during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 &#32;due to higher fees from standby letters of credit. 

Credit and funding valuation adjustments resulted in gains during the three months ended June 30, 2020 as valuation losses recovered as market volatility improved during the second quarter. In the year-to-date period, credit and funding valuation adjustments resulted in losses attributable primarily to unfavorable credit valuation adjustments on derivative assets due to deteriorating credit spreads driven by market volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the impact of lower market rates. In the prior year periods, credit and funding valuation adjustments resulted in gains attributable primarily to favorable movements in our own credit spreads within our derivative liability balances. 

Other revenue was relatively flat during the three months ended June 30, 2020 and decreased in the year-to-date period due to higher liquidity charges, lower cost reimbursements and lower allocated BSM revenue which were partially offset by lower corporate funding charges. 

Expected credit losses were higher during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 &#32;driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts used for calculating ECL and higher loss estimates for risk factors associated with oil and gas industry loan exposures and downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients. 

Operating expenses were lower during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 &#32;due to lower incentive compensation expense and lower cost allocations from our technology, finance, legal, risk and compliance support service functions, partially offset by higher severance costs and higher deposit insurance assessment fees.

Our CC segment reported a profit before tax during the three months ended June 30, 2020 compared with a loss before tax in the prior year period due to higher other operating income and lower net interest expense, partially offset by higher operating expenses. In the year-to-date period, our CC segment reported a higher loss before tax due to higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher other operating income and lower net interest expense. 

Net interest expense was lower during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 &#32;driven by improved net interest income from legacy structured credit products and lower retained liquidity charges. 

Other operating income increased during the three months ended June 30, 2020 due to favorable valuation adjustments on legacy structured credit products as valuation losses that were recorded in March 2020 due to market volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic largely recovered during the second quarter as well as favorable movements related to the economic hedging of interest rate risk within our own debt. In the year-to-date period, other operating income was higher due to favorable movements related to the economic hedging of interest rate risk within our own debt, the non-recurrence of a loss of approximately $39 million &#32;recorded during the first quarter of 2019 related to the unwind of one of our unconsolidated VIEs and, in the year-to-date period, 

HSBC USA Inc. 

a $9 million gain recorded during the first quarter of 2020 on the sale of one of our owned retail branch properties. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable valuation adjustments on legacy structured credit products. 

Operating expenses were higher during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 &#32;due to higher allocated costs driven by the execution of our restructuring plan, primarily severance costs and, in the year-to-date period, contract cancellation and equipment removal charges associated with the branch exits. The increase in the year-to-date period also reflects costs recorded during the first quarter of 2020 related to the consolidation of our retail branch network, including lease impairment and other related costs of $97 million . These increases in both periods were partially offset by lower cost allocations from our technology, risk, compliance and finance support service functions. 

Reconciliation of Segment Results As previously discussed, segment results are reported on a Group Reporting Basis. See Note 24, "Business Segments," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of our Group Reporting Basis segment results to U.S. GAAP consolidated totals. 

Credit Quality &#160; 

In the normal course of business, we enter into a variety of transactions that involve both on and off-balance sheet credit risk. Principal among these activities is lending to various commercial, institutional, governmental and individual customers. We participate in lending activity throughout the United States and, on a limited basis, internationally. 

COVID-19 Loan Forbearance Initiatives &#32;&#32; We have implemented various loan modification payment deferral programs to provide borrowers relief from the economic impacts of COVID-19. Substantially all of the loans under these programs are not classified as TDR Loans at June 30, 2020 due to their short-term nature as discussed under the Interagency Statement. In addition, under the Interagency Statement, for COVID-19 related loan modifications in the form of a payment deferral, the borrower&#8217;s past due status will not be impacted during the deferral period and, if the loan was accruing at the time the relief was granted, the loan will generally not be placed on nonaccrual status as long as the payment deferral is for six months or less. For consumer loans, when a borrower requests and is provided with extended relief in the form of a payment deferral of more than six months, the loan will generally be placed on nonaccrual status and assessed for TDR Loan classification. We have not modified our commercial loan nonaccrual policies as a result of this guidance. See "Executive Overview," in this MD&#38;A for additional information. 

Allowance for Credit Losses / Liability for Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures As discussed further in Note 21, "New Accounting Pronouncements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, beginning January 1, 2020, an allowance for credit losses is recognized based on lifetime ECL for loans, securities held-to-maturity and certain other financial assets measured at amortized cost, and an allowance for credit losses is also recognized for securities available-for-sale. Prior to January 1, 2020, an allowance for credit losses was recognized based on probable incurred losses for loans only while debt securities were assessed for other-than-temporary impairment. In addition, beginning January 1, 2020, the liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures is recognized based on lifetime ECL while, prior to January 1, 2020, it was recognized based on probable incurred losses. The new guidance also requires inclusion of expected recoveries of amounts previously written off, limited to the cumulative amount of prior write-offs, when estimating the allowance for credit losses for in scope financial assets (including collateral-dependent assets). Prior to January 1, 2020, these expected recoveries were not recognized. See Note 6, "Allowance for Credit Losses," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our accounting policies and methodologies used to estimate ECL beginning in 2020. There have been no additional significant changes to our policies or methodologies during the first half of 2020. 

&#160; Our accounting policies and methodologies related to the allowance for credit losses and liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures in prior periods are presented under the caption "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" in MD&#38;A and in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements," in our 2019 Form 10-K. Our approach toward credit risk management is summarized under the caption "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Comparative credit information at January 1, 2020, reflecting the adoption of the new accounting guidance, has been included in the tables below where available. Comparative credit information at December 31, 2019, which is not comparable as it does not reflect the adoption of the new accounting guidance, has been retained as previously reported.

See Note 21, "New Accounting Pronouncements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the changes in our allowance for credit losses and liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures at January 1, 2020 as compared with December 31, 2019. 

The total allowance for credit losses at June 30, 2020 &#32;increased $261 million &#32;or 28 percent &#32;as compared with March 31, 2020 &#32;and increased $726 million &#32;or 153 percent &#32;as compared with January 1, 2020 due primarily to higher loss estimates on our commercial loan portfolio and, to a lesser extent, higher loss estimates on our consumer loan portfolio. 

Our commercial allowance for credit losses at June 30, 2020 &#32;increased $256 million &#32;or 35 percent &#32;as compared with March 31, 2020 &#32;and increased $602 million &#32;or 158 percent &#32;as compared with January 1, 2020 driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts we use for calculating lifetime ECL in 2020 and higher loss estimates for downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and risk factors associated with large loan exposures. While higher loss estimates associated with loan growth as clients drew on their available lines of credit contributed to the increase as compared with January 1, 2020, a significant portion of commercial lines of credit that were drawn in March were repaid during the second quarter of 2020 resulting in a release of credit loss reserves, partially offsetting the increase as compared with March 31, 2020. 

Our consumer allowance for credit losses at June 30, 2020 &#32;increased $5 million &#32;or 2 percent &#32;as compared with March 31, 2020 &#32;and increased $123 million &#32;or 143 percent &#32;as compared with January 1, 2020 driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts we use for calculating lifetime ECL in 2020 and higher dollars of delinquency. Also contributing to the increases was a higher allowance for credit losses on other consumer loans reflecting growth in personal loan balances due to new product promotion. While a higher allowance for credit losses on credit cards contributed to the increase as compared with January 1, 2020, lower customer spending and changes in underwriting criteria driven by the current economic environment resulted in a decline in credit card balances and a lower allowance for credit losses on credit cards as compared with March 31, 2020. 

The liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures at June 30, 2020 &#32;decreased $118 million &#32;or 32 percent &#32;as compared with March 31, 2020 &#32;as a lower estimate of expected future draws more than offset the impact of the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic consistent with commercial loans as discussed above. As compared with January 1, 2020, the liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures increased $95 million &#32;or 60 percent &#32;resulting from the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic consistent with commercial loans as discussed above, partially offset by the impact of lower outstanding exposure.

Ratios exclude loans held for sale as these loans are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. 

(2) &#160; 

Ratios at June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020 reflect year-to-date net charge-offs, annualized. Ratios at January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2019 reflect full year net charge-offs for 2019. 

(3) &#160; 

Our commercial net charge-off coverage ratio for the year-to-date periods ended June 30, 2020 &#32;and March 31, 2020 &#32;and year ended December 31, 2019 &#32;was 71 months, 75 months and 135 months, respectively. The net charge-off coverage ratio represents the commercial allowance for credit losses at period end 

HSBC USA Inc. 

divided by average monthly commercial net charge-offs during the period. Our commercial net charge-off coverage ratio for January 1, 2020, calculated by dividing the commercial allowance for credit losses at January 1, 2019 by average monthly commercial net charge-offs during 2019, was 102 months. 

(4) &#160; 

Represents our commercial and consumer allowance for credit losses, as appropriate, divided by the corresponding outstanding balance of total nonperforming loans held for investment. Nonperforming loans include accruing loans contractually past due 90 days or more. 

See Note 6, "Allowance for Credit Losses," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a rollforward of credit losses by general loan categories for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 &#32;and 2019 . 

The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment at June 30, 2020 &#32;increased as compared with March 31, 2020 &#32;due to the increase in our allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above and a decrease in total loans held for investment driven primarily by lower commercial loans as a significant portion of commercial lines of credit that were drawn in March were repaid during the second quarter of 2020. As compared with January 1, 2020, the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment increased as the increase in our allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above outpaced an increase in total loans held for investment driven primarily by higher commercial loans. 

The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of net charge-offs at June 30, 2020 &#32;was relatively flat as compared with both March 31, 2020 &#32;and January 1, 2020 as the increase in our allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above was offset by an increase in dollars of net charge-offs driven by higher charge-offs in our commercial loan portfolio and, to a lesser extent, our consumer loan portfolio. 

The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans held for investment at June 30, 2020 &#32;decreased as compared with March 31, 2020 &#32;as an increase in nonperforming loans driven by higher nonperforming loans in our commercial loan portfolio, and to a lesser extent, our consumer loan portfolio outpaced the increase in our allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above. As compared with January 1, 2020, the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans held for investment increased as the increase in our allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above outpaced an increase in nonperforming loans driven by higher nonperforming loans in our commercial loan portfolio, and to a lesser extent, our consumer loan portfolio.

Compared with March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , our two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio increased 16 basis points and 7 &#32;basis points, respectively, due primarily to higher dollars of delinquency in our consumer loan portfolio. While dollars of delinquency in our commercial loan portfolio were higher and contributed to the increase compared with March 31, 2020, they were relatively flat compared with December 31, 2019. 

Our commercial loan two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio increased 4 basis points compared with March 31, 2020 &#32;and was flat compared with December 31, 2019 . The increase compared with March 31, 2020 was due primarily to higher dollars 

HSBC USA Inc. 

of delinquency driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and, to a lesser extent, lower outstanding loan balances as a significant portion of lines of credit that were drawn in March were repaid during the second quarter of 2020. 

Compared with March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , our consumer loan two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio increased 23 basis points and 32 &#32;basis points, respectively, due primarily to higher dollars of delinquency in residential mortgages driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic as some customers did not seek forbearance relief or became 60 days delinquent prior to seeking forbearance relief.

Our net charge-off ratio as a percentage of average loans increased 30 basis points and 24 basis points during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , respectively, due primarily to higher levels of net charge-offs in our commercial loan portfolio driven by the deterioration of two corporate banking loans and, in the year-to-date period, the sale of a global banking loan during the first quarter of 2020. Also contributing to the increases was higher levels of net charge-offs in our consumer loan portfolio due primarily to higher charge-offs in credit cards reflecting growth in average balances due to increased customer activity and product promotions.

See Note 5, "Loans," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a breakout of nonaccrual loans and accruing loans contractually 90 days or more past due. At June 30, 2020 , March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , total nonperforming loans include $34 million , $32 million and $30 million , respectively, of accruing loans contractually 90 days or more past due, primarily credit cards. 

(2) &#160; 

At June 30, 2020 , March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , nonperforming consumer mortgage loans include $293 million , $286 million and $289 million &#32;respectively, of loans that are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell. 

(3) &#160; 

Nonperforming consumer mortgage loans held for investment include all loans which are 90 or more days contractually delinquent as well as loans discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not re-affirmed and second lien loans where the first lien loan that we own or service is 90 or more days contractually delinquent. 

(4) &#160; 

Nonperforming consumer mortgage loans for all periods does not include guaranteed loans purchased from the Government National Mortgage Association. Repayment of these loans is predominantly insured by the Federal Housing Administration and as such, these loans have different risk characteristics from the rest of our customer loan portfolio. 

(5) &#160; 

Includes $1 million or less of commercial other real estate owned at June 30, 2020 , March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 . 

Our nonperforming loan ratio increased 74 basis points and 58 basis points compared with March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , respectively, due primarily to higher nonperforming loans driven by higher nonperforming loans in our commercial loan portfolio, and to a lesser extent, our consumer loan portfolio. 

Compared with March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , our commercial nonperforming loan ratio increased 84 basis points and 77 basis points, respectively, due primarily to higher nonperforming loans reflecting downgrades driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. While outstanding loan balances were lower as a significant portion of lines of credit that were drawn in March were repaid during the second quarter of 2020 and contributed to the increase compared with March 31, 2020, they were higher and partially offset the increase compared with December 31, 2019. 

Our consumer nonperforming loan ratio increased 28 basis points and 18 basis points compared with March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , respectively, due primarily to higher nonperforming loans in residential mortgages driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic as some customers did not seek forbearance relief or were placed on nonaccrual status prior to seeking forbearance relief. 

Our policies and practices for problem loan management and placing loans on nonaccrual status are summarized in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements," in our 2019 Form 10-K, as updated for COVID-19 related loan modifications in Note 5, "Loans," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Concentration of Credit Risk A concentration of credit risk is defined as a significant credit exposure with an individual or group engaged in similar activities or affected similarly by economic conditions. We enter into a variety of transactions in the normal course of business that involve both on and off-balance sheet credit risk. Principal among these activities is lending to various commercial, institutional, governmental and individual customers throughout the United States and internationally. We manage the varying degrees of credit risk associated with on and off-balance sheet transactions through specific credit policies and procedures which provide for a strict approval, monitoring and reporting process. It is our policy to require collateral when it is deemed appropriate. Varying degrees and types of collateral are secured depending upon management's credit evaluation. 

Our consumer loan portfolio includes the following types of loans: 

&#8226; 

Interest-only loans &#8211; A loan which allows a customer to pay the interest-only portion of the monthly payment for a period of time which results in lower payments during the initial loan period. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

&#8226; 

Adjustable rate mortgage ("ARM") loans &#8211; A loan which allows us to adjust pricing on the loan in line with market movements. 

The following table summarizes the balances of interest-only and ARM loans in our loan portfolios at June 30, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 . Each category is not mutually exclusive and loans may appear in more than one category below.

HSBC USA Inc. 

Credit Risks Associated with Derivative Contracts Credit risk associated with derivatives is measured as the net replacement cost of derivative contracts in a receivable position in the event the counterparties of such contracts fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. In managing derivative credit risk, both the current exposure, which is the replacement cost of contracts on the measurement date, as well as an estimate of the potential change in value of contracts over their remaining lives are considered. Counterparties to our derivative activities include financial institutions, central clearing parties, foreign and domestic government agencies, corporations, funds (mutual funds, hedge funds, etc.), insurance companies and private clients as well as other HSBC entities. These counterparties are subject to regular credit review by the credit risk management department. To minimize credit risk, we may enter into legally enforceable master netting agreements which reduce risk by permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon occurrence of certain events. In addition, we reduce credit risk by obtaining collateral from counterparties. The determination of the need for and the levels of collateral will differ based on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty and/or regulatory requirements. 

The total risk in a derivative contract is a function of a number of variables, such as: 

&#8226; 

volatility of interest rates, currencies, equity or corporate reference entity used as the basis for determining contract payments; 

&#8226; 

current market events or trends; 

&#8226; 

country risk; 

&#8226; 

maturity and liquidity of contracts; 

&#8226; 

creditworthiness of the counterparties in the transaction; 

&#8226; 

the existence of a master netting agreement among the counterparties; and 

&#8226; 

existence and value of collateral received from counterparties to secure exposures. 

The table below presents total credit risk exposure calculated using the general risk-based capital rules of the Basel III Standardized Approach which includes the net positive mark-to-market of the derivative contracts plus any adjusted potential future exposure as measured in reference to the notional amount. The regulatory capital rules recognize that bilateral netting agreements reduce credit risk and, therefore, allow for reductions of risk-weighted assets when netting requirements have been met and collateral exists. As a result, risk-weighted amounts for regulatory capital purposes are a portion of the original gross exposures. Furthermore, many contracts contain provisions that allow us to close out the transaction if the counterparty fails to post required collateral. In addition, many contracts give us the right to break the transactions earlier than the final maturity date. As a result, these contracts have potential future exposures that are often much smaller than the future exposures derived from the regulatory capital rules.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

&#160; 

Effective liquidity management is defined as ensuring we can meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities/withdrawals and other cash commitments efficiently under both normal operating conditions and under unpredictable circumstances of industry or market stress. To achieve this objective, we have guidelines that require sufficient liquidity to cover potential funding requirements and to avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. Guidelines are set for the consolidated balance sheet of HSBC USA to ensure that it is a source of strength for our regulated, deposit-taking banking subsidiary, as well as to address the more limited sources of liquidity available to it as a holding company. Similar guidelines are set for HSBC Bank USA to ensure that it can meet its liquidity needs in various stress scenarios. Cash flow analysis, including stress testing scenarios, forms the basis for liquidity management and contingency funding plans. 

During the first half of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused disruption to the financial markets as well as business and economic activity. We continue to actively monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk in accordance with HSBC policy. See "Risk Management" in this MD&#38;A for further discussion of our approach towards liquidity and funding risk management, including information regarding the key measures employed to define, monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk. To date, we have not experienced any significant impact to our liquidity or funding capabilities as a result of this disruption. While there was elevated commercial loan demand in March as clients drew on their available lines of credit during the deterioration in economic conditions, 

HSBC USA Inc. 

we actively raised deposits, short-term borrowings in the form of securities sold under repurchase agreements, and borrowed from the FHLB in order to support the elevated client demand for loans while maintaining adequate liquidity and increasing cash. In addition, a significant portion of the commercial lines of credit that were drawn in March were repaid during the second quarter of 2020. We continuously monitor the impact of market events on our liquidity positions and will continue to adapt our framework as necessary to reflect market events. 

Interest Bearing Deposits with Banks totaled $17,734 million &#32;and $2,038 million &#32;at June 30, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , respectively, of which $17,440 million &#32;and $1,801 million , respectively, were held with the Federal Reserve Bank. Balances may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our liquidity position at the time and our strategy for deploying liquidity. Surplus interest bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank may be deployed into securities purchased under agreements to resell or other investments depending on market conditions and the opportunity to maximize returns. 

Federal Funds Sold and Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell totaled $29,255 million &#32;and $17,838 million &#32;at June 30, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , respectively. Balances may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our liquidity position at the time and our strategy for deploying liquidity. 

Trading Assets includes securities totaling $18,987 million &#32;and $23,488 million &#32;at June 30, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , respectively. See "Balance Sheet Review" in this MD&#38;A for further analysis and discussion on trends. 

Securities includes securities available-for-sale and securities held-to-maturity totaling $53,303 million &#32;and $48,956 million &#32;at June 30, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , respectively. See "Balance Sheet Review" in this MD&#38;A for further analysis and discussion on trends. 

Short-Term Borrowings totaled $6,102 million &#32;and $3,659 million &#32;at June 30, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , respectively. See "Balance Sheet Review" in this MD&#38;A for further analysis and discussion on short-term borrowing trends. 

Deposits totaled $156,033 million &#32;and $119,693 million &#32;at June 30, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , respectively, which included $128,198 million &#32;and $95,253 million , respectively, of core deposits as calculated in accordance with FFIEC guidelines. See "Balance Sheet Review" in this MD&#38;A for further analysis and discussion on deposit trends.

Under our shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, we may issue certain securities including debt securities and preferred stock. We satisfy the eligibility requirements for designation as a "well-known seasoned issuer," which allows us to file a registration statement that does not have a limit on issuance capacity. The ability to issue under the registration statement is limited by the authority granted by the Board of Directors. During the first half of 2020, due to an anticipated decrease in utilization of the shelf registration statement, the Board of Directors approved a reduction in the amount we are authorized to issue from $30,000 million at December 31, 2019 to $25,000 million , of which $13,883 million &#32;was available at June 30, 2020 . HSBC Bank USA has a $40,000 million &#32;Global Bank Note Program that provides for the issuance of subordinated and senior notes, of which $13,127 million &#32;was available at June 30, 2020 . We anticipate using the Global Bank Note Program more in the future as part of our efforts designed to minimize overall funding costs while accessing diverse funding channels. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

As a member of the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, we have secured borrowing facilities which are collateralized by loans and investment securities. At June 30, 2020 , long-term debt included $5,750 million &#32;of borrowings from the FHLB facility. Based upon the amounts pledged as collateral under these facilities, we have additional borrowing capacity of up to $8,448 million . 

Preferred Equity See Note 18, "Preferred Stock," in our 2019 Form 10-K for information regarding all outstanding preferred share issues. 

Common Equity During the six months ended June 30, 2020 , HSBC USA did not receive any cash capital contributions from its parent, HSBC North America, and did not make any capital contributions to its subsidiary, HSBC Bank USA. 

Capital Ratios In managing capital, we develop targets for common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, total capital to risk-weighted assets, Tier 1 capital to adjusted quarterly average assets (i.e., the "Tier 1 leverage ratio") and Tier 1 capital to total leverage exposure (i.e., the "supplementary leverage ratio" or "SLR"). Capital targets are reviewed at least semi-annually to ensure they reflect our business mix and risk profile, as well as real-time conditions and circumstances. The following table summarizes HSBC USA's Basel III capital ratios calculated as of June 30, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 :

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule that provides the option to transition in the regulatory capital impacts of the new current expected credit loss accounting standard over a five-year period. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA have elected the five-year transition option and, as a result, beginning in 2020, our capital ratios are reported in accordance with the transition rules in the interim final rule. Accordingly, during 2020 and 2021, we will exclude from regulatory capital the change in retained earnings resulting from adoption of the new accounting standard on January 1, 2020 as well as 25 percent of the change in the allowance for credit losses recognized between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021. Beginning January 1, 2022, the excluded impacts will be phased in to regulatory capital over a three-year transition period and will be fully reflected at January 1, 2025. 

In addition, in April 2020, the FRB issued an interim final rule adopting a temporary change to the calculation of the SLR that permits bank holding companies such as HSBC North America and HSBC USA, to exclude U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from the denominator of their SLR. This change, which took effect April 1, 2020, will remain in place until March 31, 2021 and is designed to allow banking institutions to expand their balance sheets to accommodate increased customer deposits while continuing to provide credit to companies and households. In May 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule that permits depository institutions such as HSBC Bank USA to exclude U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from the denominator of their SLR. This change took effect June 1, 2020 and will remain in place until March 31, 2021. 

We manage capital in accordance with HSBC Group policy. The HSBC North America Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ("ICAAP") works in conjunction with the HSBC Group's ICAAP. The HSBC North America ICAAP applies to HSBC Bank USA and evaluates regulatory capital adequacy and capital adequacy under various stress scenarios. Our approach is to meet our capital needs for these stress scenarios locally through activities which reduce risk. To the extent that local alternatives are insufficient, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC, we would seek support from our ultimate parent. Regulatory capital requirements are based on the amount of capital required to be held, plus applicable capital buffers, as defined by regulations, and the amount of risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure, also calculated based on regulatory definitions. 

We are subject to regulatory capital rules issued by U.S. banking regulators including Basel III (the "Basel III rule"). Under the Basel III rule, there are two methods available to calculate risk-weighted assets, the generally-applicable Standardized Approach and the Advanced Approaches, which are required in addition to the Standardized Approach for large banking organizations that meet certain thresholds. In 2019, the FRB and the other federal banking agencies jointly finalized rules to implement the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act ("Relief Act") that tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards for large bank holding companies ("BHCs") and foreign banking organizations (the "Tailoring Rules"). The Tailoring Rules assign each BHC and IHC with $50 billion or more in total U.S. assets into one of five classifications (Categories I through 

HSBC USA Inc. 

IV, and 'other firms') based on its size and four risk-based indicators. Under the Tailoring Rules, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA are subject to Category III standards beginning January 1, 2020 and are no longer considered "Advanced Approaches banking organizations." However, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA remain subject to certain other capital requirements that were previously applicable only to Advanced Approaches banking organizations, including the SLR and the countercyclical capital buffer. Prior to adoption of the Tailoring Rules, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA had requested and received regulatory approval to opt out of the Advanced Approaches and therefore have previously calculated and will continue to calculate their risk-based capital requirements for credit risk solely under the Standardized Approach. The Tailoring Rules also permit Category III firms and their depository institution subsidiaries to opt-out of the requirement to recognize most elements of accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") in regulatory capital. As a result, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA, made a one-time election to opt-out of the requirement to include all components of AOCI (with the exception of accumulated net gains and losses on cash flow hedges related to items that are not carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet) in common equity Tier 1 capital, effective beginning with March 31, 2020 reporting. 

Category III firms and their depository institution subsidiaries will also benefit from (i) simpler capital requirements for mortgage servicing assets, certain deferred tax assets, and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions, and (ii) a simplified treatment for the amount of capital issued by consolidated subsidiaries to third parties (generally known as minority interests) which can be included in regulatory capital. These simplifying amendments were adopted in a separate rulemaking finalized by the federal banking agencies in 2019 and became effective beginning April 1, 2020 although firms may choose to apply the simplifications as early as January 1, 2020. As such, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA implemented both the Tailoring Rules and the simplifying amendments beginning with March 31, 2020 reporting. In 2019, the federal banking agencies also jointly amended the Basel III rule to implement a provision of the Relief Act by reducing the risk weighting applicable to high-volatility commercial real estate exposures and also finalized a rule to include a revised standardized approach for measuring counterparty credit risk ("SA-CCR") to calculate total risk-weighted asset amounts for derivative transactions in addition to the existing current exposure method ("CEM"). These changes also became effective beginning April 1, 2020. The Tailoring Rules clarify that Category III firms and their depository institution subsidiaries are not required to use SA-CCR to measure their derivative exposure. Instead, they have the option to use either SA-CCR or CEM for their risk-based capital ratios and the SLR. As such, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA have elected not to use SA-CCR at this time, but will continue to evaluate the impact of adopting SA-CCR in the future. 

For additional discussion of the Basel III final rule requirements, including required minimum capital ratios, as well as further discussion of the Tailoring Rules and other recent regulatory developments and their expected impact see Part I, "Regulation and Competition - Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Requirements," in our 2019 Form 10-K and also below under the caption, "Other Regulatory Developments." We continue to review the composition of our capital structure and capital buffers in light of these developments. 

Capital Planning and Stress Testing &#32;&#32;The FRB requires IHCs and BHCs, including HSBC North America, to comply with the FRB's capital plan rule and CCAR program, as well as the annual supervisory stress tests conducted by the FRB and annual company-run stress tests as required under Dodd-Frank (collectively, "DFAST"), as amended by the Relief Act. Under the Tailoring Rules, HSBC North America as a Category III firm, is no longer subject to a mid-cycle stress testing requirement beginning January 1, 2020 and is now required to disclose its company-run stress test results only every other year. The company-run stress tests are forward looking exercises to assess the impact of hypothetical macroeconomic baseline and severely adverse scenarios provided by the FRB, and internally developed scenarios for the company-run exercises, on the financial condition and capital adequacy of a bank-holding company over a nine quarter planning horizon. 

In March 2020, the FRB adopted a final rule on the stress capital buffer ("SCB") which will, among other things, replace the current fixed 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer with a dynamic, institution-specific risk-based SCB. It is expected that the SCB will vary in size throughout the economic cycle depending on a firm&#8217;s risk exposures and the severity of its stress scenarios. Under the final rule, the SCB would be recalibrated annually based on the sum of: (i) a firm&#8217;s projected losses under the severely adverse scenario in supervisory stress tests and (ii) four quarters of a firm&#8217;s planned future dividends. If HSBC North America's risk-based capital ratios were to fall to levels within the SCB, it would become subject to increasing restrictions on their capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The final rule also eliminates the quantitative objection component of CCAR, and instead relies on the capital rule&#8217;s automatic restrictions on capital distributions that are triggered if a firm breaches its buffer requirements. The SCB will be officially set for each CCAR firm by August 31, 2020 based on 2020 supervisory stress testing results conducted as part of CCAR, and will become effective October 1, 2020. HSBC North America already utilizes an internal capital assessment approach that is analogous to the SCB and will continue to review the composition of its capital structures and capital buffers in light of the final rule. The SCB applies only to HSBC North America; HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA remain subject to a static 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer. 

For further discussion on capital planning and stress testing, including detail regarding the FRB's supervisory assessment as part of the CCAR process, as well as further discussion of the Tailoring Rules and other recent regulatory developments and their 

HSBC USA Inc. 

expected impact see Part I, "Regulation and Competition - Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Requirements," in our 2019 Form 10-K and also below under the caption, "Other Regulatory Developments." 

HSBC North America submitted its latest CCAR capital plan and its latest annual company-run DFAST results in April 2020. In July 2020, HSBC North America publicly disclosed its latest annual DFAST results. In June 2020, the FRB publicly disclosed its own DFAST and CCAR results along with aggregated results of a sensitivity analysis aimed at gauging the ongoing economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on CCAR firms. The FRB also announced it will prohibit stock repurchases by CCAR firms and will require all CCAR firms to limit their common stock dividends to the lesser of (a) the firm's common stock dividends last quarter and (b) the average of the firm's net income for the four proceeding calendar quarters. These restrictions will continue at least through September 30, 2020 and could be extended by the FRB quarter-by-quarter. In addition, each CCAR firm, including HSBC North America, is required to resubmit its capital plan later this year based on additional economic scenarios provided by the FRB. Stress testing results are based solely on hypothetical adverse stress scenarios and should not be viewed or interpreted as forecasts of expected outcomes or capital adequacy or of the actual financial condition of HSBC North America. Capital planning and stress testing for HSBC North America may impact our future capital and liquidity. 

While bank holding company regulatory capital compliance is generally performed at the HSBC North America level, and also separately for HSBC Bank USA, as a bank holding company we are required to meet minimum capital requirements imposed by the FRB. We present our capital ratios, together with HSBC Bank USA's in Note 16, "Retained Earnings and Regulatory Capital Requirements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Other Regulatory Developments 

FRB Liquidity Facilities The FRB announced the creation of several facilities aimed at stabilizing the markets, addressing immediate liquidity concerns, and facilitating lending and other assistance to businesses and individuals affected by shutdowns due to COVID-19. These programs include, among others, the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility and the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility. We have currently not utilized any of these facilities. 

The Volcker Rule The "Volcker Rule" limits the ability of banking entities such as HUSI to sponsor or invest in certain private equity or hedge funds, or engage in certain types of proprietary trading. See Part I, "Regulation and Competition - The "Volcker Rule"," in our 2019 Form 10-K. In June 2020, the five regulatory agencies responsible for implementing the Volcker Rule approved a final rule that makes significant revisions to the "covered funds" provisions of the current implementing regulations. These revisions include (i) new exclusions for credit funds, venture capital funds, family wealth management vehicles, and client facilitation vehicles, and an expanded scope for the public welfare fund exclusion; and (ii) revisions to address practical obstacles to reliance on the existing exclusions for loan securitizations, foreign public funds, and small business investment companies. These amendments to the Volcker Rule will become effective October 1, 2020. We continue to assess the impact of the amendments on our operations. 

Uncleared Swap Margin &#32;&#32;Also in June 2020, the U.S. banking regulators approved a final rule that makes significant amendments to their margin requirements for non-cleared swaps and security-based swaps (together, "swaps") for swap dealers, security-based swap dealers, major swap participants and major security-based swap participants regulated by the agencies ("Swap Entities") (the "Margin Rules"). The final rule (1) mostly exempts Swap Entities from needing to collect initial margin ("IM") for swaps with affiliates; (2) preserves legacy status for swaps that are amended to replace certain interest rate provisions or due to technical amendments, notional reductions, or portfolio compression exercises; (3) clarifies the time at which IM trading documentation must be in place; and (4) adds a new compliance phase for IM requirements. The final rule will take effect August 31, 2020. We are continuing to assess the amendments and their impact on our operations.

Reductions to trading assets estimated during the July 1 through December 31, 2020 period are mainly related to select Fixed Income activities which will be consolidated in and operated from Europe to better utilize HSBC's global scale, which allows us to record revenue as a business introducer and hold fewer assets on our balance sheet. In addition, we will also exit certain derivative contracts as part of our restructuring plan. As previously discussed, the timing of our strategic actions may be re-sequenced or delayed. In light of COVID-19, we continue to reassess our strategic plan and may take additional actions in future periods. 

The above table reflects a long-term funding strategy. Daily balances fluctuate as we accommodate customer needs, while ensuring that we have liquidity in place to support the balance sheet maturity funding profile. Should market conditions deteriorate, we have contingency plans to generate additional liquidity through the sales of assets or financing transactions. We remain confident in our ability to access the market for long-term debt funding needs in the current market environment. We continue to seek well-priced and stable customer deposits. We also continue to sell new agency-eligible mortgage loan originations to third parties. 

HSBC Bank USA is subject to significant restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to, and certain other 'covered transactions' with HSBC USA and other affiliates. For further discussion, see Part I, "Regulation and Competition - Affiliate Transaction Restrictions," in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

See "Risk Management" in this MD&#38;A for further discussion relating to our liquidity contingency plans and our approach to liquidity and funding risk management. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Credit Derivatives and Other Contractual Obligations 

&#160; 

As part of our normal operations, we enter into credit derivatives and various off-balance sheet arrangements with affiliates and third parties. These arrangements arise principally in connection with our lending and client intermediation activities and involve primarily extensions of credit and, in certain cases, guarantees. 

As a financial services provider, we routinely extend credit through loan commitments and lines and letters of credit and provide financial guarantees, including derivative transactions having characteristics of a guarantee. The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent our maximum possible credit exposure in the event that a counterparty draws down the full commitment amount or we are required to fulfill our maximum obligation under a guarantee. 

The following table provides maturity information related to our credit derivatives and off-balance sheet arrangements. Many of these commitments and guarantees expire unused or without default. In addition, implementation of our business strategy (as described under the heading "Executive Overview - 2020 Business Update" in our 2019 Form 10-K) will affect our contractual obligations over time, including with respect to credit derivatives. As a result, we believe that the contractual amount is not representative of the actual future credit exposure or funding requirements. &#160;

Other Commitments to Extend Credit Other commitments to extend credit include arrangements whereby we are contractually obligated to extend credit in the form of loans, participations in loans, lease financing receivables, or similar transactions. Consumer commitments are comprised of certain unused MasterCard/Visa credit card lines, where we have the right to change terms or conditions upon notification to the customer, and commitments to extend credit secured by residential properties, where we have the right to change terms or conditions, for cause, upon notification to the customer. Commercial commitments comprise primarily those related to secured and unsecured loans and lines of credit. 

In addition to the above, we have established and manage a number of constant net asset value ("CNAV") money market funds that invest in shorter-dated highly-rated money market securities to provide investors with a highly liquid and secure investment. These funds price the assets in their portfolio on an amortized cost basis, which enables them to create and liquidate shares at a constant price. The funds, however, are not permitted to price their portfolios at amortized cost if that amount varies by more than 50 basis points from the portfolio's market value. In that case, the fund would be required to price its portfolio at market value and consequently would no longer be able to create or liquidate shares at a constant price. We do not consolidate the CNAV funds because we do not absorb the majority of the expected future risk associated with the fund's assets, including interest rate, liquidity, credit and other relevant risks that are expected to affect the value of the assets.

Fair Value 

&#160; 

Fair Value Hierarchy Fair value measurement accounting principles establish a fair value hierarchy structure that prioritizes the inputs to determine the fair value of an asset or liability (the "Fair Value Framework"). The Fair Value Framework distinguishes between inputs that are based on observed market data and unobservable inputs that reflect market participants' assumptions. It emphasizes the use of valuation methodologies that maximize observable market inputs. For financial instruments carried at fair value, the best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an actively traded market (Level 1). Where the market for a financial instrument is not active, valuation techniques are used. The majority of our valuation techniques use market inputs that are either observable or indirectly derived from and corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the financial instrument (Level 2). Because Level 1 and Level 2 instruments are determined by observable inputs, less judgment is applied in determining their fair values. In the absence of observable market inputs, the financial instrument is valued based on valuation techniques that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The determination of the level of fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement of an asset or a liability is classified often requires judgment and may change over time as market conditions evolve. We consider the following factors in developing the fair value hierarchy: 

&#8226; 

whether the asset or liability is transacted in an active market with a quoted market price; 

&#8226; 

the level of bid-ask spreads; 

&#8226; 

a lack of pricing transparency due to, among other things, complexity of the product and market liquidity; 

&#8226; 

whether only a few transactions are observed over a significant period of time; 

&#8226; 

whether the pricing quotations differ substantially among independent pricing services; 

&#8226; 

whether inputs to the valuation techniques can be derived from or corroborated with market data; and 

&#8226; 

whether significant adjustments are made to the observed pricing information or model output to determine the fair value. 

Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that the reporting entity has the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities. A financial instrument is classified as a Level 1 measurement if it is listed on an exchange or is an instrument actively traded in the over-the-counter ("OTC") market where transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume. We regard financial instruments such as debt securities, equity securities and derivative contracts listed on the primary exchanges of a country to be actively traded. Non-exchange-traded instruments classified as Level 1 assets include securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, to-be-announced securities, non-callable securities issued by U.S. Government sponsored enterprises and certain foreign government-backed debt. 

Level 2 inputs are those that are observable either directly or indirectly but do not qualify as Level 1 inputs. We classify mortgage pass-through securities, agency and certain non-agency mortgage collateralized obligations, non-exchange-traded derivative contracts, asset-backed securities, obligations of U.S. states and political subdivisions, corporate debt securities, certain foreign government-backed debt, preferred securities, securities purchased and sold under resale and repurchase agreements, precious metals, certain loans held for sale, residential mortgage loans whose carrying amount was reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, real estate owned and, beginning January 1, 2020, certain student loans held for investment as Level 2 measurements. Where possible, at least two quotations from independent sources are obtained based on transactions involving comparable assets and liabilities to validate the fair value of these instruments. We have established a process to understand the methodologies and inputs used by the third party pricing services to ensure that pricing information meets the fair value objective and, where appropriate, this pricing data is back-tested to market trade executions. Where significant differences arise among the independent pricing quotes and the internally determined fair value, we investigate and reconcile the differences. If the investigation results in a significant adjustment to the fair value, the instrument will be classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. In general, we have observed that there is a correlation between the credit standing and the market liquidity of a non-derivative instrument. 

Level 2 derivative instruments are generally valued based on discounted future cash flows or an option pricing model adjusted for counterparty credit risk and market liquidity. The fair value of certain derivative products is determined using valuation techniques based on inputs derived from observable indices traded in the OTC market. Appropriate control processes and procedures have been applied to ensure that the derived inputs are applied to value only those instruments that share similar risks to the relevant benchmark indices and therefore demonstrate a similar response to market factors. 

Level 3 inputs are unobservable estimates that management expects market participants would use to determine the fair value of the asset or liability. That is, Level 3 inputs incorporate market participants' assumptions about risk and the risk premium required by market participants in order to bear that risk. We develop Level 3 inputs based on the best information available in the circumstances. At June 30, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , our Level 3 measurements included the following: certain structured deposits and structured notes for which the embedded credit, foreign exchange or equity derivatives that have significant unobservable inputs (e.g., volatility or default correlations), asset-backed credit default swaps with certain inputs which are unobservable, certain corporate debt securities, certain asset-backed securities, individually assessed commercial loans, derivatives

referenced to illiquid assets of less desirable credit quality and swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of Visa Class B Shares for which the fair value is dependent upon the final resolution of the related litigation.

Significant Changes in Fair Value for Level 3 Assets and Liabilities See Note 19, "Fair Value Measurements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on additions to and transfers into (out of) Level 3 measurements during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 &#32;and 2019 &#32;as well as for further details including the classification hierarchy associated with assets and liabilities measured at fair value. 

Effect of Changes in Significant Unobservable Inputs &#160; The fair value of certain financial instruments is measured using valuation techniques that incorporate pricing assumptions not supported by, derived from or corroborated by observable market data. The resultant fair value measurements are dependent on unobservable input parameters which can be selected from a range of estimates and may be interdependent. Changes in one or more of the significant unobservable input parameters may change the fair value measurements of these financial instruments. For the purpose of preparing the financial statements, the final valuation inputs selected are based on management's best judgment that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing similar assets or liabilities. 

The unobservable input parameters selected are subject to the internal valuation control processes and procedures. When we perform a test of all the significant input parameters to the extreme values within the range at the same time, it could result in an increase of the overall fair value measurement of approximately $28 million &#32;or a decrease of the overall fair value measurement of approximately $11 million &#32;at June 30, 2020 . The effect of changes in significant unobservable input parameters are primarily driven by the uncertainty in determining the fair value of credit derivatives executed against certain insurers and certain deal-contingent forward starting interest rate derivatives. 

Risk Management 

&#160; 

Overview &#160; Managing risk effectively is fundamental to the delivery of our strategic priorities. 

We use a comprehensive risk management framework across the organization and across all risk types underpinned by our risk culture. This framework fosters continuous monitoring, promotes risk awareness and encourages sound operational and strategic decision-making. It also ensures a consistent approach to identifying, assessing, managing and reporting the risks we accept and incur in our activities. 

Our Board of Directors has the ultimate responsibility for effective management of risk. It is advised on risk matters by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors and the Compliance and Conduct Committee. In particular, the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors advises the Board of Directors on risk appetite and its alignment with our strategy, risk governance and internal controls as well as high-level risk related matters. Robust risk governance and accountability are embedded throughout our business through an established framework that helps to ensure appropriate oversight of and accountability for the effective management of risk. 

Our material risks The principal risks associated with our operations include the following: 

&#8226; 

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract; 

HSBC USA Inc. 

&#8226; 

Capital and liquidity risk is the risk of having insufficient capital, liquidity or funding resources to meet financial obligations and satisfy regulatory requirements, including pension risk; 

&#8226; 

Market risk is the risk that movements in market factors, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices and commodity prices, will reduce our income or the value of our portfolios; 

&#8226; 

Resilience risk &#32;is the risk that we are unable to provide critical services to our customers, affiliates and counterparties as a result of sustained and significant operational disruption; 

&#8226; 

Regulatory compliance risk is the risk that we fail to observe the letter and spirit of relevant laws, codes, rules, regulations and standards of good market practice, which as a consequence incur fines and penalties and suffer damage to our business; 

&#8226; 

Financial crime and fraud risk &#32;is the risk that we knowingly or unknowingly help parties to commit or to further potentially illegal activity, including both internal and external fraud; 

&#8226; 

Strategic risk is the risk that the business will fail to identify, execute and react appropriately to opportunities and/or threats arising from changes in the market, some of which may emerge over a number of years such as changing economic and political circumstances, customer requirements, demographic trends, regulatory developments or competitor action; 

&#8226; 

Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from business decisions informed by models, which can be exacerbated by errors in methodology, design or the way they are used. 

In the course of our regular risk management activities, we use models to help quantify the risk we are taking. We believe that the assumptions used in these models are reasonable within the parameters for which the models have been built and calibrated to operate, but events may unfold differently than what is assumed in the models. Consequently, actual results may differ significantly from model projections. The severe projections of macroeconomic variables during the current COVID-19 pandemic represent events outside the parameters for which the models have been built. As a result, adjustments to model outputs to reflect consideration of management judgment are used with stringent governance in place to ensure appropriate results. Where models do not require adjustments, enhanced model monitoring confirms models are performing as intended. 

See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2019 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of the objectives of our risk management system as well as our risk management policies and practices. There have been no material changes to our approach to risk management since December 31, 2019 . However, during the first half of 2020, we continued to enhance our risk management by further simplifying our approach and articulation of risk management through combining our Enterprise Risk Management Framework and our Operational Risk Management Framework to create a single simplified Risk Management Framework. 

Credit Risk Management &#32;&#32;Credit risk is managed through a robust risk identification and control framework which outlines clear and consistent policies, principles and guidance for risk managers. Credit risk is monitored using various internal risk management measures and within limits approved by individuals within a framework of delegated authorities. Our credit risk management procedures are designed for all stages of economic and financial cycles, including challenging periods of market volatility and economic uncertainty. As a result of market volatility and economic uncertainty driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, we re-reviewed the credit ratings assigned to substantially all of our material commercial loans during the first half of 2020. See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2019 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our approach to credit risk. 

ASU 2016-13 process &#32;On January 1, 2020, we adopted the requirements of ASU 2016-13, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses" ("ASU 2016-13"). The implementation of ASU 2016-13 represents a significant challenge to our Risk and Finance functions. The ASU introduces new concepts and measures such as lifetime ECL. Some of these new concepts and measures differ significantly from the IFRS 9, "Financial Instruments" ("IFRS 9") credit loss reporting that we implemented in 2018 for segment reporting under the Group Reporting Basis. As a result of ASU 2016-13 adoption, management has additional insight and measures not previously utilized which, over time, may influence our risk appetite and risk management processes. The ASU 2013-16 process comprises three main areas: 

&#8226; 

Modeling - The Risk function had pre-existing models developed in conjunction with our IFRS 9 reporting to HSBC. These models were enhanced or supplemented to address the requirements of ASU 2016-13 such as incorporating forward economic guidance for a reasonable and supportable forecast period, reversion to historical losses, the expectation for zero losses under certain conditions, and lifetime ECL for undrawn credit exposures, with the appropriate governance and independent review. The models vary in complexity and inputs depending upon the size of the portfolio, the amount of data available and the sophistication of the market concerned. 

&#8226; 

Implementation &#32;- A centralized impairment engine has been implemented to perform the lifetime ECL calculation. The impairment engine receives data, which is subject to a number of validation checks and enhancements, from a variety of client, finance and risk systems. Once the lifetime ECL calculation has been calculated, there are further data analysis checks and review and challenge of the results prior to commencing formal governance. Risk and Finance work closely together throughout the execution of this process. 

&#8226; 

Governance &#32;- A Management Review Committee has been established in order to review and approve the results of the lifetime ECL calculation. The Management Review Committee has representatives from Credit Risk and Finance and is responsible for final approval of our lifetime ECL for the period. The Chief Credit Officer and the WPB Chief Risk Officer 

HSBC USA Inc. 

share responsibility with the Chief Financial Officer for establishing appropriate levels of allowances for credit losses inherent in various loan and other portfolios carried at amortized cost. 

Capital and Liquidity Risk Management Although our overall approach to capital and liquidity risk management has not changed, we continuously monitor our capital ratios and the impact of market events on our liquidity positions and will continue to adapt our frameworks as necessary to reflect market events and the evolving regulatory landscape and view as to best practices. See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2019 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our approach to capital and liquidity risk. 

Capital risk &#32;See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in this MD&#38;A for a discussion of our approach to capital risk, including our capital ratios and regulatory capital requirements. 

Liquidity and funding risk &#32;As part of our approach towards liquidity and funding risk management, we employ the measures discussed below to define, monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk in accordance with HSBC policy. 

The Basel Committee based Liquidity Coverage Ratio ("LCR") is designed to be a short-term liquidity measure to ensure banks have sufficient High Quality Liquid Assets ("HQLA") to cover net stressed cash outflows over the next 30 days. At both June 30, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , HSBC USA's LCR under the European LCR rule exceeded 100 percent. A LCR of 100 percent or higher reflects an unencumbered HQLA balance that is equal to or exceeds liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario. HQLA consists of cash or assets that can be converted into cash at little or no loss of value in private markets. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA are also subject to the U.S. LCR rule and are required to report LCR to U.S. regulators on a daily basis. The Tailoring Rules reduced the U.S. LCR requirement for Category III firms with weighted short-term wholesale funding under $75 billion and their depository institution subsidiaries, including HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA, from 100 to 85 percent beginning January 1, 2020. As a result, under the U.S. LCR rule, a LCR of 100 percent or higher reflects an unencumbered HQLA balance that is equal to or exceeds 85 percent of liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario. During the six months ended June 30, 2020 , HSBC Bank USA's LCR under the U.S. LCR rule remained above the 100 percent minimum requirement. 

The European calibration of the Basel Committee based Net Stable Funding Ratio ("NSFR"), which is a longer term liquidity measure with a 12-month time horizon to ensure a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities, is still pending. Therefore, our calculation of NSFR is based on our current interpretation and understanding of the Basel Committee NSFR guidance, which may differ in future periods depending on completion of the European calibration and further implementation guidance from regulators. The Basel NSFR guidance has been interpreted in certain instances to include expected changes from the Capital Requirements Directive and Regulation, commonly referred to as "CRR2". Our calculation of NSFR will fully follow the CRR2 reporting rules when they are expected to become effective in June 2021. At both June 30, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , HSBC USA's estimated NSFR exceeded 100 percent. A NSFR of 100 percent or more reflects an available stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next 12 months that is equal to or exceeds the required amount of funding for assets and off-balance sheet exposures. In April 2016, U.S. regulators issued for public comment a proposal to implement the NSFR in the United States, applicable to certain large banking organizations, including HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA. The Tailoring Rules also indicate that an 85 percent NSFR requirement will apply to Category III firms with weighted short-term wholesale funding under $75 billion and their depository institution subsidiaries, including HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA, once the NSFR is finalized. As a result, under the proposed U.S. NSFR rule, a NSFR of 100 percent or more reflects an available stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next 12 months that is equal to or exceeds 85 percent of the required amount of funding for assets and off-balance sheet exposures. At both June 30, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , HSBC Bank USA's estimated NSFR, based on our current interpretation and understanding of the proposed U.S. NSFR rule, exceeded 100 percent. 

As a Category III firm, HSBC North America remains subject to liquidity stress testing on a monthly basis and related liquidity buffer and liquidity risk management requirements. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA have adjusted their liquidity profiles to support compliance with these rules. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA may need to make further changes to their liquidity profiles to support compliance with any future rules. 

Our liquidity and funding risk management approach includes deposits, supplemented by wholesale borrowing to fund our balance sheet, and using security sales or secured borrowings for liquidity stress situations in our liquidity contingency plans. In addition, regulations require banks to retain a portfolio of HQLA. As such, we are maintaining a large portfolio of high quality sovereign and sovereign guaranteed securities. 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Our ability to regularly attract wholesale funds at a competitive cost is enhanced by strong ratings from the major credit ratings agencies. The following table reflects the short and long-term credit ratings of HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA at June 30, 2020 :

Rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk management practices and legal matters, all of which could lead to adverse ratings actions. 

In April 2020, Fitch changed the rating outlook for both HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA to negative from stable following a similar change in outlook to negative from stable for HSBC. The outlook change reflects the economic disruption driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. While the outlook changed, Fitch affirmed the long-term credit rating for HSBC USA. Concurrently, Fitch upgraded the long-term credit rating for HSBC Bank USA by one notch to AA- following a review of HSBC's resolution plan. 

In May 2020, S&#38;P downgraded the long- and short-term issuer credit ratings of HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA by one notch following a similar rating action for HSBC. The long- and short-term issuer credit ratings of HSBC USA were downgraded to A- and A-2, respectively, from A and A-1, respectively, while the long- and short-term issuer credit ratings of HSBC Bank USA were downgraded to A+ and A-1, respectively, from AA- and A-1+, respectively. These rating downgrades reflect S&#38;P's view that the HSBC Group will not be fully shielded from the global economic downturn resulting from the measures taken against the spread of COVID-19 and that weaker earnings arising from higher credit charges will be exacerbated by low interest rates. In conjunction with these downgrades, S&#38;P revised their rating outlooks for HSBC, HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA to stable from negative. 

While these rating actions by Fitch and S&#38;P did not have a material financial impact on our borrowing costs or liquidity, any future actions could have such an impact. Although we closely monitor and strive to manage factors influencing our credit ratings, there is no assurance that our credit ratings will not change in the future. At June 30, 2020 , there were no pending actions in terms of changes to ratings on the debt of HSBC USA or HSBC Bank USA from any of the rating agencies. 

See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in this MD&#38;A for further discussion of our liquidity position, including information regarding our outstanding borrowings, the remaining availability of our debt issuance programs and our funding strategy. 

Market Risk Management Exposure to market risk is separated into two portfolios: 

&#8226; 

Trading portfolios &#32;comprise positions arising from market-making and warehousing of client-derived positions. 

&#8226; 

Non-trading portfolios &#32;comprise positions that primarily arise from the interest rate management of our retail and commercial banking assets and liabilities and financial investments classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity. 

We apply similar risk management policies and measurement techniques to both trading and non-trading portfolios. Our objective 

is to manage and control market risk exposures to optimize return on risk while maintaining a market profile consistent with our established risk appetite. See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2019 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our approach to market risk. 

Value at Risk ("VaR") &#32;VaR is a technique for estimating potential losses on risk positions as a result of movements in market rates and prices over a specified time horizon and to a given level of confidence. The use of VaR is integrated into market risk management and calculated for all trading positions regardless of how we capitalize them. In addition, we calculate VaR for non-trading portfolios to have a complete picture of risk. VaR measures are calculated to a 99 percent confidence level and use a one-day holding period. 

Trading portfolios Trading VaR generates from the Global Markets unit of the GB&#38;M business segment. Portfolios are mainly comprised of foreign exchange products, interest rate swaps, credit default swaps and precious metals (i.e., gold, silver, platinum) in both North America and emerging markets.

Portfolio diversification is the market risk dispersion effect of holding a portfolio containing different risk types. It represents the reduction in unsystematic market risk that occurs when combining a number of different risk types, for example, foreign exchange, interest rate and credit spread, together in one portfolio. It is measured as the difference between the sum of the VaR by individual risk type and the combined total VaR. A negative number represents the benefit of portfolio diversification. As the maximum and minimum occur on different days for different risk types, it is not meaningful to calculate a portfolio diversification benefit for these measures. 

(2) &#160; 

The total VaR is non-additive across risk types due to diversification effects. For presentation purposes, portfolio diversification of the VaR for trading portfolios includes VaR-based risk-not-in-VaR. 

Back-testing &#32;We routinely validate the accuracy of our VaR models by back-testing them against hypothetical profit and loss that excludes non-modeled items such as fees, commissions and revenues of intra-day transactions from the actual reported profit and loss. We would expect, under stable market conditions, to see two or three losses in excess of VaR at the 99 percent confidence level over a one-year period. However, in periods of unstable market conditions, we could see an increase in the number of back-testing exceptions. 

During the six months ended June 30, 2020 , we experienced eight loss back-testing exceptions. One loss exception in January was mainly driven by palladium volatility. Five loss exceptions in March and two loss exceptions in April were primarily due to intensified market volatility as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Despite the high number of loss exceptions, performance of the VaR model was in line with expectations when considered in the context of the extraordinary market movements observed in March 2020. During the period, market risk continued to be managed using a complementary set of exposure measures and limits, including stress and scenario analysis. 

Non-trading portfolios Non-trading VaR predominantly relates to BSM and represents the potential negative changes in the investment portfolio market value (which includes available-for-sale and held-to-maturity assets) and associated hedges. Our investment portfolio holdings are mainly comprised of U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed and U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities. Our non-trading VaR exposure is driven by interest rates and agency spread volatility.

Refer to the Trading VaR table above for additional information. 

The increase in non-trading VaR at June 30, 2020 &#32;was due primarily to an increase in volatility of interest rates and U.S. Government agency credit spreads driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Non-trading VaR also includes the interest rate risk of non-trading financial assets and liabilities held by the global businesses and transfer priced into BSM which has the mandate to centrally manage and hedge it. See below for a broader discussion on how interest rate risk is managed. 

Interest rate risk Various techniques are utilized to quantify and monitor risks associated with the repricing characteristics of our assets, liabilities and derivative contracts. See "Risk Management" in MD&#38;A in our 2019 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our approach to interest rate risk. 

Economic value of equity ("EVE") &#32;EVE represents the present value of the banking book cash flows that could be provided to our equity holder under a managed run-off scenario. An EVE sensitivity represents the change in EVE due to a defined movement in interest rates. We manage to an immediate parallel upward shock of 200 basis points and an immediate parallel downward shock of 200 basis points to the market implied interest rates. At both June 30, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , our EVE remained within risk appetite for the up 200 and down 200 basis point interest rate shock scenarios. 

Net interest income simulation modeling techniques &#32; We utilize simulation modeling to monitor a number of interest rate scenarios for their impact on projected net interest income. These techniques simulate the impact on projected net interest income under various scenarios, such as rate shock scenarios which assume immediate market rate movements by 100 basis points, as well as scenarios in which rates gradually rise or fall by 100 basis points over a twelve month period. In the gradual scenarios, 25 percent of the interest rate movement occurs at the beginning of each quarter. The following table reflects the impact on our projected net interest income of the scenarios utilized by these modeling techniques:

Changes in the sensitivities since December 31, 2019 have been primarily driven by the addition of pay-fixed positions and the acceleration of expected mortgage prepayments as a result of the significant drop in interest rates. In addition, the sensitivities in the 'down-shock' scenarios at June 30, 2020 reflect no floors to the shocked market rates. This is a change from the methodology published in our 2019 Form 10-K, where previously market rates would have been floored to zero when applicable. However, customer product specific rate floors continue to be recognized where appropriate. The projections do not take into consideration possible complicating factors such as the effect of changes in interest rates on the credit quality, size and composition of the balance sheet. Therefore, although this provides a reasonable estimate of interest rate sensitivity, actual results will differ from these estimates, possibly by significant amounts.
