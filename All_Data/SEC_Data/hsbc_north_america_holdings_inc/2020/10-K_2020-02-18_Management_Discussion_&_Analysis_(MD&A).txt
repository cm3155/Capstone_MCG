Certain matters discussed throughout this Form 10-K &#32;are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, we may make or approve certain statements in future filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), in press releases, or oral or written presentations by representatives of HSBC USA Inc. ("HSBC USA" and, together with its subsidiaries, "HUSI") that are not statements of historical fact and may also constitute forward-looking statements. Words such as "may," "will," "should," "would," "could," "appears," "believe," "intends," "expects," "estimates," "targeted," "plans," "anticipates," "goal," and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements but should not be considered as the only means through which these statements may be made. All discussions related to strategy, including the matters discussed under the heading "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Overview - 2020 Business Update" and discussions of those matters elsewhere in this Form 10-K are forward-looking statements. These matters or statements will relate to our future structure, operations, strategy, financial condition, economic forecast, results of operations, plans, objectives, performance or business developments and will involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from that which was expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

Executive Overview ##TABLE_START &#160; 

##TABLE_END

HSBC USA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC North America, which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC. HUSI may also be referred to in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&#38;A") as "we," "us" or "our." 

2019 Economic Environment The U.S. economy continued to grow during 2019, although the pace of growth was slower than in 2018. U.S. Gross Domestic Product ("GDP") grew at an estimated annual rate of 2.3 percent in 2019, lower than 2018's GDP annual growth rate, while inflation in 2019 remained below the FRB's target inflation rate. The U.S. economy added over 2.1 million jobs during 2019 and the total unemployment rate fell to 3.5 percent at December 2019 as compared with 3.9 percent at December 2018. In October 2019, the FRB cut short-term interest rates by 25 basis points, the third such rate decrease of the year, as a result of increased economic uncertainty from trade tensions and a slowing global economy. 

The slowing of economic growth both in the United States and abroad during 2019 has created global uncertainty about the future economic environment. The sustainability of economic growth will be determined by numerous other variables including consumer sentiment, energy prices, credit market volatility, employment levels and housing market conditions which will impact corporate earnings and the capital markets. Concerns over interest rate levels, inflation, domestic and global policy issues, U.S. trade policy and geopolitical events as well as the implications of those events on the markets in general further add to global uncertainty. Interest rate levels, in combination with global economic conditions, fiscal and monetary policy and the level of regulatory and government scrutiny of financial institutions will continue to impact our results in 2020 and beyond. 

2019 Events 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

During the third quarter of 2019, we completed our annual impairment test of goodwill and determined that the fair value of our Commercial Banking and Private Banking reporting units exceeded or approximated their carrying values including allocated goodwill. However, the cash flow projections for our Retail Banking and Wealth Management reporting unit were significantly lower than previous estimates and resulted in the carrying amount of this reporting unit, including allocated goodwill, exceeding its fair value. As a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $365 million , representing a portion of the $737 million &#32;of goodwill previously allocated to this reporting unit. As discussed in "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates," our goodwill impairment testing is highly sensitive to certain assumptions and estimates used. For additional discussion of the results of our annual goodwill impairment testing, see Note 9, "Goodwill," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

In November 2019, HSBC Bank USA repurchased $1,269 million &#32;of its outstanding subordinated long-term debt and recorded a net pre-tax gain on extinguishment of $84 million &#32;during the fourth quarter of 2019. As we previously elected to apply fair value option accounting to this debt, the extinguishment resulted in the realization of a gain associated with our own credit spread that was previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss which more than offset the premium paid to extinguish the debt. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

In 2019, we recorded a loss of $52 million &#32;(of which $48 million &#32;was recorded during the fourth quarter) on the swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of Visa Inc. ("Visa") Class B common shares ("Class B Shares") related to an increase in the expected timing of the final resolution of the related litigation for which we retained the associated risk and, to a lesser extent, changes in the Visa Class B Share conversion rate. See Note 27, "Guarantee Arrangements, Pledged Assets and Repurchase Agreements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

As previously discussed, we have implemented staff cost reduction efforts throughout 2019 as part of a global effort aimed to right-size our cost base and recorded severance related costs of $33 million . During the fourth quarter of 2019, we began a review of the scope of our retail branch network and determined that we would exit approximately 20 &#32;branches. As a result, we recorded charges of $19 million &#32;in the fourth quarter of 2019 reflecting impairment of the lease right-of-use ("ROU") assets and other related costs associated with these branches. 

##TABLE_END 2020 Business Update 

HSBC Group aims to be the world's preeminent international bank. HSBC will continue to seek growth where opportunities best align with its strengths, focused on enabling and supporting business and trade between the developed world and the faster growing, higher returning markets of the world, particularly in Asia and the Middle East. However, the more challenging economic environment requires strategic changes in order to increase returns and create capacity for future growth. HSBC will first materially reshape underperforming areas of the Group, particularly in Global Banking and Markets, Europe, and the United States. HSBC will focus these businesses around its strengths as an international bank, simplifying the footprint and reducing both risk-weighted assets ("RWAs") and costs. These actions will enable HSBC to direct its resources, including RWAs, toward areas of higher growth and profitability. Second, HSBC will reduce costs by finding efficiencies, sharing capabilities and investing in automation and digitization. Third, HSBC will simplify the organizational structure to reduce fragmentation and accelerate the pace of execution. 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. 

##TABLE_END

Simplification will include changing the global matrix and geographical reporting structure, consolidating Retail Banking and Wealth Management and Global Private Banking to create one of the world's largest wealth management businesses, and reorganizing Global Functions and Head Office to match the new structure. Combined, these actions will enable HSBC to refocus toward areas of higher growth and profitability and continue to invest in digital capabilities and customer experience. HSBC Group's overarching targets by 2022 include a gross RWA reduction of more than $100 billion, a reduction in the cost base to $31 billion or less, and a return on tangible equity in the range of 10-12%. 

HUSI aspires to be the leading international bank in the U.S., and will take active measures in 2020-2021 to re-profile our business and ensure success. In alignment with HSBC's global strategy, our U.S. wholesale operations will be refocused to better serve our international corporate clients and retail operations will be restructured to better meet the needs of globally mobile and affluent clients. This strategic repositioning will enable us to bring the best of HSBC's expansive global network and leading international banking capabilities to current and future clients in the U.S. We will streamline our functional and operations support model by removing duplication and reduce the size of the balance sheet to better align to the scope and scale of the U.S. opportunity. These actions will enable us to continue as a global hub for trade, investment, and U.S. dollar clearing for global customers and deliver sustainable profitability and improved returns. The strategy will be executed while preserving and maintaining a strong control environment. 

The U.S. strategy will include the following: 

Global Banking and Markets ("GB&#38;M") &#32;Our Global Banking business will refocus on meeting the needs of international corporate clients, sponsors, and strategic global clients with capabilities in Debt Capital Markets, Financing, and Transaction Banking. Low return client relationships will be reviewed for exit or remediation. Our Global Markets business will be restructured in coordination with HSBC Europe. Select Fixed Income activities will be consolidated in and operated from Europe to better utilize HSBC's global scale, allowing HUSI to receive revenue as a business introducer and hold fewer assets on its local balance sheet. This structural change will ensure U.S. clients will have access to the full suite of Global Markets products while optimizing GB&#38;M's use of the HUSI balance sheet. 

Commercial Banking ("CMB") &#32;Commercial Banking will continue to focus on meeting the needs of U.S.-based large and middle market corporates and the U.S. subsidiaries of international corporate clients. CMB will also collaborate closely with GB&#38;M to deliver sophisticated debt finance and capital market solutions to corporate clients. CMB will selectively expand coverage in high opportunity markets where international corporates and subsidiaries are concentrated. 

Retail Banking and Wealth Management ("RBWM") and Private Banking ("PB") &#32;We will combine RBWM and PB to create a single Wealth and Personal Banking ("WPB") business and focus our retail businesses to best serve the needs of internationally mobile and affluent clients. Unifying the retail platform will allow us to maximize the investment across the client continuum, providing better digital and transaction banking services for private banking clients while creating greater access to wealth solutions for retail banking clients. Private banking teams will continue to serve in a distinct and separate coverage segment designed to meet the sophisticated needs of high net worth and ultra- high net worth clients, however we expect to see a lower cost to serve these clients over time. We will continue the modernization of our retail branch network and limited expansion in high opportunity markets, however we will consolidate roughly 30% of our branch footprint primarily in high branch density markets. Additional investments will be made to enhance our client service proposition, including more advanced mobile and digital functionality, and scale our unsecured lending products. 

Functional and Operational Changes &#32;We will simplify the U.S. operating model, which will enable us to serve clients in a more consistent way and concentrate our investments in servicing enhancements and digitization. We will consolidate the middle and back office functions of Global Banking and Commercial Banking under a single operations structure. While the client teams will remain in separate and distinct business units, the wholesale operating model will facilitate delivery of the full breadth of product solutions to corporate clients while unlocking cost synergies and capitalize on gains made in key client experience processes such as onboarding. As noted above, the new Wealth and Personal Banking business will run on an integrated and efficient service model in order to deliver better service and more capabilities to our retail and private banking clients. Our supporting functions, information technology, and related operations teams will realign to adapt to the changes made in our business model. These support areas will reengineer processes, eliminate redundant activities, and down-size to successfully support our strategic agenda. 

In connection with these actions, we expect to reduce staffing levels in the U.S. by approximately 15% and expect to incur pre-tax charges in connection with this plan over the two-year period of 2020-2021 of approximately $350-$400 million ($265-$305 million after-tax), including severance and employee benefits, lease impairment and other costs. We also anticipate investments of approximately $100 million in modernization, digital capabilities and expanded product solutions described above. There can be no assurance, however, as to the precise timing or amounts of these expenditures. We anticipate that it will require approximately 24 months to complete the restructuring plan. These actions will result in a moderate reduction in overall RWAs, with an approximate $8 billion reduction in RWAs from the Global Markets restructuring, partially offset by the deployment of more capital to areas in which we are investing, such as CMB and

##TABLE_END

WPB. Streamlining our operating model is intended to reduce gross operating cost by 10-15% by 2022 and enable investments in digital capabilities and new product solutions. 

Performance, Developments and Trends &#32;&#32;Net income (loss) was income of $113 million &#32;during 2019 compared with income of $320 million &#32;during 2018 and a loss of $179 million &#32;during 2017. Our net loss in 2017 reflects the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Legislation") enacted in December 2017 which lowered the Federal corporate income tax rate to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018 and resulted in an increase to our income tax provision of approximately $865 million due to a lower carrying value of our net deferred tax asset. 

Income before income tax was $270 million &#32;during 2019 compared with $586 million &#32;and $1,049 million &#32;during 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in income before income tax during 2019 compared with 2018 was due to a higher provision for credit losses, lower net interest income due primarily to higher rates paid on deposits and lower other revenues, partially offset by lower operating expenses as the impact of the goodwill impairment charge discussed above was more than offset by expense of $492 million &#32;recorded in 2018 related to the settlement of a mortgage securitization legal matter. The decrease in income before income tax during 2018 compared with 2017 was due to higher operating expenses driven by the settlement of a mortgage securitization legal matter as discussed above, lower other revenues which reflect the non-recurrence of a gain recorded in 2017 on the sale of Visa Class B Shares, lower releases in the provision for credit losses and lower net interest income. 

Our reported results in all periods were impacted by certain items management believes to be significant, which affect comparability between periods. Significant items are excluded to arrive at adjusted performance because management would ordinarily identify and consider them separately to better understand underlying business trends. The following table summarizes the impact of these significant items for all periods presented:

In 2019, we recorded a loss of $52 million &#32;related to an increase in the expected timing of the final resolution of the related litigation and, to a lesser extent, changes in the Visa Class B Share conversion rate. In 2018, we recorded a loss of $7 million &#32;related to a change in the Visa Class B Share conversion rate.

##TABLE_END Excluding the impact of the items in the table above, our adjusted performance during 2019 decreased $421 million &#32;compared with 2018 due to a higher provision for credit losses, lower net interest income due primarily to higher rates paid on deposits and lower other revenues, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Excluding the impact of the items in the table above, our adjusted performance during 2018 increased $111 million &#32;compared with 2017 due primarily to higher other revenues driven by higher trading revenue, partially offset by lower releases in the provision for credit losses and lower net interest income.

##TABLE_END

London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") Transition &#32;&#32;Regulators and central banks in various national jurisdictions continue to actively work to help transition from interbank offered rates ("IBORs") to acceptable alternative rates, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") recommended by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee ("ARRC") convened by the FRB. We currently anticipate the FASB will issue final rate reform guidance related to contract modification and hedge accounting relief in the first quarter of 2020 as companies prepare for the transition away from IBORs. We have a considerable number of contracts referencing IBORs, primarily LIBOR, such as loans, derivatives and long-term debt, extending past 2021 when the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority has announced it will no longer require banks to submit rates for LIBOR. 

HSBC has established a global transition program in which we actively participate with the objective of facilitating an orderly transition of all products, processes, models and curves, as well as all legacy LIBOR contracts, onto replacement rates. This program is aimed to minimize the volume of such contracts outstanding upon the cessation of LIBOR and, therefore, the associated disruption to financial flows and the risk of economic losses. The program is significant in terms of scale and complexity and will impact all global businesses as well as multiple products, currencies, systems and processes. In addition to the risk associated with LIBOR contracts being outstanding upon cessation of LIBOR, transition also results in a number of additional risks, mainly conduct risk, financial risk and operational risk. An initial draft of our risk inventory, including mitigating actions, has been completed and is currently going through the validation process. 

During 2019, risk disclosures across all products and business lines were established and are expected to be fully implemented in early 2020. Our global businesses have started to inform their clients that there are risks associated with engaging in new LIBOR products which will continue to evolve over time. Better awareness of the potential risks will enable clients to make informed decisions about their ongoing use of LIBOR-linked products and encourage them to focus more clearly on the task of transitioning to replacement rates. While we continue to transact in LIBOR, an initial framework to limit the sale of LIBOR-based products has been established as we continue to remain focused on developing alternative rate products and the supporting processes and systems and making them available to customers. 

The ARRC has published recommended contract fallback language for floating rate notes, syndicated loans, bilateral loans and securitizations. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we began to incorporate this new fallback language in new LIBOR-based contracts which will create a clearer process on which benchmark rates the products will move to when LIBOR ceases to exist. In addition, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association plans to update the benchmark fallback language in its new contracts beginning in 2020 and is working to establish an industry protocol that will support the transition of legacy contracts to reference the new fallback language. This represents a material undertaking for the industry as a whole and may expose us to the risk of financial losses. We intend to actively engage in the process to achieve an orderly transition of our LIBOR-based debt and other LIBOR-based debt where we are the payment agent. We continue to formulate detailed plans to enable us to transition these exposures, though the execution of these transition plans will, to a certain extent, also depend on the participation and engagement of third party market participants in the transition process. 

The ability of HUSI and its clients to transition legacy contracts onto replacement rates by the end of 2021 is materially dependent on the availability of products that reference replacement rates, including SOFR, and on our customers being ready and able to adapt their own processes and systems to accommodate the replacement products. This gives rise to an elevated level of conduct related risk. We have made progress in developing high level legacy contract transition plans and expect to have pricing and data/workflow requirements finalized in the first quarter of 2020. In addition to the conduct risk previously highlighted, the process of adopting new reference rates may expose us to an increased level of operational and financial risks, such as potential earnings volatility resulting from contract modifications and a large volume of product and associated process changes. Furthermore, the transition to alternative reference rates could have a range of adverse impacts on our business, including legal proceedings or other actions regarding the interpretation and enforceability of provisions in IBOR based contracts and regulatory investigations or reviews regarding our preparation and readiness for the replacement of IBOR with alternative reference rates. We continue to engage with industry participants, the official sector and our clients to support an orderly transition and the mitigation of the risks resulting from the transition. 

Future Prospects Our operations are dependent upon our ability to grow revenues, maintain stable deposit balances and, to a lesser extent, access the global capital markets. Numerous factors, both internal and external, may impact our access to, and the costs associated with, both retail and wholesale sources of funding. These factors may include our debt ratings, overall economic conditions, overall market volatility, the counterparty credit limits of investors to the HSBC Group as a whole and the effectiveness of our management of credit risks inherent in our customer base. 

Our results are also impacted by general global and domestic economic conditions, including employment levels, housing market conditions, property valuations, interest rates and legislative and regulatory changes, all of which are beyond our control. Changes in interest rates generally affect both the rates we charge to our customers and the rates we pay on our borrowings. Achieving our profitability goals in 2020 is largely dependent upon macroeconomic conditions which include the interest rate environment, housing market conditions, unemployment levels, market volatility, energy prices and our ability to attract and retain loans and deposits from customers, all of which could impact trading and other revenue, net interest income, loan volume, loss provision and ultimately our results of operations.

Group Reporting Basis &#32;We report financial information to HSBC in accordance with HSBC Group accounting and reporting policies, which apply International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRSs") as issued by the IASB and endorsed by the EU and, as a result, our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the basis of HSBC Group's accounting and reporting policies ("Group Reporting Basis"). Because operating results on the Group Reporting Basis are used in managing our businesses and rewarding performance of employees, our management also separately monitors profit before tax under this basis of reporting. The following table reconciles our U.S. GAAP versus Group Reporting Basis profit before tax:

##TABLE_END

The significant differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis as they impact our results are summarized in Note 24, "Business Segments," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Differences in reported profit before tax in the table above that were individually significant for 2019 and 2018 are explained below. See "Basis of Reporting" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 ("2018 Form 10-K") for an explanation of the differences in reported profit before tax in the table above that were individually significant for 2017. 

During 2019, goodwill impairment charges were lower under the Group Reporting Basis than under U.S. GAAP. Under the Group Reporting Basis, goodwill was amortized until 2005, however goodwill was amortized under U.S. GAAP until 2002, which resulted in a lower carrying amount of goodwill and, therefore, a lower impairment charge under the Group Reporting Basis. 

During 2019, credit loss estimates were higher under U.S. GAAP than under the Group Reporting Basis due primarily to the impact of downgrades in the commercial loan portfolio, which was more pronounced under U.S. GAAP. In addition, expected credit losses under the Group Reporting Basis reflect a release in credit reserves due to the upgrade of a single oil and gas industry client which resulted in reclassification from 'stage 2' (which requires a lifetime expected credit losses estimate) to 'stage 1' (which requires a 12-month expected credit losses estimate). The higher credit loss estimates under U.S. GAAP were partially offset by a release in credit reserves under U.S. GAAP for risk factors associated with fraud. 

During 2019, extinguishment of long-term debt resulted in a gain under U.S. GAAP compared with a loss under the Group Reporting Basis. We previously elected to apply fair value option accounting to this debt. Under U.S. GAAP, the extinguishment resulted in the realization of a gain associated with our own credit spread that was previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss which more than offset the premium paid to extinguish the debt. Under the Group Reporting Basis, the gain associated with our own credit spread remains in equity and does not get recognized in earnings. 

During 2018, releases in credit reserves were recorded under both the Group Reporting Basis and U.S. GAAP, though the releases were higher under the Group Reporting Basis. The higher reserve releases under the Group Reporting Basis were primarily due to releases associated with a single client relationship driven by improvements in credit conditions which resulted in reclassification from 'stage 2' to 'stage 1' and other modeling factors as well as a reduction of expected credit losses associated with oil and gas

##TABLE_END

clients. In addition, reserve releases driven by paydowns, sales and maturities were partially offset by the impact of downgrades in the commercial loan portfolio, which was more pronounced under U.S. GAAP, as well as a provision under U.S. GAAP for risk factors associated with geopolitical risks and market volatility inherent in certain segments of the portfolio. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates ##TABLE_START &#160; 

##TABLE_END

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting standards generally accepted in the United States. We believe our policies are appropriate and fairly present the financial position and results of operations of HSBC USA. 

The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are more fully described in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Certain critical accounting policies affecting the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, are complex and involve significant judgments by our management, including the use of estimates and assumptions. As a result, changes in estimates, assumptions or operational policies could significantly affect our financial position and our results of operations. We base our accounting estimates on historical experience, observable market data, inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means and on various other assumptions that we believe to be appropriate, including assumptions based on unobservable inputs. To the extent we use models to assist us in measuring the fair value of particular assets or liabilities, we strive to use models that are consistent with those used by other market participants. Actual results may differ from these estimates due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. The impact of estimates and assumptions on our financial condition or operating performance may be material. 

Of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, the items discussed below involve what we have identified as critical accounting estimates based on the associated degree of judgment and complexity. Our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies as well as the associated estimates, assumptions and accompanying disclosure with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. 

Allowance for Credit Losses &#160; Because we lend money to others, we are exposed to the risk that borrowers may not repay amounts owed to us when contractually due. Consequently, we maintain an allowance for credit losses that reflects our estimate of probable incurred losses in the existing loan portfolio. Allowance for credit loss estimates are reviewed periodically and adjustments are reflected through the provision for credit losses in the period they become known. Our Risk and Finance departments share responsibility for establishing appropriate levels of allowances for credit losses inherent in our various loan portfolios and they assess and independently approve our allowance for credit losses. We believe the accounting estimate relating to the allowance for credit losses is a "critical accounting estimate" for the following reasons: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Changes in the provision can materially affect our financial results; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Estimates related to the allowance for credit losses require us to project future borrower performance, including cash flows, delinquencies and charge-offs, along with, when applicable, collateral values, which are highly uncertain; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

The allowance for credit losses is influenced by factors outside of our control such as borrower performance, economic conditions such as industry and business trends and trends in housing markets and interest rates, energy prices, unemployment, bankruptcy trends, geopolitical events and the effects of laws and regulations. 

##TABLE_END Because our estimates of the allowance for credit losses involve judgment and are influenced by factors outside of our control, there is uncertainty inherent in these estimates. Our estimate of probable incurred credit losses is inherently uncertain because it is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions which influence growth, industry and business performance, bankruptcy trends, trends in housing markets and interest rates, delinquency rates and the flow of loans through various stages of delinquency, the realizability of any collateral and actual loss experience. Changes in such estimates could significantly impact our allowance and provision for credit losses. 

As an illustration of the effect of changes in estimates related to the allowance for credit losses, a 10 percent change in our projection of probable net credit losses on our loans would have resulted in a change of approximately $64 million &#32;in our allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2019 . 

Our allowance for credit losses is based on estimates and is intended to be adequate but not excessive. The allowance for credit losses is regularly assessed for adequacy. The allowance for credit losses, which is carried as a reduction to loans on the balance sheet includes reserves for inherent probable credit losses associated with all loans outstanding. A reserve is also maintained for off-balance sheet risk, which is recorded in other liabilities and includes probable and reasonably estimable credit losses arising from off-balance sheet arrangements such as letters of credit and undrawn commitments to lend. 

The allowances include amounts calculated for specific individual loan balances and for collective loan portfolios depending on the nature of the exposure and the manner in which risks inherent in that exposure are managed.

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

All commercial loans in a nonaccrual status that exceed $500,000 and all consumer and commercial troubled debt restructurings ("TDR Loans") are evaluated individually for impairment. Reserves against impaired loans are determined primarily based on the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate, or as a practical expedient, the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent or, for commercial loans, the observable market price if the loan is traded in the market. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Loans that are not individually evaluated for impairment are pooled into homogeneous categories of loans and collectively evaluated to determine if it is deemed probable, based on historical data and other environmental factors, that a loss has been incurred even though it has not yet manifested itself in a specific loan. 

##TABLE_END We estimate probable losses for pools of homogeneous consumer loans and certain small business loans which do not qualify as TDR Loans using a roll rate migration analysis that estimates the likelihood that a loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately charge-off based upon recent performance experience of other loans in our portfolio. This migration analysis incorporates estimates of the period of time between a loss occurring and the confirming event of its charge-off. This analysis also considers delinquency status, loss experience and severity and takes into account whether borrowers have filed for bankruptcy or have been subject to account management actions, such as the re-age or modification of accounts. We also take into consideration the loss severity expected based on the underlying collateral, if any, for the loan in the event of default based on historical and recent trends which are updated monthly based on a rolling average of several months' data using the most recently available information and is typically in the range of 20-40 percent for residential mortgages and 70-100 percent for home equity mortgages. 

An advanced credit risk analysis methodology is utilized to support the estimation of incurred losses inherent in pools of homogeneous commercial loans and off-balance sheet risk. This methodology uses the probability of default from the customer risk rating assigned to each counterparty together with the estimated loss emergence period (estimate of the period of time between a loss occurring and the confirming event of its charge-off) of the separate portfolios. The "Loss Given Default" rating assigned to each transaction or facility is based on the collateral securing the transaction and the measure of exposure based on the transaction. A suite of models, tools and templates is maintained using quantitative and statistical techniques, which are combined with management's judgment to support the assessment of each transaction. These were developed using internal data and supplemented with data from external sources which was judged to be consistent with our internal credit standards. These advanced measures are applied to the homogeneous credit pools to estimate the required allowance for credit losses. 

In addition, loss reserves on consumer and commercial loans are maintained to reflect our judgment of portfolio risk factors which may not be fully reflected in the statistical calculations or when historical trends are not reflective of current inherent losses in the portfolio. Portfolio risk factors considered in establishing the allowance for credit losses on loans include, as appropriate, growth, including new lending markets and customer concentrations, product mix and risk selection, unemployment rates, bankruptcy trends, geographic concentrations, loan product features such as adjustable rate loans, economic conditions such as trends in housing markets, interest rates and industry and business performance, portfolio seasoning, account management policies and practices, model imprecision, changes in underwriting practices, current levels of charge-offs and delinquencies, changes in laws and regulations, geopolitical risks and market volatility, customer concentration and other factors which can affect payment patterns on outstanding loans such as natural disasters. We also consider key ratios such as allowance as a percentage of loans in developing our allowance estimates. 

The results from the consumer roll rate analysis, commercial analysis and the specific impairment reserving process are reviewed each quarter by the Wholesale and Retail Allowance for Loan Losses Committees. These committees also consider other observable factors, both internal and external to us in the general economy, to ensure that the estimates provided by the various models adequately include all known information at each reporting period. 

Goodwill Impairment &#32; Goodwill is not subject to amortization but is tested for possible impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset might be impaired. Impairment testing requires that the fair value of each reporting unit be compared with its carrying amount, which is determined on the basis of capital invested in the unit including attributable goodwill. We determine the invested capital of a reporting unit by applying to the reporting unit's risk-weighted assets a capital charge that is consistent with the targets assigned and monitored through our capital management monitoring framework, and additionally, allocating to each reporting unit the remaining carrying amount of HUSI's net assets. Accordingly, the entire carrying amount of HUSI's net assets is allocated to our reporting units. Significant and long-term changes in the applicable reporting unit's industry and related economic conditions are considered to be primary indicators of potential impairment due to their impact on expected future cash flows. In addition, shorter-term changes may impact the discount rate applied to such cash flows based on changes in investor requirements or market uncertainties. In evaluating possible impairment, specific factors we consider are: (a) the observance of material changes to business plan information (e.g., financial forecasts); (b) significant increases in observed peer group discount rates; (c) significant announced or planned business divestitures; (d) the margin by which the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount at the previous testing date; (e) deterioration in macroeconomic, industry or market conditions that have not yet been reflected in the latest business plan information, 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. 

##TABLE_END

if any, and; (f) other relevant events specific to the reporting unit (e.g., changes in management, strategy or customers, capital allocation or litigation). 

The determination of fair value as part of the impairment testing of our goodwill is a "critical accounting estimate" due to the significant judgment required in the use of the fair value approaches. We utilize the market approach and the discounted cash flow method to determine fair value. The market approach focuses on valuation multiples for reasonably similar publicly traded companies and also considers recent market transactions. The discounted cash flow method includes such variables as revenue growth rates, expense trends, interest rates and terminal values. Based on an evaluation of key data and market factors, management's judgment is required to select the specific variables to be incorporated into the models. Additionally, the estimated fair value can be significantly impacted by the risk adjusted cost of capital percentage used to discount future cash flows. The risk adjusted cost of capital percentage is derived from an appropriate capital asset pricing model, which itself depends on a number of financial and economic variables which are established on the basis of those believed to be used by market participants. Because our fair value estimate involves judgment and is influenced by factors outside our control, it is reasonably possible our judgment could change. When management's judgment is that the anticipated cash flows have decreased and/or the cost of capital percentage has increased, the effect will be a lower estimate of fair value which could result in an impairment charge and a negative impact to net income (loss). 

Impairment testing of goodwill requires that the fair value of each reporting unit be compared with its carrying amount, including goodwill. Goodwill was allocated to the carrying amount of each reporting unit based on its relative fair value. Movements of businesses across reporting units may result in a reallocation of goodwill. 

We have established July 1 of each year as the date for conducting our annual goodwill impairment assessment. Prior to 2019, we utilized a two-step approach to test our goodwill for impairment. The first step, which was used to identify potential impairment, involved comparing each reporting unit's fair value to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount, including allocated goodwill, there was no indication of impairment and no further procedures were required. If the carrying amount including allocated goodwill of the reporting unit exceeded the unit's fair value, a second step was performed to quantify the impairment amount, if any. If the implied fair value of goodwill as determined using the same methodology as used in a business combination was less than the carrying amount of goodwill, an impairment charge was recorded for the excess. Beginning in 2019, we adopted new accounting guidance and removed the second step of the goodwill impairment test and instead goodwill impairment is measured and an impairment charge is recorded at the amount by which a reporting unit&#8217;s carrying amount, including allocated goodwill, exceeds its fair value. Any impairment charge recognized is limited to the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Subsequent reversals of goodwill impairments are not permitted. 

During the third quarter of 2019 , we completed our annual impairment test of goodwill and determined that the fair value of our Commercial Banking and Private Banking reporting units exceeded or approximated their carrying values including allocated goodwill. However, the cash flow projections for our Retail Banking and Wealth Management reporting unit were significantly lower than previous estimates and resulted in the carrying amount of this reporting unit, including allocated goodwill, exceeding its fair value. As a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $365 million , representing a portion of the $737 million &#32;of goodwill previously allocated to this reporting unit. The fair value of our Private Banking reporting unit approximated its book value, including allocated goodwill of $412 million. For additional discussion of the results of our annual goodwill impairment testing, see Note 9, "Goodwill," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Our goodwill impairment testing is highly sensitive to certain assumptions and estimates used as discussed above. We will continue to monitor changes to our business forecasts as we continue to perform periodic analyses of the risks and strategies of our business and product offerings. If deterioration in economic and credit conditions, a change in the strategy or performance of our business or product offerings, or an increase in the capital requirements of our business occurs, interim goodwill impairment tests for reporting units could be required, which may result in an impairment charge. We considered these and other factors as part of a qualitative analysis at December 31, 2019 to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units was less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. Based on this analysis, we determined no interim impairment test was required at December 31, 2019 for any of our reporting units. 

Valuation of Financial Instruments &#32; A significant portion of our financial assets and liabilities are carried at fair value. These include trading assets and liabilities, derivatives held for trading or used for hedging, securities available-for-sale and equity securities. Furthermore, we have elected to measure specific assets and liabilities at fair value under the fair value option, including certain commercial loans held for sale, certain securities purchased and sold under resale and repurchase agreements, structured deposits, structured notes, and certain of our own debt issuances. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Where available, we use quoted prices to determine fair value. If quoted prices are not available, we base fair value on models using inputs that are either directly observable or are derived from and corroborated by market data. 

Valuation of Major Classes of Assets and Liabilities &#32;- Fair value measurement accounting principles establish a fair value hierarchy structure that prioritizes the inputs to determine the fair value of an asset or liability (the "Fair Value Framework"). The Fair Value Framework establishes a three-tiered fair value hierarchy as discussed further in Note 28, "Fair Value Measurements," in the 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. 

##TABLE_END

accompanying consolidated financial statements. Classification within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest hierarchical level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. As such, the classification of a financial asset or liability within the fair value hierarchy is dynamic in that the asset or liability could be transferred to other hierarchy levels in each reporting period as a result of price discovery. We review and update our fair value hierarchy classifications quarterly. Changes from one quarter to the next related to the observability of the inputs into a fair value measurement may result in a reclassification between hierarchy levels. Level 3 assets as a percentage of total assets measured at fair value were approximately 1.4 percent &#32;at December 31, 2019 . 

Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs can impact the amount of revenue, expense or other comprehensive income recorded for a particular financial instrument. While we believe our valuation methods are appropriate, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. For additional discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value see Note 28, "Fair Value Measurements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The following is a description of the methodologies used in the valuation of significant financial assets and liabilities for which quoted market prices and observable market parameters are not available. 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Derivatives &#32; - We manage groups of derivative instruments with offsetting market and credit risks. Accordingly, we measure the fair value of each group of derivative instruments based on the exit price of the group's net risk position. The fair value of a net risk position is determined using internal models that utilize multiple market inputs. The majority of the market inputs can be validated through market consensus data. For complex or long-dated derivative products where market data is not available, fair value is sensitive to the limitation of the valuation model (model risk), the liquidity of the product (liquidity risk) and the assumptions about inputs not obtainable through price discovery process (data uncertainty risk). Accordingly, we make valuation adjustments to capture the risks and uncertainties. Because of the interrelated nature, we do not separately make an explicit adjustment to the fair value for each of these risks. Instead, we apply a range of assumptions to the valuation input that we believe implicitly incorporates adjustments for liquidity, model and data uncertainty risks. 

##TABLE_END We also include a credit valuation adjustment to reflect the credit risk associated with the net derivative positions. In estimating the credit valuation adjustment, we net the derivative positions by counterparties. The fair value for a net long credit risk position is adjusted for the counterparty's credit risk referred to as credit valuation adjustment whereas the fair value for a net short credit risk position is adjusted for HUSI's own credit risk referred to as debit valuation adjustment. We calculate the credit valuation adjustment by applying the probability of default of the counterparty to the expected exposure, and multiplying the result by the expected loss given default. We estimate the implied probability of default based on the credit spread of the specific counterparty observed in the credit default swap market. Where credit default spread of the counterparty is not available, we use the credit default spread of a specific proxy (e.g. the credit default swap spread of the counterparty's parent) or a proxy based on credit default swaps referencing to credit names of similar credit standing. 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Valuation of Securities &#32;- For the majority of our trading and available-for-sale securities, we obtain fair value for each security instrument from multiple independent pricing vendors ("IPV") and brokers, if available. We have established adequate controls in pricing vendor selection and fair value validation. The validation methods include but are not limited to comparisons among IPV prices for the same instrument, review and challenge of IPV valuation methodologies, inputs and assumptions, and the elapsed time between the date to which market data relates and the measurement date. For securities that are difficult to value, we use internal pricing models which estimate the fair value based on our assumptions in funding risk, default risk and loss upon default. We exercise significant judgment in estimating these assumptions and inputs to the valuation model. We believe these model inputs reflect market participants' assumptions about risks and the risk premium required to compensate for undertaking risks. For certain non-recourse instruments, we use the fair value of the collateral as a proxy to the measurement. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Structured Notes and Deposits &#32;- Structured notes and deposits are hybrid instruments containing embedded derivatives. The valuation of the hybrid instruments is predominantly driven by the derivative features embedded within the instruments and our own credit risk. Depending on the complexity of the embedded derivative, the same risk elements of valuation adjustments described in the derivative section above would also apply to hybrid instruments. In addition, cash flows for the funded notes and deposits are discounted at the relevant interest rates for the duration of the instrument adjusted for our own credit spreads. The credit spreads so applied are determined with reference to our own debt issuance rates observed in primary and secondary markets, internal funding rates and the structured note rates in recent executions. 

##TABLE_END Except for structured notes and deposits with embedded credit derivative features, the associated risks embedded in the hybrid instruments issued to customers are economically hedged with our affiliates through a freestanding derivative. As a result, HUSI is market risk neutral in substantially all of the structured notes and deposits. 

Because the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities are significantly impacted by the use of estimates, the use of different assumptions can result in changes in the estimated fair value of those assets and liabilities, which can result in equity and earnings volatility. 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. 

##TABLE_END

Derivatives Held for Hedging Derivatives designated as qualified hedges are tested for hedge effectiveness. For these transactions, assessments are made at the inception of the hedge and on a recurring basis, whether the derivative used in the hedging transaction has been and is expected to continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item. This assessment is conducted using statistical regression analysis. 

If we determine as a result of this assessment that a derivative is no longer a highly effective hedge, hedge accounting is discontinued as of the quarter in which such determination was made. The assessment of the effectiveness of the derivatives used in hedging transactions is considered to be a "critical accounting estimate" due to the use of statistical regression analysis in making this determination. Inputs to statistical regression analysis require the use of estimates regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows which are susceptible to significant changes in future periods based on changes in market rates as well as the selection of a convention for the treatment of credit spreads in the analysis. Statistical regression analysis also involves the use of additional assumptions including the determination of the period over which the analysis should occur. 

The outcome of the statistical regression analysis serves as the foundation for determining whether or not a derivative is highly effective as a hedging instrument. This can result in earnings volatility as the mark-to-market on derivatives which do not qualify as effective hedges and the ineffectiveness associated with qualifying fair value hedges are recorded in current period earnings. For example, a 10 percent adverse change in the value of our derivatives that do not qualify as effective hedges would have reduced revenue by approximately $53 million &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2019 . 

Regulators continue to actively work to help transition from LIBOR to an acceptable alternative, such as SOFR. The FASB has issued proposed changes to the U.S. GAAP guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting and is expected to issue final guidance during the first quarter of 2020 to mitigate the effect of this transition on financial reporting. Under the proposal, an entity would be allowed to account for the modification of a contract affected by reference rate reform as a continuation of the existing contract, if certain conditions are met. The proposed guidance would also allow an entity to continue to apply hedge accounting for hedging relationships in which the critical terms change due to reference rate reform. The proposed standard has a sunset date of December 31, 2022. 

As a result of these ongoing developments, significant accounting judgment remains in determining whether certain hedge accounting relationships that hedge the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or the variability of cash flows and interest rate risk due to changes in LIBOR continue to qualify for hedge accounting as of December 31, 2019. Management&#8217;s judgment is that those existing hedge accounting relationships continue to be supported at year-end. Even though there are plans to replace LIBOR with an acceptable alternative rate by the end of 2021, there is widespread continued reliance on LIBOR in market pricing structures for long-term products with maturities over hedging horizons that extend beyond the timescales for replacing LIBOR. This judgment will be kept under review in the future as markets for an alternative reference rate fully develop and the accounting guidance to deal with these unusual circumstances is finalized. 

Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance &#32;&#32; We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences related to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for tax credits and State net operating losses. Our net deferred tax assets, including deferred tax liabilities, totaled $1.3 billion &#32;and $1.4 billion &#32;at December 31, 2019 &#32;and 2018 , respectively. We evaluate our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering negative and positive evidence, including our historical financial performance, projections of future taxable income, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies and any carryback availability. We are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to earnings or equity if we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we estimate future taxable income based on management approved business plans. This process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period. Because the recognition of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant judgments about future earnings, the periods in which items will impact taxable income and the application of inherently complex tax laws, we have identified the assessment of deferred tax assets and the need for any related valuation allowance as a critical accounting estimate. 

We are included in HSBC North America's consolidated U.S. Federal income tax return and in various combined State tax returns. We have entered into a tax allocation agreement with HSBC North America and its subsidiary entities which governs the current amount of taxes to be paid or received by the various entities and, therefore, we look at HSBC North America and its affiliates in reaching conclusions on recoverability. Based on our forecasts of future taxable income, we currently anticipate that our continuing operations will generate sufficient taxable income to allow us to realize our deferred tax assets. 

The use of different assumptions of future earnings, the periods in which items will impact taxable income and the application of inherently complex tax laws can result in changes in the amounts of deferred tax items recognized, which can result in equity and earnings volatility because such changes are reported in current period earnings. Furthermore, if future events differ from our current forecasts, valuation allowances may need to be established or adjusted, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and capital position. We will continue to update our assumptions and forecasts of future taxable income and assess the need and adequacy of any valuation allowance. 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. 

##TABLE_END

Our interpretations of tax laws are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and State taxing authorities. Resolution of disputes over interpretations of tax laws may result in us being assessed additional income taxes. We regularly review whether we may be assessed such additional income taxes and recognize liabilities for such potential future tax obligations as appropriate. 

Additional detail on our assumptions with respect to the judgments made in evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets and on the components of our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2019 &#32;and 2018 &#32;can be found in Note 17, "Income Taxes," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Contingent Liabilities &#32;&#32;Both we and certain of our subsidiaries are parties to various legal proceedings resulting from ordinary business activities relating to our current and/or former operations. These actions include assertions concerning violations of laws and/or unfair treatment of consumers. We have also been subject to various governmental and regulatory proceedings. 

We estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different from those estimates. Our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case-by-case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case or proceeding, our experience and the experience of others in similar cases or proceedings and the opinions and views of legal counsel. 

Litigation and regulatory exposure is a critical accounting estimate because it represents a key area of judgment and is subject to uncertainty and certain factors outside of our control. Due to the inherent uncertainties and other factors involved in such matters, we cannot be certain that we will ultimately prevail in each instance. Such uncertainties impact our ability to determine whether it is probable that a liability exists and whether the amount can be reasonably estimated. Also, as the ultimate resolution of these proceedings is influenced by factors that are outside of our control, it is reasonably possible our estimated liability under these proceedings may change. We will continue to update our accruals for these legal, governmental and regulatory proceedings as facts and circumstances change. &#32; For further details, see Note 29, "Litigation and Regulatory Matters," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Short-Term Investments Short-term investments include cash and due from banks, interest bearing deposits with banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell.

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. 

##TABLE_END

December 31, 2018 &#32;due primarily to a redeployment of liquidity to trading security positions held as economic hedges of derivative products issued to clients as well as a managed reduction in liquidity driven by the repayment of long-term debt that matured or was repurchased during 2019.

Includes loans to HSBC affiliates which totaled $2,343 million &#32;and $2,274 million &#32;at December 31, 2019 &#32;and 2018 , respectively. 

##TABLE_END Commercial loans decreased compared with December 31, 2018 &#32;driven by paydowns from a few large global banking clients, partially offset by new business activity as we continued to apply a disciplined lending approach to grow the business. The decline in commercial non-affiliate loans was primarily in the banking, retailing, telecommunication and semiconductor industries, partially offset by growth in the consumer service industry. 

Consumer loans increased compared with December 31, 2018 &#32;due to higher residential mortgage loans which we continue to target towards our Premier and Advance customer relationships and higher credit card receivables due to increased customer activity and new product promotions which are targeted beyond our historical customer base. These increases were partially offset by a continued decline in home equity mortgages due to net paydowns. The increase in other consumer loans reflects a transfer of certain student loans from held for sale to held for investment as discussed below.

LTVs for first liens are calculated using the loan balance as of the reporting date. LTVs for second liens are calculated using the loan balance as of the reporting date plus the senior lien amount at origination. Current estimated property values are derived from the property's appraised value at the time of loan origination updated by the change in the Federal Housing Finance Agency's house pricing index ("HPI") at either a Core Based Statistical Area or state level. The estimated value of the homes could differ from actual fair values due to changes in condition of the underlying property, variations in housing price changes within metropolitan statistical areas and other factors. As a result, actual property values associated with loans that end in foreclosure may be significantly lower than the estimates used for purposes of this disclosure. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) &#160; 

Current estimated property values are calculated using the most current HPIs available and applied on an individual loan basis, which results in an approximate three month delay in the production of reportable statistics. Therefore, the information in the table above reflects current estimated property values using HPIs at September 30, 2019 &#32;and 2018, respectively.

Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. 

##TABLE_END Commercial loans held for sale decreased compared with December 31, 2018 . Included in commercial loans held for sale are certain loans that we no longer intend to hold for investment and were transferred to held for sale which totaled $34 million &#32;and $285 million &#32;at December 31, 2019 &#32;and 2018 , respectively. The decrease compared with December 31, 2018 was due to loan sales. 

Commercial loans held for sale also includes certain loans that we have elected to designate under the fair value option which consists of loans that we originate in connection with our participation in a number of syndicated credit facilities with the intent of selling them to unaffiliated third parties as well as loans that we purchase from the secondary market and hold as hedges against our exposure to certain total return swaps. The fair value of these loans totaled $178 million &#32;and $109 million &#32;at December 31, 2019 &#32;and 2018 , respectively. Balances will fluctuate from period to period depending on the volume and level of activity. 

Consumer loans held for sale decreased compared with December 31, 2018 . During the first quarter of 2019, we transferred $53 million &#32;of student loans that were previously classified as other consumer loans held for sale to held for investment as we now intend to hold these loans for the foreseeable future. 

Included in residential mortgage loans held for sale are agency-eligible residential mortgage loans which are originated and held for sale to third parties, currently on a servicing retained basis. Balances will fluctuate from period to period depending on the volume and level of activity. Gains and losses from the sale of these residential mortgage loans are reflected as a component of other income in the accompanying consolidated statement of income (loss). 

Excluding the commercial loans designated under fair value option discussed above, loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value, with adjustments to fair value being recorded as a valuation allowance through other revenues. The valuation allowance on consumer loans held for sale was $2 million &#32;and $4 million &#32;at December 31, 2019 &#32;and 2018 , respectively. The valuation allowance on commercial loans held for sale was nil &#32;and $3 million &#32;at December 31, 2019 &#32;and 2018 , respectively.

See Note 3, "Trading Assets and Liabilities," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a breakout of trading securities by category. 

##TABLE_END Trading securities balances increased compared with December 31, 2018 &#32;due primarily to increases in equity, foreign sovereign and U.S. Treasury positions. Trading security positions are held as economic hedges of interest rate, credit and equity derivative products issued to clients of domestic and emerging markets. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in corporate bond positions reflecting the unwind of one of our unconsolidated variable interest entities ("VIEs") which resulted in the termination of our investment in the VIE along with the related derivatives during the first quarter of 2019. Balances of securities sold, not yet purchased were higher compared with December 31, 2018 &#32;driven by an increase in short U.S. Treasury positions related to economic hedges of derivatives in the interest rate trading portfolio. 

Precious metals trading assets were relatively flat compared with December 31, 2018 &#32;as a decrease in our own gold inventory position held as economic hedges for client derivative activity was more than offset by an increase in our own silver inventory position held as economic hedges for client derivative activity and higher spot prices. Payables for precious metals were lower compared with December 31, 2018 &#32;reflecting a decline in borrowing of gold inventory to support client activity levels. Precious metal positions may not represent our net underlying exposure as we may use derivatives contracts to reduce our risk associated with these positions, the fair value of which would appear in derivatives in the table above. 

Derivative asset balances were flat compared with December 31, 2018 &#32;as higher balances from market movements were offset by the impact of higher netting of outstanding positions and cash collateral posted as well as the termination of derivatives associated with the unwind of an unconsolidated VIE as discussed above. Derivative liability balances decreased compared with December 31, 2018 &#32;as higher balances from market movements were more than offset by the impact of higher netting of outstanding positions and cash collateral posted as well as the termination of derivatives associated with the unwind of an unconsolidated VIE as discussed above. Market movements resulted in higher valuations of interest rate, equity, foreign exchange, commodity and credit derivatives. 

Securities Securities include securities available-for-sale and securities held-to-maturity. Securities balances were higher compared with December 31, 2018 &#32;driven by net purchases of U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury securities, partially offset by net sales of U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities as part of our continuing strategy to maximize returns while balancing the securities portfolio for risk management purposes. 

See Note 4, "Securities," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding our securities portfolios at December 31, 2019 and 2018. At December 31, 2017, our securities available-for-sale portfolio, which totaled $30,700 million, consisted of $29,060 million of U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government agency and U.S. Government sponsored obligations and $1,640 million of other available-for-sale securities and our securities held-to-maturity portfolio, which totaled $13,977 million, consisted of $13,962 million of U.S. Government agency and U.S. Government sponsored obligations, $12 million of U.S. state and political subdivision obligations and $3 million of other held-to-maturity securities. 

All Other Assets All other assets includes, among other items, properties and equipment, net and goodwill. All other assets was flat compared with December 31, 2018 &#32;as higher lease assets and higher outstanding clearing receivables from correspondent banks was offset by a goodwill impairment charge of $365 million &#32;recorded during the third quarter of 2019, representing a portion 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. 

##TABLE_END

of the goodwill previously allocated to our Retail Banking and Wealth Management reporting unit, as well as lower outstanding settlement balances related to security sales and lower margin requirements related to futures trading. As discussed more fully in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and &#32; New Accounting Pronouncements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the adoption of new accounting guidance resulted in a gross-up of our balance sheet to recognize lease liabilities and corresponding ROU assets for operating leases as of January 1, 2019. For additional discussion of the results of our annual goodwill impairment testing, see Note 9, "Goodwill," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Core deposits, as calculated in accordance with Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council ("FFIEC") guidelines, generally include all domestic demand, money market and other savings accounts, as well as time deposits with balances not exceeding $250,000. 

##TABLE_END Total deposits increased compared with December 31, 2018 &#32;due to an increase in wholesale time deposits driven by new issuances, higher retail deposits driven by promotional rates offered on savings accounts and increased commercial demand deposits reflecting increased business activity with a focus on high quality balances. These increases were partially offset by lower deposits from affiliates as well as lower deposits in Private Banking reflecting withdrawals from a few large clients. We continue to actively manage our balance sheet to increase profitability while maintaining adequate liquidity. 

Short-Term Borrowings Short-term borrowings were lower compared with December 31, 2018 &#32;due primarily to a decrease in securities sold under repurchase agreements resulting from the management of our short-term funding positions. 

Long-Term Debt Long-term debt decreased compared with December 31, 2018 &#32;as the impacts of debt issuances and fair value movements on fair value option debt were more than offset by debt retirements, including the repurchase of $1,269 million &#32;of subordinated long-term debt by HSBC Bank USA during the fourth quarter of 2019. See Note 14, "Long-Term Debt," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional details. Debt issuances during 2019 &#32;totaled $4,686 million , of which $1,755 million &#32;was issued by HSBC Bank USA. 

Incremental issuances from our shelf registration statement with the SEC totaled $2,931 million &#32;of senior structured notes during 2019 . &#32; Total long-term debt outstanding under this shelf was $13,295 million &#32;and $16,249 million &#32;at December 31, 2019 &#32;and 2018 , respectively. 

Incremental issuances from the HSBC Bank USA Global Bank Note Program totaled $755 million &#32;during 2019 . Total debt outstanding under this program was $2,908 million &#32;and $4,493 million &#32;at December 31, 2019 &#32;and 2018 , respectively. 

Borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York ("FHLB") totaled $1,000 million &#32;and $2,100 million &#32;at December 31, 2019 &#32;and 2018 , respectively. 

Interest, Taxes and Other Liabilities Interest, taxes and other liabilities increased compared with December 31, 2018 &#32;due primarily to higher lease liabilities due to the adoption of new accounting guidance as discussed above and higher outstanding settlement balances related to security purchases. 

Total Equity &#32;&#32;During the first quarter of 2019, we paid a distribution on our common stock of $2.4 billion &#32;from surplus capital to HSBC North America.

Represents the benefit associated with interest earning assets in excess of interest bearing liabilities. Increased percentages reflect growth in this excess or a higher cost of interest bearing liabilities, while decreased percentages reflect a reduction in this excess or a lower cost of interest bearing liabilities. 

##TABLE_END Net interest income decreased during 2019 &#32;due to higher interest expense on interest bearing liabilities due primarily to higher rates paid on deposits as well as lower interest income from short-term investments driven by lower average balances. These decreases were partially offset by increased interest income from loans, trading securities and securities driven by higher average balances and increased yields earned on loans reflecting the benefit of higher market rates during the first half of the year. 

Short-term investments &#32;&#32;Interest income decreased during 2019 &#32;driven by lower average balances on interest bearing deposits with banks, partially offset by higher yields earned on these balances reflecting the benefit of higher market rates during the first half of the year. 

Trading securities &#32;&#32;Interest income increased during 2019 &#32;due to higher average balances, partially offset by lower yields. The increase in average balances reflects increases in lower yielding foreign sovereign and U.S. Treasury positions which resulted in a shift in mix and a lower yield overall. Interest income associated with trading securities was partially offset within trading revenue by the performance of the associated derivatives as discussed further below. 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. 

##TABLE_END

Securities &#32;&#32;Interest income was higher during 2019 &#32;due primarily to higher average balances, partially offset by lower yields. The increase in average balances reflects increases in lower yielding U.S. Treasury and U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed securities which resulted in a shift in mix and a lower yield overall. 

Commercial loans Interest income increased during 2019 &#32;due to higher average balances driven by loan growth and higher yields reflecting the benefit of higher market rates during the first half of the year. 

Consumer loans &#32;&#32;Interest income was higher during 2019 &#32;due to higher yields on residential mortgages and higher average balances driven by growth in credit card receivables and residential mortgage loans. 

Other Higher interest income during 2019 &#32;due to higher yields on cash collateral posted. 

Deposits &#32;&#32;Interest expense increased during 2019 &#32;due primarily to higher rates paid on wholesale deposits reflecting the impact of higher market rates during the first half of the year and higher promotional rates offered to our retail customers on savings accounts and certificates of deposit compared with 2018. The increase in interest expense also reflects a shift in mix as the attrition of lower rate retail savings deposits driven by competitive pricing pressures was more than offset by increases in more expensive wholesale deposits and promotional retail deposits, which also resulted in higher average interest bearing deposit balances overall. 

Short-term borrowings &#32;&#32;Higher interest expense during 2019 &#32;was due primarily to higher average borrowings in commercial paper and federal funds purchased and, to a lesser extent, higher rates paid reflecting the impact of higher market rates during the first half of the year. 

Long-term debt &#32;&#32;Interest expense increased during 2019 &#32;as the impact of lower average borrowings, including the repurchase of $1,269 million &#32;of subordinated long-term debt by HSBC Bank USA during the fourth quarter of 2019, was more than offset by higher rates paid reflecting the impact of higher market rates during the first half of the year. 

Tax liabilities and other &#32;&#32;Interest expense was lower during 2019 &#32;as the impact of lower average borrowings in securities sold, not yet repurchased was largely offset by higher rates paid.

##TABLE_END

Our provision for credit losses increased $268 million &#32;during 2019 &#32;due to a higher provision for credit losses in our commercial loan portfolio and, to a lesser extent, our consumer loan portfolio. During 2019 , we increased our allowance for credit losses as the provision for credit losses was higher than net charge-offs by $96 million . During 2018, we decreased our allowance for credit losses as the provision for credit losses was lower than net charge-offs by $140 million. 

The provision for credit losses in our commercial loan portfolio increased $203 million &#32;during 2019 &#32;reflecting releases in credit reserves in 2018 compared with loss provisions in 2019. The releases in credit reserves in 2018 were due to improvements in the credit quality of our portfolio driven by paydowns, sales and maturities as well as improvements in credit conditions associated with certain clients in the energy sector at that time, partially offset by loss provisions for downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain client relationships and a higher provision for risk factors associated with geopolitical risks and market volatility inherent in certain segments of the portfolio. In 2019, loss provisions driven by downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients exposed to the energy and retail sectors were partially offset by releases in credit reserves 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. 

##TABLE_END

due to paydowns and improvements in credit conditions associated with certain clients as well as a release in credit reserves for risk factors associated with fraud. 

The provision for credit losses in our consumer loan portfolio was higher by $65 million &#32;during 2019 &#32;due primarily to a higher provision for credit losses on credit cards reflecting growth in balances due to increased customer activity and new product promotions, including higher dollars of delinquency and higher delinquency roll rates. Also contributing to the increase was a lower release in credit loss reserves on residential mortgages as the positive impacts of improvements in economic and credit conditions were more pronounced in 2018. 

Our methodology and accounting policies related to the allowance for credit losses are presented under the caption "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" in this MD&#38;A and in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. See "Credit Quality" in this MD&#38;A for additional discussion on the allowance for credit losses associated with our various loan portfolios.

Trust and investment management fees Trust and investment management fees decreased slightly during 2019 due primarily to lower average assets under management in Private Banking reflecting the impact of the client referral agreement with UBS Wealth Management Americas ("UBS"). See Note 10, "Sale of Certain Private Banking Client Relationships," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 

Other fees and commissions Other fees and commissions decreased during 2019 &#32;due to lower fees from loan syndication, loan commitments and other lending fees.

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) &#160; 

Derivatives trading revenue in all periods does not reflect associated net interest income as certain derivatives, such as total return swaps, were economically hedged by holding the underlying interest bearing referenced assets. 

##TABLE_END Trading revenue decreased during 2019 &#32;driven by lower Metals revenue due to a lower redeployment of liquidity to Metals, declining interest rates during the second half of the year and lower volatility in certain metals, including lower trading activity. Also contributing to the decrease in trading revenue was a loss of approximately $39 million &#32;recorded during the first quarter of 2019 related to the unwind of one of our unconsolidated VIEs which resulted in the termination of our investment in the VIE along with the related derivatives and a payment made to the derivative counterparty as a result of the termination. These decreases were partially offset by higher Derivatives revenue primarily related to emerging markets rate products and, to a lesser extent, interest rate swaps. The increase in other trading revenue reflects the impact of favorable funding spreads in 2019. 

Other securities gains, net We maintain securities portfolios as part of our balance sheet diversification and risk management strategies. During 2019 &#32;and 2018 , we sold $12,878 million &#32;and $5,169 million &#32;of primarily U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed and U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities as part of a continuing strategy to maximize returns while balancing the securities portfolio for risk management purposes. Other securities gains, net increased during 2019 &#32;reflecting the impact of higher sales activity compared with 2018. The gross realized gains and losses from sales of securities, which are included as a component of other securities gains, net above, are summarized in Note 4, "Securities," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates &#32;&#32;Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates was relatively flat during 2019 . 

Gain (loss) on instruments designated at fair value and related derivatives We have elected to apply fair value option accounting to certain commercial loans held for sale, a portion of our securities purchased and sold under resale and repurchase agreements, certain of our own fixed-rate debt issuances and all of our hybrid instruments issued, including structured notes and deposits. We also use derivatives to economically hedge the interest rate and other risks associated with certain financial liabilities for which fair value option accounting has been elected. Gain (loss) on instruments designated at fair value and related derivatives was lower during 2019 &#32;attributable to unfavorable movements related to the economic hedging of interest rate risk within our own debt, partially offset by favorable movements related to the economic hedging of interest rate and other risks within our structured deposits. See Note 16, "Fair Value Option," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information including a breakout of these amounts by individual component. 

Other income &#160; Beginning January 1, 2019, fair value hedge ineffectiveness is recorded in net interest income, rather than other income. During 2018, fair value hedge ineffectiveness resulted in a gain in other income of $13 million . Excluding this item, other income remained higher in 2019 &#32;due primarily to a net gain on extinguishment of debt recorded in 2019, including a gain of $84 million &#32;on extinguishment of long-term debt in the fourth quarter and a loss of $14 million &#32;on extinguishment of certain repurchase agreements in the third quarter. Also contributing to the increase was higher income associated with bank owned life insurance. These increases were partially offset by higher losses in miscellaneous income associated with credit default swap protection which largely reflects the hedging of a single client relationship as well as higher losses on the swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of Visa Class B Shares. In 2019 , we recorded a loss of $52 million &#32;(of which $48 million &#32;was recorded during the fourth quarter) related to an increase in the expected timing of the final resolution of the related litigation and, to a lesser extent, 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc.

changes in the Visa Class B Share conversion rate. In 2018, we recorded a loss of $7 million &#32;related to a change in the Visa Class B Share conversion rate.

##TABLE_END

Salaries and employee benefits Salaries and employee benefits expense decreased slightly during 2019 &#32;as lower pension expense, higher health care reimbursements and lower temporary staff costs were largely offset by higher salaries expense and higher severance costs. While continued cost management efforts, including targeted staff reductions to optimize staffing and improve efficiency, resulted in a decline in the average number of personnel, the impact of these reductions on salaries expense was more than offset by the addition of personnel associated with growth initiatives in certain businesses. 

Support services from HSBC affiliates Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates increased during 2019 &#32;due primarily to increased costs associated with our business systems as well as higher allocated severance and lease impairment costs. These increases were partially offset by lower cost allocations from our technology, operations, risk and compliance support service functions. A summary of the services received from various HSBC affiliates is included in Note 23, "Related Party Transactions," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Occupancy expense, net Prior to 2019, occupancy expense was impacted by the amortization of the deferred gain associated with the sale and leaseback of our 452 Fifth Avenue property, which resulted in the recognition of a gain of $6 million during 2018 . In January 2019, we adopted new accounting guidance which resulted in a cumulative effect adjustment to recognize the previously deferred gain in retained earnings on January 1, 2019. Excluding this item, occupancy expense remained higher during 2019 &#32;due to charges of $19 million &#32;recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we determined that we would exit certain branches and, as a result, we recorded impairment of the lease ROU assets and other related costs associated with these branches. This increase was partially offset by lower rent expense and lower maintenance costs. 

Goodwill impairment Reflects a goodwill impairment charge of $365 million &#32;recorded during the third quarter of 2019 , representing a portion of the goodwill previously allocated to our Retail Banking and Wealth Management reporting unit. See Note 9, "Goodwill," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion. 

Other expenses Other expenses were lower during 2019 &#32;due primarily to lower expense related to legal matters driven by expense of $492 million &#32;recorded in 2018 related to the settlement of a mortgage securitization legal matter. Also contributing to the decrease was lower deposit insurance assessment fees due primarily to removal of the temporary surcharge in December 2018 and a lower

##TABLE_END

assessment rate as well as lower foreclosure related expenses and lower professional fees. These decreases were partially offset by higher marketing expense, higher capitalized software amortization expense and higher off-balance sheet credit reserves. 

Efficiency ratio Our efficiency ratio increased slightly during 2019 &#32;as lower net interest income and lower other revenues were largely offset by lower operating expenses as discussed in detail above. 

Income tax expense Our effective tax rate was 58.1 percent &#32;in 2019 &#32;compared with 45.4 percent &#32;in 2018 &#32;and 117.1 percent &#32;in 2017 . For a complete analysis of the differences between effective tax rates based on the total income tax provision attributable to pretax income and the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate, see Note 17, "Income Taxes," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

The Tax Legislation enacted in 2017 contains certain complex provisions such as the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax ("BEAT"), which, if applicable could have a material impact on income tax expense and taxes payable for the HSBC North America consolidated tax group, of which we are a member. In December 2019, the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department issued final regulations (the "Final Regulations") related to the BEAT, which provide guidance and clarify some of the key aspects of this tax which were not addressed in the Tax Legislation. Based on the Tax Legislation and the Final Regulations, we currently do not anticipate a material impact on HUSI&#8217;s financial position or results of operations from the BEAT and have not recorded a liability for the BEAT as of December 31, 2019 . 

Segment Results &#8211; Group Reporting Basis 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

##TABLE_END

We have five distinct business segments that we utilize for management reporting and analysis purposes, which are aligned with HSBC's global business strategy: Retail Banking and Wealth Management ("RBWM"), Commercial Banking ("CMB"), Global Banking and Markets ("GB&#38;M"), Private Banking ("PB") and a Corporate Center ("CC"). See Item 1, "Business," in this Form 10-K for a description of our segments, which are based upon our global businesses, including a discussion of the main business activities of the segments and a summary of their products and services. There have been no changes in the basis of our segmentation as compared with the presentation in our 2018 Form 10-K. 

Net interest income of each segment represents the difference between actual interest earned on assets and interest incurred on liabilities of the segment, adjusted for a funding charge or credit that includes both interest rate and liquidity components. Segments are charged a cost to fund assets (e.g. customer loans) and receive a funding credit for funds provided (e.g. customer deposits) based on equivalent market rates that incorporate both repricing (interest rate risk) and tenor (liquidity) characteristics. The objective of these charges/credits is to transfer interest rate risk from the segments to one centralized unit in Balance Sheet Management, recognize term funding costs/benefits and more appropriately reflect the profitability of the segments. 

Certain other revenue and operating expense amounts are also apportioned among the business segments based upon the benefits derived from this activity or the relationship of this activity to other segment activity. These inter-segment transactions have not been eliminated, and we generally account for them as if they were with third parties. 

We report financial information to our parent, HSBC, in accordance with HSBC Group accounting and reporting policies, which apply IFRS issued by the IASB and endorsed by the EU, and, as a result, our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the Group Reporting Basis as operating results are monitored and reviewed, trends are evaluated and decisions about allocating resources, such as employees, are primarily made on this basis. We continue, however, to monitor capital adequacy and report to regulatory agencies on a U.S. GAAP basis. 

There have been no changes in the measurement of segment profit as compared with the presentation in our 2018 Form 10-K. We are currently reviewing the financial information used to manage our business, including the scope and content of the financial data being reported to our management and our Board of Directors within the Corporate Center, any changes to which would impact our other business segments. In February 2020 as part of a business update, we also announced certain changes involving our global businesses including RBWM and PB. To the extent we make changes to the financial information being reported to our management and our Board of Directors in the future, we will evaluate any impact such changes may have on our segment reporting. 

The significant differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis as they impact our results are summarized in Note 24, "Business Segments," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

2018 compared with 2017 &#32;&#32;See "Segment Results - Group Reporting Basis" in our 2018 Form 10-K for a discussion of our segment results for 2018 compared with 2017. See below for a discussion of our segment results for 2019 compared with 2018.

During 2017, retail business banking and other reflects a gain of approximately $312 million on the sale of Visa Class B Shares and a loss of $73 million on the sale of certain partially charged-off residential mortgages. 

##TABLE_END Our RBWM segment reported a higher loss before tax during 2019 due to higher operating expenses driven by a goodwill impairment charge of $209 million &#32;recorded during the third quarter of 2019, representing a portion of the goodwill previously allocated to this segment, as well as higher expected credit losses, lower other operating income and lower net interest income. See Note 9, "Goodwill," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the factors which led to the impairment. 

Net interest income decreased during 2019 due primarily to lower deposit spreads and, to a lesser extent, lower spreads on residential mortgages, partially offset by higher net interest income from credit cards driven by higher loan balances. 

Other operating income decreased during 2019 due primarily to higher losses on the swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of Visa Class B Shares. In 2019 , we recorded a loss of $52 million &#32;(of which $48 million &#32;was recorded during the fourth quarter) related to an increase in the expected timing of the final resolution of the related litigation and, to a lesser extent, changes in the Visa Class B Share conversion rate. In 2018, we recorded a loss of $7 million &#32;related to a change in the Visa Class B Share conversion rate. Also contributing to the decrease was lower cost reimbursements associated with shared service activities performed on behalf of other HSBC affiliates, including the non-recurrence of approximately $10 million of cost reimbursements recorded in 2018 associated with enhancing the HSBC Group's digital banking platform. 

Expected credit losses were higher during 2019 due primarily to higher expected credit losses in credit cards reflecting growth in balances due to increased customer activity and new product promotions, including higher delinquency, as well as higher expected credit losses in residential mortgages as the positive impacts of improvements in economic and credit conditions were more pronounced in 2018. 

Excluding the goodwill impairment as discussed above, operating expenses decreased during 2019 driven by lower foreclosure related expenses, lower deposit insurance assessment fees due primarily to removal of the temporary surcharge in December 2018 and a lower assessment rate as well as lower cost allocations from our risk and compliance support service functions. These decreases were partially offset by higher legal expense and higher marketing expense.

##TABLE_END

Our CMB segment reported a lower profit before tax during 2019 due to higher expected credit losses, partially offset by higher net interest income and lower operating expenses. 

Net interest income increased during 2019 due to the favorable impact of higher loan balances as we continued to apply a disciplined lending approach to grow the business. 

Other operating income was flat during 2019 as a loss on extinguishment of long-term debt in 2019 was offset by higher fees from credit cards and account services. 

Expected credit losses were higher during 2019 due to higher loss estimates for downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients exposed to the energy and retail sectors as well as loan growth, partially offset by releases in credit reserves due to paydowns and improvements in credit conditions associated with certain clients. In 2018, releases in credit reserves were driven by paydowns, sales and maturities as well as improvements in credit conditions associated with certain clients in the energy sector at that time. 

Operating expenses decreased during 2019 due to lower deposit insurance assessment fees due primarily to removal of the temporary surcharge in December 2018 and a lower assessment rate as well as lower cost allocations from our risk and compliance support service functions. These decreases were partially offset by higher staff costs and increased costs associated with our business systems.

##TABLE_END Our GB&#38;M segment reported a lower profit before tax during 2019 due to higher expected credit losses and lower net interest income, partially offset by higher other operating income. 

Credit revenue decreased during 2019 due to lower revenue from structuring and collateralized financing related activity. 

Rates revenue increased during 2019 due to higher revenue from emerging markets rate products and interest rate swaps. 

Foreign Exchange and Metals revenue decreased during 2019 due primarily to a decline in trading activity in Metals and a lower redeployment of liquidity to Metals. 

Equities revenue decreased during 2019 due to lower client activity in structured equity derivatives, partially offset by increased activity in prime brokerage. 

Global Banking revenue decreased during 2019 due to lower fees from loan syndication, loan commitments and other lending fees as well as lower net interest income from spread compression and higher losses associated with credit default swap protection which largely reflects the hedging of a single client exposure. 

Global Liquidity and Cash Management revenue decreased during 2019 due to lower net interest income from spread compression. 

Securities Services revenue was higher during 2019 due to higher revenue from additional direct custody and clearing client activity. 

Global Trade and Receivables Finance revenue was relatively flat during 2019. 

Credit and funding valuation adjustments improved in 2019 attributable primarily to favorable credit valuation adjustments on derivative assets driven by a decline in expected exposure. 

Other revenue decreased during 2019 due to a loss on extinguishment of long-term debt in 2019, partially offset by higher cost reimbursements. 

Expected credit losses reflected higher releases in credit reserves in 2018 due to improvements in the credit quality of our portfolio driven by paydowns, sales and maturities as well as improvements in credit conditions associated with certain client clients at that time, including the upgrade of a single oil and gas industry client. In 2019, releases in credit reserves due to paydowns and improvements in credit conditions associated with certain clients were offset by higher loss estimates for downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain client relationships. 

Operating expenses were lower during 2019 due to lower deposit insurance assessment fees due primarily to removal of the temporary surcharge in December 2018 and a lower assessment rate, partially offset by higher expense related to legal matters.

In August 2017, our PB business entered into an agreement to refer parts of its Latin America portfolio, consisting primarily of clients based in areas where we do not have a corporate presence, including Central America and the Andean Pact, to UBS for a period of two years, which concluded during the third quarter of 2019. Under the terms of the agreement, we facilitated the referral of these client relationships to UBS for a fee, including the transfer of client assets, consisting of client investments and deposits, as well as the transfer of the relationship managers and client service employees that supported these clients. Loans associated with these client relationships were not included in the agreement. Total operating income associated with these client relationships was approximately $1 million, $14 million and $51 million during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

##TABLE_END

Our PB segment reported a loss before tax during 2019 compared with a profit before tax during 2018 due to lower net interest income, lower other operating income and higher expected credit losses, partially offset by lower operating expenses. 

Net interest income decreased during 2019 due primarily to the impact of lower deposit balances reflecting the impact of the client referral agreement with UBS as well as withdrawals from a few large clients as well as spread compression. 

Other operating income decreased in 2019 driven by a decline in investment management fees reflecting lower average assets under management as well as a loss on extinguishment of long-term debt in 2019. These decreases were partially offset by the non-recurrence of a $3 million loss recorded in 2018 as a result of a decline in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration receivable associated with the sale discussed above. 

Expected credit losses were higher during 2019 due to higher loss estimates in the mortgage portfolio. 

Operating expenses decreased during 2019 due to lower deposit insurance assessment fees due primarily to removal of the temporary surcharge in December 2018 and a lower assessment rate as well as lower staff costs and lower cost allocations from our risk and compliance support service functions.

##TABLE_END Our CC segment reported a lower loss before tax during 2019 due to lower operating expenses driven by expense of $494 million recorded in 2018 related to the settlement of a mortgage securitization legal matter, partially offset by lower other operating income and lower net interest income. 

Net interest income was lower during 2019 due to lower net interest income in Balance Sheet Management driven by lower yields. This decrease was partially offset by improved net interest income from legacy structured credit products and the impact of the liquidity framework we adopted in preparation for the planned implementation of the Net Stable Funding Ratio ("NSFR") which provided a temporary cap on the net liquidity charge to GB&#38;M until 2020. Lower liquidity charges in GB&#38;M resulted in lower excess liquidity charges being retained in the CC compared with 2018. See "Risk Management" in this MD&#38;A for additional discussion of the NSFR. 

Other operating income decreased during 2019 due primarily to unfavorable movements related to the economic hedging of interest rate risk within our own debt, lower revenue from legacy structured credit products, including a loss of approximately $39 million &#32;recorded in 2019 related to the unwind of one of our unconsolidated VIEs, and a loss of $14 million &#32;recorded in 2019 on the extinguishment of certain repurchase agreements. These decreases were partially offset by higher gains on asset sales in Balance Sheet Management. 

Expected credit losses decreased during 2019 due to higher loss estimates on certain financial assets in 2018. 

Operating expenses were lower during 2019 due primarily to lower expense related to legal matters driven by expense recorded in 2018 related to the settlement of a mortgage securitization legal matter as discussed above. These decreases were partially offset by higher lease impairment related costs, including charges related to the exit of certain branches and allocated charges from HTSU, as well as higher allocated severance costs. 

Reconciliation of Segment Results As previously discussed, segment results are reported on a Group Reporting Basis. See Note 24, "Business Segments," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of our Group Reporting Basis segment results to U.S. GAAP consolidated totals. 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. 

##TABLE_END

Credit Quality ##TABLE_START &#160; 

##TABLE_END

In the normal course of business, we enter into a variety of transactions that involve both on and off-balance sheet credit risk. Principal among these activities is lending to various commercial, institutional, governmental and individual customers. We participate in lending activity throughout the U.S. and, on a limited basis, internationally. 

Our reported results under U.S. GAAP reflect the following methodologies for establishing the allowance for credit losses. 

Allowance for Credit Losses Commercial loans are monitored on a continuous basis with a formal assessment completed, at a minimum, annually. As part of this process, a credit grade and loss given default are assigned and an allowance is established for these loans based on a probability of default estimate associated with each credit grade under the allowance for credit losses methodology. Credit Review, a function independent of the business, provides an ongoing assessment of lending activities that includes independently assessing credit grades and loss given default estimates for sampled credits across various portfolios. When it is deemed probable based upon known facts and circumstances that full interest and principal on an individual loan will not be collected in accordance with its contractual terms, the loan is considered impaired. An impairment reserve is then established primarily based on the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate, or as a practical expedient, the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent or the loan's observable market price if the loan is traded in the market. Updated appraisals for collateral dependent loans are generally obtained only when such loans are considered troubled and the frequency of such updates are generally based on management judgment under the specific circumstances on a case-by-case basis. In addition, loss reserves on commercial loans are maintained to reflect our judgment of portfolio risk factors which may not be fully reflected in the reserve calculations. 

Our probability of default estimates for commercial loans are mapped to our credit grade master scale. These probability of default estimates are validated on an annual basis using back-testing of actual default rates and benchmarking of the internal ratings with external rating agency data like Standard and Poor's ("S&#38;P") ratings and default rates. Substantially all appraisals in connection with commercial real estate loans are ordered by the independent real estate appraisal review unit at HSBC. The appraisal must be reviewed and accepted by this unit. For loans greater than $250,000, an appraisal is generally ordered when the loan is classified as Substandard as defined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC"). On average, it takes approximately four weeks from the time the appraisal is ordered until it is completed and the values accepted by HSBC's independent appraisal review unit. Subsequent provisions or charge-offs are completed shortly thereafter, generally within the quarter in which the appraisal is received. 

In situations where an external appraisal is not used to determine the fair value of the underlying collateral of impaired loans, current information such as rent rolls and operating statements of the subject property are reviewed and presented in a standardized format. Operating results such as net operating income and cash flows before and after debt service are established and reported with relevant ratios. Third-party market data is gathered and reviewed for relevance to the subject collateral. Data is also collected from similar properties within the portfolio. Actual sales levels of properties, operating income and expense figures and rental data on a square foot basis are derived from existing loans and, when appropriate, used as comparables for the subject property. Property specific data, augmented by market data research, is used to project a stabilized year of income and expense to create a 10-year cash flow model to be discounted at appropriate rates to present value. These valuations are then used to determine if any impairment on the underlying loans exists and an appropriate allowance is recorded when warranted. 

For loans identified as TDR Loans, an allowance for credit losses is maintained primarily based on the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate, or as a practical expedient, the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent or, for commercial loans, the observable market price if the loan is traded in the market. The circumstances in which we perform a loan modification involving a TDR Loan at a then current market interest rate for a borrower with similar credit risk would include other changes to the terms of the original loan made as part of the restructuring (e.g. principal reductions, collateral changes, etc.) in order for the loan to be classified as a TDR Loan. 

For pools of homogeneous consumer loans and certain small business loans which do not qualify as TDR Loans, we estimate probable losses using a roll rate migration analysis that estimates the likelihood that a loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately charge-off &#32; based upon recent historical performance experience of other loans in our portfolio. This migration analysis incorporates estimates of the period of time between a loss occurring and the confirming event of its charge-off. This analysis considers delinquency status, loss experience and severity and takes into account whether borrowers have filed for bankruptcy or have been subject to account management actions, such as the re-age or modification of accounts. We also take into consideration the loss severity expected based on the underlying collateral, if any, for the loan in the event of default based on historical and recent trends which are updated monthly based on a rolling average of several months' data using the most recently available information. 

&#160; The roll rate methodology is a migration analysis based on contractual delinquency and rolling average historical loss experience which captures the increased likelihood of an account migrating to charge-off as the past due status of such account increases. The roll rate models used were developed by tracking the movement of delinquencies by age of delinquency over a specified time

period. Each stage of delinquency represents a period of delinquency in 30-day increments. The roll from the last delinquency stage results in charge-off. Contractual delinquency is a method for determining aging of past due accounts based on the status of payments under the loan. Average roll rates are developed to avoid temporary aberrations caused by seasonal trends in delinquency experienced by some product types. We have determined that a 12-month average roll rate balances the desire to avoid temporary aberrations, while at the same time analyzing recent historical data. The roll rate calculations are performed monthly and are done consistently from period to period. We regularly monitor our portfolio to evaluate the period of time utilized in our roll rate migration analysis and perform a formal review on an annual basis. In addition, loss reserves on consumer loans are maintained to reflect our judgment of portfolio risk factors which may not be fully reflected in the statistical roll rate calculation. Our residential mortgage loan allowance for credit losses in all periods reflects consideration of risk factors relating to trends such as recent portfolio performance as compared with average roll rates as well as housing market trends and second lien exposure. 

Our allowance for credit losses methodology and our accounting policies related to the allowance for credit losses are presented in further detail under the caption "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" in this MD&#38;A and in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Our approach toward credit risk management is summarized under the caption "Risk Management" in this MD&#38;A.

##TABLE_START (1) &#160; 

The provision for credit losses and charge-offs for residential mortgage loans during 2016 includes $11 million related to the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment attributable to credit factors for loans transferred to held for sale. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) &#160; 

For collateral dependent loans that are transferred to held for sale, the existing allowance for credit losses at the time of transfer are recognized as a charge-off. We transferred to held for sale certain residential mortgage loans during 2016 and, accordingly, we recognized the existing allowance for credit losses on these loans as additional charge-offs totaling $22 million during 2016. 

##TABLE_END The allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2019 &#32; increased &#32; $96 million &#32;or 18 percent &#32;as compared with December 31, 2018 &#32;due to higher loss estimates in both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios. Our commercial allowance for credit losses at 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. 

##TABLE_END

December 31, 2019 &#32; increased &#32; $49 million &#32;or 11 percent &#32;as compared with December 31, 2018 &#32;due primarily to downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients exposed to the energy and retail sectors, partially offset by releases in credit reserves due to paydowns and improvements in credit conditions associated with certain clients as well as charge-offs and a release in credit reserves for risk factors associated with fraud. Our consumer allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2019 &#32; increased &#32; $47 million &#32;or 57 percent &#32;as compared with December 31, 2018 &#32;due primarily to a higher allowance for credit losses in credit cards reflecting growth in balances due to increased customer activity and new product promotions, including higher dollars of delinquency and higher delinquency roll rates. 

The allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2018 decreased $140 million or 21 percent as compared with December 31, 2017 due to lower loss estimates in our commercial loan portfolio, partially offset by higher loss estimates in our consumer loan portfolio. Our commercial allowance for credit losses decreased $150 million or 25 percent as compared with December 31, 2017 reflecting improvements in the credit quality of our portfolio driven by paydowns, sales and maturities as well as improvements in credit conditions associated with certain clients. These decreases were partially offset by a higher provision for risk factors associated with geopolitical risks and market volatility inherent in certain segments of the portfolio and higher provisions for downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain client relationships. Our consumer allowance for credit losses increased $10 million or 14 percent as compared with December 31, 2017 due to a higher allowance for credit losses in credit cards reflecting growth in customer activity driven by new product promotions along with an associated increase in dollars of delinquency, partially offset by a lower allowance for credit losses in residential mortgages and home equity mortgages due to improvements in economic and credit conditions, including lower dollars of delinquency. 

The allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2017 decreased $336 million or 33 percent as compared with December 31, 2016 due primarily to lower loss estimates in our commercial loan portfolio and, to a lesser extent, lower loss estimates in our consumer loan portfolio. Our commercial allowance for credit losses decreased $322 million or 35 percent as compared with December 31, 2016 largely due to improvements in the credit quality of our portfolio driven by managed reductions in certain exposures, releases of reserves due to paydowns and maturities exceeding new loan originations as we continued to focus efforts on improving returns, improvements in credit conditions associated with certain client relationships and the partial charge-off of a single mining client relationship. Our consumer allowance for credit losses decreased $14 million or 16 percent as compared with December 31, 2016 due to improvements in economic and credit conditions, the origination of higher quality Premier mortgages and lower loss estimates in our home equity mortgage portfolio reflecting lower outstanding balances. These decreases were partially offset by the impact of a slight increase in delinquency levels. 

The allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2016 increased $105 million or 12 percent as compared with December 31, 2015 due to higher loss estimates in our commercial loan portfolio, partially offset by lower loss estimates in our consumer loan portfolio. Our commercial allowance for credit losses increased $151 million or 19 percent as compared with December 31, 2015 primarily due to higher loss estimates associated with the deterioration of the single mining customer relationship and, to a lesser extent, other downgrades reflecting weaknesses in the financial condition of certain customer relationships, including mining and other industry loan exposures. These increases were partially offset by charge-offs associated with oil and gas industry loan exposures, including a large impaired oil and gas industry loan that was sold. Our consumer allowance for credit losses decreased $46 million or 35 percent as compared with December 31, 2015 primarily due to charge-offs associated with the transfers of mortgages to held for sale as well as releases of reserves related to certain residential mortgages serviced by others as a result of updated information regarding the underlying loan characteristics being reported by the servicers and improved loss estimates associated with certain home equity mortgages. The decrease also reflects lower loss estimates driven by improvements in economic and credit conditions and the origination of higher quality Premier mortgages. 

The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment at December 31, 2019 , 2018, 2017 and 2016 increased or decreased compared with their respective prior year periods for the reasons discussed above. 

The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of net charge-offs at December 31, 2019 &#32;decreased as compared with December 31, 2018 &#32;as an increase in dollars of net charge-offs driven by higher charge-offs in our consumer loan portfolio, primarily credit cards, outpaced the increase in our allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above. In 2018, the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of net charge-offs increased as a decrease in dollars of net charge-offs driven by lower charge-offs in our commercial loan portfolio associated with a single mining client relationship and loan sales outpaced the decrease in our overall allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above. In 2017, the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of net charge-offs was relatively flat as lower dollars of net charge-offs in both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios was largely offset by a decrease in our overall allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above. In 2016, the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of net charge-offs decreased as the increase in dollars of net charge-offs largely driven by higher charge-offs associated with oil and gas industry loan exposures in our commercial loan portfolio, including a large impaired oil and gas industry loan that was sold, outpaced the increase in our overall allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above. 

The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans held for investment at December 31, 2019 &#32;was relatively flat as compared with December 31, 2018 &#32;as an increase in nonperforming loans driven by higher nonperforming loans in both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios was offset by the increase in our allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed

above. In 2018, the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans held for investment increased driven by a decrease in nonperforming loans due primarily to managed reductions in certain exposures in our commercial loan portfolio which was partially offset by a decrease in our overall allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above.

Off-balance sheet reserves increased in 2019 reflecting higher outstanding exposure and downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain client relationships. In 2018 and 2017, off-balance sheet reserves decreased reflecting managed reductions in certain exposures and improvements in credit conditions associated with certain client relationships. In 2016, off-balance sheet reserves increased reflecting the impact of downgrades in oil and gas industry and other industry loan exposures.

Our two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio was relatively flat compared with both September 30, 2019 &#32;and December 31, 2018 &#32;as lower dollars of delinquency in our commercial loan portfolio was offset by higher dollars of delinquency in our consumer loan portfolio and, as compared with September 30, 2019, lower outstanding loan balances driven by a decrease in the commercial loan portfolio. 

Our commercial loan two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio decreased 7 basis points compared with September 30, 2019 &#32;driven largely by the collection of a global banking loan which became 60 days delinquent in the third quarter, partially offset by lower outstanding loan balances. Compared with December 31, 2018 , our commercial loan two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio decreased 4 &#32;basis points due to improved collections. 

Our consumer loan two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio increased 9 basis points compared with September 30, 2019 &#32;due to higher dollars of delinquency in residential mortgages and credit cards reflecting seasonality and growth in balances in credit cards due to increased customer activity and new product promotions. Compared with December 31, 2018 , our consumer loan two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio was relatively flat as higher dollars of credit card delinquency reflecting growth in balances due to increased customer activity and new product promotions and slightly higher dollars of residential

Our net charge-off ratio as a percentage of average loans increased 4 basis points for the full year of 2019 compared with the full year of 2018 due primarily to higher levels of net charge-offs in our consumer loan portfolio driven by higher charge-offs in credit cards reflecting growth in balances due to increased customer activity and new product promotions. 

&#160; Our net charge-off ratio as a percentage of average loans decreased 15 basis points for the full year of 2018 compared with the full year of 2017 due to lower levels of net charge-offs in our commercial loan portfolio associated with a single mining client relationship and loan sales. This decrease was partially offset by slightly higher levels of net charge-offs in our consumer loan portfolio.

##TABLE_START (1) &#160; 

At December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017, nonaccrual consumer mortgage loans include $289 million , $289 million &#32;and $360 million respectively, of loans that are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) &#160; 

Nonaccrual consumer mortgage loans held for investment include all loans which are 90 or more days contractually delinquent as well as loans discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not re-affirmed and second lien loans where the first lien loan that we own or service is 90 or more days contractually delinquent. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) &#160; 

Nonaccrual consumer mortgage loans for all periods does not include guaranteed loans purchased from the Government National Mortgage Association. Repayment of these loans is predominantly insured by the Federal Housing Administration and as such, these loans have different risk characteristics from the rest of our customer loan portfolio. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) &#160; 

Includes $1 million or less of commercial other real estate owned at December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

##TABLE_END Nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2019 &#32;increased compared with December 31, 2018 &#32;due primarily to higher levels of nonaccrual loans in our commercial loan portfolio driven by downgrades, partially offset by paydowns and charge-offs. Nonaccrual loans in our consumer loan portfolio also increased compared with December 31, 2018 largely due to some Private Banking residential mortgage customers which became 90 days past due. Accruing loans past due 90 days or more increased compared with December 31, 2018 &#32;due to an increase in credit cards reflecting growth in balances due to increased customer activity and new product promotions. 

Nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2018 decreased as compared with December 31, 2017 due primarily to lower levels of nonaccrual loans in our commercial loan portfolio driven by managed reductions in certain exposures, including the sale of a single mining client relationship. Nonaccrual loans in our consumer loan portfolio were also lower primarily reflecting improvements in economic and credit conditions. Accruing loans past due 90 days or more increased as compared with December 31, 2017 driven by higher accruing loans past due 90 days or more in credit cards reflecting growth in customer activity driven by new product promotions. 

Accrued but unpaid interest on loans placed on nonaccrual status generally is reversed and reduces current income at the time loans are so categorized. Interest income on these loans may be recognized to the extent of cash payments received. Our policies and practices for problem loan management and placing loans on nonaccrual status are summarized in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Impaired Commercial Loans A commercial loan is considered to be impaired when it is deemed probable that not all principal and interest amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will be collected. Probable losses from impaired loans are quantified and recorded as a component of the overall allowance for credit losses. Generally, impaired commercial loans 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. 

##TABLE_END

include loans in nonaccrual status, loans that have been assigned a specific allowance for credit losses, loans that have been partially charged off and TDR Loans. The following table summarizes impaired commercial loan statistics:

Commercial impaired loans increased in 2019 driven by increased nonaccrual loans for the reasons discussed above, partially offset by the paydown of a large accruing TDR Loan. In 2018, commercial impaired loans decreased largely due to lower nonaccrual loans, including TDR Loans, for the reasons discussed above. 

Criticized Loans Criticized loan classifications presented in the table below are determined by the assignment of various criticized facility grades based on the risk rating standards of our regulator. The following facility grades are deemed to be criticized: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Special Mention &#160;&#8211; generally includes loans that are protected by collateral and/or the credit worthiness of the customer, but are potentially weak based upon economic or market circumstances which, if not checked or corrected, could weaken our credit position at some future date. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Substandard &#160;&#8211; includes loans that are inadequately protected by the underlying collateral and/or general credit worthiness of the customer. These loans present a distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Doubtful &#160;&#8211; includes loans that have all the weaknesses exhibited by substandard loans, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full of the recorded loan highly improbable. However, although the possibility of loss is extremely high, certain factors exist which may strengthen the credit at some future date, and therefore the decision to charge-off the loan is deferred. Loans graded as doubtful are required to be placed in nonaccruing status.

Concentration of Credit Risk A concentration of credit risk is defined as a significant credit exposure with an individual or group engaged in similar activities or affected similarly by economic conditions. We enter into a variety of transactions in the normal course of business that involve both on and off-balance sheet credit risk. Principal among these activities is lending to various commercial, institutional, governmental and individual customers throughout the United States and internationally. We manage the varying degrees of credit risk associated with on and off-balance sheet transactions through specific credit policies and procedures which provide for a strict approval, monitoring and reporting process. It is our policy to require collateral when it is deemed appropriate. Varying degrees and types of collateral are secured depending upon management's credit evaluation. 

Our consumer loan portfolio includes the following types of loans: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Interest-only loans &#8211; A loan which allows a customer to pay the interest-only portion of the monthly payment for a period of time which results in lower payments during the initial loan period. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Adjustable rate mortgage ("ARM") loans &#8211; A loan which allows us to adjust pricing on the loan in line with market movements. 

##TABLE_END The following table summarizes the balances of interest-only and ARM loans in our loan portfolios at December 31, 2019 &#32;and 2018 . Each category is not mutually exclusive and loans may appear in more than one category below.

Cross-Border Net Outstandings Cross-border net outstandings are amounts payable by residents of foreign countries regardless of the currency of claim and local country claims in excess of local country obligations. Cross-border net outstandings, as calculated in accordance with FFIEC guidelines, include deposits placed with other banks, loans, acceptances, securities available-for-sale, trading securities, revaluation gains on foreign exchange and derivative contracts and accrued interest receivable. Excluded from cross-border net outstandings are, among other things, the following: local country claims funded by non-local country obligations (U.S. dollar or other non-local currencies), principally certificates of deposit issued by a foreign branch, where the providers of funds agree that, in the event of the occurrence of a sovereign default or the imposition of currency exchange restrictions in a given country, they will not be paid until such default is cured or currency restrictions lifted or, in certain circumstances, they may accept payment in local currency or assets denominated in local currency; and cross-border claims that are guaranteed by cash or other external liquid collateral. Cross-border net outstandings that exceed .75 percent of total assets at year-end are summarized in the following table:

##TABLE_END

Credit Risks Associated with Derivative Contracts Credit risk associated with derivatives is measured as the net replacement cost of derivative contracts in a receivable position in the event the counterparties of such contracts fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. In managing derivative credit risk, both the current exposure, which is the replacement cost of contracts on the measurement date, as well as an estimate of the potential change in value of contracts over their remaining lives are considered. Counterparties to our derivative activities include financial institutions, central clearing parties, foreign and domestic government agencies, corporations, funds (mutual funds, hedge funds, etc.), insurance companies and private clients as well as other HSBC entities. These counterparties are subject to regular credit review by the credit risk management department. To minimize credit risk, we may enter into legally enforceable master netting agreements which reduce risk by permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon occurrence of certain events. In addition, we reduce credit risk by obtaining collateral from counterparties. The determination of the need for and the levels of collateral will differ based on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty and/or regulatory requirements. 

The total risk in a derivative contract is a function of a number of variables, such as: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

volatility of interest rates, currencies, equity or corporate reference entity used as the basis for determining contract payments; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226;

the existence of a master netting agreement among the counterparties; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

existence and value of collateral received from counterparties to secure exposures. 

##TABLE_END The table below presents total credit risk exposure calculated using the general risk-based capital rules of the Basel III Standardized Approach which includes the net positive mark-to-market of the derivative contracts plus any adjusted potential future exposure as measured in reference to the notional amount. The regulatory capital rules recognize that bilateral netting agreements reduce credit risk and, therefore, allow for reductions of risk-weighted assets when netting requirements have been met and collateral exists. As a result, risk-weighted amounts for regulatory capital purposes are a portion of the original gross exposures. Furthermore, many contracts contain provisions that allow us to close out the transaction if the counterparty fails to post required collateral. In addition, many contracts give us the right to break the transactions earlier than the final maturity date. As a result, these contracts have potential future exposures that are often much smaller than the future exposures derived from the regulatory capital rules. ##TABLE_START At December 31,

Effective liquidity management is defined as ensuring we can meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities/withdrawals and other cash commitments efficiently under both normal operating conditions and under unpredictable circumstances of industry or market stress. To achieve this objective, we have guidelines that require sufficient liquidity to cover potential funding requirements and to avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. Guidelines are set for the consolidated balance sheet of HSBC USA to ensure that it is a source of strength for our regulated, deposit-taking banking subsidiary, as well as to address the more limited sources of liquidity available to it as a holding company. Similar guidelines are set for HSBC Bank USA to ensure that it can meet its liquidity needs in various stress scenarios. Cash flow analysis, including stress testing scenarios, forms the basis for liquidity management and contingency funding plans. See "Risk Management" in this MD&#38;A for further discussion of our approach towards liquidity and funding risk management, including information regarding the key measures employed to define, monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk. 

Interest Bearing Deposits with Banks totaled $2,038 million &#32;and $15,700 million &#32;at December 31, 2019 &#32;and 2018 , respectively, of which $1,801 million &#32;and $14,376 million , respectively, were held with the Federal Reserve Bank. Balances may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our liquidity position at the time and our strategy for deploying liquidity. Surplus interest bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank may be deployed into securities purchased under agreements to resell or other investments depending on market conditions and the opportunity to maximize returns. 

Federal Funds Sold and Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell totaled $17,838 million &#32;and $10,168 million &#32;at December 31, 2019 &#32;and 2018 , respectively.

See "Balance Sheet Review" in this MD&#38;A for further analysis and discussion on long-term debt trends, including additional information on debt issued and repaid during 2019 . 

Under our shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, we may issue certain securities including debt securities and preferred stock. We satisfy the eligibility requirements for designation as a "well-known seasoned issuer," which allows us to file a registration statement that does not have a limit on issuance capacity. The ability to issue under the registration statement is limited by the authority granted by the Board of Directors. During the first quarter of 2019, due to an anticipated decrease in utilization of the shelf registration statement, the Board of Directors approved a reduction in the amount we are authorized to issue from $36,000 million &#32;at December 31, 2018 &#32;to $30,000 million , of which $16,705 million &#32;was available at December 31, 2019 . HSBC Bank USA has a $40,000 million &#32;Global Bank Note Program that provides for the issuance of subordinated and senior notes, of which $13,293 million &#32;was available at December 31, 2019 . We anticipate using the Global Bank Note Program more in the future as part of our efforts designed to minimize overall funding costs while accessing diverse funding channels. 

As a member of the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, we have secured borrowing facilities which are collateralized by loans and investment securities. At December 31, 2019 , long-term debt included $1,000 million &#32;of borrowings from the FHLB facility. Based upon the amounts pledged as collateral under these facilities, we have additional borrowing capacity of up to $13,701 million .

Preferred Equity See Note 18, "Preferred Stock," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding all outstanding preferred share issues. 

Common Equity During the first quarter of 2019 , HSBC USA received a common stock return of capital of $2.4 billion &#32;from its subsidiary, HSBC Bank USA, and paid a distribution on its common stock of $2.4 billion &#32;from surplus capital to its parent, HSBC North America. 

Capital Ratios In managing capital, we develop targets for common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, total capital to risk-weighted assets, Tier 1 capital to adjusted quarterly average assets (i.e., the "Tier 1 leverage ratio") and Tier 1 capital to total leverage exposure (i.e., the "supplementary leverage ratio" or "SLR"). Capital targets are reviewed at least semi-annually to ensure they reflect our business mix and risk profile, as well as real-time conditions and circumstances. The following table summarizes HSBC USA's Basel III capital ratios calculated as of December 31, 2019 &#32;and 2018 :

##TABLE_END We manage capital in accordance with HSBC Group policy. The HSBC North America Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ("ICAAP") works in conjunction with the HSBC Group's ICAAP. The HSBC North America ICAAP applies to HSBC Bank USA and evaluates regulatory capital adequacy and capital adequacy under various stress scenarios. Our approach is to meet our capital needs for these stress scenarios locally through activities which reduce risk. To the extent that local alternatives are insufficient, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC, we would seek support from our ultimate parent. Regulatory capital requirements are based on the amount of capital required to be held, plus applicable capital buffers, as defined by regulations, and the amount of risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure, also calculated based on regulatory definitions. 

We are subject to regulatory capital rules issued by U.S. banking regulators including Basel III (the "Basel III rule"). Under the Basel III rule, there are two methods available to calculate risk-weighted assets, the generally-applicable Standardized Approach and the Advanced Approaches, which are required in addition to the Standardized Approach for large banking organizations that meet certain thresholds. In October 2019, the FRB and the other federal banking agencies jointly finalized rules to implement the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act ("Relief Act") that tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards for large bank holding companies ("BHCs") and foreign banking organizations (the "Tailoring Rules"). HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA will be subject to Category III standards beginning January 1, 2020. Prior to adoption of the Tailoring Rules, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA had requested and received regulatory approval to opt out of the Advanced Approaches and therefore have previously calculated and will continue to calculate their risk-based capital requirements for credit risk solely under the Standardized Approach. For additional discussion of the Basel III final rule requirements, including required minimum capital ratios, as well as further discussion of the Tailoring Rules and other recent regulatory developments and their expected impact see Part I, "Regulation and Competition - Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Requirements," in this Form 10-K. We continue to review the composition of our capital structure and capital buffers in light of these developments. 

Capital Planning and Stress Testing &#32;&#32;The FRB requires IHCs and large BHCs, including HSBC North America, to comply with the FRB's capital plan rule and CCAR program, as well as the annual supervisory stress tests conducted by the FRB, and annual company-run stress tests as required under Dodd-Frank (collectively, "DFAST"), as amended by the Relief Act. Under the Tailoring Rules, beginning January 1, 2020, HSBC North America is no longer subject to a mid-cycle stress testing requirement and is now required to disclose its company-run stress test results only every other year. In October 2019, the OCC adopted a final rule implementing the Relief Act which eliminated the requirement to conduct company-run stress tests for national banks with less than $250 billion in total assets, such as HSBC Bank USA. As a result, HSBC Bank USA is no longer subject to the OCC's DFAST requirements beginning in 2020. The company-run stress tests are forward looking exercises to assess the impact of hypothetical macroeconomic baseline and severely adverse scenarios provided by the FRB and the OCC for the annual exercise, and internally developed scenarios for both the annual and periodic company-run exercises, on the financial condition and capital adequacy of a bank-holding company or bank over a nine quarter planning horizon. For further discussion on capital planning and stress testing, including detail regarding the FRB's supervisory assessment as part of the CCAR process, as well as further discussion of the 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. 

##TABLE_END

Tailoring Rules and other recent regulatory developments and their expected impact see Part I, "Regulation and Competition - Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Requirements," in this Form 10-K. 

HSBC North America submitted its latest CCAR capital plan and both HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA submitted their latest annual company-run DFAST results in April 2019. In July 2019, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA publicly disclosed their latest annual DFAST results. In October 2019, HSBC North America submitted and publicly disclosed its latest periodic DFAST results. 

In June 2019, the FRB publicly disclosed its own DFAST and CCAR results and informed HSBC North America that it did not object to HSBC North America's capital plan or the planned capital distributions included in its 2019 CCAR submission. 

Stress testing results are based solely on hypothetical adverse stress scenarios and should not be viewed or interpreted as forecasts of expected outcomes or capital adequacy or of the actual financial condition of HSBC North America or HSBC Bank USA. Capital planning and stress testing for HSBC North America or HSBC Bank USA may impact our future capital and liquidity. 

While bank holding company regulatory capital compliance is generally performed at the HSBC North America level, and also separately for HSBC Bank USA, as a bank holding company we are required to meet minimum capital requirements imposed by the FRB. We present our capital ratios, together with HSBC Bank USA's in Note 25, "Retained Earnings and Regulatory Capital Requirements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

HSBC USA Inc. HSBC USA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC North America, which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC, and the parent company of HSBC Bank USA and other subsidiaries through which we offer consumer and commercial banking products and related financial services including derivatives, liquidity and cash management, trade finance and investment solutions. Our main source of funds is cash received from financing activities, primarily through debt issuance to third parties and affiliates. In addition, we receive cash from affiliates by issuing preferred stock, from subsidiaries in the form of dividends and from our parent by receiving capital contributions when necessary. 

HSBC USA received cash dividends from its subsidiaries of $138 million &#32;and $ 137 million &#32;in 2019 &#32;and 2018 , respectively. During 2019 &#32;and 2018 , HSBC USA did not receive any cash capital contributions from its parent, HSBC North America. 

HSBC USA has a number of obligations to meet with its available cash. It must be able to service its debt and meet the capital needs of its subsidiaries. It also must pay dividends on its preferred stock and may pay dividends on its common stock. HSBC USA paid dividends on its preferred stock totaling $77 million &#32;and $76 million &#32;in 2019 &#32;and 2018 , respectively. HSBC USA did not pay any dividends on its common stock during either 2019 &#32;or 2018 . We may pay dividends in the future, but will maintain our capital at levels consistent with our regulatory requirements, risk appetite and internal capital adequacy process. 

At various times, we will make capital contributions to our subsidiaries to comply with regulatory guidance, support receivable growth, maintain acceptable investment grade ratings at the subsidiary level, or provide funding for long-term facilities and technology improvements. During 2019 &#32;and 2018 , HSBC USA did not make any capital contributions its subsidiary, HSBC Bank USA. 

As of December 31, 2019 , HSBC Bank USA has the ability to pay dividends under bank regulatory guidelines, as cumulative net income for 2017 through 2019 exceeded dividends attributable to this period. Any reduction of permanent capital of HSBC Bank USA would require OCC approval. See Note 25, "Retained Earnings and Regulatory Capital Requirements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further details. In determining the extent of dividends to pay, HSBC Bank USA must also consider the effect of dividend payments on applicable risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements, as well as policy statements of federal regulatory agencies that indicate banking organizations should generally pay dividends out of current operating earnings. 

Subsidiaries At December 31, 2019 , we had one major subsidiary, HSBC Bank USA. We manage substantially all of our operations through HSBC Bank USA, which contributes to the funding of our businesses primarily through receiving deposits from customers; the collection of receivable balances; issuing short-term, medium-term and long-term debt and selling residential mortgage loans. The vast majority of our domestic medium-term notes and long-term debt is marketed through subsidiaries of HSBC. Intermediate and long-term debt may also be marketed through unaffiliated investment banks.

Reductions to trading assets are mainly related to select Fixed Income activities which will be consolidated in and operated from Europe to better utilize HSBC's global scale, which allows us to record revenue as a business introducer and hold fewer assets on our balance sheet. 

The above table reflects a long-term funding strategy. Daily balances fluctuate as we accommodate customer needs, while ensuring that we have liquidity in place to support the balance sheet maturity funding profile. Should market conditions deteriorate, we have contingency plans to generate additional liquidity through the sales of assets or financing transactions. We remain confident in our ability to access the market for long-term debt funding needs in the current market environment. We continue to seek well-priced and stable customer deposits. We also continue to sell new agency-eligible mortgage loan originations to third parties. 

HSBC Bank USA is subject to significant restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to, and certain other 'covered transactions' with HSBC USA and other affiliates.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Credit Derivatives and Other Contractual Obligations 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

##TABLE_END

As part of our normal operations, we enter into credit derivatives and various off-balance sheet arrangements with affiliates and third parties. These arrangements arise principally in connection with our lending and client intermediation activities and involve primarily extensions of credit and, in certain cases, guarantees. 

As a financial services provider, we routinely extend credit through loan commitments and lines and letters of credit and provide financial guarantees, including derivative transactions having characteristics of a guarantee. The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent our maximum possible credit exposure in the event that a counterparty draws down the full commitment amount or we are required to fulfill our maximum obligation under a guarantee. 

The following table provides maturity information related to our credit derivatives and off-balance sheet arrangements. Many of these commitments and guarantees expire unused or without default. In addition, implementation of our business strategy (as described under the heading "Executive Overview - 2020 Business Update") will affect our contractual obligations over time, including with respect to credit derivatives. As a result, we believe that the contractual amount is not representative of the actual future credit exposure or funding requirements. &#160;

##TABLE_END Letters of Credit A letter of credit may be issued for the benefit of a customer, authorizing a third party to draw on the letter for 

specified amounts under certain terms and conditions. We issue commercial and standby letters of credit. 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

A commercial letter of credit is drawn down on the occurrence of an expected underlying transaction, such as the delivery of goods. Upon the occurrence of the transaction, the amount drawn under the commercial letter of credit is recorded as a receivable from the customer in other assets and as a liability to the vendor in other liabilities until settled. 

##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

A standby letter of credit is issued to third parties for the benefit of a customer and is essentially a guarantee that the customer will perform, or satisfy some obligation, under a contract. It irrevocably obligates us to pay a third party beneficiary when a customer either: (1) in the case of a performance standby letter of credit, fails to perform some contractual non-financial obligation, or (2) in the case of a financial standby letter of credit, fails to repay an outstanding loan or debt instrument. See Note 27, "Guarantee Arrangements, Pledged Assets and Repurchase Agreements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information related to standby letter of credit off-balance sheet guarantee arrangements. 

##TABLE_END 

Credit Derivatives Credit derivative contracts are entered into both for our own benefit and to satisfy the needs of our customers. 

Credit derivatives are arrangements where one party (the "beneficiary") transfers the credit risk of a reference asset to another party (the "guarantor"). Under this arrangement the guarantor assumes the credit risk associated with the reference asset without 

directly owning it. The beneficiary agrees to pay to the guarantor a specified fee. In return, the guarantor agrees to reimburse the beneficiary an agreed amount if there is a default to the reference asset during the term of the contract. 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. 

##TABLE_END

We offset most of the market risk by entering into a buy protection credit derivative contract with another counterparty. Credit derivatives, although having characteristics of a guarantee, are accounted for as derivative instruments and are carried at fair value. The commitment amount included in the table above is the maximum amount that we could be required to pay, without consideration of the approximately equal amount receivable from third parties and any associated collateral. See Note 27, "Guarantee Arrangements, Pledged Assets and Repurchase Agreements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of credit derivative off-balance sheet guarantee arrangements. 

Other Commitments to Extend Credit Other commitments to extend credit include arrangements whereby we are contractually obligated to extend credit in the form of loans, participations in loans, lease financing receivables, or similar transactions. Consumer commitments are comprised of certain unused MasterCard/Visa credit card lines, where we have the right to change terms or conditions upon notification to the customer, and commitments to extend credit secured by residential properties, where we have the right to change terms or conditions, for cause, upon notification to the customer. Commercial commitments comprise primarily those related to secured and unsecured loans and lines of credit. 

In addition to the above, we have established and manage a number of constant net asset value ("CNAV") money market funds that invest in shorter-dated highly-rated money market securities to provide investors with a highly liquid and secure investment. These funds price the assets in their portfolio on an amortized cost basis, which enables them to create and liquidate shares at a constant price. The funds, however, are not permitted to price their portfolios at amortized cost if that amount varies by more than 50 basis points from the portfolio's market value. In that case, the fund would be required to price its portfolio at market value and consequently would no longer be able to create or liquidate shares at a constant price. We do not consolidate the CNAV funds because we do not absorb the majority of the expected future risk associated with the fund's assets, including interest rate, liquidity, credit and other relevant risks that are expected to affect the value of the assets. 

Fair Value 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

##TABLE_END

Fair Value Hierarchy Fair value measurement accounting principles establish a fair value hierarchy structure that prioritizes the inputs to determine the fair value of an asset or liability (the "Fair Value Framework"). The Fair Value Framework distinguishes between inputs that are based on observed market data and unobservable inputs that reflect market participants' assumptions. It emphasizes the use of valuation methodologies that maximize observable market inputs. For financial instruments carried at fair value, the best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an actively traded market (Level 1). Where the market for a financial instrument is not active, valuation techniques are used. The majority of our valuation techniques use market inputs that are either observable or indirectly derived from and corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the financial instrument (Level 2). Because Level 1 and Level 2 instruments are determined by observable inputs, less judgment is applied in determining their fair values. In the absence of observable market inputs, the financial instrument is valued based on valuation techniques that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The determination of the level of fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement of an asset or a liability is classified often requires judgment and may change over time as market conditions evolve. We consider the following factors in developing the fair value hierarchy: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

whether the asset or liability is transacted in an active market with a quoted market price; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

the level of bid-ask spreads; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

a lack of pricing transparency due to, among other things, complexity of the product and market liquidity; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

whether only a few transactions are observed over a significant period of time; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

whether the pricing quotations differ substantially among independent pricing services; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

whether inputs to the valuation techniques can be derived from or corroborated with market data; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

whether significant adjustments are made to the observed pricing information or model output to determine the fair value. 

##TABLE_END Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that the reporting entity has the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities. A financial instrument is classified as a Level 1 measurement if it is listed on an exchange or is an instrument actively traded in the over-the-counter ("OTC") market where transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume. We regard financial instruments such as debt securities, equity securities and derivative contracts listed on the primary exchanges of a country to be actively traded. Non-exchange-traded instruments classified as Level 1 assets include securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, to-be-announced securities, non-callable securities issued by U.S. Government sponsored enterprises and certain foreign government-backed debt. 

Level 2 inputs are those that are observable either directly or indirectly but do not qualify as Level 1 inputs. We classify mortgage pass-through securities, agency and certain non-agency mortgage collateralized obligations, certain derivative contracts, asset-backed securities, obligations of U.S. states and political subdivisions, corporate debt, certain foreign government-backed debt, preferred securities, securities purchased and sold under resale and repurchase agreements, precious metals, certain commercial 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. 

##TABLE_END

loans held for sale, residential mortgage loans whose carrying amount was reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral and real estate owned as Level 2 measurements. Where possible, at least two quotations from independent sources are obtained based on transactions involving comparable assets and liabilities to validate the fair value of these instruments. We have established a process to understand the methodologies and inputs used by the third party pricing services to ensure that pricing information meets the fair value objective and, where appropriate, this pricing data is back-tested to market trade executions. Where significant differences arise among the independent pricing quotes and the internally determined fair value, we investigate and reconcile the differences. If the investigation results in a significant adjustment to the fair value, the instrument will be classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. In general, we have observed that there is a correlation between the credit standing and the market liquidity of a non-derivative instrument. 

Level 2 derivative instruments are generally valued based on discounted future cash flows or an option pricing model adjusted for counterparty credit risk and market liquidity. The fair value of certain derivative products is determined using valuation techniques based on inputs derived from observable indices traded in the OTC market. Appropriate control processes and procedures have been applied to ensure that the derived inputs are applied to value only those instruments that share similar risks to the relevant benchmark indices and therefore demonstrate a similar response to market factors. 

Level 3 inputs are unobservable estimates that management expects market participants would use to determine the fair value of the asset or liability. That is, Level 3 inputs incorporate market participants' assumptions about risk and the risk premium required by market participants in order to bear that risk. We develop Level 3 inputs based on the best information available in the circumstances. At December 31, 2019 &#32;and 2018 , our Level 3 measurements included the following: certain structured deposits and structured notes for which the embedded credit, foreign exchange or equity derivatives have significant unobservable inputs (e.g., volatility or default correlations), asset-backed credit default swaps with certain inputs which are unobservable, certain corporate debt securities, certain asset-backed securities, impaired commercial loans, derivatives referenced to illiquid assets of less desirable credit quality, swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of Visa Class B Shares for which the fair value is dependent upon the final resolution of the related litigation and, at December 31, 2018, collateralized debt obligations ("CDOs") for which there was a lack of pricing transparency due to market illiquidity and a contingent consideration receivable associated with the sale of a portion of our PB business. See Note 28, "Fair Value Measurements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on Level 3 inputs.

##TABLE_END Significant Changes in Fair Value for Level 3 Assets and Liabilities In 2019, one of our unconsolidated VIEs was unwound and our investment in the VIE along with the related derivatives were terminated. Our investment in the VIE, which was a level 3 asset measured at fair value on a recurring basis, had a carrying value of $1,293 million &#32;at the time of unwind. See Note 26, "Variable Interest Entities," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

See Note 28, "Fair Value Measurements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on additions to and transfers into (out of) Level 3 measurements during 2019 &#32;and 2018 &#32;as well as for further details including the classification hierarchy associated with assets and liabilities measured at fair value. 

Effect of Changes in Significant Unobservable Inputs &#160; The fair value of certain financial instruments is measured using valuation techniques that incorporate pricing assumptions not supported by, derived from or corroborated by observable market data. The resultant fair value measurements are dependent on unobservable input parameters which can be selected from a range of estimates and may be interdependent. Changes in one or more of the significant unobservable input parameters may change the fair value 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. 

##TABLE_END

measurements of these financial instruments. For the purpose of preparing the financial statements, the final valuation inputs selected are based on management's best judgment that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing similar assets or liabilities. 

The unobservable input parameters selected are subject to the internal valuation control processes and procedures. When we perform a test of all the significant input parameters to the extreme values within the range at the same time, it could result in an increase of the overall fair value measurement of approximately $45 million &#32;or a decrease of the overall fair value measurement of approximately $2 million &#32;at December 31, 2019 . The effect of changes in significant unobservable input parameters are primarily driven by the uncertainty in determining the fair value of credit derivatives executed against certain insurers and certain deal-contingent forward starting interest rate derivatives. 

Risk Management 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

##TABLE_END

Overview &#160; Managing risk effectively is fundamental to the delivery of our strategic priorities. 

Our risk management framework We use a comprehensive risk management framework across the organization and across all risk types underpinned by our risk culture. This framework fosters continuous monitoring, promotes risk awareness and encourages sound operational and strategic decision-making. It also ensures a consistent approach to identifying, assessing, managing and reporting the risks we accept and incur in our activities. 

Our risk culture &#32;refers to norms, attitudes and behaviors related to risk awareness, risk taking and risk management. We have long recognized the importance of a strong risk management culture, the fostering of which is a key responsibility of senior executives. Our risk culture is reinforced by our values and principles. It is instrumental in aligning the behaviors of individuals with our attitude to assuming and managing risk, which helps to ensure that our risk profile remains in line with our risk appetite. We use clear and consistent employee communication on risk to convey strategic messages and set the tone from senior management and the Board of Directors. We also deploy mandatory training on risk and compliance topics to embed skills and understanding in order to strengthen our risk culture and reinforce the attitude to risk in the behavior expected of employees, as described in our risk policies. We operate a global whistleblowing platform, HSBC Confidential, allowing staff to report matters of concern confidentially. Our risk culture is also reinforced by our approach to remuneration. Individual awards, including those for senior executives, are based on compliance with our values and the achievement of financial and non-financial objectives, which are aligned to our risk appetite and strategy. 

Maintaining a conservative risk profile is a core part of our philosophy. This philosophy encompasses: maintaining a strong capital position defined by regulatory and internal capital ratios; having effective liquidity and funding management; generating returns that are in line with risk taken; and maintaining a sustainable and diversified earnings mix, delivering consistent returns. Additionally, we have zero tolerance for the following: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

knowingly engaging in any business, activity or association where foreseeable reputational risk or damage has not been considered and/or mitigated; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

deliberately or knowingly causing detriment to consumers arising from our products, services or operations or incurring a breach of the letter or spirit of regulatory requirements; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

inappropriate market conduct by a member of our staff or by any of our lines of business. 

##TABLE_END Risk governance &#32;Our Board of Directors has the ultimate responsibility for effective management of risk. It is advised on risk matters by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors and the Compliance and Conduct Committee ("CCC"). In particular, the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors advises the Board of Directors on risk appetite and its alignment with our strategy, risk governance and internal controls as well as high-level risk related matters. Robust risk governance and accountability are embedded throughout our business through an established framework that helps to ensure appropriate oversight of and accountability for the effective management of risk. 

Executive accountability for the ongoing monitoring, assessment and management of the risk environment and the effectiveness of the risk management framework resides with the HSBC North America Chief Risk Officer ("CRO") who is supported by the Risk Management Meeting of the HSBC USA Executive Committee ("RMM"). The management of financial crime risk resides with the Head of Financial Crime Compliance who is supported by the Financial Crime Risk Management Committee. Day-to-day responsibility for risk management is delegated to senior managers with individual accountability for decision making. 

Our responsibilities &#32;All employees are responsible for identifying and managing risk within the scope of their role as part of the Three Lines of Defense ("LoD") model. This model delineates management accountabilities and responsibilities for risk management and the control environment, and underpins our approach to risk management by clarifying responsibilities, encouraging collaboration and enabling efficient coordination of risk and control activities. Under the Three LoD model, the First LoD owns the risks and is responsible for identifying, recording, reporting and managing them in line with risk appetite, and 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. 

##TABLE_END

ensuring that the right controls and assessments are in place to mitigate them. The Second LoD sets the policy and guidelines for managing specific risk areas, provides advice and guidance in relation to the risk, and challenges the First LoD on effective risk management. The Third LoD is our Internal Audit function, which provides independent assurance that our risk management, governance and internal control processes are designed and operating effectively. 

The principle of individual accountability is exercised across the organization and is fundamental to risk ownership and risk management. Decisions are not taken by committees, but by specific individuals, in accordance with the Three LoD model, to promote clear ownership of decisions. The Board of Directors and its sub-committees remain collective decision-making bodies. All employees are required to identify, assess and manage risk within the scope of their assigned responsibilities and, as such, they are critical to the effectiveness of the Three LoD model. 

Risk function &#32;Our Risk function, headed by the CRO, is responsible for our risk management framework. This responsibility includes establishing policies, monitoring risk profiles and forward-looking risk identification and management. Our Risk function is made up of sub-functions covering all risks to our business. The Risk function forms part of the Second LoD. It is independent from our lines of business, including sales and trading functions, to provide challenge, appropriate oversight and balance in risk/reward decisions. The CRO reports to the HSBC North America Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors and to the HSBC Group CRO. Executive accountability for the ongoing monitoring, assessment and management of the risk environment and the effectiveness of risk management policies resides with the CRO, supported by the RMM. 

Specific oversight of various risk management processes occurs through the following meetings: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

the Asset and Liability Management Committee ("ALCO"); 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

the Financial Crime Risk Management Committee ("FCRMC"); 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

the Reputational Risk and Client Selection Committees ("RRCSCs"); and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Line of Business Risk Management Meetings ("LoB RMMs"). 

##TABLE_END Each of these committees, as well as the RMM, have separate charters which detail their respective roles and responsibilities. 

The ALCO provides oversight of all capital, liquidity, interest rate and market risk and is chaired by the HUSI Chief Financial Officer. ALCO sets the limits of acceptable risk, monitors the adequacy of the tools used to measure risk and assesses the adequacy of reporting. In managing these risks, we seek to protect both our income stream and the value of our assets. ALCO also conducts contingency planning with regard to liquidity. 

The FCRMC is the formal governance committee set up to ensure effective management of financial crime risk and to support the CEO in carrying out his financial crime risk responsibilities. Additionally, the HSBC North America Head of Financial Crime Compliance, who serves as the designated Bank Secrecy Act Compliance Officer for HUSI, is the delegated chair of the FCRMC. 

The RRCSC structure ensures appropriate consideration of customers and transactions that may adversely affect our public perception. RRCSCs exist in each Business and are comprised of senior members from the business, risk, legal, financial crime and compliance departments and other invited parties. The RRCSCs provide decision-making and guidance in respect of reputational risks and customer selection matters, and are responsible for ensuring that issues are appropriately tracked and resolved. 

Each LoB RMM is chaired by the respective line of business CRO. LoB RMMs provide recommendations and advice, as requested, to their respective CROs in the exercise of their powers, authorities and discretions in relation to the enterprise-wide management of all risks within or impacting their respective businesses. 

Enterprise-wide risk management tools We use a range of tools to identify, monitor and manage risk. The key enterprise-wide risk management tools are summarized below: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Risk appetite - The CRO oversees the development of our risk appetite which defines, shapes and monitors our risk profile. The HSBC North America Risk Appetite Statement ("RAS") is a written articulation of the aggregate level and types of risk that we are willing to accept in order to achieve our strategic business objectives. HSBC North America's conservative risk profile is articulated in the qualitative section of the RAS, which serves as guidance to embed risk appetite and supports strategic and operational decision making at HUSI. The quantitative section of the RAS contains a set of key metrics covering both financial and non-financial risks. Non-financial risk is defined as the risk to achieving our strategy or objectives as a result of inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. 

##TABLE_END Performance against the RAS metrics is monitored by senior management and reported to the RMM on a monthly basis, enabling senior management to monitor the risk profile and guide business activity to balance risk and return. All breaches of risk appetite thresholds are escalated and actions to remediate the breaches are documented. This process helps to embed a strong risk culture across our businesses. The risk appetite profile is one of the key tools in the wider enterprise risk management framework, which drives the core of our active risk management. The risk appetite profile is aligned to strategic and financial planning and therefore provides a top down view of risk and return objectives. Performance that falls outside of risk appetite is highlighted and appropriate mitigation actions are determined. 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Risk map - We utilize a risk map to provide a point-in-time view of our residual risk profile across a range of both financial and non-financial risk categories, including our principal banking risks. It assesses the potential of these risks to have a material impact on our financial results, reputation or sustainability of our business. Risks that have an 'amber' or 'red' rating require a rating justification to outline the key issues and monitoring and mitigating action plans to be in place to manage the risk down to acceptable levels. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Top and emerging risks - We use a top and emerging risks process to provide a forward-looking view of issues with the potential to threaten the execution of our strategy or operations over the medium to long term. The top and emerging risks framework enables us to take action which either stop these risks from materializing or limit their impact. We proactively assess the internal and external risk environment as well as review the themes identified across our businesses and functions to update our top and emerging risks as necessary. We define a 'top risk' as a thematic issue that may form and crystallize between six months and one year and that has the potential to materially affect our financial results, reputation or business model. The impact of a 'top risk' may be well understood by senior management and some mitigating actions may already be in place. An 'emerging risk' is a thematic issue with large unknown components that may form and crystallize beyond a one-year time horizon. If it were to materialize, it could have a material effect on our long-term strategy, profitability and/or reputation. Existing mitigating plans for an 'emerging risk' are likely to be minimal, reflecting the uncertain nature of these risks at this stage. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Risk identification - Risk identification is a tool that allows us to provide a holistic view of risks facing the organization stemming from our unique business activities and associated exposures, including those that are difficult to quantify or only materialize under stressful conditions. The process is integrated with and built upon existing risk management tools such as top and emerging risk reporting as well as risk and control assessments. The risk identification process takes place every quarter and involves senior representatives from all lines of defense. Senior management governance is provided by the RMM with results presented to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors every quarter. Material risks identified are actively monitored and used to inform key aspects of our capital planning and stress testing program. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Stress testing - Stress testing is an important tool we use to assess potential vulnerabilities in our businesses, business model or portfolios. We operate a comprehensive stress testing program that supports our risk management and capital planning. It includes execution of stress tests mandated by our regulators, is supported by dedicated teams and infrastructure, and is overseen by senior management. It demonstrates our capital strength and enhances our resilience to external shocks. It allows us to understand the sensitivities of the core assumptions in our strategic and capital plans and improve decision making through balancing risk and return. In addition to taking part in regulators' stress tests, we conduct our own internal stress tests. Internal stress test scenarios are closely aligned to our assessment of top and emerging risks and help inform risk appetite thresholds. These may prompt management actions, including a reduction in limits or direct exposures, or closer monitoring of exposures sensitive to stress. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Models - In the course of our regular risk management activities, we use models to help quantify the risk we are taking. The output from some of these models is included in this section of our filing. By their nature, models are based on various assumptions and relationships. We believe that the assumptions used in these models are reasonable, but events may unfold differently than what is assumed in the models. In actual stressed market conditions, these assumptions and relationships may no longer hold, causing actual experience to differ significantly from the results predicted in the model. Consequently, model results may be considered reasonable estimates, with the understanding that actual results may differ significantly from model projections. 

##TABLE_END Key developments in 2019 &#32;&#32;In 2019, we undertook a number of key initiatives to enhance our approach to the management of risk. These included: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

We continued to strengthen our approach to managing non-financial risk, as set out in the Operational Risk Management Framework ("ORMF"). The ORMF sets out our approach to governance and risk appetite. It enables a single view of non-financial risks that matter the most and associated controls. This is overseen by the Operational Risk function, headed by the U.S. Head of Operational Risk. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

We simplified our risk taxonomy through consolidating certain existing risks into broader categories. These changes streamline risk reporting and promote common language in our risk management approach. Further simplification will continue during 2020, including the combining of our two key risk management frameworks. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

We formed a Resilience Risk sub-function to reflect the growing regulatory importance of operational resilience. The leadership of the Resilience Risk function in the United States is the responsibility of the U.S. Head of Resilience Risk. See below for further discussion of resilience risk. 

##TABLE_END Our material risks The principal risks associated with our operations include the following: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Capital and liquidity risk is the risk of having insufficient capital, liquidity or funding resources to meet financial obligations and satisfy regulatory requirements, including pension risk; 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Market risk is the risk that movements in market factors, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices and commodity prices, will reduce our income or the value of our portfolios; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Resilience risk &#32;is the risk that we are unable to provide critical services to our customers, affiliates and counterparties as a result of sustained and significant operational disruption; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Regulatory compliance risk is the risk that we fail to observe the letter and spirit of relevant laws, codes, rules, regulations and standards of good market practice, which as a consequence incur fines and penalties and suffer damage to our business; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Financial crime and fraud risk &#32;is the risk that we knowingly or unknowingly help parties to commit or to further potentially illegal activity, including both internal and external fraud; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Strategic risk is the risk that the business will fail to identify, execute and react appropriately to opportunities and/or threats arising from changes in the market, some of which may emerge over a number of years such as changing economic and political circumstances, customer requirements, demographic trends, regulatory developments or competitor action; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from business decisions informed by models, which can be exacerbated by errors in methodology, design or the way they are used. 

##TABLE_END Credit Risk Management Credit risk is managed through a robust risk identification and control framework which outlines clear and consistent policies, principles and guidance for risk managers. Credit risk is monitored using various internal risk management measures and within limits approved by individuals within a framework of delegated authorities. 

The principle objectives of credit risk management are to: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

maintain a strong culture of responsible lending, and robust risk policies and control frameworks; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

partner with and challenge our businesses in defining, implementing and continually re-evaluating our risk appetite under actual and scenario conditions; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

ensure there is independent scrutiny of credit risks, their cost and their mitigation. 

##TABLE_END Credit risk arises from various on- and off-balance sheet instruments and arrangements, such as: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

loan portfolios; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

investment portfolios; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

unfunded commitments such as letters of credit and lines of credit and unutilized credit card lines that customers can draw upon; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, which may represent an exposure to the counterparty to the contract. 

##TABLE_END While credit risk exists widely in our operations, diversification among various commercial and consumer portfolios helps to lessen risk exposure. Day-to-day management of credit and market risk is performed by the Chief Credit Officer/Head of Wholesale Credit and Market Risk North America and the HSBC North America RBWM Chief Risk Officer, who report directly to the CRO and maintain independent risk functions. The credit risk associated with wholesale commercial portfolios is managed by the Chief Credit Officer, while credit risk associated with retail consumer loan portfolios, such as credit cards, installment loans and residential mortgages, is managed by the RBWM Chief Risk Officer. Further discussion of credit risk, including risk associated with cross-border exposures, can be found under the "Credit Quality" caption in this MD&#38;A. 

Our credit risk management procedures are designed for all stages of economic and financial cycles, including challenging periods of market volatility and economic uncertainty. The Credit Risk function continues to refine "early warning" indicators and reporting, including stress testing scenarios on the basis of recent experience. These risk management tools are embedded within our business planning process. Action has been taken, where necessary, to improve our resilience to risks associated with the current market conditions by selectively discontinuing business lines or products, closely managing underwriting criteria and investing in improved fraud prevention technologies. 

The responsibilities of the Credit Risk function include: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Formulating credit risk policies &#32;&#8211; Our policies are designed to ensure that all of our various retail and wholesale business units operate within clear standards of acceptable credit risk. Our policies ensure that the HSBC standards are consistently implemented across all businesses and that all regulatory requirements are also considered. Credit policies are reviewed and approved annually at the RMM and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Approving new credit exposures and independently assessing large exposures annually &#32;&#8211; Credit approval authorities are delegated by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors to the CRO with the authority to sub-delegate to the Chief Credit Officer and RBWM Chief Risk Officer. The Chief Credit Officer and RBWM Chief Risk Officer in turn delegate limited credit authority to the various lending units. However, most wholesale credits are reviewed and approved centrally through a dedicated Credit Approval Unit that reports directly to the Chief Credit Officer. In addition, the Chief Credit Officer coordinates the review of material credits with the HSBC Group Credit Risk which, subject to certain agreed- 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. 

##TABLE_END

upon limits, will concur on material new and renewal transactions. Large retail credits are escalated to the RBWM Chief Risk Officer for review and concurrence. 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Overseeing retail credit and collateral risk &#32;&#8211; The RBWM Chief Risk Officer manages the credit and collateral risk associated with retail portfolios and is supported by expertise from a dedicated advanced risk analytics unit. Collateral risk in retail arises when the underlying value of the property securing a retail loan loses value due to macroeconomic, local or industry conditions. This risk is actively managed through on-going monitoring of HPIs. In areas where we have identified property values as declining, maximum loan to values will be adjusted downward to compensate for this risk. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Maintaining and developing the governance and operation of the wholesale risk rating system &#32;&#8211; A two-dimensional credit risk rating system is utilized in order to categorize exposures meaningfully and enable focused management of the risks involved. This ratings system is comprised of a 23 category customer risk rating, which considers the probability of default of an obligor and a separate assessment of a transaction's potential loss given default. Each credit grade has a probability of default estimate. Rating methodologies are based upon a wide range of analytics and market data-based tools, which are core inputs to the assessment of counterparty risk. Although automated risk rating processes are increasingly used, for larger facilities the ultimate responsibility for setting risk grades rests in each case with the final approving executive. Risk grades are reviewed frequently and amendments, where necessary, are implemented promptly. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Measuring portfolio credit risk &#32;&#8211; We continue to advance the measurement of the risk in our credit portfolios using techniques such as stress testing in certain internal reporting. Efforts continue to refine both the inputs and assumptions used to increase the usefulness in the evaluation of large and small commercial and retail customer portfolio products and business unit return on risk. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Monitoring portfolio performance &#32;&#8211; Credit data warehouses have been implemented to centralize the reporting of credit risk, support the analysis of risk and to calculate credit loss reserves. This data warehouse also supports HSBC's wider effort to meet the requirements of Basel III and to generate credit reports for management and the Board of Directors. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Establishing counterparty and portfolio limits &#32;&#8211; We monitor and limit our wholesale exposure to individual counterparties and to the combined exposure of related counterparties. In addition, selected industry portfolios, such as real estate, are subject to caps that are recommended by the Chief Credit Officer and reviewed where appropriate by management committees and the Board of Directors. Retail establishes portfolio limits by product as well as limits on new products and higher-risk segments such as investment property, high LTV mortgages and credit cards which are targeted beyond our historical customer base. These limits are approved by the RBWM Chief Risk Officer and monitored by a retail credit risk management committee. Counterparty credit exposure related to derivative activities is also managed under approved limits. Since the exposure related to derivatives is variable and uncertain, internal risk management methodologies are used to calculate the 95 percent worst-case potential future exposure for each customer. These methodologies take into consideration, among other factors, cross-product close-out netting, collateral received from customers under collateral support annexes, termination clauses, and off-setting positions within the portfolio. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Managing problem loans &#32;&#8211; Special attention is paid to problem loans. When appropriate, our wholesale Loan Management Unit and retail Collection and Recovery teams provide customers with intensive management and control support in order to help them avoid default wherever possible and maximize recoveries. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Establishing allowances for credit losses &#32;&#8211; The Chief Credit Officer and the RBWM Chief Risk Officer share responsibility with the Chief Financial Officer for establishing appropriate levels of allowances for credit losses inherent in various loan portfolios. 

##TABLE_END Sustainability risk &#32;is a component of credit risk and represents the risk that financial services provided to customers indirectly result in unacceptable impacts on people or on the environment. We measure sustainability risk by assessing the potential sustainability impacts of a customer's activities and assigning a sustainability risk rating. Sustainability risk is monitored by the businesses and the Credit Approval Unit, as well as HSBC Group Sustainability Risk. Sustainability risk managers in the Wholesale Credit Risk function, with input from HSBC Group Sustainability Risk, are responsible for advising our businesses on managing environmental and social risks. The Wholesale Credit Risk function's responsibilities in relation to sustainability risk include: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

overseeing our sustainability risk standards, our application of the Equator Principles and our sustainability policies (covering agricultural commodities, chemicals, defense, energy, forestry, mining and metals, Ramsar Wetlands and UNESCO World Heritage Sites); 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

undertaking an independent review of transactions, including escalating transactions to HSBC Group Sustainability Risk where sustainability risks are assessed to be high and approving transactions where sustainability risks are of a lower magnitude; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

providing training and capacity building within our businesses to ensure sustainability risks are identified and mitigated consistently. 

##TABLE_END Credit Review is an independent and critical Second LoD function. Its mission is to identify and evaluate areas of credit risk within our business. Credit Review will focus on the review and evaluation of wholesale and retail lending activities and will identify 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. 

##TABLE_END

risks and provide an ongoing assessment as to the effectiveness of the risk management framework and the related portfolios. Credit Review will independently assess the business units and risk management functions to ensure the portfolios are managed and operating in a manner that is consistent with HSBC Group strategy, risk appetite, appropriate local and HSBC Group credit policies and procedures and applicable regulatory requirements. For example, this includes the unilateral authority to independently assess and revise customer risk ratings, facility grades and loss given default estimates. To ensure its independent stature, the Credit Review Delegation of Authority is endorsed by the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors which grants the Head of Credit Review unhindered access to the Risk Committee and executive sessions at the discretion of the Head of Credit Review. Accordingly, our Board of Directors has oversight of the Credit Review annual and ongoing plan, quarterly plan updates and results of reviews. 

Capital and Liquidity Risk Management Capital and liquidity risk arises from changes to the respective buffers and risk profiles driven by customer behavior and the external environment. 

Capital risk &#32;is the risk that we fail to meet our regulatory capital requirements. Capital risk arises from a deterioration in the capital base due to losses and increased risk profile from management activity or the external environment. We aim to maintain a strong capital base to support the risks inherent in our business and invest in accordance with our strategy, meeting regulatory capital requirements at all times. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in this MD&#38;A for a full discussion of our approach to capital risk management, including our capital ratios and regulatory capital requirements. 

Liquidity and funding risk &#32;is the risk that we do not have sufficient financial resources to meet our obligations as they fall due or that we can only do so at an excessive cost, or that funding considered to be sustainable, and therefore used to fund assets, is not sustainable over time. Liquidity and funding risk arises from mismatches in the timing of cash flows or when illiquid asset positions cannot be funded at the expected terms and when required. We continuously monitor the impact of market events on our liquidity positions and will continue to adapt our liquidity and funding framework to reflect market events and the evolving regulatory landscape and view as to best practices. Historically, we have seen the greatest strain in the wholesale market as opposed to the retail market (the latter being the market from which we source stable demand and time deposit accounts which are less sensitive to market events or changes in interest rates). 

Liquidity is managed to provide the ability to generate cash to meet lending, deposit withdrawal and other commitments at a reasonable cost in a reasonable amount of time while maintaining routine operations and market confidence. Market funding is coordinated with other HSBC Group entities, as the markets increasingly view debt issuances from the separate companies within the context of our common parent company. Liquidity and funding risk management is performed at the HSBC North America, HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA levels. Each entity is required to have sufficient liquidity for a crisis situation. 

ALCO develops and implements policies and procedures to ensure that the minimum liquidity ratios and a strong overall liquidity position are maintained. ALCO projects cash flow requirements and determines the level of liquid assets and available funding sources to have at our disposal, with consideration given to anticipated deposit and balance sheet growth, contingent liabilities, and the ability to access wholesale funding markets. In addition to base case projections, multiple stress scenarios are generated to simulate crisis conditions, including: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

run-off of non-stable deposits; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

inability to renew maturing interbank funding; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

draw-downs of committed loan facilities; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

decreases in the market value of liquid securities; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

additional collateral requirements for derivative transactions under existing collateral support agreements; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

rating downgrades of HSBC USA or HSBC Bank USA; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

increased discount on security values for repos or disposals. 

##TABLE_END In addition, ALCO monitors the overall mix of deposit and funding concentrations to avoid undue reliance on individual funding sources and large deposit relationships. 

As part of our approach towards liquidity and funding risk management, we employ the measures discussed below to define, monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk in accordance with HSBC policy. 

The Basel Committee based Liquidity Coverage Ratio ("LCR") is designed to be a short-term liquidity measure to ensure banks have sufficient High Quality Liquid Assets ("HQLA") to cover net stressed cash outflows over the next 30 days. At both December 31, 2019 &#32;and 2018 , HSBC USA's LCR under the EU LCR rule exceeded 100 percent. A LCR of 100 percent or higher reflects an unencumbered HQLA balance that is equal to or exceeds liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario. HQLA consists of cash or assets that can be converted into cash at little or no loss of value in private markets. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA are also subject to the U.S. LCR rule. Under the U.S. rule, U.S. institutions, including HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA, are currently required to maintain a minimum LCR of 100 percent and report LCR to U.S. regulators on a daily basis. During 2019 , HSBC Bank USA's LCR under the U.S. LCR rule remained above the 100 percent minimum requirement. 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. 

##TABLE_END

The European calibration of the Basel Committee based NSFR, which is a longer term liquidity measure with a 12-month time horizon to ensure a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities, is still pending. Therefore, our calculation of NSFR is based on our current interpretation and understanding of the Basel Committee NSFR guidance, which may differ in future periods depending on completion of the European calibration and further implementation guidance from regulators. At both December 31, 2019 &#32;and 2018 , HSBC USA's estimated NSFR exceeded 100 percent. A NSFR of 100 percent or more reflects an available stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next 12 months that is equal to or exceeds the required amount of funding for assets and off-balance sheet exposures. In April 2016, U.S. regulators issued for public comment a proposal to implement the NSFR in the United States, applicable to certain large banking organizations, including HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA. At both December 31, 2019 &#32;and 2018 , HSBC Bank USA's estimated NSFR, based on our current interpretation and understanding of the proposed U.S. NSFR rule, exceeded 100 percent. 

As discussed further in Part 1, "Regulation and Competition - Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Requirements," in this Form 10-K, the Tailoring Rules reduced the regulatory LCR requirement for HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA from 100 to 85 percent beginning January 1, 2020. The Tailoring Rules also indicate that an 85 percent NSFR would apply to HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA once the NSFR rule is finalized. 

HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA maintain their liquidity profiles to support compliance with these rules. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA may need to make further changes to their liquidity profiles to support compliance with any future rules. 

ALCO also maintains a liquidity management and contingency funding plan ("Contingency Funding Plan"), which identifies certain potential early warning indicators of liquidity problems, and actions that can be taken both initially and in the event of a liquidity crisis, to minimize the long-term impact on our businesses and customer relationships. The Contingency Funding Plan is reviewed annually and approved by the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors. We recognize a liquidity crisis can either be specific to us, relating to our ability to meet our obligations in a timely manner, or market-wide, caused by a macro risk event in the broader financial system. A range of indicators are monitored to attain an early warning of any liquidity issues. These include widening of key spreads or indices used to track market volatility, material reductions or extreme volatility in customer deposit balances, increased utilization of credit lines, widening of our own credit spreads and higher borrowing costs. At the onset of a crisis, liquidity needs would be satisfied primarily with unsecured wholesale market funding. If the crisis escalates, contingency funding needs will be satisfied primarily through sales of securities from the investment portfolio and secured borrowing using the mortgage portfolio as collateral. Securities may be sold or used as collateral in a repurchase agreement depending on the scenario. Portions of the mortgage portfolio may be used as collateral at the FHLB to increase borrowings. We maintain a Liquid Asset Buffer consisting of cash, short-term liquid assets and unencumbered government and other highly rated investment securities as a source of funding. Further, collateral is maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and the FHLB, providing additional secured borrowing capacity in a liquidity crisis. 

In addition to the oversight provided by ALCO, Liquidity Risk Management ("LRM") is a Second LoD oversight function for liquidity which independently reports into the CRO. LRM's primary mandate is to strengthen our liquidity and funding risk management framework through challenge and review of existing processes and recommending areas that need improvement to the RMM. LRM serves as an advisory function to senior management to ensure front line units with direct responsibility for managing liquidity risk are operating within their operating guidelines and defined risk appetite parameters. The LRM oversight mandate is carried out through critical evaluation and challenge of existing risk management processes including stress testing and ratio calculations. 

Our liquidity and funding risk management approach includes deposits, supplemented by wholesale borrowing to fund our balance sheet, and using security sales or secured borrowings for liquidity stress situations in our liquidity contingency plans. In addition, current regulatory initiatives require banks to retain a portfolio of HQLA. As such, we are maintaining a large portfolio of high quality sovereign and sovereign guaranteed securities. 

Our ability to regularly attract wholesale funds at a competitive cost is enhanced by strong ratings from the major credit ratings agencies. The following table reflects the short and long-term credit ratings of HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA at December 31, 2019 :

Rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk management practices and legal matters, all of which could lead to adverse ratings actions. 

During the fourth quarter of 2019, S&#38;P and Moody's both changed their rating outlooks for HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA to negative from stable following similar changes in outlook to negative from stable for HSBC. The outlook changes came after HSBC announced that it no longer expected to reach its 2020 return on tangible equity target and was planning potentially significant restructuring. The negative outlooks reflect the implementation challenges of the planned restructuring in the context of a weakening external environment. While the outlooks changed, S&#38;P and Moody's both affirmed their long- and short-term issuer credit ratings for HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA. 

In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2019, Fitch downgraded the long-term debt ratings of both HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA by one notch to A+ and maintained a negative rating watch following a similar rating action for HSBC. The rating downgrade reflects a downward revision by Fitch of the HSBC Group's business model, execution and earnings viability scores which came after HSBC announced that it had lowered its return targets and was planning potentially significant restructuring as discussed above. Fitch believes this announcement highlights weakness in the stability of the HSBC Group's business model and the earnings capacity of its geographic footprint. As part of this review, the short-term ratings of both HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA were re-affirmed. 

While these rating actions by S&#38;P, Moody's and Fitch did not have a material impact on our borrowing costs or liquidity, any future actions could have such an impact. Although we closely monitor and strive to manage factors influencing our credit ratings, there is no assurance that our credit ratings will not change in the future. At December 31, 2019 , there were no pending actions in terms of changes to ratings on the debt of HSBC USA or HSBC Bank USA from any of the rating agencies. 

Numerous factors, internal and external, may impact access to and costs associated with issuing debt in the global capital markets. These factors include our debt ratings, overall economic conditions, overall capital markets volatility and the effectiveness of the management of credit risks inherent in our customer base. 

Cash resources, short-term investments and a trading asset portfolio are available to provide highly liquid funding for us. Additional liquidity is provided by available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities. Approximately $2,762 million &#32;of the debt securities in these portfolios at December 31, 2019 &#32;are expected to mature in 2020 . The remaining $46,194 million &#32;of debt securities not expected to mature in 2020 &#32;are available to provide liquidity by serving as collateral for secured borrowings, or if needed, by being sold. Further liquidity is available through our ability to sell or securitize loans in secondary markets. In 2019 , we did not sell or securitize any residential mortgage loan portfolios other than the normal sales of agency-eligible mortgage loan originations. 

It is the policy of HSBC Bank USA to maintain both primary and secondary collateral in order to ensure precautionary borrowing availability from the Federal Reserve Bank. Primary collateral is collateral that is physically maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank, and serves as a safety net against any unexpected funding shortfalls that may occur. Secondary collateral is collateral that is acceptable to the Federal Reserve Bank, but is not maintained there. If unutilized borrowing capacity were to be low, secondary collateral would be identified and maintained as necessary. Further liquidity is available from the FHLB. 

See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in this MD&#38;A for further discussion of our liquidity position, including additional information regarding our outstanding borrowings, the remaining availability of our debt issuance programs and our funding strategy. 

Pension risk is a component of capital and liquidity risk and represents the risk of increased costs from offering post-employment benefit plans to our employees. Certain employees are eligible to participate in the HSBC North America qualified defined benefit pension plan which has been frozen. While plan assets were higher than projected plan liabilities resulting in an over-funded status of approximately $65 million &#32;at December 31, 2019, changes in market conditions could result in an under-funded status occurring in future periods. Because these obligations relate to the HSBC North America pension plan, only a portion of any deficit could be considered our responsibility. We and other HSBC North America affiliates with employees participating in this plan will be required to make up any shortfall over a number of years as specified under the Pension Protection Act. This can be accomplished through direct contributions, appreciation in plan assets and/or increases in interest rates resulting in lower liability valuations. See Note 21, "Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information concerning the HSBC North America defined benefit plan. 

Market Risk Management Exposure to market risk is separated into two portfolios: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Trading portfolios &#32;comprise positions arising from market-making and warehousing of client-derived positions.

The nature of the hedging and risk mitigation strategies performed corresponds to the market risk management instruments available. These strategies range from the use of traditional market instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to more sophisticated hedging strategies to address a combination of risk factors arising at the portfolio level. 

Market risk governance Market risk is managed and controlled through limits approved by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors and the RMM, as well as the various businesses, and also ratified by the HSBC Group Risk Management Meeting. These limits are allocated across business lines and to the HSBC Group legal entities, including HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA. 

We have an independent market risk management and control function in North America which is responsible for setting the risk appetite, measuring market risk exposures in accordance with the policies defined by HSBC Group Risk, and monitoring and reporting these exposures against the prescribed limits on a daily basis. 

Model risk is governed through model oversight committees at the regional and global Wholesale Credit and Market Risk levels. The Committees have direct oversight and approval responsibility for all traded risk models utilized for risk measurement and management and stress testing. They prioritize the development of models, methodologies and practices used for traded risk management and ensure that they remain within our risk appetite and business plans. We are committed to the ongoing development and enhancement of our in-house risk models subject to regulatory approval. Refer to "Model Risk Management" below for further discussion regarding the management and monitoring of model risk across North America. 

Our control of market risk in the trading and non-trading portfolios is based on a policy of restricting operations to trading within a list of permissible instruments ultimately approved by HSBC Group Risk as well as enforcing new product approval procedures through a dedicated committee. 

Market risk measures We use a range of tools to monitor and limit market risk exposures, including: 

Sensitivity analysis &#32;Sensitivity analysis measures the impact of individual market factor movements on specific instruments or portfolios, for example the impact of a one basis point change in the yield curve. We use sensitivity analysis to monitor the market risk positions within each risk type. Sensitivity limits are set for portfolios, products and risk types, with the depth of the market being one of the principal factors in determining the level of limits set. 

Value at Risk ("VaR") &#32;VaR is a technique for estimating potential losses on risk positions as a result of movements in market rates and prices over a specified time horizon and to a given level of confidence. The use of VaR is integrated into market risk management and calculated for all trading positions regardless of how we capitalize them. In addition, we calculate VaR for non-trading portfolios to have a complete picture of risk. Where we do not calculate VaR explicitly, we use alternative tools as summarized in the 'Stress Testing' section below. 

Our VaR models are predominantly based on historical simulation which incorporates the following features: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

historical market rates and prices are calculated with reference to foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates and the associated volatilities; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

potential market movements utilized for VaR are calculated with reference to data from the past two years; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

scenario profit and losses are calculated utilizing the market scenarios for all relevant risk factors; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

VaR measures are calculated to a 99 percent confidence level and use a one-day holding period. 

##TABLE_END The models also incorporate the effect of option features on the underlying exposures. The nature of the VaR models means that an increase in observed market volatility will lead to an increase in VaR without any changes in the underlying positions. 

Although a valuable guide to risk, VaR should always be viewed in the context of its limitations. For example: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

the use of historical data as a proxy for estimating future events may not encompass all potential events, particularly those which are extreme in nature; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

the use of a holding period assumes that all positions can be liquidated or the risks offset during that period, which may not fully reflect the market risk arising at times of severe illiquidity, when the holding period may be insufficient to liquidate or hedge all positions fully; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

the use of a 99 percent confidence level does not take into account losses that might occur beyond this level of confidence; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

VaR is calculated on the basis of exposures outstanding at the close of business and therefore does not necessarily reflect intra-day exposures. 

##TABLE_END The risks not in VaR ("RNIV") framework aims to capture and capitalize material market risks that are not adequately covered in the VaR model. Risk factors are reviewed on a regular basis and either incorporated directly in the VaR models, where possible, or quantified through the RNIV. RNIV stresses interest rate basis risk exposure and interest rate volatility skewness. RNIV risk-weighted assets make up approximately 10 percent of HUSI market risk risk-weighted assets, though contribution to total HUSI risk-weighted assets remains immaterial.

Stressed VaR &#32;Stressed VaR is primarily used for regulatory capital purposes and is integrated into the risk management process to facilitate efficient capital management. Stressed VaR complements other risk measures by providing severe potential losses associated with stressed market conditions. Stressed VaR modeling follows the same approach as VaR, except Stressed VaR calculates potential loss at a 99 percent confidence level for a one-day holding period based on a one year historical period that is calibrated to the most volatile period for the trading portfolio. 

Stress testing &#32;Stress testing is an important procedure that is integrated into our market risk management framework to evaluate the potential impact on portfolio values of more extreme, although plausible, events or movements in a set of financial variables. In such scenarios, losses can be much greater than those predicted by VaR modeling. 

A set of scenarios is used consistently across the HSBC Group. Scenarios are tailored to capture the relevant potential events or market movements at each level. The risk appetite around potential stress losses is set and monitored against corresponding limits. 

The process is governed by the Stress Testing Review Group forum which, in conjunction with regional risk management, determines the scenarios to be applied. Main scenario types are as follows: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

single risk factor stress scenarios that are unlikely to be captured within the VaR models, such as the break of a currency peg; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

technical scenarios that incorporate the largest move in each risk factor independent from any underlying market correlation; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

hypothetical scenarios are mainly built on potential macroeconomic events, for example, the slowdown in mainland China and the potential effects of a sovereign debt default, including its wider contagion effects, curves steepening or flattening scenarios; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

historical scenarios which incorporate past observations of market movements during periods of stress which are not captured within VaR. 

##TABLE_END Market risk reverse stress tests are undertaken on the premise that there is a fixed loss. The stress testing process identifies which scenarios lead to this loss. The rationale behind the reverse stress test is to understand scenarios which are beyond normal business conditions and could have contagion and systemic implications. 

Stressed VaR and stress testing, together with reverse stress testing, provide management with insights regarding the 'tail risk' beyond VaR, for which our appetite is limited. 

Market risk in 2019 &#32;The global market environment was characterized by slowing global economic conditions, trade tensions between the United States and China, and other geopolitical events. 

Global economic growth slowed as trade tensions between the United States and China impacted global trade growth and eroded further confidence in the global economy. The FRB took a policy easing stance in 2019 as they cut interest rates three times during the year. In mid-September, a sudden spike in short term repurchase agreement funding rates resulted in FRB intervention via the establishment of overnight and term repurchase agreement facilities and U.S. Treasury buybacks. 

In 2019, we observed material volatility in Latin America, driven by changes in the political establishment and social unrest. These geopolitical events eroded investor confidence and led to a reduction in client risk appetite in those regions. 

However, in the fourth quarter of 2019, the announcement of a trade deal between the United States and China drove overall "risk-on" sentiment by investors for developed markets. Further, in Latin America, we observed easing of social unrest close to year-end, which reduced local market volatility. Ongoing strength regarding the U.S. labor market and low unemployment remained through the year and the S&#38;P 500 index hit a record high to close out 2019. A focus on global economic indicators with a backdrop of political uncertainty, as the United States enters a presidential election year, will be a significant theme in 2020. 

Trading Portfolios Trading VaR generates from the Global Markets unit of the GB&#38;M business segment. Portfolios are mainly comprised of foreign exchange products, interest rate swaps, credit default swaps and precious metals (i.e., gold, silver, platinum) in both North America and emerging markets 

Trading VaR at December 31, 2019 was relatively flat as compared with December 31, 2018 as the Global Markets business in the United States continued to focus on customer facilitation and interest rate derivative markets. Interest rate risk is the main driver of exposure.

Portfolio diversification is the market risk dispersion effect of holding a portfolio containing different risk types. It represents the reduction in unsystematic market risk that occurs when combining a number of different risk types, for example, foreign exchange, interest rate and credit spread, together in one portfolio. It is measured as the difference between the sum of the VaR by individual risk type and the combined total VaR. A negative number represents the benefit of portfolio diversification. As the maximum and minimum occur on different days for different risk types, it is not meaningful to calculate a portfolio diversification benefit for these measures. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) &#160; 

The total VaR is non-additive across risk types due to diversification effects. For presentation purposes, portfolio diversification of the VaR for trading portfolios includes VaR-based risk-not-in-VaR. 

##TABLE_END Back-testing &#32;We routinely validate the accuracy of our VaR models by back-testing them against hypothetical profit and loss that excludes non-modeled items such as fees, commissions and revenues of intra-day transactions from the actual reported profit and loss. We would expect, on average, to see two or three profits and two or three losses in excess of VaR at the 99 percent confidence level over a one-year period. The actual number of profits or losses in excess of VaR over this period can therefore be used to gauge how well the models are performing. To ensure a conservative approach to calculating our risk exposures, it is important to note that profits in excess of VaR are only considered when back-testing the accuracy of models and are not used for capital purposes. 

In 2019 , we experienced three profit and two loss back-testing exceptions. A profit exception in March and a loss exception in April were mainly driven by precious metal future and spot price movements. A loss exception in June was primarily driven by market volatility in emerging market currencies and rates. A profit exception in July was driven by a large drop in market yields outside of historical distribution and a profit exception in August was driven by Argentina market volatility. 

Non-trading Portfolios Non-trading VaR predominantly relates to Balance Sheet Management and represents the potential negative changes in the investment portfolio market value (which includes available-for-sale and held-to-maturity assets) and associated hedges. Our investment portfolio holdings are mainly comprised of U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed and U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities. Our non-trading VaR exposure is driven by interest rates and agency spread volatility. 

Non-trading VaR was higher at December 31, 2019 as compared with December 31, 2018 due primarily to increased volatility in the historical VaR time series. Investment portfolio overall size and asset allocation were stable during the year.

Refer to the Trading VaR table above for additional information. 

##TABLE_END Non-trading VaR also includes the interest rate risk of non-trading financial assets and liabilities held by the global businesses and transfer priced into Balance Sheet Management which has the mandate to centrally manage and hedge it. Interest rate swaps used by Balance Sheet Management ("BSM") to hedge the interest rate risk of the investment portfolio and transfer price risk from the banking book are typically classified as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge and included within our non-traded VaR. In case there is residual market risk that cannot be efficiently and conveniently hedged by BSM they are managed by ALCO in segregated ALCO books. See below for a broader discussion on how interest rate risk is managed. 

Stressed VaR &#32; The following table reflects stressed VaR at December 31, 2019 &#32;and 2018 :

##TABLE_END

Stressed VaR at December 31, 2019 &#32;was lower as compared with December 31, 2018 &#32;driven by a reduction of inventory in rates and foreign exchange products as well as the impact of lower market rates during the stressed period. 

Interest rate risk is the potential reduction of net interest income due to mismatched pricing between assets and liabilities as well as losses in value due to interest rate movements. We are subject to interest rate risk associated with the repricing characteristics of our balance sheet assets and liabilities. Specifically, as interest rates change, amounts of interest earning assets and liabilities fluctuate, and interest earning assets reprice at intervals that do not correspond to the maturities or repricing patterns of interest bearing liabilities. This mismatch between assets and liabilities in repricing sensitivity results in changes to projected net interest income as interest rates move. To help manage the risks associated with changes in interest rates, and to manage net interest income within interest rate risk ranges management considers acceptable, we use derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps, options, futures and forwards as hedges to modify the repricing characteristics of specific assets, liabilities, forecasted transactions or firm commitments. Analysis of this risk is complicated by having to make assumptions on embedded optionality within certain product areas such as the incidence of mortgage prepayments, and from behavioral assumptions regarding the economic duration of liabilities which are contractually repayable on demand such as current accounts. These assumptions around behavioral features are captured in our interest rate behavioralization framework, which is described further below. Day-to-day management of interest rate risk is centralized principally in BSM. 

We have significant, but historically well controlled, interest rate risk in large part due to our portfolio of residential mortgages and mortgage backed securities, which consumers can prepay without penalty, and our large base of demand and savings deposits. These deposits can be withdrawn by consumers at will, but historically they have been a stable source of relatively low cost funds. 

In addition, we have a considerable number of contracts referencing LIBOR. The process of adopting new reference rates may expose us to an increased level of financial risks, such as potential earnings volatility. See "Executive Overview" in this MD&#38;A for a full discussion of our LIBOR transition. 

In the course of managing interest rate risk, an economic value of equity ("EVE") analysis is utilized in conjunction with a combination of other risk assessment techniques to identify and assess the potential impact of interest rate movements and take 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. 

##TABLE_END

appropriate action. This combination of techniques, with some focusing on the impact of interest rate movements on the valuation of the balance sheet (e.g. EVE, present value of a basis point ("PVBP"), repricing gap analysis, VaR) and others focusing on the impact of interest rate movements on earnings (e.g. net interest income simulation modeling, basis risk analysis) allows for comprehensive analyses from different perspectives. During 2019, we began managing our net interest rate risk sensitivities to a static balance sheet. As a result, we have revised prior year amounts in the net interest income simulation modeling table below in order to conform to the current year presentation. 

A key element of managing interest rate risk is the management of the convexity of the balance sheet, largely resulting from the mortgage related products on the balance sheet. Convexity risk arises as mortgage loan consumers change their payment behavior significantly in response to large movements in market rates, but do not change behavior appreciably for smaller changes in market rates. Certain interest rate management tools, such as EVE and net interest income simulation modeling described below, better capture the embedded convexity in the balance sheet, while measures such as PVBP are designed to capture the risk of smaller changes in rates. 

The assessment techniques discussed below act as a guide for managing interest rate risk associated with balance sheet composition and off-balance sheet hedging strategy (the risk position). Calculated values within limit ranges reflect an acceptable risk position, although possible future unfavorable trends may prompt adjustments to on or off-balance sheet exposure. Calculated values outside of limit ranges will result in consideration of adjustment of the risk position, or consideration of temporary dispensation from making adjustments. 

Economic value of equity ("EVE") &#32;EVE represents the present value of the banking book cash flows that could be provided to our equity holder under a managed run-off scenario. An EVE sensitivity represents the change in EVE due to a defined movement in interest rates. We manage to an immediate parallel upward shock of 200 basis points and an immediate parallel downward shock of 200 basis points to the market implied interest rates. At both December 31, 2019 &#32;and 2018 , our EVE remained within risk appetite for the up 200 and down 200 basis point interest rate shock scenarios. 

Repricing gap analysis &#32;The following table shows the repricing structure of our assets and liabilities at December 31, 2019. For assets and liabilities whose cash flows are subject to change due to movements in interest rates, such as the sensitivity of mortgage loans to prepayments, data is reported based on the earlier of expected repricing or maturity and reflects anticipated prepayments based on the current rate environment. The resulting "gaps" are reviewed to assess the potential sensitivity to earnings with respect to the direction, magnitude and timing of changes in market interest rates. Data shown is as of year-end, and one-day figures can be distorted by temporary swings in assets or liabilities. The repricing structure of our assets and liabilities may be impacted by the implementation of our business strategy, which is described under the heading "Executive Overview - 2020 Business Update."

Various techniques are utilized to quantify and monitor risks associated with the repricing characteristics of our assets, liabilities and derivative contracts. 

Net interest income simulation modeling techniques &#32; We utilize simulation modeling to monitor a number of interest rate scenarios for their impact on projected net interest income. These techniques simulate the impact on projected net interest income under various scenarios, such as rate shock scenarios which assume immediate market rate movements by 100 basis points, as well as scenarios in which rates gradually rise or fall by 100 basis points over a twelve month period. In the gradual scenarios, 25 percent of the interest rate movement occurs at the beginning of each quarter.

Projected net interest income sensitivity figures represent the effect of movements in net interest income based on the projected yield curve scenarios and our current interest rate risk profile. This effect, however, does not incorporate actions which would probably be taken by BSM or in the businesses to mitigate the effect of interest rate risk. In reality, BSM seeks proactively to change the interest rate risk profile to minimize losses and optimize net revenues. The net interest income simulation modeling calculations assume that interest rates of all maturities move by the same amount in the 'up-shock' scenario. Rates are not assumed to become negative in the 'down-shock' scenario which may effectively result in non-parallel shock. In addition, the net interest income simulation modeling calculations take account of the effect on net interest income of anticipated differences in changes between interbank interest rates and interest rates over which the entity has discretion in terms of the timing and extent of rate changes. The projections do not take into consideration possible complicating factors such as the effect of changes in interest rates on the credit quality, size and composition of the balance sheet. Therefore, although this provides a reasonable estimate of interest rate sensitivity, actual results will differ from these estimates, possibly by significant amounts. 

Interest rate risk behavioralization &#32; Unlike liquidity risk which is assessed on the basis of a very severe stress scenario, interest rate risk is assessed and managed according to business-as-usual conditions. In many cases the contractual profile of our assets and liabilities does not reflect the behavior observed. 

Behavioralization is therefore used to assess the interest rate risk of our assets and liabilities and this assessed risk is transferred to BSM, in accordance with the rules governing the transfer of interest rate risk from the global businesses to BSM. 

Behavioralization is applied in three key areas: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

the assessed re-pricing frequency of managed rate balances; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

the assessed duration of non-interest bearing balances, typically capital and current accounts; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

the base case expected prepayment behavior or pipeline take-up rate for fixed rate balances with embedded optionality. 

##TABLE_END Interest rate behavioralization policies have to be formulated in line with the HSBC Group's behavioralization policies and approved at least annually by ALCO and global Asset, Liability and Capital Management, in conjunction with local, regional and HSBC Group risk monitoring teams. 

The extent to which balances can be behavioralized is driven by: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

the amount of the current balance that can be assessed as stable under business-as-usual conditions; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

for managed rate balances the historic market interest rate re-pricing behavior observed; or 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

for non-interest bearing balances the duration for which the balance is expected to remain under business-as-usual conditions. This assessment is often driven by the re-investment tenors available to BSM to neutralize the risk through the use of fixed rate government bonds or interest rate derivatives, and for derivatives the availability of cash flow hedging capacity. 

##TABLE_END Capital risk/sensitivity of accumulated other comprehensive loss &#32;Large movements of interest rates could directly affect some reported capital balances and ratios. The mark-to-market valuation of available-for-sale securities is recorded on a tax effected

basis to accumulated other comprehensive loss. This valuation mark is included in two important accounting based capital ratios: common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and total equity to total assets. At December 31, 2019 , we had an available-for-sale securities portfolio of approximately $35,663 million &#32;with a negative &#32;mark-to-market adjustment of $69 million . An increase of 25 basis points in interest rates of all maturities would lower the mark-to-market by approximately $342 million &#32;to a net loss &#32;of $411 million &#32;with the following results on our capital ratios:

##TABLE_END Resilience Risk Management &#160; Resilience risk arises from failures or inadequacies in processes, people, systems or external events. These may be driven by rapid technological innovation, changing behaviors of our consumers, cyber threats, cross-border dependencies and third-party relationships. 

In 2019, in line with our simplified risk taxonomy, we formed a new Resilience Risk sub-function to ensure our operations continue functioning when an operational disturbance occurs. Our resilience strategy is focused on the establishment of robust back-up plans, detailed response methods, alternative delivery channels and recovery options. Resilience risk was formed to simplify the way we interact with our stakeholders and to deliver clear, consistent and credible responses across the organization. The new sub-function consolidates personnel from several previously independent risk functions into a single Resilience Risk sub-function. These personnel have deep roots in the organization, across the following risk areas: Information and Security Resilience, Protective Security, Business Continuity and Incident Management, Third-party, and Systems, Data Integrity and Transaction Processing. We also adopted a new organizational structure that allows us to more efficiently deliver our strengths and expertise across the six resilience risk lenses discussed below. 

Resilience Risk provides guidance and stewardship to our businesses and global functions about how we can prevent, adapt, and learn from resilience-related threats when something goes wrong. We view resilience through six lenses: strategic change and emerging threats; third-party risk; information and data resilience; payments and processing resilience; systems and cyber resilience; and protective security risk. 

The HSBC Group Resilience Risk Executive Committee oversees resilience risk and has accountability to the HSBC Global Risk Management Board. The HSBC Group Resilience Risk Executive Committee is supported by its subcommittees that provide oversight over each of the respective Resilience Risk sub-teams. The HSBC Group Resilience Risk Governance Meeting ensures that resilience risk is managed within its defined risk appetite. It is jointly chaired by the Global Head of Operational Resilience and the HSBC Group Chief Information Officer. The HSBC Group Resilience Risk Governance Meeting has accountability into the HSBC Group Non-Financial Risk Management Board, and escalates issues to the HSBC Group Risk Committee. 

Operational resilience is our ability to adapt operations to continue functioning when an operational disturbance occurs. We measure resilience in terms of the maximum disruption period or their impact tolerance that we are willing to accept for a business service. Resilience risk cannot be managed down to zero, so we concentrate on critical business and strategic change programs that have the highest potential to threaten our ability to provide continued service to our customers. Our resilience strategy is focused on the establishment of robust back-up plans, detailed response methods, alternative delivery channels and recovery options. The Resilience Risk team oversees the identification, management and control of resilience risks. 

Systems and Cyber Resilience The security of our information and technology infrastructure is crucial for maintaining our applications and processes while protecting our customers and the HSBC brand. In common with other financial institutions and multinational organizations, we face a growing threat of cyberattacks that continue to increase in sophistication. A failure of our defenses against such attacks could result in financial loss or the loss of customer data or other sensitive information which could undermine both our reputation and our ability to attract and retain our customers. We experienced cyberattacks in 2019, none of which resulted in material financial loss. We continue to mature our cyber intelligence capabilities as the cyber threat landscape evolves. These intelligence monitoring capabilities increase our agility and ability to respond with increased detection and response capabilities reducing potential exposure to cyber threats. Regulators have listed cybersecurity as their top concern in 2019. Regulation continues to increase from multiple jurisdictions and perspectives, and is deployed without coordination with other regulators. HSBC is engaged with peer institutions working to address regulatory harmonization as it relates to cyber and information security. We have met with the U.S. Treasury Department and all regulatory bodies (e.g. the OCC, FRB, FDIC, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, etc.) to progress harmonization. Cybersecurity will continue to be a strong focus of ongoing initiatives to strengthen the control environment and our readiness to respond in the event of an attack.

Regulatory Compliance Risk Management &#160; Regulatory compliance risk arises from the risks associated with breaching our duty to clients and other counter-parties, inappropriate market conduct, and breaching other regulatory requirements. Regulatory compliance risk is measured by reference to identified metrics, key risk indicators, testing of controls by the three lines of defense, employee feedback, customer complaints and through regulatory feedback. Regulatory compliance risks are assessed through detailed assessments and reported to the RMM and the Board of Directors through the reporting of RAS metrics and the Regulatory Compliance Enterprise Risk Assessment report. Regulatory compliance risk is managed by establishing and communicating appropriate policies and procedures, training employees in regulatory requirements, establishing controls, and monitoring and testing controls to help ensure that the regulatory requirements are being adhered to. Proactive assessment and enhancement of controls is undertaken where required. 

The Second LoD risk stewards provide independent, objective oversight and challenge and promote a compliance-orientated culture, supporting the businesses in delivering fair outcomes for customers, maintaining the integrity of financial markets and achieving our strategic objectives. Any actual or potential regulatory breaches require prompt identification and escalation to the Regulatory Compliance function or other applicable risk stewards. Any major breaches, gaps, issues and emerging risks are escalated to RMM and the Board of Directors, as appropriate. 

The Regulatory Compliance function oversees the management of regulatory compliance risk for laws, codes, rules, regulations and standards that align under its scope of oversight as the Second LoD risk steward. As a Board of Directors sub-committee, the CCC oversees our compliance risk management program (both Regulatory Compliance and Financial Crime Risk) as well as fiduciary matters as discussed further below. 

Fiduciary Risk &#32;is a component of regulatory compliance risk and represents the risk of breaching fiduciary duties where we act in a fiduciary capacity as trustee, investment manager or as mandated by law or regulation. It is the risk associated with failing to offer services honestly and properly to clients in that capacity. Fiduciary risks reside in our PB businesses (such as Investment Management, Personal Trust, Security Operation Services) and other business lines outside of PB (such as Corporate Trust). Fiduciary risk is governed by the CCC. The CCC has delegated day-to-day management and oversight responsibilities to management, whose primary oversight body for management of fiduciary activity is the Fiduciary Risk Management Meeting, chaired by the U.S. Head of Enterprise Compliance. The U.S. Head of Enterprise Compliance reports to the U.S. Head of Regulatory Compliance. 

Financial Crime and Fraud Risk Management &#32;&#32;Financial crime and fraud risk management is the framework in place to identify and deter potential illegal activity from occurring by, at, or through the HSBC Group. It is embedded in our day to day operations and culture. 

The Financial Crime Compliance function ("FCC") is led by the U.S. Head of FCC, who reports to the CEO and the HSBC Global Head of FCC and Group Money Laundering Reporting Officer. FCC provides oversight to enable us to build on our achievements in managing financial crime risk effectively and to continue to strengthen financial crime detection, and anti-money laundering ("AML"), sanctions, fraud, tax evasion and anti-bribery and corruption compliance. The U.S. Head of FCC has delegated authority from the CEO over the FCRMC which escalates to the CCC on matters relating to financial crime and fraud risk management. Line of Business Financial Crime Risk Management Committees ("LOB FCRMCs") are established to support the effective management of financial crime risk at the lines of business. The LoB FCRMCs are chaired by the respective line of business CEOs. We use a Financial Crime Risk Management Information Dashboard ("FCR MI Dashboard") to monitor risk and performance indicators of financial crime, including trends and potential gaps in the management of financial crime risk that require attention. Separate FCR MI Dashboards are produced monthly for each of the lines of business and for HSBC North America overall. 

FCC is a sub-function of the Compliance function, which also includes Regulatory Compliance, Financial Crime Threat Mitigation ("FCTM"), Regulatory Affairs, Assurance, and Chief Operating Office. FCTM is a global capability to proactively identify, analyze and investigate financial crime risk and ensure proper mitigation of these risks. It works closely with the lines of business and functions to provide the information needed to mitigate financial crime risk. FCC continues to embed policies and procedures, introduce new technology solutions, and support a culture of compliance needed to effectively manage financial crime risk including the enterprise wide compliance risk management program. 

Strategic Risk Management Strategic risk may be mitigated by consideration of the potential opportunities and challenges through the strategic planning process. This risk is also a function of the compatibility of our strategic goals, the business strategies developed to achieve those goals, the resources deployed against those goals and the quality of implementation. 

We have established a strong internal control structure to minimize the impact of strategic risk to our earnings and capital. All changes in strategy as well as the process in which new strategies are implemented are subject to detailed reviews and approvals at business line, functional, regional, board and HSBC levels. This process is monitored by the Strategy and Planning function to ensure compliance with our policies and standards. 

Reputational risk is a component of strategic risk and represents the risk arising from failure to meet stakeholder expectations as a result of any event, behavior, action or inaction, either by us, our employees, the HSBC Group or those with whom it is associated, that may cause stakeholders to form a negative view of us. This might also result in financial or non-financial impacts, loss of 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. 

##TABLE_END

confidence or other consequences. The safeguarding of our reputation is of paramount importance to our continued prosperity and is the responsibility of every member of our staff. Reputational risk can arise from social, ethical or environmental issues, or as a consequence of operational and other risk events. Our good reputation depends upon the way in which we conduct our business, but can also be affected by the way in which customers to whom we provide financial services conduct themselves. 

Reputational risk relates to stakeholders' perceptions, whether based on fact or otherwise. Stakeholder expectations are constantly changing and thus, reputational risk is dynamic and will differ between geographies, groups and individuals. 

We tolerate a limited degree of reputational risk arising from business activities or association where foreseeable reputational risk has been escalated to the appropriate level of management, carefully considered and/or mitigated and is determined to fall to acceptable risk thresholds as defined by the HSBC Group risk appetite statement. Since reputational risk can arise from all aspects of operations and activities, all businesses and functions are required to articulate and track reputational risk. 

Reputational risk is considered and assessed by the HSBC Group Management Board, the HSBC Group and local Board of Directors and senior management during the establishment of standards for all major aspects of business and the formulation of policy and products. These policies, which are an integral part of the internal control systems, are communicated through manuals and statements of policy, internal communication and training. The policies form the basis for operational procedures, as well as consideration of reputational risk in areas including money laundering deterrence, economic sanctions, environmental impact, anti-corruption measures, employee relations, inappropriate market conduct and breach of regulatory duty and requirements. 

We have taken steps over the past several years to de-risk our businesses and product offering to reduce reputational risk. In addition, we continue to strengthen our internal control structure to minimize the risk of operational and financial failure and to ensure that a full appraisal of reputational risk is made before strategic decisions are taken. 

The RMM and FCRMC provide governance and oversight of reputational risk. Each business reviews transactions and customers that may adversely affect our public perception via their RRCSC. The RRCSCs are chaired by a senior executive and are comprised of senior members from the business, risk, legal, financial crime and compliance departments and other invited parties. The RRCSCs are responsible for reviewing the individual merits and involved parties in higher-risk transactions, and approving or declining customer relationships and transactions based on the potential risks to us. In addition to the RRCSCs, the responsibility of the practical implementation of such policies and the compliance with the letter and spirit of them rests with our CEO and senior management of our businesses. 

Model Risk Management In order to manage the risk of inappropriate or incorrect business decisions (e.g. customer conduct, financial crime, pricing, profit &#38; loss and balance sheet and capital reporting, etc.) arising from models that have been inadequately designed, implemented or used; or that models do not perform in line with expectations and predictions, a comprehensive model risk management framework has been established that provides oversight and challenge to all models across HSBC North America. The framework includes a Model Standards Policy that aligns with model risk management regulations. A model inventory is maintained and updated on a semi-annual basis. In addition, a model risk measurement framework is used to measure, mitigate and monitor model risk. Model risk is managed on an ongoing basis as part of a Model Risk Committee, which is chaired by the CRO with representation from businesses and functions. The Independent Model Review ("IMR") team, which is part of the Model Risk Management function, is responsible for providing effective challenge to models and critical processes implemented for use within HSBC North America. Validations are conducted in-line with supervisory guidance on model risk management issued by the OCC and FRB as well as other applicable internal guidelines. IMR activities are segregated from the model development process to ensure that incentives are aligned with the function's role to challenge models and identify model limitations. The IMR process assesses model development, implementation, use, validation, and governance.
