 Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

INTRODUCTION 

The Charles Schwab Corporation (CSC) is a savings and loan holding company. CSC engages, through its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as Schwab or the Company), in wealth management, securities brokerage, banking, asset management, custody, and financial advisory services. 

Principal business subsidiaries of CSC include the following: 

&#8226; Charles Schwab &#38; Co., Inc. (CS&#38;Co), incorporated in 1971, a securities broker-dealer; 

&#8226; TD Ameritrade, Inc., an introducing securities broker-dealer; 

&#8226; TD Ameritrade Clearing, Inc. (TDAC), a securities broker-dealer that provides trade execution and clearing services to TD Ameritrade, Inc.; 

&#8226; Charles Schwab Bank, SSB (CSB), our principal banking entity; and 

&#8226; Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc. (CSIM), the investment advisor for Schwab&#8217;s proprietary mutual funds (Schwab Funds &#174; ) and for Schwab&#8217;s exchange-traded funds (Schwab ETFs &#8482; ). 

Unless otherwise indicated, the terms &#8220;Schwab,&#8221; &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221; mean CSC together with its consolidated subsidiaries. 

Schwab provides financial services to individuals and institutional clients through two segments &#8211; Investor Services and Advisor Services. The Investor Services segment provides retail brokerage, investment advisory, and banking and trust services to individual investors, and retirement plan services, as well as other corporate brokerage services, to businesses and their employees. The Advisor Services segment provides custodial, trading, banking and trust, and support services, as well as retirement business services, to independent registered investment advisors (RIAs), independent retirement advisors, and recordkeepers. 

Schwab was founded on the belief that all Americans deserve access to a better investing experience. Although much has changed in the intervening years, our purpose remains clear &#8211; to champion every client&#8217;s goals with passion and integrity. Guided by this purpose and our vision of creating the most trusted leader in investment services, management has adopted a strategy described as &#8220;Through Clients&#8217; Eyes.&#8221; 

This strategy emphasizes placing clients&#8217; perspectives, needs, and desires at the forefront. Because investing plays a fundamental role in building financial security, we strive to deliver a better investing experience for our clients &#8211; individual investors and the people and institutions who serve them &#8211; by disrupting longstanding industry practices on their behalf and providing superior service. We also aim to offer a broad range of products and solutions to meet client needs with a focus on transparency, value, and trust. In addition, management works to couple Schwab&#8217;s scale and resources with ongoing expense discipline to keep costs low and ensure that products and solutions are affordable as well as responsive to client needs. In combination, these are the key elements of our &#8220;no trade-offs&#8221; approach to serving investors. We believe that following this strategy is the best way to maximize our market valuation and stockholder returns over time. 

Management estimates that investable wealth in the United States (U.S.) (consisting of assets in defined contribution, retail wealth management and brokerage, and registered investment advisor channels, along with bank deposits) currently exceeds $60 trillion, which means the Company&#8217;s $6.64 trillion in client assets leaves substantial opportunity for growth. Our strategy is based on the principle that developing trusted relationships will translate into more assets from both new and existing clients, ultimately driving more revenue, and along with expense discipline and thoughtful capital management, will generate earnings growth and build long-term stockholder value. 

This Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 (2021 Form 10-K).

(3) Adjusted total expenses is a non-GAAP financial measure adjusting total expenses excluding interest. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures. 

During the first nine months of 2022, our clients faced a challenging macroeconomic environment that included rising inflation, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s corresponding aggressive monetary tightening policy, Russia&#8217;s continued war in Ukraine, and increasing challenges across other global economies. Equity markets declined substantially throughout the first nine months of 2022, with the S&#38;P 500 extending year-to-date losses to 25% through September 30. 

Against this backdrop, clients&#8217; daily average trades (DATs) in the third quarter remained consistent with the prior year quarter at 5.5 million, while declining 8% to 6.1 million on a year-to-date basis as investor sentiment softened, particularly compared with the extraordinary client trading levels seen in early 2021. New brokerage accounts were also down from the prior year, as clients opened 897 thousand and 3.1 million new brokerage accounts in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively. Active brokerage accounts were 33.9 million at September 30, 2022, increasing 4% year-over-year. Core net new assets were $114.6 billion in the third quarter and brought the year-to-date 2022 total to $299.3 billion. We ended the third quarter of 2022 with total client assets of $6.64 trillion, down 13% from September 30, 2021, and down 18% from year-end 2021, as declines in market valuations of approximately $1.4 trillion over the past 12 months outweighed our continued asset gathering.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) 

Schwab&#8217;s financial results in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 reflected the strength of our business and significant benefits from higher market interest rates. Net income totaled $2.0 billion and $5.2 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively, increasing 32% and 22% from the comparable periods in 2021. Diluted earnings per common share (EPS) was $.99 and $2.53 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively, rising 34% and 23% from the same periods in the prior year. Adjusted diluted EPS (1) , which excludes acquisition and integration-related costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and related income tax effects, was $1.10 and $2.83 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively, up 31% and 18% from the comparable periods in 2021. 

Total net revenues were $5.5 billion and $15.3 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively, rising 20% and 11% from the comparable periods in 2021. Net interest revenue increased to $2.9 billion and $7.7 billion for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, representing growth of 44% and 30% over the prior year periods primarily as a result of significantly higher market rates. Asset management and administration fees of $1.0 billion and $3.2 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively, were down 5% from the third quarter of 2021 and largely flat with the first nine months of 2021, as significant declines in equity market valuations offset the benefit of lower money market fund fee waivers. 

Trading revenue totaled $930 million and $2.8 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively, down 4% and 11% from the same periods in 2021, due primarily to changes in the mix of client trading activity, and, for the year-to-date period, lower DATs in 2022 relative to the extraordinary client trading volume seen early in 2021. Bank deposit account fee revenue was $413 million and $1.1 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively, increasing 28% and 5% from the same periods in 2021, as higher average net yields more than offset lower average BDA balances. BDA balances totaled $139.6 billion at September 30, 2022, down 9% from September 30, 2021 and down 12% from year-end 2021. 

Total expenses excluding interest amounted to $2.8 billion and $8.5 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively, increasing 10% and 4% from the same periods in 2021. Adjusted total expenses (1) were $2.6 billion and 

$7.7 billion for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively, increasing 12% and 6% from the same periods in 2021. The increases in total expenses excluding interest and total adjusted expenses reflected higher compensation and benefits expense and higher occupancy and equipment expense, as we continued to invest in our people and technology to support ongoing growth in our client base. The year-to-date increases were partially offset by lower other expense, which included a charge of approximately $200 million in the second quarter of 2021 (see Item 1 &#8211; Note 9). 

Return on average common stockholders&#8217; equity increased to 25% and 18% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively, compared with 12% and 11% in the comparable periods in 2021. Return on tangible common equity (1) (ROTCE) was 74% and 42% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively, compared with 23% and 21% in the same periods in the prior year. The increases in both return on average common stockholders&#8217; equity and ROTCE were due primarily to lower stockholders&#8217; equity and higher net income. Stockholders&#8217; equity declined in the first nine months of 2022 due to a significant decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), as higher market interest rates resulted in larger unrealized losses on our available for sale (AFS) portfolio. 

The Company continued its diligent approach to balance sheet management amid a rapidly evolving macroeconomic environment in the first nine months of 2022, maintaining appropriate capital and liquidity to support client activity and returning excess capital to stockholders. Total balance sheet assets of $577.6 billion at September 30, 2022 were down 9% in the third quarter and down 13% from year-end 2021, primarily due to decreases in bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients as a result of client cash allocation decisions and unrealized losses on AFS securities, both primarily resulting from higher market interest rates. 

During the third quarter, the Board of Directors approved a 10% increase in our common dividend and a $15 billion share repurchase authorization; repurchases under this new authorization totaled $1.5 billion in the third quarter. As announced in September, the Company redeemed its $400 million Series A Preferred Stock effective November 1, 2022, and we announced in October the redemption of our $600 million Series E Preferred Stock, effective December 1, 2022. In addition, during the third quarter, we lowered our operating objective for the Company&#8217;s consolidated Tier 1 Leverage Ratio by 25 basis points to 6.50%-6.75%. The Company&#8217;s Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 6.8% at September 30, 2022, slightly above our new operating objective. 

(1) Adjusted diluted EPS, adjusted total expenses, and return on tangible common equity are non-GAAP financial measures. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further details and a reconciliation of such measures to GAAP reported results.

Integration of TD Ameritrade 

Effective October 6, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (TDA Holding) and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively referred to as &#8220;TD Ameritrade&#8221; or &#8220;TDA&#8221;). Integration work continued during the first nine months of 2022. Based on our current integration plans and expanded scope of technology work, the Company now expects to complete most client conversions across multiple groups over the course of 2023, with certain client groups to be completed in early 2024. We now expect to incur total acquisition and integration-related costs and capital expenditures of between $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion, which reflects increased costs resulting from incremental complexity in conversion work, due in part to the replacement of certain vendor resources following Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, as well as overall inflationary pressures. 

The Company&#8217;s estimates of the nature, amounts, and timing of recognition of acquisition and integration-related costs remain subject to change based on a number of factors, including the expected duration and complexity of the integration process and the continued uncertainty of the economic environment. More specifically, factors that could cause variability in our expected acquisition and integration-related costs include the level of employee attrition and availability of third-party labor, workforce redeployment from eliminated positions into open roles, changes in the levels of client activity, as well as changes in the scope and cost of technology and real estate-related exit cost variability due to effects of changes in remote working trends. 

Acquisition and integration-related costs, which are inclusive of related exit costs, totaled $101 million and $291 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively, and $104 million and $367 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2021, respectively. Over the course of the integration, we continue to expect to realize annualized cost synergies of between $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion, and, through September 30, 2022, we have achieved over half of this amount on an annualized run-rate basis. The Company expects to realize the vast majority of the remaining estimated cost synergies by the end of 2024. Estimated timing and amounts of synergy realization are subject to change as we progress in the integration. Refer to Part II &#8211; Item 7 &#8211; Overview in our 2021 Form 10-K and Item 1 &#8211; Note 10 for additional information regarding our integration of TD Ameritrade. 

Current Regulatory Environment and Other Developments 

Results of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s 2022 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review 

In June 2022, the Company received the results of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s 2022 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). These results included the Federal Reserve&#8217;s estimate of CSC&#8217;s minimum capital ratios under the supervisory severely adverse scenario for the nine-quarter horizon beginning December 31, 2021 and ending March 31, 2024. Based on these results, CSC&#8217;s calculated stress capital buffer was below the 2.5% minimum, resulting in a stress capital buffer at the 2.5% floor. This 2.5% stress capital buffer became applicable on October 1, 2022. See Item 1 &#8211; Note 16 for additional information regarding our capital requirements. 

Inflation Reduction Act of 2022: Excise Tax on Share Repurchases 

In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (Inflation Reduction Act) was enacted into law. Among many other items, the Inflation Reduction Act imposes a nondeductible 1% excise tax on a publicly traded corporation on the fair market value of certain stock that it repurchases, net of issuances, effective for repurchases after December 31, 2022. The Company believes share repurchases made under its current repurchase authorization beginning in 2023 will become subject to this tax. We expect to recognize the tax as a direct and incremental cost associated with these transactions. For repurchases of common stock, we expect the tax will be recorded as part of the cost basis of the treasury stock repurchased, resulting in no income statement impact. 

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Assessment Rate Increase 

In October 2022, the FDIC adopted a final rule to increase the initial base deposit insurance assessment rates by 2 basis points, beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The FDIC has stated that this change is intended to raise the FDIC&#8217;s Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) reserve ratio to the minimum threshold within the FDIC&#8217;s established DIF restoration plan, and will remain in effect until the DIF reserve ratio meets the FDIC&#8217;s long-term goal of 2%. A 2 basis point increase in the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate will result in a corresponding increase in regulatory fees and assessments, as well as a corresponding decrease in bank deposit account fee revenue based on IDA balances.

Net Interest Revenue 

Revenue on interest-earning assets is affected by various factors, such as the composition of assets, prevailing interest rates and spreads at the time of origination or purchase, changes in interest rates on floating-rate securities and loans, and changes in prepayment levels for mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities and loans. Schwab establishes the rates paid on client-related liabilities, and management expects that it will generally adjust the rates paid on these liabilities at some fraction of any movement in short-term rates. Interest expense on long-term debt, short-term borrowings, and other funding sources is impacted by market interest rates at the time of borrowing and changes in interest rates on floating-rate debt. 

Interest rates increased significantly from year-end 2021 through September 30, 2022. Short-term rates were near zero until the Federal Reserve began its aggressive tightening cycle in response to rising inflation beginning in March 2022, ultimately increasing the federal funds target overnight rate five times between March and September for a total increase of 300 basis points, while long-term interest rates increased throughout the first nine months of the year. 

Schwab continued to see strength in net new client assets during the first nine months of 2022, which, along with transfers of BDA balances to the Company&#8217;s balance sheet (see Bank Deposit Account Fees), drove growth in Schwab&#8217;s average interest-earning assets in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 relative to the same periods in 2021. Partially offsetting this growth, we experienced significant seasonal tax outflows in the second quarter, and, due to the rapid increases to the federal funds overnight rate, changes in client cash allocations increased in the third quarter which resulted in a total decrease in bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients of 9% during the third quarter and 11% since year-end 2021. In recent quarters, the Company increased its cash holdings and reduced the duration of incremental investment securities purchases, which has provided flexibility to support such changes in client cash allocations associated with higher short-term interest rates. These steps also help keep Schwab positioned to benefit from interest rate increases. 

The following table presents net interest revenue information corresponding to interest-earning assets and funding sources on the condensed consolidated balance sheets:

(2) In January 2022, the Company transferred a portion of its investment securities designated as available for sale to the held to maturity category, as described in Item 1 &#8211; Note 4. 

Net interest revenue increased $896 million, or 44%, and $1.8 billion, or 30%, in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021. These increases were due primarily to higher average yields on substantially all interest-earning assets as a result of higher market interest rates. Net premium amortization of investment securities decreased to $295 million and $1.2 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively, from $560 million and $1.8 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2021, respectively. These benefits were partially offset by higher rates paid on bank deposits, payables to brokerage clients, and long-term debt, as well as lower balances of margin loans and lower securities lending revenue due to decreased market demand. 

Average interest-earning assets for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 were higher by 6% and 15%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021. These increases were primarily due to growth in bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients, which resulted from net new client asset inflows as well as transfers of BDA balances to our balance sheet in the third quarter of 2021 and the first nine months of 2022. These year-over-year increases were partially offset by client cash allocation decisions in response to higher short-term market interest rates in the second and third quarters of 2022, as clients moved certain cash balances out of bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients. 

Net interest margin increased to 1.97% and 1.65% during the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively, from 1.45% and 1.46% during the same periods in 2021. These increases were primarily driven by improved yields on substantially all interest-earning assets as a result of higher market interest rates partially offset by higher rates paid on our funding sources driven primarily by bank deposits, payables to brokerage clients, and recent debt issuances and floating-rate long-term debt balances.

Asset management and administration fees declined by $54 million, or 5%, in the third quarter of 2022 and were essentially flat in the first nine months of 2022, compared to the same periods in 2021. The decrease in the third quarter of 2022 was a result of lower balances in Mutual Fund OneSource &#174; and other third-party mutual funds, as well as advice solutions, relative to the same period in 2021. Balances declined primarily due to equity market weakness during the first nine months of 2022, which negatively impacted client asset valuations. These decreases were partially offset during the third quarter, and fully offset in the year-to-date period, by lower money market fund fee waivers, which were eliminated during the second quarter of 2022 as a result of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s increases to the federal funds target overnight rate.

Trading Revenue 

Trading revenue includes commissions, order flow revenue, and principal transaction revenues. Commissions and order flow revenue are primarily affected by volume and mix of client trades executed. Principal transaction revenue is recognized primarily as a result of accommodating clients&#8217; fixed income trading activity, and includes adjustments to the fair value of securities positions held to facilitate such client trading activity. 

The following table presents trading revenue and related information: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Percent Change Nine Months Ended September 30, Percent Change 2022 2021 2022 2021 Trading revenue $ 930 $ 964 (4) % $ 2,778 $ 3,135 (11) % DATs (in thousands) 5,523 5,549 &#8212; 6,103 6,644 (8) % Number of trading days 64.0 64.0 &#8212; 188.0 188.0 &#8212; 

Revenue per trade (1) 

$ 2.63 $ 2.71 (3) % $ 2.42 $ 2.51 (4) % 

(1) Revenue per trade is calculated as trading revenue divided by DATs multiplied by the number of trading days. 

Trading revenue decreased $34 million and $357 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021. The decrease in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2021 was primarily due to changes in the mix of client trading activity toward more ETFs and fewer single stocks, and toward more index options and futures and fewer single stock options, resulting in lower commissions and order flow revenue, which decreased 7% and 10%, respectively, from the third quarter of 2021. The decrease in the first nine months of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 was primarily due to lower client trading activity during the first quarter of 2022 relative to the extraordinary trading volume experienced during the first quarter of 2021, as well as changes in the mix of client trading activity. These factors drove lower commissions and order flow revenue, which each decreased 13% from the first nine months of 2021.

Bank Deposit Account Fees 

The Company earns bank deposit account fee revenue pursuant to the IDA agreement with TD Bank USA, National Association and TD Bank, National Association (together, the TD Depository Institutions) and arrangements with other third-party banks. 

The following table presents bank deposit account fee revenue, average BDA balances, average net yield, and average balances earning floating- and fixed-rate yields: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Percent Change Nine Months Ended September 30, Percent Change 2022 2021 2022 2021 Bank deposit account fees $ 413 $ 323 28 % $ 1,059 $ 1,011 5 % Average BDA balances $ 148,142 $ 151,504 (2) % $ 152,698 $ 159,829 (4) % Average net yield 1.09 % 0.83 % 0.92 % 0.84 % Percentage of average BDA balances designated as: Fixed-rate balances 79 % 81 % 78 % 80 % Floating-rate balances 21 % 19 % 22 % 20 % 

Bank deposit account fees increased $90 million, or 28%, and $48 million, or 5%, in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021. These increases were primarily due to higher market interest rates, which helped to increase the average net yield in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022. The Company transferred $20.1 billion and $10.5 billion of BDA balances to its balance sheet during the first nine months of 2022 and 2021, respectively. The transfer of these balances to our balance sheet, as well as client cash allocation decisions in response to higher short-term market interest rates in the second and third quarters of 2022, led to the decrease in average BDA balances in the first nine months of 2022 compared with the first nine months of 2021. 

Transfers of BDA balances to Schwab&#8217;s balance sheet result in lower balances upon which bank deposit account fee revenue is earned but provide a source of funding to invest in interest-earning assets to increase net interest revenue. See also Capital Management and Item 1 &#8211; Note 9 for discussion of the IDA agreement and the potential to move IDA balances to Schwab&#8217;s balance sheet. 

Other Revenue 

Other revenue includes exchange processing fees, certain service fees, software fees, non-recurring gains, and the provision for credit losses on bank loans. 

Other revenue increased $32 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to higher exchange processing fees, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses on bank loans and losses on sales of AFS securities. Exchange processing fees increased as a result of an SEC fee rate increase which became effective in the second quarter of 2022, and the provision for credit losses on bank loans increased as a result of higher loan loss factors driven primarily by higher forecasted interest rates and growth of the loan portfolio. Other revenue decreased $6 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to the higher provision for credit losses, certain lower service fees due to lower trading volume, and lower net gains on sales of AFS securities, partially offset by higher exchange processing fees. In addition, other revenue in the first nine months of 2022 included a gain of $46 million on the sale of Schwab Compliance Technologies, Inc. and certain investments.

Expenses excluding interest increased by $264 million and $353 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021. Adjusted total expenses, which excludes acquisition and integration-related costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets, increased 12% and 6% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further details and a reconciliation of such measures to GAAP reported results. 

Total compensation and benefits increased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021, primarily due to growth in employee headcount to support our expanding client base, annual merit increases, as well as a 5% employee salary increase and other targeted compensation adjustments that went into effect in late 2021. Compensation and benefits included acquisition and integration-related costs of $57 million and $58 million in the third quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $166 million and $227 million in the first nine months of 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Professional services expense increased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021, primarily due to increased utilization of technology-related and other professional services to support overall growth of the business and enhancement to technological infrastructure to support our expanding client base, as well as the integration of TD Ameritrade. Professional services included acquisition and integration-related costs of $36 million and $35 million in the third quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $102 million and $99 million in the first nine months of 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Occupancy and equipment expense increased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021, primarily due to an increase in software maintenance and other agreements as well as other technology equipment costs to support growth of the business and the integration of TD Ameritrade. Occupancy and equipment included acquisition and integration-related costs of $6 million and $7 million in the third quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $14 million and $30 million in the first nine months of 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Advertising and market development expense decreased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021, primarily due to decreases in spending for marketing communications for TD Ameritrade.

Communications expense decreased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021, primarily due to lower client trading activity. 

Depreciation and amortization expense increased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021, primarily as a result of higher amortization of purchased and internally developed software and higher depreciation of hardware, driven by capital expenditures in 2021 and the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 to support the TDA integration and enhance our technological infrastructure to support growth of the business. 

Regulatory fees and assessments in the third quarter of 2022 were largely consistent with the third quarter of 2021, and decreased in the first nine months of the year from the first nine months of 2021. The year-to-date decrease in 2022 primarily resulted from lower client trading activity, partially offset by higher FDIC assessments and other regulatory assessments due to asset growth and overall growth of the business. 

Other expense increased in the third quarter of 2022 while decreasing in the first nine months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. The increase in the third quarter of 2022 was primarily due to higher exchange processing fees as a result of fee rate increases beginning in the second quarter of 2022, while the decrease in the first nine months of 2022 was primarily due to the recognition in the second quarter of 2021 of approximately $200 million for a now-settled regulatory matter (see Item 1 &#8211; Note 9). 

Capital expenditures were $193 million and $176 million in the third quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $741 million and $610 million for the first nine months of 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increases in capital expenditures from the prior year were primarily related to continued work on the TDA integration and enhancement of our technological infrastructure to support greater capacity for our expanding client base. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures for full-year 2022 will be approximately 4-5% of total net revenues. 

Taxes on Income 

Taxes on income were $657 million and $485 million for the third quarters of 2022 and 2021, respectively, resulting in effective income tax rates on income before taxes of 24.5% and 24.1%, respectively. Taxes on income were $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion for the first nine months of 2022 and 2021, respectively, resulting in effective income tax rates on income before taxes of 23.2% and 24.9%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 was primarily related to increased 2022 state tax expense. The decrease in the effective tax rate in the first nine months of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 was primarily related to the reversal of tax reserves in 2022 due to the resolution of certain state matters and tax benefits recognized on the portion of the regulatory matter charge that was determined upon settlement to be deductible.

Segment Net Revenues 

Investor Services total net revenues increased by 15% and 6% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021, while Advisor Services total net revenues increased by 38% and 28% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021. Investor Services growth was primarily driven by increases in net interest revenue as described above, partially offset by decreases in trading revenue due to changes in the mix of client trading activity, resulting in lower commissions and order flow revenue. Advisor Services growth was primarily driven by increases in net interest revenue as described above, as well as increases in trading revenue primarily due to market volatility and bank deposit account fees primarily due to a rising interest rate environment. Asset management and administration fees were essentially flat for Advisor Services for both periods, while declining slightly for Investor Services as equity market weakness during the first nine months of 2022 weighed on client asset valuations, partially offset by the elimination of money market fund fee waivers. Other revenues increased for Investor Services in the third quarter of 2022 from the same period in 2021 due to higher exchange processing fees, partially offset by an increased provision for credit losses on bank loans and losses on sales of AFS securities. 

Segment Expenses Excluding Interest 

Investor Services total expenses excluding interest increased by 8% and 2% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021, while Advisor Services total expenses excluding interest increased by 17% and 13% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021. Both segments saw higher compensation and benefits expenses due to increases in headcount to support our expanding client base, annual merit increases, as well as a 5% employee salary increase and other targeted compensation adjustments that went into effect in late 2021. Occupancy and equipment expenses increased in both segments, primarily due to an increase in software maintenance and other agreements as well as other technology equipment costs to support growth of the business and the integration of TD Ameritrade. In addition, depreciation and amortization increased for both segments primarily due to higher amortization of purchased and internally developed software and higher depreciation of hardware, driven by capital expenditures in 2021 and the first nine months of 2022 to enhance our technological infrastructure to support growth of the business. For Investor Services, these increases in the first nine months of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 were partially offset by lower other expenses due to a charge of approximately $200 million in the second quarter of 2021 for a now-settled regulatory matter (see Item 1 &#8211; Note 9). In addition, increases in both segments were partially offset by decreases in advertising and market development expense due to reduced spending for marketing communications for TD Ameritrade. 

RISK MANAGEMENT 

Schwab&#8217;s business activities expose it to a variety of risks, including operational, compliance, credit, market, and liquidity risks. The Company has a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact. 

As part of our ongoing integration of TD Ameritrade, the Company has aligned TD Ameritrade&#8217;s risk management practices with Schwab&#8217;s risk appetite. Our integration work included evaluating new or changed risks impacting the combined company, 

- 15 - 

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) 

and taking action through various means. Though integration work continues, the Company&#8217;s operations, inclusive of TD Ameritrade, remain consistent with our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework. 

For a discussion of our risk management programs, see Part II &#8211; Item 7 &#8211; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Risk Management in the 2021 Form 10-K. 

Interest Rate Risk Simulations 

Net Interest Revenue Simulation 

For our net interest revenue sensitivity analysis, we use net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates. The simulations include all balance sheet interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities. Key assumptions include the projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors, prepayment speeds of mortgage-related investments, repricing of financial instruments, and reinvestment of matured or paid-down securities and loans. 

Net interest revenue is affected by various factors, such as the distribution and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the spread between yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which may reprice at different times or by different amounts, and the spread between short- and long-term interest rates. Interest-earning assets include investment securities, margin loans, bank loans, and cash and cash equivalents. These assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment. Because we establish the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on certain margin and bank loans, and control the composition of our investment securities, we have some ability to manage our net interest spread, depending on competitive factors and market conditions. 

Net interest revenue sensitivity analysis assumes the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates. As we actively manage the consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure, in all likelihood we would take steps to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment. 

The following table shows the simulated change to net interest revenue over the next 12 months beginning September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period: 

September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Increase of 100 basis points 5.3 % 14.1 % Decrease of 100 basis points (4.6) % (4.5) % 

The Company&#8217;s simulated increase of 100 basis points in market interest rates had a lower impact on net interest revenue as of September 30, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021 primarily due to increased sensitivity to the Company&#8217;s higher projected client deposit rates and decreased sensitivity to the Company&#8217;s mortgage-backed investment securities. A simulated decrease of 100 basis points in market interest rates had a slightly larger impact on net interest revenue as of September 30, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021 primarily due to increased sensitivity from a higher allocation to cash and short-term investments. This increased sensitivity was partially offset by higher starting client deposit rates which, relative to the December 31, 2021 simulation, provide greater responsiveness to lower simulated interest rates. 

Higher short-term interest rates would positively impact net interest revenue as yields on interest-earning assets are expected to rise faster than the cost of funding sources. A decline in interest rates could negatively impact the yield on the Company&#8217;s investment and loan portfolio to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense from funding sources, compressing net interest margin. 

In addition to measuring the effect of a gradual 100 basis point parallel increase or decrease in current interest rates, we regularly simulate the effects of larger parallel- and non-parallel shifts in interest rates on net interest revenue.

Bank Deposit Account Fees Simulation 

Consistent with the presentation on the consolidated statement of income, the sensitivity of bank deposit account fee revenue to interest rate changes is assessed separately from the net interest revenue simulation described above. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, simulated changes in bank deposit account fee revenue from gradual 100 basis point changes in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates did not have a significant impact on the Company&#8217;s total net revenues. 

Economic Value of Equity Simulation 

Management also uses economic value of equity (EVE) simulations to measure interest rate risk. EVE sensitivity measures the long-term impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities. EVE is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to hypothetical instantaneous shifts in the level of interest rates. This analysis is highly dependent upon asset and liability assumptions based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations of the economic environment. Key assumptions in our EVE calculation include projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors, prepayment speeds of mortgage-related investments, term structure models of interest rates, non-maturity deposit behavior, and pricing assumptions. Our net interest revenue, bank deposit account fee revenue, and EVE simulations reflect the assumption of non-negative investment yields. 

Phase-out of LIBOR 

The Company has made significant progress to prepare for the phasing-out of LIBOR, as described in Part II &#8211; Item 7 &#8211; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Risk Management in the 2021 Form 10-K, and additional transition efforts to prepare for the phasing-out of LIBOR are ongoing. 

On March 15, 2022, President Biden signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022 into law, which includes the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act, containing legislation related to the transition away from LIBOR. This legislation is intended to establish a uniform process for replacing LIBOR in existing contracts and securities that continue after the cessation of LIBOR and do not contain clearly defined or practicable fallback provisions. 

On July 19, 2022, the Federal Reserve Board released a proposal that provides default rules for certain contracts that use LIBOR, which would implement the LIBOR Act with replacement rates based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). The Company believes the LIBOR Act and the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s proposed regulation help provide clarity for the transition of our legacy LIBOR contracts, including investment securities, loans, and preferred stock, to alternative reference rates in an orderly manner. 

Liquidity Risk 

Liquidity risk is the potential that Schwab will be unable to sell assets or meet cash flow obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable losses. We have established liquidity policies to support the successful execution of business strategies, while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity to meet operational needs and satisfy applicable regulatory requirements under both normal and stressed conditions. We employ a variety of methodologies to monitor and manage liquidity, which are described below and in greater detail in Part II &#8211; Item 7 &#8211; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Risk Management &#8211; Liquidity Risk in our 2021 10-K. 

Funding Sources 

Schwab&#8217;s primary source of funds is cash generated by client activity which includes bank deposits and cash balances in client brokerage accounts. These funds are used to purchase investment securities and extend loans to clients. 

Other sources of funds may include cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities, repayments on loans, securities lending of assets held in client brokerage accounts, repurchase agreements, and cash provided by external financing. 

To meet daily funding needs, we maintain liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and short-term investments. For unanticipated liquidity needs, we also maintain a buffer of highly liquid investments, including U.S. Treasury securities.

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) 

In addition to internal sources of liquidity, Schwab has access to external funding. The following table describes external debt facilities available at September 30, 2022: 

Description Borrower Outstanding Available 

Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) secured credit facilities (1) 

Banking subsidiaries $ &#8212; $ 82,561 Federal Reserve discount window Banking subsidiaries &#8212; 8,823 Uncommitted, unsecured lines of credit with various external banks CSC, CS&#38;Co &#8212; 1,532 Unsecured commercial paper CSC 500 4,500 

Secured uncommitted lines of credit with various external banks (2) 

TDAC &#8212; &#8212; 

(1) CSC&#8217;s banking subsidiaries must each maintain positive tangible capital, as defined by the FHLB, in order to draw upon these credit facilities. Tangible capital pursuant to the FHLB&#8217;s requirements for our banking subsidiaries is common equity less goodwill and intangible assets. 

(2) Secured borrowing capacity is made available based on TDAC&#8217;s ability to provide acceptable collateral to the lenders as determined by the credit agreements. 

Our banking subsidiaries may also engage with external banks in repurchase agreements collateralized by investment securities as another source of short-term liquidity. CSC&#8217;s ratings for Commercial Paper Notes are P1 by Moody&#8217;s Investor Service (Moody&#8217;s), A1 by Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Rating Group (Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s), and F1 by Fitch Ratings, Ltd (Fitch) at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. CSC also has a universal automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, which enables it to issue debt, equity, and other securities. 

As a result of rapidly increasing short-term interest rates in the second and third quarters of 2022, the Company saw an increase in the pace at which clients moved certain cash balances out of our sweep features and into higher yielding alternatives. As these outflows have continued, they have outpaced excess cash on hand and cash generated by maturities and paydowns on our investment and loan portfolios. In October 2022, our banking subsidiaries began to draw upon the FHLB secured credit facilities to provide temporary supplemental funding. As of October 31, 2022, $9.0 billion was outstanding under these facilities, including both fixed- and floating-rate advances. The current average interest rate on these advances was 4.25%, with the earliest maturity occurring in June 2023. The Company expects to use temporary supplemental funding, including FHLB advances, until the Company&#8217;s primary sources of liquidity are again greater than any outflows associated with client cash allocation decisions. 

See Part II &#8211; Item 7 &#8211; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Risk Management &#8211; Liquidity Risk in the 2021 Form 10-K for additional information on these and other borrowing facilities. 

To support growth in margin loan balances at our broker-dealer subsidiaries while meeting our LCR requirements, the Company may issue commercial paper or draw on secured lines of credit, in addition to capital markets issuances. 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio 

Schwab is subject to the full LCR rule, which requires the Company to hold high quality liquid assets (HQLA) in an amount equal to at least 100% of the Company&#8217;s projected net cash outflows over a prospective 30-calendar-day period of acute liquidity stress, calculated on each business day. See Part I &#8211; Item 1 &#8211; Business &#8211; Regulation in the 2021 Form 10-K for additional information. The Company was in compliance with the LCR rule at September 30, 2022, and the table below presents information about our average daily LCR: 

Average for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 Total eligible HQLA $ 110,712 Net cash outflows $ 93,748 LCR 118 % 

Borrowings 

The Company had short-term borrowings outstanding of $500 million and $4.9 billion as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Long-term debt is primarily comprised of Senior Notes and totaled $20.8 billion and $18.9 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

Schwab additionally enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements in the ordinary course of business. For information on these arrangements, see Item 1 &#8211; Notes 5, 6, 8, 9, and 11. 

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 

Schwab seeks to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support execution of our business strategy, including anticipated balance sheet growth inclusive of migration of IDA balances (see further discussion below), providing financial support to our subsidiaries, and sustained access to the capital markets, while at the same time meeting our regulatory capital requirements and serving as a source of financial strength to our banking subsidiaries. Schwab&#8217;s primary sources of capital are funds generated by the operations of subsidiaries and securities issuances by CSC in the capital markets. To ensure that Schwab has sufficient capital to absorb unanticipated losses or declines in asset values, we have adopted a policy to remain well capitalized even in stressed scenarios.

(1) Changes in market interest rates can result in unrealized gains or losses on AFS securities, which are included in AOCI. As a Category III banking organization, CSC has elected to exclude AOCI from regulatory capital. 

In the third quarter of 2022, the Company lowered its operating objective for the consolidated Tier 1 Leverage Ratio down 25 basis points from 6.75% - 7.00% to 6.50% - 6.75%. Capital operating objectives and limits for our subsidiaries remain unchanged. 

The Company&#8217;s consolidated Tier 1 Leverage Ratio increased to 6.8% at September 30, 2022 from 6.2% at year-end 2021. This increase resulted from strength in earnings in the first nine months of 2022, our March 2022 issuance of preferred stock net of the announced redemption of Series A, and a decrease of $63.7 billion, or 11%, in total bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients due to seasonal tax outflows and client cash allocation decisions resulting from the rising interest rate environment. CSB&#8217;s Tier 1 Leverage Ratio also increased from year-end 2021, ending the third quarter of 2022 at 7.6%. 

IDA Agreement 

Certain brokerage client deposits are swept off-balance sheet to the TD Depository Institutions pursuant to the IDA agreement. During the first nine months of 2022, Schwab moved $14.6 billion of IDA balances to its balance sheet. The Company&#8217;s overall capital management strategy includes supporting migration of IDA balances in future periods as available pursuant to the terms of the IDA agreement. The Company&#8217;s ability to migrate these balances to its balance sheet is dependent upon multiple factors including having sufficient capital levels to sustain these incremental deposits and the availability of IDA balances designated as floating-rate obligations. See Item 1 &#8211; Note 9 for further information on the IDA agreement.

Share Repurchases 

On July 27, 2022, CSC publicly announced that its Board of Directors terminated the existing share repurchase authorization of up to $4.0 billion of common stock and replaced it with a new authorization to repurchase up to $15.0 billion of common stock. The new share repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date. On August 1, 2022, CSC purchased, directly from an affiliate of TD Bank, 15 million shares of nonvoting common stock for a total of $1.0 billion, or approximately $66.53 per share. The shares of nonvoting common stock automatically converted into common stock and were purchased under CSC&#8217;s new share repurchase authorization. The purchase price paid by CSC was equal to the lowest price per share that the affiliate of TD Bank received in a contemporaneous share sale facilitated by a third-party market maker, which resulted in a purchase price lower than the closing price on August 1, 2022. CSC repurchased an additional $500 million of common stock under the new authorization during the three months ended September 30, 2022. There were no repurchases of CSC&#8217;s common stock under the terminated authorization during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. As of September 30, 2022, $13.5 billion remained on the new authorization.

Sweden at $754 million. In addition, Schwab had outstanding margin loans to foreign residents of $3.2 billion and $3.3 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

Certain of our accounting policies that involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity are discussed in Part II &#8211; Item 7 &#8211; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Critical Accounting Estimates in the 2021 Form 10-K. There have been no changes to critical accounting estimates during the first nine months of 2022. 

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 

In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP), Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain references to the non-GAAP financial measures described below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information about the financial performance of the Company, and facilitate meaningful comparison of Schwab&#8217;s results in the current period to both historic and future results. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies. 

Schwab&#8217;s use of non-GAAP measures is reflective of certain adjustments made to GAAP financial measures as described below. 

Non-GAAP Adjustment or Measure Definition Usefulness to Investors and Uses by Management Acquisition and integration-related costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets Schwab adjusts certain GAAP financial measures to exclude the impact of acquisition and integration-related costs incurred as a result of the Company&#8217;s acquisitions, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and, where applicable, the income tax effect of these expenses. Adjustments made to exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets are reflective of all acquired intangible assets, which were recorded as part of purchase accounting. These acquired intangible assets contribute to the Company&#8217;s revenue generation. Amortization of acquired intangible assets will continue in future periods over their remaining useful lives. We exclude acquisition and integration-related costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets for the purpose of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because we believe doing so provides additional transparency of Schwab&#8217;s ongoing operations, and is useful in both evaluating the operating performance of the business and facilitating comparison of results with prior and future periods. Acquisition and integration-related costs fluctuate based on the timing of acquisitions and integration activities, thereby limiting comparability of results among periods, and are not representative of the costs of running the Company&#8217;s ongoing business. Amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded because management does not believe it is indicative of the Company&#8217;s underlying operating performance. Return on tangible common equity Return on tangible common equity represents annualized adjusted net income available to common stockholders as a percentage of average tangible common equity. Tangible common equity represents common equity less goodwill, acquired intangible assets &#8212; net, and related deferred tax liabilities. Acquisitions typically result in the recognition of significant amounts of goodwill and acquired intangible assets. We believe return on tangible common equity may be useful to investors as a supplemental measure to facilitate assessing capital efficiency and returns relative to the composition of Schwab&#8217;s balance sheet. 

The Company also uses adjusted diluted EPS and return on tangible common equity as components of performance criteria for employee bonus and certain executive management incentive compensation arrangements. The Compensation Committee of CSC&#8217;s Board of Directors maintains discretion in evaluating performance against these criteria.
