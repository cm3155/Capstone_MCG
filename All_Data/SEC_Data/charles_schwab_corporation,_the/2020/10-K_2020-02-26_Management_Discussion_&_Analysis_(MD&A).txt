OVERVIEW 

Management focuses on several client activity and financial metrics in evaluating Schwab&#8217;s financial position and operating performance. We believe that metrics relating to net new and total client assets, as well as client cash levels and utilization of advisory services, offer perspective on our business momentum and client engagement. Data on new and total client brokerage accounts provides additional perspective on our ability to attract and retain new business. Total net revenue growth, pre-tax profit margin, EPS, return on average common stockholders&#8217; equity, and the Consolidated Tier 1 Leverage Ratio provide broad indicators of Schwab&#8217;s overall financial health, operating efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns. Total expenses, excluding interest, as a percentage of average client assets, is a measure of operating efficiency. Results for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 are as follows:

(1) 2019 and 2017 include inflows of $11.1 billion and $34.5 billion, respectively, from certain mutual fund clearing services clients. 2018 includes outflows of $93.9 billion from certain mutual fund clearing services clients. 

2019 Compared to 2018 

Schwab delivered solid financial results in 2019 while taking significant steps to further enhance our offer to clients and help position the Company to build value for our stakeholders over the long-term. Throughout the year, investor sentiment reflected a complex market environment that included global trade negotiations and an uncertain domestic economic outlook. The Federal Reserve ended up cutting the federal funds target interest rate three times, in a reversal of the increases seen in 2018. At the same time, stocks continued to rise, with the S&#38;P 500 increasing 29% during the year. Core net new assets totaled $211.7 billion for the year, representing an organic growth rate of 7% and our second consecutive year over $200 billion. Clients opened 1.6 million new brokerage accounts in 2019, while active brokerage accounts grew 6% to 12.3 million. Our success in asset gathering combined with strong market returns drove total client assets to reach $4.04 trillion at December 31, 2019, closing the year up 24%.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) 

Company actions to benefit clients and build long-term value during 2019 included the elimination of online trading commissions for U.S. and Canadian-listed stocks and ETFs, as well as the base charge on options, which became effective October 7th. The Company also announced two significant acquisitions during the year. In July, the Company agreed to acquire assets of USAA-IMCO and agreed to enter into a long-term referral agreement. In late November, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire TD Ameritrade. 

Against the backdrop of the more challenging than expected macroeconomic environment and our own pricing decisions, Schwab&#8217;s net income totaled $3.7 billion in 2019, an increase of $197 million, or 6%. Diluted earnings per common share grew to $2.67, representing an increase of 9% from 2018. 

Total net revenues reached $10.7 billion, up 6% in 2019. Net interest revenue increased 12% in 2019 to $6.5 billion, driven by higher average investment yields and also by an increase in client cash balances held at our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries. While trading revenue declined 19% to $617 million due to our pricing actions, asset management and administration fees remained essentially flat with 2018 at $3.2 billion, decreasing 1%. Growing enrollment in advice solutions, along with rising balances in other third-party mutual funds, helped to largely offset declines in Mutual Fund OneSource &#174; and lower sweep money market fund revenue due to transfers of sweep money market funds to our balance sheet in 2018 and early 2019. 

Total expenses excluding interest increased 5% in 2019 to $5.9 billion, which included $62 million in severance charges associated with a 3% reduction in our workforce and $25 million in costs relating to the announced acquisitions of assets of USAA-IMCO and TD Ameritrade. Our ongoing focus on driving efficiency while managing our spending in a disciplined manner helped us maintain a ratio of expenses to client assets of 16 bps for 2019. Reflecting our commitment to balancing long-term profitability with reinvesting for growth, we achieved a 45.2% pre-tax profit margin and a 19% return on equity in 2019, representing our second consecutive year of at least 45% and 19%, respectively. 

Disciplined balance sheet management remains core to our strategy as we continue to support business growth and meaningful capital returns across a range of conditions. In early 2019, the Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend 31% to $0.17 per share and authorized the repurchase of up to $4.0 billion of common stock; during 2019 we repurchased 55 million shares for $2.2 billion under this authorization. As of December 31, 2019, our balance sheet assets were $294 billion, down 1% from a year ago; our Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 7.3% at year-end. As the Company continues to grow both organically and through our pending acquisitions, our intent to return excess capital above our long-term operating objective of 6.75%-7.00% remains in place. 

Planned Acquisitions 

TD Ameritrade: On November 25, 2019, CSC announced a definitive agreement to acquire TD Ameritrade in an all-stock transaction. At the time of announcement, TD Ameritrade had approximately twelve million brokerage accounts and $1.3 trillion in total client assets. Under the agreement, TD Ameritrade stockholders will receive 1.0837 CSC shares for each TD Ameritrade share. Based on the closing price of CSC common stock on November 20, 2019, the merger consideration represented approximately $26 billion. The Company anticipates this transaction will add scale to help support the Company&#8217;s ongoing efforts to enhance the client experience, provide deeper resources for RIAs, and continue to improve our operating efficiency. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2020, subject to satisfaction of closing conditions. Under certain circumstances, CSC or TD Ameritrade could be required to pay the other party a termination fee of $950 million or reimburse the other party&#8217;s fees up to $50 million. 

Assets of USAA-IMCO: On July 25, 2019, the Company announced a definitive agreement to acquire assets of USAA-IMCO, including over one million brokerage and managed portfolio accounts with approximately $90 billion in client assets at the time of announcement, for $1.8 billion in cash. The companies have also agreed to enter into a long-term referral agreement, effective at closing of the acquisition, which would make Schwab the exclusive wealth management and brokerage provider for USAA members. The transaction is expected to close in mid-2020, subject to satisfaction of closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the implementation of conversion plans. 

The Company expects to recognize significant amounts of goodwill and amortizable intangible assets as part of the planned acquisitions.

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) 

2018 Compared to 2017 

Net income increased by $1.2 billion, or 49%, in 2018, driven primarily by business momentum, a supportive economic environment for much of the year, and lower corporate tax rates. Continued execution of our &#8216;Through Clients&#8217; Eyes&#8217; strategy helped us succeed with clients. In 2018, clients opened 1.6 million new brokerage accounts, helping bring active brokerage accounts to 11.6 million at the end of the year, and core net new assets totaled $227.8 billion, up 15% from the 2017 total. Our strong net new assets largely offset lower market valuations, and we ended 2018 at $3.25 trillion in total client assets. 

Total net revenue grew by $1.5 billion, or 18%, in 2018 primarily due to an increase of $1.5 billion, or 36%, in net interest revenue. The Fed raised the federal funds target interest rate four times in 2018 for a total of 100 basis points. The growth of total net revenue resulted from higher interest rates due to the Fed&#8217;s rate increases, and also from higher interest-earning assets, which reflect both client cash allocations and the transfer of sweep money market funds to bank and broker-dealer sweep. As we progressed with these transfers, the corresponding money market fund asset management and administration fee revenue naturally declined, yet positive inflows in advice solutions, Schwab equity and bond funds and ETFs, and other third-party mutual funds and ETFs kept asset management fees at $3.2 billion, limiting the decrease to 5% from 2017. Record trading activity from our clients resulted in trading revenue reaching $763 million, an increase of 17% from the prior year. 

Our increase in total expenses excluding interest of $602 million, or 12%, reflected our 2018 investments to support and fuel our business growth, including hiring additional client-facing and other employees and technology project spending, as well as an increase in marketing and a special stock award of $36 million to our employees. Even with these increases, expenses as a percentage of client assets remained consistent at 16 basis points, and pre-tax income increased 25% to $4.6 billion in 2018, resulting in a pre-tax profit margin of 45.0%. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act), taxes on income decreased 19% in 2018, resulting in an effective tax rate of 23.1%. Overall, we generated a 19% return on equity and diluted EPS of $2.45 for the year. 

During 2018, the Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend 63% to $0.13 per share and authorized a $1.0 billion Share Repurchase Program, which we completed during the fourth quarter of 2018. These actions reflected the Company&#8217;s strong financial performance and our confidence in its long-term success; they also demonstrated that effective capital management at Schwab can support both healthy business growth and more meaningful capital returns to stockholders. 

Subsequent Events 

In October 2019, the Federal Reserve issued a final enhanced prudential standards rule, and the Federal Reserve, OCC, and the FDIC jointly issued a final regulatory capital and liquidity rule. With total consolidated assets of $294.0 billion at December 31, 2019, CSC is designated as a Category III firm pursuant to the framework established by the final rules. Accordingly, the Company opted to exclude AOCI from its regulatory capital as permitted by the regulatory capital and liquidity rule beginning January 1, 2020. In accordance with ASC 320, Investments &#8211; Debt and Equity Securities (ASC 320) and as of January 1, 2020, the Company transferred all of its investment securities designated as held to maturity (HTM) to the AFS category without tainting our intent to hold other debt securities to maturity. At the date of transfer, these securities had a total amortized cost of $134.7 billion and a total net unrealized gain of $1.4 billion. 

CURRENT REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS 

In December 2019, the FDIC issued a proposed rule that would modernize its brokered deposits regulations. Among other things, the proposed rule would clarify the &#8220;primary purpose&#8221; exception from the definition of a deposit broker for securities broker-dealers such as CS&#38;Co that place deposits through brokerage sweep arrangements under certain conditions. In addition, the proposed rule would create a streamlined application process for obtaining a primary purpose exception where less than 25 percent of a broker-dealer&#8217;s customer assets are placed with a depository institution. Schwab is currently evaluating the impact of the proposed rule on its bank sweep program. 

In January 2020, the OCC and the FDIC published their jointly proposed revisions to the regulations implementing the CRA. The proposed regulations (i) clarify and expand what qualifies for CRA credit; (ii) expand where CRA activity counts; (iii) provide an objective method to measure CRA activity; and (iv) revise data collection, recordkeeping, and reporting.

Federal Reserve did not join the OCC and the FDIC in the proposed regulations. The comment period for the proposed regulations ends on March 9, 2020. Schwab is currently evaluating the impact of the proposed regulations. 

In May 2016, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC jointly issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would impose a minimum NSFR on certain banking organizations, including CSC. The comment period for the proposed rule ended on August 5, 2016 and the impact to the Company cannot be assessed until the final rule is released. The agencies indicated in the October 2019 interagency regulatory capital and liquidity rule their intention to utilize the four category tiering framework when the NSFR rule is adopted. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Total Net Revenues 

Total net revenues of $10.7 billion and $10.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, represented growth of 6% and 18% from the prior periods, primarily due to increases in net interest revenue.

(1) Beginning in 2019, a change was made to move CTFs from other asset management and administration fees. Prior periods have been recast to reflect this change. 

Net Interest Revenue 

Schwab&#8217;s primary interest-earning assets include cash and cash equivalents; cash and investments segregated; margin loans, which constitute the majority of receivables from brokerage clients; investment securities; and bank loans. Revenue on interest-earning assets is affected by various factors, such as the composition of assets, prevailing interest rates and spreads at the time of origination or purchase, changes in interest rates on floating rate securities and loans, and changes in prepayment levels for mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities and loans. Fees earned on securities borrowing and lending activities, which are conducted by CS&#38;Co using assets held in client brokerage accounts, are primarily included in other interest revenue and expense. 

Schwab&#8217;s interest-bearing liabilities include bank deposits, payables to brokerage clients, short-term borrowings (e.g., Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances), and long-term debt. Non-interest-bearing funding sources include stockholders&#8217; equity, certain client cash balances, and other miscellaneous liabilities. 

We establish the rates paid on client-related liabilities, and management expects that it will generally adjust the rates paid on these liabilities at some fraction of any movement in short-term rates. Schwab deploys the funds from these sources into the 

- 33 -

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

assets outlined above. We do not use short-term, wholesale borrowings to support our long-term investment activity, but may use such funding, including FHLB advances, for short-term liquidity purposes or to provide temporary funding (e.g., for investment purchases) ahead of anticipated balance sheet deposit growth. 

In order to keep interest-rate sensitivity within established limits, management actively monitors and adjusts interest-rate sensitivity through changes in the balance sheet, primarily by adjusting the composition of our banking subsidiaries&#8217; investment portfolios. As Schwab builds its client base, we attract new client sweep cash, which is a primary driver of funding balance sheet growth. 

Towards the end of 2018, the federal funds target interest rate increased to levels not seen in over a decade, leading us to expect some clients would shift more of their cash holdings from brokerage deposits swept to our banking subsidiaries to higher-yielding alternatives like purchased money market funds. We therefore expected brokerage deposits swept to our banking subsidiaries, excluding organic growth, to decline during the first part of 2019. As a result, we held a higher amount of short-term liquidity at our banking subsidiaries at the end of 2018 to accommodate this potential client cash sorting. 

While average interest rates throughout the year in 2019 were higher than average rates in 2018, interest rates across maturities declined from December 2018 to December 2019. Lower interest rates typically result in longer durations on our client-related liabilities and shorter durations on our investment securities, especially mortgage-related securities with options to prepay without penalty. During 2019, to maintain our overall targeted interest rate risk profile, we began positioning our banking entities&#8217; investment portfolios to include a higher percentage of fixed-rate, longer duration investments to reduce our interest rate sensitivities which would naturally increase as market rates declined. We did, however, once again hold a higher level of short-term liquidity at the end of 2019 to accommodate a typical seasonal buildup of client cash, much of which then generally moves to other assets within a few months. 

We believe that the process of clients sorting between transactional cash and cash held for investment is subsiding. Aligned with market consensus, we do not expect to see a significant increase in market rates in the near term. Over the course of 2020, we expect to further reduce our exposure to lower rates primarily by adding a larger percentage of fixed-rate securities with relatively longer duration to our ongoing purchases as a result of maturities, prepayments, organic deposit growth, on-boarding of USAA-IMCO client cash to our balance sheet, and any potential asset-liability-management-driven investment portfolio re-balancing. As such, we expect the duration difference between our liabilities and assets to decline over the course of 2020.

##TABLE_END

(1) Amounts have been calculated based on amortized cost. 

(2) Interest revenue or expense was less than $500,000 in the period or periods presented. 

Net interest revenue increased $693 million or 12% , in 2019 from 2018 , and $1.5 billion , or 36% , in 2018 from 2017 , due to higher average investment yields and growth in interest earning assets. 

Our net interest margin improved 12 basis points to 2.41% in 2019 , driven primarily by higher average yields received on interest-earning assets in 2019 due largely to the net impact of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s interest rate increases in 2018 and decreases in the third and fourth quarters of 2019. The increase in average yields on interest-earning assets was partially offset by higher average interest rates paid on bank deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. The portfolio adjustments made in 2019 as described above helped to moderate the impact of the declining rate environment on our net interest margin. 

Average interest-earning assets grew 6% from 2018 to 2019 , primarily driven by higher bank deposits due to transfers from sweep money market funds to bank sweep, as well as higher client cash balances. 

Our net interest margin improved 32 basis points to 2.29% in 2018, primarily as a result of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s 2017 and 2018 interest rate increases, partially offset by higher interest rates paid on bank deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. Average interest earning assets grew 16% from 2017 to 2018, primarily reflecting higher bank deposits due to transfers from sweep money market funds to bank sweep, as well as changes in client cash allocations, partially offset by client purchases of other assets. In March 2017, the Company transferred $24.7 billion of debt securities from the AFS category to the HTM category. The transfer had no effect on the overall net interest margin. Short-term borrowings in 2018 and 2017 primarily included FHLB advances, which were used to provide temporary funding for investments ahead of deposit growth.

Asset Management and Administration Fees 

Asset management and administration fees include mutual fund, ETF, and CTF service fees and fees for other asset-based financial services provided to individual and institutional clients. Schwab earns mutual fund, ETF, and CTF service fees for shareholder services, administration, and investment management provided to its proprietary funds, and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to third-party funds. Asset management and administration fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in these funds and do not include securities lending revenues earned by proprietary mutual funds, ETFs, and CTFs, as those amounts, net of program fees, are credited to the fund shareholders. Proprietary CTFs may, but generally do not, directly participate in securities lending. The fair values of client assets included in proprietary and third-party mutual funds, ETFs, and CTFs are based on quoted market prices and other observable market data. 

We also earn asset management fees for advice solutions, which include managed portfolios, specialized strategies, and customized investment advice. Other asset management and administration fees include various asset-based fees such as trust fees, 401(k) recordkeeping fees, mutual fund clearing fees, and non-balance based service and transaction fees. 

Asset management and administration fees vary with changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and client activity.

(1) Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, a change was made to move CTFs from other balance-based fees. Prior periods have been recast to reflect this change. 

(2) Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, Schwab ETF OneSource TM was discontinued as a result of the elimination of online trading commissions for U.S. and Canadian-listed ETFs. 

(3) Average client assets for advice solutions may also include the asset balances contained in the mutual fund and/or ETF categories listed above. 

(4) Includes various asset-related fees, such as trust fees, 401(k) recordkeeping fees, and mutual fund clearing fees and other service fees. 

(5) Includes miscellaneous service and transaction fees relating to mutual funds and ETFs that are not balance-based. 

Asset management and administration fees decreased by $18 million , or 1% , in 2019 from 2018 , primarily due to lower sweep money market fund revenue as a result of transfers to bank and broker-dealer sweep in 2018 and early 2019, as well as client asset allocation choices including continued reduced usage of Mutual Fund OneSource &#174; . Part of the decline was offset by revenue from growing asset balances in purchased money market funds, other third-party mutual funds and ETFs, and in advice solutions. 

Asset management and administration fees decreased by $163 million, or 5%, in 2018 from 2017, primarily due to lower money market fund revenue as a result of transfers to bank sweep, client asset allocation choices, and lower fee rates on

Trading Revenue 

Trading revenue includes commission and principal transaction revenues. Commission revenue is affected by the number of revenue trades executed and the average revenue earned per revenue trade. Principal transaction revenue is primarily comprised of revenue from trading activity in fixed income securities with clients. To accommodate clients&#8217; fixed income trading activity, Schwab maintains positions in fixed income securities, including U.S. state and municipal debt obligations, U.S. Government and corporate debt, and other securities. The difference between the price at which the Company buys and sells securities to and from its clients and other broker-dealers is recognized as principal transaction revenue. Principal transaction revenue also includes adjustments to the fair value of these securities positions. 

The following table presents trading revenue and the related drivers:

##TABLE_END

Trading revenue decreased by $146 million , or 19% , in 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a 20% decrease in DART volumes in 2019 as a result of the elimination of online trading commissions for U.S. and Canadian-listed stocks and ETFs, as well as the base charge on options effective October 7, 2019. 

Trading revenue increased by $109 million, or 17%, in 2018 compared to 2017. This increase was due primarily to a 31% increase in DART volumes in 2018, which more than offset Schwab&#8217;s 2017 commission pricing reductions to lower standard equity, ETF, and option trade commissions from $8.95 to $4.95 and lower the per contract option fee from $.75 to $.65. 

Other Revenue 

Other revenue includes order flow revenue, other service fees, software fees from our portfolio management solutions, exchange processing fees, and non-recurring gains. Other revenue increased $ 60 million , or 19% , in 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to a gain from the sale of a portfolio management and reporting software solution for advisors to Tamarac Inc. in the second quarter of 2019 and a gain from the assignment of leased office space in the first quarter of 2019. Order flow revenue was $135 million during 2019 , $139 million for 2018 , and $114 million in 2017 . The increase in 2018 from 2017 was primarily due to higher rebate rates received on certain types of orders and higher volume of trades.

##TABLE_END

&#3839; 

Expenses excluding interest increased in 2019 and 2018 from the prior years by 5% and 12%, respectively. The largest driver of the increase in both years was compensation and benefits costs. 

Total compensation and benefits increased in 2019 from 2018 , primarily due to both an overall increase in employee headcount to support our expanding client base and higher severance costs, which included $62 million associated with a 3% reduction in our workforce in the third quarter of 2019. The increase in 2018 from 2017 was primarily due to increases in employee headcount; additionally, special stock awards were issued in 2018 to non-officer employees, totaling $36 million. 

Professional services expense increased in 2019 from 2018 , primarily due to overall growth in the business, investments in projects to further drive efficiency and scale, and certain costs relating to pending acquisitions. The increase in 2018 from 2017 was primarily due to higher spending on technology projects as well as an increase in asset management and administration related expenses resulting from growth in the Schwab Funds &#174; and Schwab ETFs&#8482;. 

Occupancy and equipment expense increased in 2019 and 2018 from the prior years, primarily due to increases in software maintenance expenses and additional licenses to support growth in the business. 

Advertising and market development expense increased in 2018 from 2017, primarily reflecting management&#8217;s decision to increase television advertising and digital media spending in the fourth quarter of 2018. 

Depreciation and amortization expenses grew in 2019 and 2018 from the prior years, primarily due to higher amortization of internally developed software associated with continued investments in software and technology enhancements. 

Regulatory fees and assessments decreased in 2019 from 2018 , primarily due to a decrease in FDIC insurance assessments resulting from the elimination of the FDIC surcharge in the fourth quarter of 2018. Regulatory fees and assessments 

- 38 - 

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) 

increased in 2018 from 2017, due to an increase in FDIC insurance assessments which rose as a result of higher average assets in deposit balances, partially offset by the elimination of the FDIC surcharge. 

Other expenses decreased in 2019 from 2018 , primarily due to lower travel and entertainment expense and bad debt expense. Other expenses increased in 2018 from 2017 due to travel and entertainment and miscellaneous items due to overall growth in the business. 

Capital expenditures were $753 million , $576 million , and $412 million in 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , respectively. The increases in capital expenditures in 2019 and 2018 from the prior years were primarily due to the expansion of our campuses in the U.S., with investments in buildings totaling $397 million and $253 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Capitalized costs for developing internal-use software totaled $165 million, $167 million, and $157 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. 

Our capital expenditures for 2019 equaled 7% of total net revenues, within our estimated range for the year. Along with continued campus expansion, we will continue to invest further in technology projects in 2020. Excluding any potential impact of the pending acquisition of TD Ameritrade, we anticipate capital expenditures in 2020 to be approximately 5-6% of total net revenues, while our longer term expectation for capital expenditures remains in the range of 3-5% of total net revenues. 

Taxes on Income 

On December 22, 2017, P.L.115-97, the Tax Act, was signed into law, and became effective on January 1, 2018. Among other things, the Tax Act lowered the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018. As a result of the Tax Act, Schwab recognized a $46 million one-time non-cash charge to taxes on income in the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets and other tax adjustments related to the Tax Act. 

Schwab&#8217;s effective income tax rate on income before taxes was 23.6% in 2019 , 23.1% in 2018 , and 35.5% in 2017 . The change in rates in 2019 from 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in equity compensation tax deduction benefits which reduced our tax expense by approximately $23 million and $46 million in 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The change in rates in 2018 from 2017 was primarily due to impacts of the Tax Act and a decrease in equity compensation tax deduction benefits, which totaled $87 million in 2017. 

Segment Information 

Schwab provides financial services to individuals and institutional clients through two segments &#8211; Investor Services and Advisor Services. The Investor Services segment provides retail brokerage and banking services to individual investors, and retirement plan services, as well as other corporate brokerage services to businesses and their employees. The Advisor Services segment provides custodial, trading, banking, and support services, as well as retirement business services, to independent RIAs, independent retirement advisors, and recordkeepers. Revenues and expenses are attributed to the two segments based on which segment services the client. Management evaluates the performance of the segments on a pre-tax basis. Segment assets and liabilities are not used for evaluating segment performance or in deciding how to allocate resources to segments. Net revenues in both segments are generated from the underlying client assets and trading activity; differences in the composition of net revenues between the segments are based on the composition of client assets, client trading frequency, and pricing unique to each. While both segments leverage the scale and efficiency of our platforms, segment expenses reflect the dynamics of serving millions of clients in Investor Services versus the thousands of RIAs on the advisor platform.

N/M Not meaningful. 

Investor Services 

Total net revenues increased by 4% in 2019 from 2018 primarily due to an increase in net interest revenue and higher asset management and administrations fees, partially offset by lower trading revenue. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher average investment yields and higher interest-earning assets. Asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to growing asset balances in advice solutions, partially offset by lower mutual fund and ETF service fee revenue as a result of client cash allocation choices, including reduced usage of Mutual Fund OneSource &#174; . Trading revenue decreased as a result of the elimination of online trading commissions for U.S. and Canadian-listed stocks and ETFs, as well as the base charge on options in the fourth quarter of 2019. 

Expenses excluding interest increased by 3% in 2019 compared to 2018 , primarily as a result of higher compensation and benefits due to increased headcount in 2019 and severance charges in the third quarter of 2019, higher occupancy and equipment expenses due to an increase in software maintenance expenses and additional licenses to support growth in the business, and higher amortization of internally developed software associated with continued investments in software and technology enhancements. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in FDIC insurance assessments due to the elimination of the FDIC surcharge in the fourth quarter of 2018 and lower travel and entertainment expenses. 

Total net revenues increased by $1.1 billion, or 18%, in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to an increase in net interest revenue, partially offset by lower asset management and administration fees. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher net interest margins and higher balances of interest-earning assets. Asset management and administration fees decreased primarily due to lower money market fund revenue as a result of transfers to bank sweep, client asset allocation choices, and our 2017 fee reductions. Expenses excluding interest increased by $420 million, or 11%, in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to higher compensation and benefits, technology project spend, and asset management and administration related expenses to support the Company&#8217;s expanding client base. 

Advisor Services 

Total net revenues increased by 10% , in 2019 from 2018 primarily due to an increase in net interest revenue and other revenue, partially offset by lower asset management and administration fees and lower trading revenue. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher average investment yields and higher interest-earning assets. Other revenue increased primarily due to a gain from the sale of a portfolio management and reporting software solution for advisors to Tamarac Inc. in the second quarter of 2019. Asset management and administration fees decreased primarily due to lower sweep money market fund revenue as a result of transfers to bank and broker-dealer sweep, as well as client asset allocation choices, including reduced usage of Mutual Fund OneSource &#174; , partially offset b y increased revenue from growing asset balances in purchased money market funds and in other third-party mutual funds and ETFs.

elimination of online trading commissions for U.S. and Canadian-listed stocks and ETFs, as well as the base charge on options in the fourth quarter of 2019. 

Expenses excluding interest increased by 12% of 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to higher compensation and benefits due to increased headcount in 2019 and severance charges in the third quarter of 2019, higher professional services expense due to overall growth in the business and investments in projects to further drive efficiency and scale, and higher occupancy and equipment expense due to an increase in software maintenance expenses and additional licenses to support growth in the business. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in FDIC insurance assessments due to the elimination of the FDIC surcharge in the fourth quarter of 2018, lower bad debt expenses, and lower travel and entertainment expenses. 

Total net revenues increased by $393 million or 16%, in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to an increase in net interest revenue, partially offset by lower asset management and administration fees. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher net interest margins and higher balances of interest-earning assets. Asset management and administration fees decreased primarily due to lower money market fund revenue as a result of transfers to bank sweep, client asset allocation choices, and our 2017 fee reductions. Expenses excluding interest increased by $182 million, or 15%, in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to higher compensation and benefits, technology project spend, and asset management and administration related expenses to support the Company&#8217;s expanding client base. 

RISK MANAGEMENT 

Schwab&#8217;s business activities expose it to a variety of risks, including operational, credit, market, liquidity, and compliance risks. The Company has a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact. Despite our efforts to identify areas of risk and implement risk management policies and procedures, there can be no assurance that Schwab will not suffer unexpected losses due to these risks. 

Our risk management process is comprised of risk identification and assessment, risk measurement, risk monitoring and reporting, and risk mitigation controls; we use periodic risk and control self-assessments, control testing programs, and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. The activities and governance that comprise the risk management process are described below. 

Culture 

The Board of Directors has approved an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework that incorporates our purpose, vision, and values, which form the bedrock of our corporate culture and set the tone for the organization. 

We designed the ERM Framework to enable a comprehensive approach to managing risks encountered by Schwab in its business activities. The framework incorporates key concepts commensurate with the size, risk profile, complexity, and continuing growth of the Company. Risk appetite, which is defined as the amount of risk the Company is willing to accept in pursuit of its corporate strategy, is developed by executive management and approved by the Board of Directors. 

Risk Governance 

Senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for identifying, measuring, and controlling risks. 

The Global Risk Committee, which is comprised of senior executives from each major business and control function, is responsible for the oversight of risk management. This includes identifying emerging risks, assessing risk management practices and the control environment, reinforcing business accountability for risk management, supervisory controls and regulatory compliance, supporting resource prioritization across the organization, and escalating significant issues to the Board of Directors. 

We have established risk metrics and reporting that enable measurement of the impact of strategy execution against risk appetite. The risk metrics, with risk limits and tolerance levels, are established for key risk categories by the Global Risk Committee and its functional risk sub-committees. 

- 41 - 

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) 

The Chief Risk Officer regularly reports activities of the Global Risk Committee to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. The Board Risk Committee in turn assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to our risk management program, including approving risk appetite statements and related key risk appetite metrics and reviewing reports relating to risk issues from functional areas of corporate risk management, legal, compliance, and internal audit. 

Functional risk sub-committees focusing on specific areas of risk report to the Global Risk Committee. These sub-committees include the: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Operational Risk Oversight Committee &#8211; provides oversight of and approves operational risk management policies, risk tolerance levels, and operational risk governance processes, and includes sub-committees covering Information Security, Fraud, Third-Party Risk, Data, and Model Governance; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226;

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Financial Risk Oversight Committee &#8211; provides oversight of and approves credit, market, liquidity, and capital risk policies, limits, and exposures; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

New Products and Services Risk Oversight Committee &#8211; provides oversight of, and approves corporate policy and procedures relating to, the risk governance of new products and services. 

##TABLE_END 

Senior management has also created an Incentive Compensation Risk Oversight Committee, which establishes policy and reviews and approves the Annual Risk Assessment of incentive compensation plans, and reports directly to the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. 

The Company&#8217;s compliance, finance, internal audit, legal, and corporate risk management departments assist management and the various risk committees in evaluating, testing, and monitoring risk management. 

In addition, the Disclosure Committee is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal quarter. The Disclosure Committee reports on this evaluation to the CEO and CFO prior to their certification required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. 

Operational Risk 

Operational risk arises due to potential inadequacies or failures related to people, internal processes, and systems, or from external events or relationships impacting the Company and/or any of its key business partners and third parties. While operational risk is inherent in all business activities, we rely on a system of internal controls and risk management practices designed to keep operational risk and operational losses within the Company&#8217;s risk appetite. We have specific policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk, and use control testing programs, and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. Where appropriate, we manage the impact of operational loss and litigation expense through the purchase of insurance. The insurance program is specifically designed to address our key operational risks and to maintain compliance with local laws and regulation. 

Schwab&#8217;s operations are highly dependent on the integrity and resilience of our critical business functions and technology systems. To the extent Schwab experiences business or system interruptions, errors or downtime (which could result from a variety of causes, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, technological failure, cyber attacks, changes to systems, linkages with third-party systems, and power failures), our business and operations could be negatively impacted. To minimize business interruptions and ensure the capacity to continue operations during an incident regardless of duration, Schwab maintains a backup and recovery infrastructure which includes facilities for backup and communications, a geographically dispersed workforce, and routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans and a well-established incident management program. 

Information Security risk is the risk of unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, recording or destruction of the firm&#8217;s information or systems. We have designed and implemented an information security program that knits together complementary tools, controls and technologies to protect systems, client accounts and data. We continuously 

- 42 - 

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) 

monitor the systems and work collaboratively with government agencies, law enforcement and other financial institutions to address potential threats. We use advanced monitoring systems to identify suspicious activity and deter unauthorized access by internal or external actors. We limit the number of employees who have access to clients&#8217; personal information and internal authentication measures are enforced to protect against the potential for social engineering. All employees who handle sensitive information are trained in privacy and security. Schwab&#8217;s conduct and cybersecurity teams monitor activity looking for suspicious behavior. These capabilities allow us to identify and quickly act on any attempted intrusions. 

Fraud risk arises from attempted or actual theft of financial assets or other property of any client or the Company. Schwab is committed to protecting the Company&#8217;s and its clients&#8217; assets from fraud, and complying with all applicable laws and regulations to prevent, detect and report fraudulent activity. Schwab manages fraud risk through policies, procedures and controls. We also take affirmative steps to prevent and detect fraud and report, to appropriate authorities, any known or suspected acts of fraud in accordance with existing laws and requirements. 

Schwab also faces operational risk when we employ the services of various third parties, including domestic and international outsourcing of certain technology, processing, servicing, and support functions. We manage the exposure to third party risk and promote a culture of resiliency through contractual provisions, control standards, ongoing monitoring of third party performance, and appropriate testing. We also maintain policies and procedures regarding the standard of care expected with all data, whether the data is internal company information, employee information, or non-public client information. We clearly define for employees, contractors, and third parties the expected standards of care for critical and confidential data. We also provide regular training on data security. 

Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. Models are owned by several business units throughout the organization, and are used for a variety of purposes. Model use includes, but is not limited to, calculating capital requirements for hypothetical stressful environments, estimating interest and credit risk for loans and other balance sheet assets, and providing guidance in the management of client portfolios. We have established a policy to describe the roles and responsibilities of all key stakeholders in model development, management, and use. All models are registered in a centralized database and classified into different risk ratings depending on their potential financial, reputational, or regulatory impact to the Company. The model risk rating determines the scope of model governance activities. 

Incentive Compensation risk is the potential for adverse consequences resulting from compensation plans that do not balance the execution of our strategy with risk and financial rewards, potentially encouraging imprudent risk-taking by employees. We have implemented risk management processes, including a policy, to identify, evaluate, assess, and manage risks associated with incentive compensation plans and the activities of certain employees, defined as Covered Employees, who have the authority to expose the Company to material amounts of risk. 

Compliance Risk 

Schwab faces compliance risk which is the potential exposure to legal or regulatory sanctions, fines or penalties, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from the failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, or other regulatory requirements. Among other things, compliance risks relate to the suitability of client investments, conflicts of interest, disclosure obligations and performance expectations for products and services, supervision of employees, and the adequacy of our controls. The Company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and foreign regulatory authorities, including SROs. 

We manage compliance risk through policies, procedures and controls reasonably designed to achieve and/or monitor compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. These procedures address issues such as conduct and ethics, sales and trading practices, marketing and communications, extension of credit, client funds and securities, books and records, anti-money laundering, client privacy, and employment policies. 

Conduct risk arises from inappropriate, unethical, or unlawful behavior of the Company, its employees or third parties acting on the Company&#8217;s behalf that may result in detriment to the Company&#8217;s clients, financial markets, the Company, and/or the Company&#8217;s employees. We manage this risk through a policy, procedures, a system of internal controls, including personnel monitoring and surveillance. Conduct-related matters are escalated through appropriate channels by the Corporate Responsibility Officer.

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) 

Fiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client. Fiduciary activities include, but are not limited to, individual and institutional trust, investment management, custody, and cash and securities processing. We manage this risk by establishing policy and procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the policy and procedures applicable to their business. Guidance and control are provided through the creation, approval, and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various risk committees. 

Credit Risk 

Credit risk is the potential for loss due to a borrower, counterparty, or issuer failing to perform its contractual obligations. Our exposure to credit risk mainly results from investing activities in our liquidity and investment portfolios, mortgage lending, margin lending and client option and futures activities, pledged asset lending, securities lending activities, and our role as a counterparty in other financial contracts. To manage the risks of such losses, we have established policies and procedures, which include setting and reviewing credit limits, monitoring of credit limits and quality of counterparties, and adjusting margin, PAL, option, and futures requirements for certain securities and instruments. 

Liquidity and Investment Portfolios 

Schwab has exposure to credit risk associated with its investment portfolios, which include U.S. agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, U.S. agency notes, U.S. Treasury securities, certificates of deposit, U.S. state and municipal securities, commercial paper, and foreign government agency securities. 

At December 31, 2019 , substantially all securities in the investment portfolios were rated investment grade. U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities do not have explicit credit ratings; however, management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. government or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. 

Mortgage Lending Portfolio 

The bank loan portfolio includes First Mortgages, HELOCs, and other loans. The credit risk exposure related to loans is actively managed through individual loan and portfolio reviews. Management regularly reviews asset quality, including concentrations, delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, charge-offs, and recoveries. All are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for loan losses. 

Our residential loan underwriting guidelines include maximum LTV ratios, cash out limits, and minimum Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores. The specific guidelines are dependent on the individual characteristics of a loan (for example, whether the property is a primary or secondary residence, whether the loan is for investment property, whether the loan is for an initial purchase of a home or refinance of an existing home, and whether the loan size is conforming or jumbo). 

Schwab does not originate or purchase residential loans that allow for negative amortization and does not originate or purchase subprime loans (generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a FICO score of less than 620 at origination), unless the borrower has compensating credit factors. For more information on credit quality indicators relating to Schwab&#8217;s bank loans, see Item 8 &#8211; Note 6 . 

Securities and Instrument-Based Lending Portfolios 

Collateral arrangements relating to margin loans, PALs, option and futures positions, securities lending agreements, and securities purchased under agreements to resell (resale agreements) include provisions that require additional collateral in the event of market fluctuations. Additionally, for margin loans, PALs, options and futures positions, and securities lending agreements, collateral arrangements require that the fair value of such collateral sufficiently exceeds the credit exposure in order to maintain a fully secured position. 

- 44 - 

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) 

Other Counterparty Exposures 

Schwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts. Schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual funds, and other financial institutions even if Schwab&#8217;s clients or a counterparty fail to meet their obligations to Schwab. 

Market Risk 

Market risk is the potential for changes in earnings or the value of financial instruments held by Schwab as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, or market conditions. Schwab is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in market interest rates on our interest-earning assets relative to changes in the costs of funding sources that finance these assets. 

To manage interest rate risk, we have established policies and procedures, which include setting limits on net interest revenue risk and economic value of equity risk. To remain within these limits, we manage the maturity, repricing, and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios. Management monitors established guidelines to stay within the Company&#8217;s risk appetite. 

Our measurement of interest rate risk involves assumptions that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, cannot precisely estimate the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue or economic value of equity. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes, as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies, including changes in asset and liability mix. Financial instruments are also subject to the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument. 

We are indirectly exposed to option, futures, and equity market fluctuations in connection with client option and futures accounts, securities collateralizing margin loans to brokerage customers, and client securities loaned out as part of the brokerage securities lending activities. Equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity, margin borrowing, and overall client engagement with Schwab. Additionally, we earn mutual fund and ETF service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets. Fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue we earn. 

Our market risk related to financial instruments held for trading is not material. 

Net Interest Revenue Simulation 

For our net interest revenue sensitivity analysis, we use net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates. The simulations include all interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities. Key assumptions include the projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors, prepayment speeds of mortgage-related investments, repricing of financial instruments, and reinvestment of matured or paid-down securities and loans. 

Net interest revenue is affected by various factors, such as the distribution and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the spread between yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which may reprice at different times or by different amounts, and the spread between short and long-term interest rates. Interest-earning assets primarily include investment securities, margin loans and bank loans. These assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment. Because we establish the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on certain margin and bank loans, and control the composition of our investment securities, we have some ability to manage our net interest spread, depending on competitive factors and market conditions.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) 

Net interest revenue sensitivity analysis assumes the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates. As we actively manage the consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure, in all likelihood we would take steps to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment. The following table shows the simulated net interest revenue change over the next 12 months beginning December 31, 2019 and 2018 of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period:

(4.9 

)% 

##TABLE_END

The year-over-year change in net interest revenue sensitivities reflects lower interest rates across the yield curve, producing higher adverse sensitivity to lower rates as funding costs more rapidly reach rate floor assumptions. 

In addition to measuring the effect of a gradual 100 basis point parallel increase or decrease in current interest rates, we regularly simulate the effects of larger parallel- and non-parallel shifts in interest rates on net interest revenue. 

Economic Value of Equity Simulation 

Management also uses economic value of equity (EVE) simulations to measure interest rate risk. EVE sensitivity measures the long-term impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities. EVE is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to hypothetical instantaneous shifts in the level of interest rates. This analysis is highly dependent upon asset and liability assumptions based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations of the economic environment. Key assumptions in our EVE calculation include projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors, prepayment speeds of mortgage-related investments, term structure models of interest rates, non-maturity deposit behavior, and pricing assumptions. 

Expected Phase-out of LIBOR 

The Company has established a firm-wide team to address the likely discontinuation of LIBOR. As part of our efforts, we have inventoried our LIBOR exposures, the largest of which are certain investment securities and loans. In purchasing new investment securities, we ensure that appropriate fall-back language is in the security&#8217;s prospectus in the event that LIBOR is unavailable or deemed unreliable. We are updating loan agreements to ensure new LIBOR-based loans adequately provide for an alternative to LIBOR. Furthermore, we plan to phase-out the use of LIBOR as a reference rate in our new lending products before December 2021. Consistent with our &#8220;Through Clients&#8217; Eyes&#8221; strategy, our focus throughout the LIBOR transition process is to ensure clients are treated fairly and consistently as this major change is occurring in the financial markets. The market transition process has not yet progressed to a point at which the impact to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements of LIBOR&#8217;s discontinuation can be estimated. 

Liquidity Risk 

Liquidity risk is the potential that Schwab will be unable to sell assets or meet cash flow obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable losses. 

Due to its role as a source of financial strength, CSC&#8217;s liquidity needs are primarily driven by the liquidity and capital needs of CS&#38;Co, the capital needs of the banking subsidiaries, principal and interest due on corporate debt, dividend payments on CSC&#8217;s preferred stock, and returns of capital to common stockholders. The liquidity needs of CS&#38;Co are primarily driven by client activity including trading and margin borrowing activities and capital expenditures. The capital needs of the banking subsidiaries are primarily driven by client deposits. We have established liquidity policies to support the successful execution of business strategies, while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity to meet operational needs and satisfy applicable regulatory requirements under both normal and stressed conditions. We seek to maintain client confidence in the balance sheet and the safety of client assets by maintaining liquidity and diversity of funding sources to allow the Company to meet its obligations. To this end, we have established limits and contingency funding scenarios to support liquidity levels during both business as usual and stressed conditions. 

- 46 - 

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) 

We employ a variety of methodologies to monitor and manage liquidity. We conduct regular liquidity stress testing to develop a consolidated view of liquidity risk exposures and to ensure our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity during market-related or company-specific liquidity stress events. Liquidity is also tested at key subsidiaries and results are reported to the Financial Risk Oversight Committee. A number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify emerging liquidity stresses in the market or within the organization and are reviewed with management as appropriate. 

Primary Funding Sources 

Schwab&#8217;s primary source of funds is cash generated by client activity which includes bank deposits and cash balances in client brokerage accounts. These funds are used to purchase investment securities and extend loans to clients. 

Other sources of funds may include cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities, repayments on loans, securities lending of assets held in client brokerage accounts, repurchase agreements, and cash provided by external financing. 

To meet daily funding needs, we maintain liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and short-term investments. For unanticipated liquidity needs, we also maintain a buffer of highly liquid investments, including U.S. Treasury securities. 

Additional Funding Sources 

In addition to internal sources of liquidity, Schwab has access to external funding. The need for short-term borrowings from external debt facilities arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements, scheduled liquidation of interest-earning investments, movements of cash to meet regulatory brokerage client cash segregation requirements and general corporate purposes. We maintain policies and procedures necessary to access funding and test discount window borrowing procedures on a periodic basis.

Our banking subsidiaries maintain secured credit facilities with the FHLB. Amounts available under these facilities are dependent on the value of our First Mortgages, HELOCs, and the fair value of certain of our investment securities that are pledged as collateral. These credit facilities are also available as backup financing in the event the outflow of client cash from the banking subsidiaries&#8217; respective balance sheets is greater than maturities and paydowns on investment securities and bank loans. 

Our banking subsidiaries also have access to short-term secured funding through the Federal Reserve discount window. Amounts available under the Federal Reserve discount window are dependent on the fair value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral. 

CSC has a commercial paper program of which proceeds are used for general corporate purposes. The maturities of the Commercial Paper Notes may vary, but are not to exceed 270 days from the date of issue. CSC&#8217;s ratings for these short-term borrowings were P1 by Moody&#8217;s, A1 by Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s, and F1 by Fitch at December 31, 2019 and 2018, and CSC had no Commercial Paper Notes outstanding at December 31, 2019 or 2018 .

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) 

The financial covenants for the $750 million committed credit facility require CS&#38;Co to maintain a minimum net capital ratio, all bank subsidiaries to be well capitalized, and CSC to maintain a minimum level of stockholders&#8217; equity, adjusted to exclude AOCI. At December 31, 2019 , the minimum level of stockholders&#8217; equity required under this facility was $16.0 billion (CSC&#8217;s stockholders&#8217; equity, excluding AOCI, at December 31, 2019 was $21.7 billion ). Management believes these restrictions will not have a material effect on CSC&#8217;s ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements. 

To partially satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the Options Clearing Corporation, CS&#38;Co has unsecured standby letter of credit agreements (LOCs) with several banks in favor of the Options Clearing Corporation aggregating $20 million at December 31, 2019 . There were no funds drawn under any of these LOCs during 2019 or 2018 . In connection with its securities lending activities, the Company is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. The collateral requirements were satisfied by providing cash as collateral. 

CSC has a universal automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, which enables it to issue debt, equity, and other securities. 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio 

As Schwab&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet assets were above $250 billion at December 31, 2018, Schwab became subject to the non-modified LCR rule on April 1, 2019. The Company was in compliance with the LCR rule at December 31, 2019 .

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 

Schwab seeks to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support execution of our business strategy, including anticipated balance sheet growth, providing financial support to our subsidiaries, and sustained access to the capital markets, while at the same time meeting our regulatory capital requirements and serving as a source of financial strength to our banking subsidiaries. Schwab&#8217;s primary sources of capital are funds generated by the operations of subsidiaries and securities issuances by CSC in the capital markets. To ensure that Schwab has sufficient capital to absorb unanticipated losses or declines in asset values, we have adopted a policy to remain well capitalized even in stressed scenarios. Our capital management in coming quarters will incorporate preparations for closing the USAA-IMCO transaction, including the allocation of capital to support client cash that will be added to our balance sheet. 

Internal guidelines are set, for both CSC and its regulated subsidiaries, to ensure capital levels are in line with our strategy and regulatory requirements. Capital forecasts are reviewed monthly at Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee and Financial Risk Oversight Committee meetings. A number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify potential problems that could impact capital. In addition, we monitor the subsidiaries&#8217; capital levels and requirements. Subject to regulatory capital requirements and any required approvals, any excess capital held by subsidiaries is transferred to CSC in the form of dividends and returns of capital. When subsidiaries have need of additional capital, funds are provided by CSC as equity investments and also as subordinated loans (in a form approved as regulatory capital by regulators) for CS&#38;Co. The details and method used for each cash infusion are based on an analysis of the particular entity&#8217;s needs and financing alternatives. The amounts and structure of infusions must take into consideration maintenance of regulatory capital requirements, debt/equity ratios, and equity double leverage ratios. 

Schwab conducts regular capital stress testing to assess the potential financial impacts of various adverse macroeconomic and company-specific events to which the Company could be subjected. The objective of the capital stress testing is (1) to explore various potential outcomes &#8211; including rare and extreme events and (2) to assess impacts of potential stressful outcomes on both capital and liquidity. Additionally, we have a comprehensive Capital Contingency Plan to provide action plans for certain low probability/high impact capital events that the Company might face. The Capital Contingency Plan is issued under the authority of the Financial Risk Oversight Committee and provides guidelines for sustained capital events. It does not specifically address every contingency, but is designed to provide a framework for responding to any capital stress. The results of the stress testing indicate there are two scenarios which could stress the Company&#8217;s capital: (1) inflows of balance sheet cash during a period of very low interest rates and (2) outflows of balance sheet cash when other sources of financing are not available and the Company is required to sell assets to fund the flows at a loss. The Capital Contingency Plan is reviewed annually and updated as appropriate.

Regulatory Capital Requirements 

CSC is subject to capital requirements set by the Federal Reserve and is required to serve as a source of strength for our banking subsidiaries and to provide financial assistance if our banking subsidiaries experience financial distress. Schwab is required to maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio for CSC of at least 4%; however, management seeks to maintain a ratio of at least 6%. Due to the relatively low risk of our balance sheet assets and risk-based capital ratios at CSC and CSB that are well in excess of regulatory requirements, the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio is the most restrictive capital constraint on CSC&#8217;s asset growth. 

Our banking subsidiaries are subject to capital requirements set by their regulators that are substantially similar to those imposed on CSC by the Federal Reserve. Our banking subsidiaries&#8217; failure to remain well capitalized could result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that could have a direct material effect on the banks. Schwab&#8217;s principal banking subsidiary, CSB, is required to maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of at least 5% to be well capitalized, but seeks to maintain a ratio of at least 6.25%. Based on its regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2019 , CSB is considered well capitalized. 

The following table details the capital ratios for CSC consolidated and CSB:

(1) Beginning in 2019, CSC and CSB were required to include all components of AOCI in regulatory capital and report our supplementary leverage ratio, which is calculated as Tier 1 capital divided by total leverage exposure. Total leverage exposure includes all on-balance sheet assets and certain off-balance sheet exposures, including unused commitments. Prior to 2019, CSC and CSB elected to opt-out of the requirement to include most components of AOCI in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital; the amounts and ratios for December 31, 2018 are presented on this basis. In the interagency regulatory capital and liquidity rules adopted in October 2019, Category III banking organizations such as CSC were given the ability to opt-out of the inclusion of AOCI in regulatory capital, and CSC made this opt-out election effective as of January 1, 2020. See Business &#8211; Regulation in Part I, Item 1 for additional information on recently issued rules that impact Schwab&#8217;s regulatory capital requirements. 

N/A Not applicable. 

CSB is also subject to regulatory requirements that restrict and govern the terms of affiliate transactions. In addition, CSB is required to provide notice to, and may be required to obtain approval from, the OCC and the Federal Reserve to declare dividends to CSC.

As a broker-dealer, CS&#38;Co is subject to regulatory requirements of the Uniform Net Capital Rule, which is intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. These regulations prohibit CS&#38;Co from paying cash dividends, making unsecured advances and loans to the parent company and employees, and repaying subordinated borrowings from CSC if such payment would result in a net capital amount below prescribed thresholds. At December 31, 2019 , CS&#38;Co was in compliance with its net capital requirements. 

In addition to the capital requirements above, Schwab&#8217;s subsidiaries are subject to other regulatory requirements intended to ensure financial soundness and liquidity. See Item 8 &#8211; Note 21 for additional information on the components of stockholders&#8217; equity and information on the capital requirements of significant subsidiaries. 

Dividends 

Since the initial dividend in 1989, CSC has paid 123 consecutive quarterly dividends and has increased the quarterly dividend rate 24 times, resulting in a 21% compounded annual growth rate, excluding the special cash dividend of $1.00 per common share in 2007. While the payment and amount of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors, subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions, CSC currently targets its common stock cash dividend at approximately 20% to 30% of net income. 

The Board of Directors of the Company declared quarterly cash dividend increases per common share during 2018 and 2019 as shown below:

Share Repurchases 

On January 30, 2019, CSC publicly announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $4.0 billion of common stock. The authorization does not have an expiration date. During 2019, CSC repurchased 55 million shares of its common stock for $2.2 billion, leaving $1.8 billion remaining on our existing authorization as of December 31, 2019.

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) 

On October 25, 2018, CSC publicly announced that its Board of Directors terminated the existing two share repurchase authorizations and replaced them with a new authorization to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of common stock. CSC repurchased 22 million shares of its common stock for $1.0 billion in 2018, completing all repurchases under this authorization. 

FOREIGN EXPOSURE 

At December 31, 2019 , Schwab had exposure to non-sovereign financial and non-financial institutions in foreign countries, as well as agencies of foreign governments. At December 31, 2019 , the fair value of these holdings totaled $6.4 billion , with the top three exposures being to issuers and counterparties domiciled in France at $3.1 billion , the Netherlands at $845 million , and Sweden at $684 million . 

In addition to the direct holdings in foreign companies and securities issued by foreign government agencies, Schwab had outstanding margin loans to foreign residents of $437 million at December 31, 2019 . 

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

Schwab uses the market approach to determine the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, and to determine fair value disclosures. See Item 8 &#8211; Notes 2 and 16 for more information on our assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. 

When available, Schwab uses quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities. Quoted prices for investments in exchange-traded securities represent end-of-day close prices published by exchanges. Quoted prices for money market funds and other mutual funds represent reported net asset values. When utilizing market data and bid-ask spread, we use the price within the bid-ask spread that best represents fair value. When quoted prices in active markets do not exist, prices are obtained from independent third-party pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets. We generally obtain prices from three independent pricing sources for assets recorded at fair value. Our primary third-party pricing service provides prices for our fixed income investments such as commercial paper; certificates of deposits; U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; corporate debt securities; asset-backed securities; foreign government agency securities; and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. Such prices are based on observable trades, broker/dealer quotes, and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities (a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads) and weighted-average maturity for the same or similar &#8220;to-be-issued&#8221; securities. We compare the prices obtained from the primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable. Schwab does not adjust the prices received from independent third-party pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in material differences in the amounts recorded. At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , we did not adjust prices received from the primary independent third-party pricing service. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

The consolidated financial statements of Schwab have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Item 8 &#8211; Note 2 contains more information on our significant accounting policies made in connection with its application of these accounting principles. 

While the majority of the revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are not based on estimates, there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on Schwab&#8217;s financial position and reported financial results. These critical accounting estimates are described below. Management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy.

Schwab estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, including federal, state and local domestic jurisdictions, and immaterial amounts owed to several foreign jurisdictions. The estimated income tax expense is reported in the consolidated statements of income in taxes on income. Accrued taxes are reported in other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing jurisdictions either currently or deferred to future periods. Deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes versus income tax reporting purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in management&#8217;s judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. In estimating accrued taxes, we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position. Because of the complexity of tax laws and regulations, interpretation can be difficult and subject to legal judgment given specific facts and circumstances. 

Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws, the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities, and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance that impacts the relative merits and risks of tax positions. These changes, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be significant to the operating results of the Company. See Item 8 &#8211; Note 20 for more information on the Company&#8217;s income taxes. 

Legal and Regulatory Reserves 

Reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter, after considering, among other factors, the progress of the case, prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases, available defenses, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. In many cases, including most class action lawsuits, it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred, or to estimate the range of that loss, until the matter is close to resolution, in which case no accrual is made until that time. Reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved. See Item 8 &#8211; Note 14 for more information on the Company&#8217;s contingencies related to legal and regulatory reserves.
