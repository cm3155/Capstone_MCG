Risk Factors" in Part II of this quarterly report and in "Risk Factors," "Business &#8212; Competition," "Business &#8212; Supervision and Regulation" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, which is filed with the SEC and available at the SEC's internet site (https://www.sec.gov). 

Introduction and Overview 

Discover Financial Services ("DFS") is a direct banking and payment services company. We provide direct banking products and services and payment services through our subsidiaries. We offer our customers credit card loans, private student loans, personal loans, home equity loans and deposit products. We also operate the Discover Network, the PULSE network ("PULSE") and Diners Club International ("Diners Club"). The Discover Network processes transactions for Discover-branded credit and debit cards and provides payment transaction processing and settlement services. PULSE operates an electronic funds transfer network, providing financial institutions issuing debit cards on the PULSE network with access to ATMs domestically and internationally, as well as merchant acceptance throughout the U.S. for debit card transactions. Diners Club is a global payments network of licensees, which are generally financial institutions, that issue Diners Club branded charge cards and/or provide card acceptance services. 

Our primary revenues consist of interest income earned on loan receivables and fees earned from customers, financial institutions, merchants and issuers. The primary expenses required to operate our business include funding costs (interest expense), credit loss provisions, customer rewards and expenses incurred to grow, manage and service our loan receivables and networks. Our business activities are funded primarily through consumer deposits, securitization of loan receivables and the issuance of unsecured debt. 

Change in Accounting Principle 

Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments&#8212;Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments became effective for us on January 1, 2020. The standard significantly amended accounting principles generally accepted in the United States by replacing the incurred loss model with the current expected credit loss ("CECL") approach. The CECL approach requires our allowance for credit losses to be based on an estimate of all anticipated credit losses over the remaining expected life of all of the loans, as opposed to an estimate of incurred losses as of the balance sheet date. For additional information on CECL, see Note 1: Background and Basis of Presentation to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

The ASU required modified-retrospective application, meaning a cumulative-effect adjustment was recorded on January 1, 2020, without adjusting comparative prior periods. This cumulative-effect adjustment did not reflect the economic disruption resulting from COVID-19 since the global disruption occurred subsequent to January 1, 2020. As a result of adoption, we recorded: 

&#8226; A $2.5 billion increase to the allowance for credit losses on loan receivables primarily representing the adjustment for recording reserves for expected losses, not simply those deemed to be already incurred, and extending the loss estimate period over the entire life of the loan; 

&#8226; A $0.6 billion increase to other assets related to deferred tax assets on the larger allowance for credit losses; 

&#8226; An offsetting $1.9 billion decrease, net of tax, to the opening balance of retained earnings; and 

&#8226; Immaterial adjustments to the following: 

&#9702; The carrying value of PCD loans and related accrued interest reflected in other assets; and 

&#9702; Accrued expenses and other liabilities to record reserves for unfunded commitments. 

As required by the ASU, financial statement results and balances prior to January 1, 2020, have not been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the amendments in ASU No. 2016-13. Therefore, current period results and balances are not comparable to prior period amounts, particularly with regard to the provision and allowance for credit losses (and their related subtotals). 

Additional Information for Comparability 

In order to help investors understand our year-over-year performance, we are providing adjusted prior year allowance for credit losses and related allowance build figures using the CECL approach for comparative purposes. These adjusted prior year figures are non-GAAP financial measures and should be viewed in addition to, not as a substitute for, our reported results. We believe that these adjusted figures are useful to investors since credit losses were estimated using the incurred loss approach prior to adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 on January 1, 2020. The adjusted allowance and related build figures provide investors with comparable amounts to understand our results. 

The following table provides a reconciliation of prior year allowance for credit losses figures as reported (using the incurred loss approach) to adjusted allowance for credit losses using the CECL approach, as well as related allowance build figures (dollars in millions): &#160; As of and for the Quarter Ended, As of &#160; Dec 31, 2019 Sep 30, 2019 Jun 30, 2019 Mar 31, 2019 Dec 31, 2018 Allowance for credit losses - as reported (incurred) $ 3,383 $ 3,299 $ 3,202 $ 3,134 $ 3,041

COVID-19 Pandemic Response and Impact 

The COVID-19 pandemic has continued to have a widespread and unprecedented impact on a global scale. The health crisis continues to have a severe effect on the economy and unemployment. The impact of COVID-19 continues to evolve rapidly. Its future effects are uncertain and it may be difficult to assess or predict the extent of the impacts of the pandemic on us as many factors are beyond our control and knowledge. For a discussion of the risks we face with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic, the associated economic uncertainty, the steps taken to mitigate the pandemic and the resulting economic contraction, see "Item 1A &#8212; Risk Factors" in Part II of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which should be read in conjunction with the risk factors disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. This section includes a discussion of significant areas of potential impact on us of the COVID-19 pandemic and certain actions we are taking or expect to take in this time of uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Outlook and Financial Results 

During the first three quarters of the year, the pandemic has adversely impacted our financial results, specifically in the decrease in sales volume and credit card loan growth as well as the increase in our estimate of life of loan expected credit losses. As previously disclosed in the first quarter Form 10-Q, we continue to execute on our strategy to implement approximately $400 million of cost reductions off of previously provided guidance from the fourth quarter 2019 earnings release, targeting areas such as account acquisition costs and marketing expenses, due to the economic environment and the resulting pressure on earnings for the remainder of the year. Outbreaks of COVID-19 have resulted in state and local governments implementing, and in some cases re-implementing, measures to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions, shutdowns and quarantines. We anticipate these measures as well as the related economic uncertainty will continue to negatively impact consumer and business spending habits and the consumer credit environment, including the ability of consumers to repay their loans. While certain parts of the U.S. have lifted these measures, the re-emergence of COVID-19 has and may continue to result in governments re-imposing restrictions that may remain in place for a significant period of time. The economic uncertainty associated with COVID-19 and the measures taken to limit its spread have and will likely continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

Regulatory and Legislative 

Federal, state and local governments, including the U.S. Congress, the Executive Branch and banking agencies have taken extraordinary measures to support the U.S. economy and mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of measures taken to slow its spread. These policies have included efforts to provide regulatory relief and flexibility to financial institutions, liquidity to capital markets and mandates to support businesses and consumers, including stimulus checks, payment forbearance and other forms of assistance. Lawmakers continue to offer additional proposals as the situation evolves in an attempt to mitigate harm to the economy and consumers. It is too early to determine the overall effectiveness of 

actions that have been taken and their ultimate impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For more information, see &#8220;&#8212; Regulatory Environment and Developments&#8221; below. 

Loan Receivables 

In our loan portfolio, we continue to lend to customers, but have tightened standards for new accounts and for growing existing accounts. Currently, we are providing support to our customers impacted by COVID-19 across all of our loan products to help our customers during this period of economic difficulty. We have materially increased our allowance for credit losses in anticipation of higher credit losses caused by further deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook. The reserve for the quarter ended September 30, 2020, took into account our best estimate for the impact of programs put in place by federal and state governments and agencies to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic. It is unclear whether the measures employed to date are complete or whether federal and state governments and agencies may take additional action that could impact our business. Refer to "&#8212; Loan Quality &#8212; Impact of COVID-19 on Loan Quality" for more details on the current period allowance for credit losses. 

Capital and Liquidity 

We entered the COVID-19 pandemic with strong capital and liquidity positions, which we believe allows us to maintain normal operations during periods of financial market stress and disruptions to wholesale and retail funding sources. We believe we have a sufficient reserve of high-quality liquid assets and have been able to maintain access to diverse funding channels. We continued to see strong demand for our direct-to-consumer and sweep deposit balances as consumer savings rates have increased and investors sought safer assets. We remain well-capitalized with capital ratios in excess of regulatory minimums and have taken actions to preserve capital such as suspending our share repurchase program. For purposes of calculating regulatory capital, we have elected to defer recognition of the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital for two years in accordance with the interim final rule announced by Federal banking regulators on March 27, 2020. Pursuant to the interim final rule, the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital will be phased in over a three-year period beginning in 2022. 

For more information on the impact of COVID-19 on liquidity and capital, see "&#8212; Liquidity and Capital Resources &#8212; Impact of COVID-19 on Liquidity and Capital." 

Payment Services 

As governments across the U.S. and the world have taken steps to minimize the transmission of COVID-19, the number of transactions processed on the Discover Global Network has declined overall despite increases in certain categories. Certain negatively impacted categories such as travel make up a small portion of the transactions processed but may have an outsized impact on some of our Diners Club franchisees. The current crisis may result in lasting changes in consumer payment behaviors, such as a shift from credit to debit, a decline in the use of cash, increasing online sales and rapid adoption of contactless payment. These shifts may result in changes to the Payment Services segment&#8217;s results of operations. 

Fair Value and Impairments 

With the uncertain nature of the pandemic's overall impact to the economy, we continue to assess the impact of COVID-19 with respect to our goodwill and intangible assets, investment securities and other long-term assets and determined that there were no material impairments necessary during the quarter. For more information on the impact of COVID-19 on intangible assets, see Note 5: Intangible Assets to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Business Continuity and Operations 

We have opened some of our physical locations with appropriate health safety measures and capacity limitations, including our corporate headquarters. However, we have informed employees that they may continue to work from home and will not be required to return to our physical locations until June 2021, at the earliest. Notwithstanding the shift to work-from-home, our operations continue largely unaffected due to the successful implementation of certain of our business continuity plans. Operational changes necessitated by the rapid shift in employee location have not thus far had a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition; however, the shift has caused us to grow increasingly dependent on third-party service providers, including those with which we have no relationship such as our employees&#8217; internet service providers. For more information on the risks associated with reliance on third-party service providers and the shift to work from home, see our 

risk factors disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as well as "Item 1A &#8212; Risk Factors" in Part II of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 

Regulatory Environment and Developments 

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to dramatically impact the U.S. and global economies. We are working with our customers to address their unique financial situations, while balancing safety and soundness requirements. We are in contact with our regulators, who continue to proactively encouraged banks to work with borrowers during this time of stress. Among other actions, the federal banking agencies have taken the following measures to proactively address the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 outbreak and provide flexibility for banking organizations to work with impacted businesses and consumers: 

&#8226; Market Stabilization: The Federal Reserve reduced short-term interest rates to near zero and launched numerous programs and facilities, including the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, to increase market liquidity and promote stability; 

&#8226; Capital &#38; Liquidity Flexibility: Regulatory agencies issued statements urging banks to use their capital and liquidity buffers to continue lending during the crisis; 

&#8226; CECL: A joint agency interim final rule, which has since been adopted as a final rule, provided banks, such as Discover, with the option to delay CECL's impact on regulatory capital for two years, followed by three year phase-in of those impacts. The U.S. Treasury subsequently released a study on CECL impacts, noting the need to continue to assess and potentially make changes to the standard or regulatory capital requirements; 

&#8226; Flexibility to Work with Consumers: The agencies issued joint guidance encouraging banks to work with borrowers and provided guidelines for prudent relief programs, and agencies worked with FASB to provide accounting-classification flexibility for certain short-term loan modifications. Subsequently, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (&#8220;FFIEC&#8221;) issued a statement emphasizing the need for institutions to utilize &#8220;prudent risk management and consumer protection principles&#8230;while working with borrowers as loans near the end of initial loan accommodation periods&#8221;; 

&#8226; Pandemic Planning: The FFIEC released updated guidance to remind banks of actions they should be taking to minimize potential adverse effects of a pandemic on business continuity; and 

&#8226; Supervisory Flexibility: Regulatory agencies have indicated willingness to work with institutions to provide flexibility and minimize burdens of supervisory activities, including extending deadlines for data collections. 

In addition to the above regulatory actions, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act") was signed into law on March 27, 2020, to provide relief to U.S. businesses and consumers impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. The CARES Act includes approximately $2 trillion of financial assistance, principally through federal loan programs intended to provide relief to consumers who have suffered job losses and aid businesses that have experienced disruption as a result of the pandemic. Additionally, the CARES Act provided expanded unemployment benefits and direct payments to impacted consumers and offered relief for consumers through changes to credit reporting requirements and mandated forbearance on certain federally backed mortgages and student loans. Specific to financial institutions, the CARES Act provided the option for financial institutions, including Discover, to temporarily suspend certain accounting requirements related to troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs") and delay the effective date of CECL for the duration of the national emergency. See "&#8212; Banking &#8212; Capital Standards and Stress Testing" below for more information. It also authorized the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") to establish an emergency guarantee program, which could be used to temporarily increase deposit insurance limits. Additional legislative and regulatory action may be proposed and could include requirements that could significantly impact our business practices. The impact of these legislative and regulatory initiatives on us, the economy and the U.S. consumer will depend upon a wide variety of factors some of which are yet to be identified. 

Banking 

Capital Standards and Stress Testing 

Discover is subject to mandatory supervisory stress tests every other year and is required to submit annual capital plans to the Federal Reserve based on internal forward-looking analysis of income and capital levels under expected and stressful conditions. Discover is also subject to capital buffer requirements, including the Stress Capital Buffer ("SCB"), which requires maintenance of regulatory capital levels above a threshold that is established based on the results of supervisory stress tests after accounting for planned dividend payments. 

On June 25, 2020, we received results of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s supervisory stress tests and preliminary SCB requirement. The notice indicated that Discover&#8217;s capital ratios remain above all required minimums under each of the supervisory scenarios and our preliminary SCB requirement was set at 3.5%, which was announced as final in a public notice issued by the Federal Reserve on August 10, 2020. In addition to the stress test and SCB results, the Federal Reserve also notified Discover that it and all other firms that participated in the 2020 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review ("CCAR") exercise would be required to submit a revised capital plan that will be assessed by the Federal Reserve later this year under newly developed scenarios incorporating economic stresses reflecting the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The Federal Reserve has since released the supervisory scenarios that will be utilized as part of the capital plan resubmission and informed covered firms that capital plans must be submitted by November 2, 2020, with the Federal Reserve planning to release firm-specific results via public disclosure before the end of the year. It is not yet known whether the Federal Reserve will utilize the capital plan resubmission to adjust firms&#8217; SCB or distribution limits. In the interim, for both the third and fourth quarter of 2020, the Federal Reserve has capped covered firms&#8217; capital distributions based on a formula that restricts most share repurchases and limits dividends based on average net income during the past four quarters. The SCB is anticipated to become effective beginning in the first quarter of 2021. Consistent with regulatory expectations, we continue to conduct forward-looking sensitivity analysis and stress tests to assess the potential impact of economic changes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic on capital planning and provide this information to our Board of Directors as well as our regulators. 

The Federal Reserve issued a public notice on September 30, 2020, that it is soliciting comments on proposed changes to its capital plan rule to reflect the tailored requirements for Category IV bank holding companies (including Discover). Among other things, the proposed rule would clarify that Category IV firms will be required to submit a capital plan to the Federal Reserve annually even in off-cycle years and would have the option to submit to supervisory stress tests during off-cycle years if they wished to adjust their SCB. The deadline to provide comments to the Federal Reserve is November 20, 2020, and the timing and substance of any final rule is unknown. 

Consumer Financial Services 

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB") regulates consumer financial products and services and examines certain providers of consumer financial products and services, including Discover. The CFPB's authority includes preventing "unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices" and ensuring that consumers have access to fair, transparent and competitive financial products and services. The CFPB has rulemaking, supervision and enforcement powers with respect to federal consumer protection laws. Historically, the CFPB's policy priorities focused on several financial products of the type we offer (e.g. credit cards and other consumer lending products). In addition, the CFPB is required by statute to undertake certain actions including its bi-annual review of the consumer credit card market. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, federal banking regulators as well as the CFPB have encouraged banks to work with their borrowers and provided regulatory flexibility, given exam flexibility, delayed the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and other data collections, and promoted other areas for relief. Similar to the banking regulators, we continue to be in regular contact with the CFPB as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves. Similarly, we are monitoring the activity in the states and are in contact with state officials, as necessary, to ensure we are aware of and in compliance with state requirements responding to COVID-19. 

Data Security and Privacy 

Policymakers at the federal and state levels remain focused on measures to enhance data security and data breach incident response requirements. Furthermore, regulations and legislation at various levels of government have been proposed and enacted to augment data privacy standards. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") creates a broad set of privacy rights and remedies modeled in part on the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020, and the final California Attorney General regulations became effective on August 14, 2020. California Attorney General enforcement for CCPA began on July 1, 2020. The original proponent of the CCPA has launched a 2020 California ballot initiative with the goal of expanding the rights and remedies created by the CCPA, while protecting the new law from future legislative amendments. This initiative will appear on the November 2020 ballot. While it is too early to determine the full impact of these developments, they may result in the imposition of requirements on Discover and other providers of consumer financial services or networks that could adversely affect our businesses. 

Payment Networks 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank Act") contains several provisions impacting the debit card market, including network participation requirements and interchange fee limitations. The changing debit card environment, including competitor actions related to merchant and acquirer pricing and transaction routing 

strategies, has adversely affected, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our PULSE network's business practices, network transaction volume, revenue and prospects for future growth. We continue to closely monitor competitor pricing and technology development strategies in order to assess their impact on our business and on competition in the marketplace. Following an inquiry by the U.S. Department of Justice into some of these competitor pricing strategies, PULSE filed a lawsuit against Visa in late 2014 with respect to these competitive concerns. The Court granted summary judgment in favor of Visa in August 2018. PULSE filed an appeal on January 17, 2019, and Visa filed their response to the appeal on April 5, 2019. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held a hearing on the appeal on October 9, 2019, and will hold an additional hearing on the appeal in the coming months. Visa also faces ongoing merchant litigation as it relates to the underlying anticompetitive behavior that is the subject of PULSE's case against Visa. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act's network participation requirements impact PULSE's ability to enter into exclusivity arrangements, which affects PULSE's current business practices and may materially adversely affect its network transaction volume and revenue. 

For more information on how the regulatory and supervisory environment, ongoing enforcement actions and findings and changes to laws and regulations could impact our strategies, the value of our assets or otherwise adversely affect our business see "Risk Factors &#8212; Current Economic and Regulatory Environment" in our annual report on Form 10-K year ended December 31, 2019. For more information on recent matters affecting us, see Note 14: Litigation and Regulatory Matters to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

Direct Banking 

Our Direct Banking segment reported pretax income of $917 million and $272 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to pretax income of $943 million and $2.8 billion, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019. 

Net interest income decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same periods in 2019 primarily driven by lower yields on credit card loans partially offset by lower funding costs. Interest income decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same periods in 2019, primarily as a result of lower yields on credit card loans, which was the result of lower market rates. Interest expense decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same periods in 2019 due to lower average market rates and lower funding costs. 

The provision for credit losses increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, which primarily reflects the impact of life of loan reserving under CECL and a significant change in the economic outlook due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the three months ended September 30, 2020, the provision for credit losses decreased as compared with the same period in 2019 primarily due to lower levels of net charge-offs and lower reserve builds. For a detailed discussion on provision for credit losses, see "&#8212; Loan Quality &#8212; Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses." 

Total other income decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same periods in 2019, which was primarily due to a decrease in discount and interchange revenue and loan fee income. The decrease in discount and interchange revenue was partially offset by a decrease in rewards costs, both of which were the result of lower sales volume due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Loan fee income decreased due to lower volume and late fees. Late fees decreased as a result of lower delinquencies as we continue to work with our customers through the economic stresses from COVID-19. 

Total other expense decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, which was primarily driven by marketing and business development and professional fees. Marketing and business development decreased due to COVID-19 related expense reductions in brand advertising for card. Professional fees were lower primarily driven by a decrease in collection fees. This was partially offset by an increase in employee compensation and benefits and information processing and communications. Employee compensation and benefits increased as a result of a larger headcount base and higher average salaries. The increase in information processing and communications was due to investments in infrastructure. 

Discover card sales volume was $37.1 billion and $101.8 billion, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, which was a decrease of 0.8% and 4.8%, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2019. This volume decline was primarily driven by lower consumer spending as a result of COVID-19. 

Payment Services 

Our Payment Services segment reported pretax income of $42 million and $148 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to pretax income of $51 million and $148 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2019. The decrease in segment pretax income for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, was primarily driven by lower volume. Segment pretax income was relatively flat for nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in segment pretax income was primarily due to gains on equity investment sales during the first and second quarters, offset by an increase in segment pretax expense driven by a COVID-19 related non-cash impairment charge on the Diners Club business in the second quarter. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

In preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"), management must make judgments and use estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are uncertain. For estimates that involve a high degree of judgment and subjectivity, it is possible that different estimates could reasonably be derived for the same period. For estimates that are particularly sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions, significant changes to the estimated amount from period to period are also possible. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts in our condensed consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could 

have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and, in certain cases, could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition. Management has identified the estimates related to our allowance for credit losses on loan receivables, the evaluation of goodwill for potential impairment and the accrual of income taxes as critical accounting estimates. Discussion of critical accounting estimates related to the evaluation of goodwill for potential impairment and the accrual of income taxes are discussed in greater detail in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. That discussion can be found within "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Critical Accounting Estimates." There have not been any material changes in the methods used to formulate these critical accounting estimates related to the evaluation of goodwill for potential impairment and the accrual of income taxes from those discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. Discussion of our critical accounting estimate related to our allowance for credit losses on loan receivables, which has been updated for adoption of the CECL approach for estimating losses on January 1, 2020, is discussed below. For more information on CECL adoption, see Note 1: Background and Basis of Presentation to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loan Receivables 

We base our allowance for credit losses on several analyses that help us estimate credit losses anticipated over the remaining expected life of loan receivables as of the balance sheet date. In deriving this estimate, we consider the collectability of principal, interest and fees associated with our loan receivables. We also consider expected recoveries of amounts that were either previously charged off or are expected to be charged off. Our estimation process includes models that predict customer losses based on risk characteristics and portfolio attributes, macroeconomic variables and historical data and analysis. There is a significant amount of judgment applied in selecting inputs and analyzing the results produced to determine the allowance. The allowance for credit losses for each loan product type is based on: 1) a reasonable and supportable forecast period, 2) a reversion period and 3) a post-reversion period based on historical information covering the remaining life of the loan. For credit card loans, we use a modeling framework that includes the following components: 1) probability of default, 2) exposure at default and 3) loss given default, as well as estimated recoveries for estimating expected credit losses. For student loans and personal loans, we use vintage-based models that estimate expected credit losses net of recoveries over the life of the loans. The considerations in these models include past and current loan performance, loan growth and seasoning, risk management practices, account collection strategies, economic conditions, bankruptcy filings, policy changes and forecasting uncertainties. Given the same information, others may reach different reasonable estimates. 

The key assumptions requiring significant judgment in the allowance for credit losses estimate on a quarterly basis include determination of the lengths of the reasonable and supportable forecast and reversion periods, as well as the macroeconomic variables selected for use in loss forecast models. The lengths of the reasonable and supportable forecast and reversion periods can vary and are subject to a quarterly assessment that considers the economic outlook and level of variability among macroeconomic forecasts. Generally, a straight-line method is used to revert from the reasonable and supportable forecast period to the post-reversion period, but in certain stressed scenarios, a weighted approach may be deemed more appropriate. The specific macroeconomic variables most significant to the loss forecast models may change over time, but generally include measures of consumer indebtedness, unemployment, personal income and housing-related metrics. 

The overall economic environment directly impacts both the reasonable and supportable forecast and reversion periods, as well as the macroeconomic variables that are used in the loss forecast models. If management used different assumptions about the economic environment in estimating expected credit losses, the impact to the allowance for credit losses could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we experience a rapidly changing economic environment, as experienced recently under the COVID-19 pandemic, the uncertainty around the credit loss forecasts may increase, both due to the uncertainty of the economic forecasts and the challenges our models may have in incorporating them. See "&#8212; Loan Quality" and Note 3: Loan Receivables to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further details about our allowance for credit losses.

Net Interest Income 

The table that follows this section has been provided to supplement the discussion below and provide further analysis of net interest income and net interest margin. Net interest income represents the difference between interest income earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred to finance those assets. We analyze net interest income in total by calculating net interest margin (net interest income as a percentage of average total loan receivables) and net yield on interest-earning assets (net interest income as a percentage of average total interest-earning assets). We also separately consider the impact of the level of loan receivables and the related interest yield and the impact of the cost of funds related to each of our funding sources, along with the income generated by our liquidity portfolio, on net interest income. 

Our interest-earning assets consist of: (i) cash and cash equivalents primarily related to amounts on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, (ii) restricted cash, (iii) other short-term investments, (iv) investment securities and (v) loan receivables. Our interest-bearing liabilities consist primarily of deposits, both direct-to-consumer and brokered, and long-term borrowings, including amounts owed to securitization investors. Net interest income is influenced by the following: 

&#8226; The level and composition of loan receivables, including the proportion of credit card loans to other loans, as well as the proportion of loan receivables bearing interest at promotional rates as compared to standard rates; 

&#8226; The credit performance of our loans, particularly with regard to charge-offs of finance charges, which reduce interest income; 

&#8226; The terms of long-term borrowings and certificates of deposit upon initial offering, including maturity and interest rate; 

&#8226; The interest rates necessary to attract and maintain direct-to-consumer deposits; 

&#8226; The level and composition of other interest-earning assets, including our liquidity portfolio and interest-bearing liabilities; 

&#8226; Changes in the interest rate environment, including the levels of interest rates and the relationships among interest rate indices, such as the prime rate, the Federal Funds rate, interest rate on excess reserves and London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"); and 

&#8226; The effectiveness of interest rate swaps in our interest rate risk management program. 

&#160; Net interest income decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same periods in 2019 primarily driven by lower yields on credit card loans partially offset by lower funding costs. Interest income decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same periods in 2019, primarily as a result of lower yields on credit card loans, which was the result of lower market rates. Interest expense decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same periods in 2019 due to lower average market rates and lower funding costs.

Loan Quality 

Impact of COVID-19 on Loan Quality 

COVID-19 and its impact to the economy has had a significant effect on our sales volume and credit card loan growth during the first three quarters of 2020. While we continue to lend to customers, we have tightened standards for new accounts and for growing existing accounts across all products. 

In response to the pandemic, we expanded borrower relief offerings to included Skip-a-Pay (payment deferral) programs and other loan modifications, complementing the assistance already available through our existing loan modification programs. The accounts using these modifications as a result of the pandemic impact, were evaluated for exclusion from TDR status either due to the insignificance of the concession or because they qualified for exemption pursuant to the CARES Act. While we continue to support and provide assistance to all customers impacted by COVID-19, we are no longer offering enrollments in the Skip-a-Pay (payment deferral) programs or loan modifications developed specifically for COVID-19 as of August 31, 2020. While the Skip-a-Pay (payment deferral) programs were active, we enrolled approximately 699 thousand customers and $5.5 billion in receivables in total. 

The utilization of these Skip-a-Pay (payment deferral) programs had a favorable impact on reported credit performance because, pursuant to regulatory guidelines, accounts enrolled in the programs did not advance through delinquency cycles in the same time frame as would have occurred without the programs. Specifically, current accounts enrolled in the programs did not advance to delinquency and delinquent accounts enrolled in the programs did not advance to the next delinquency cycle or to charge-off. Our delinquency ratios have been favorably impacted at September 30, 2020, as compared to December 31, 2019, by customer usage of the Skip-a-Pay (payment deferral) programs. 

Additionally, due to relief provided by the CARES Act, certain customer accounts entering loan modification programs during the pandemic were excluded from being reported as TDRs. As a result, fewer modifications were reported as TDRs at September 30, 2020, than otherwise would have been. The table below reflects both the new modifications reported as TDRs and the amount of new modifications excluded from TDR classification as a result of regulatory relief (dollars in millions): For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 

Accounts that entered a program and were classified as TDRs during the period Accounts excluded from the TDR designation due to regulatory exemptions Number of Accounts Balances Number of Accounts Balances Credit card loans 

130,869 $ 875 155,676 $ 1,169 Private student loans 

1,767 $ 32 3,416 $ 62 Personal loans 

6,315 $ 83 2,431 $ 43 

Despite the lower delinquency and TDR trends resulting from the relief we are providing to our customers, we believe we have appropriately reflected the risk presented by the accounts using these programs as well as the worsening economic impact of the pandemic on our customers in the allowance for credit losses. Since the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, the increases in the allowance for credit losses during the first three quarters of 2020 are indicative of the deterioration in consumer credit we expect related to the pandemic. The year-to-date build in the allowance of $4.8 billion, which includes the $2.5 billion cumulative-effect adjustment for the adoption of CECL, is largely attributable to card loans but includes increases associated with all loan products. Labor markets, historically indicative of trends in credit losses, have been significantly stressed by the pandemic with unemployment reaching unprecedented levels. The higher allowance for credit losses reflects our view of this economic impact on our customers. Refer to Note 3: Loan Receivables to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more details on modification programs, TDRs and the allowance for credit losses.

Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses 

Provision for credit losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for credit losses at an appropriate level to absorb the estimate of credit losses anticipated over the remaining expected life of loan receivables at each period end date. In deriving the estimate of expected credit losses, we consider the collectability of principal, interest and fees associated with our loan receivables. We also consider expected recoveries of amounts that were either previously charged off or are expected to be charged off. Establishing the estimate for expected losses requires significant management judgment. The factors that influence the provision for credit losses include: 

&#8226; Increases or decreases in outstanding loan balances, including: 

&#9702; Changes in consumer spending, payment and credit utilization behaviors; 

&#9702; The level of originations and maturities; and 

&#9702; Changes in the overall mix of accounts and products within the portfolio; 

&#8226; The credit quality of the loan portfolio, which reflects, among other factors, our credit granting practices and the effectiveness of collection efforts; 

&#8226; The impact of general economic conditions on the consumer, including national and regional conditions, unemployment levels, bankruptcy trends and interest rate movements; 

&#8226; The level and direction of historical losses; and 

&#8226; Regulatory changes or new regulatory guidance. 

For more details on how we estimate the allowance for credit losses, refer to "&#8212; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8212; Allowance for Credit Losses on Loan Receivables" and Note 3: Loan Receivables to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

(5) Net change in reserves on PCD pools having no remaining non-accretable difference (prior to adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 on January 1, 2020). 

The allowance for credit losses was $8.2 billion at September 30, 2020. The allowance reflects a $4.8 billion build over the amount of the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2019, and was essentially flat compared to the amount of the allowance for credit losses at June 30, 2020. The allowance build across all loan products was due to (I) a $2.5 billion cumulative-effect adjustment for the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, and (II) a $2.3 billion build during the period that primarily reflects an economic outlook with updated assumptions about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In estimating the allowance at September 30, 2020, we used a macroeconomic forecast that projected slight improvement from prior quarter, including a peak unemployment rate of 11%, which remained flat through the end of 2020 and recovers slowly over the next few years. We also considered the uncertainties associated with some of the assumptions used in that macroeconomic forecast, including the amount and timing of additional government stimulus. Furthermore, the estimate contemplated the impact of previous government stimulus programs and other company-initiated loan modification programs on borrower payment trends. The impact of COVID-19 on the economy has continued to cause uncertainty in assumptions surrounding factors such as length and depth of economic stresses and longer term impacts on borrower behavior, which has required significant management judgment in estimating the allowance for credit losses. 

The forecast period management deemed to be reasonable and supportable was 18 months for all periods since the adoption of CECL except for the estimate as of March 31, 2020. The decrease to 12 months as of March 31, 2020, was due to the uncertainty caused by the rapidly changing economic environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The return to an 18-month reasonable and supportable forecast period was based on the view that the present macroeconomic conditions will last for a longer period than previously expected. The reversion period was 12 months for all quarters since the adoption of CECL. During the first quarter of 2020, a straight-line method was used to revert to appropriate historical information. In the second quarter of 2020, the high degree of economic stress led us to apply a weighted reversion method for credit card 

loans that puts more emphasis on the loss forecast model rather than lower historical losses. For similar reasons, we determined it was appropriate to apply a weighted reversion method for all loans in the third quarter. 

The provision for credit losses is the amount of expense realized after considering the level of net charge-offs in the period and the required amount of allowance for credit losses at the balance sheet date. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, the provision for credit losses decreased by $89 million or 11%, and increased $2.2 billion or 91%, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2019. The allowance build was determined under separate methodologies for each period, based on the timing of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 on January 1, 2020; however, the largest driver of the increase in provision between the two periods was the significant change in economic outlook due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Net Charge-offs 

Our net charge-offs include the principal amount of losses charged off less principal recoveries and exclude charged-off and recovered interest and fees and fraud losses. Charged-off and recovered interest and fees are recorded in interest income and loan fee income, respectively, which is effectively a reclassification of the provision for credit losses, while fraud losses are recorded in other expense. 

The following table presents amounts and rates of net charge-offs of key loan products (dollars in millions): &#160; For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30, &#160; 2020 2019 2020 2019 &#160; $ % $ % $ % $ % Credit card loans $ 604 3.45 % $ 611 3.32 % $ 1,975 3.67 % $ 1,850 3.43 %

(1) Prior to adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, net charge-offs on PCD loans generally did not result in a charge to earnings. 

The net charge-off rate on our credit card loans increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, when compared to the same periods in 2019 due to lower receivable balances and seasoning of recent years' loan growth, respectively. The net charge-off rate on our private student loans was essentially flat for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, when compared to the same periods in 2019. The net charge-off rate on our personal loans decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, when compared to the same periods in 2019 due to improved underwriting. 

Delinquencies 

Delinquencies are an indicator of credit quality at a point in time. A loan balance is considered delinquent when contractual payments on the loan become 30 days past due. 

The following table presents the amounts and delinquency rates of key loan products that are 30 and 90 days or more delinquent, loans that are not accruing interest regardless of delinquency and loans restructured in TDR programs (dollars in millions): &#160; September 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 &#160; $ % $ % Loans 30 or more days delinquent Credit card loans $ 1,328 1.91 % $ 2,019 2.62 %

(1) Includes PCD loans for all periods presented. 

(2) We estimate that interest income recognized on credit card loans restructured in TDR programs was $50 million and $82 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $181 million and $152 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We do not separately track interest income on loans in TDR programs. This amount was estimated by applying an average interest rate to the average loans in the various TDR programs. 

(3) We estimate that the gross interest income that would have been recorded in accordance with the original terms of credit card loans restructured in TDR programs was $43 million and $50 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $144 million and $95 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We do not separately track the amount of additional gross interest income that would have been recorded if the loans in TDR programs had not been restructured and interest had instead been recorded in accordance with the original terms. This amount was estimated by applying the difference between the average interest rate earned on non-modified loans and the average interest rate earned on loans in the TDR programs to the average loans in the TDR programs. 

(4) Credit card loans restructured in TDR programs include $88 million and $184 million at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, which are also included in loans 90 or more days delinquent. 

(5) Private student loans restructured in TDR programs include $5 million and $10 million at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, which are also included in loans 90 or more days delinquent. 

(6) Personal loans restructured in TDR programs include $6 million and $7 million at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, which are also included in loans 90 or more days delinquent. 

The 30-day as well as 90-day delinquency rates for credit card loans at September 30, 2020, decreased compared to December 31, 2019, primarily due to the impact of changing consumer spending and savings patterns and the Skip-a-Pay (payment deferral) relief programs. The 30-day and 90-day delinquency rates for private student loans at September 30, 2020, decreased compared to December 31, 2019, primarily due to seasonality of the loan portfolio. The 30-day and 90-day delinquency rates for personal loans at September 30, 2020, decreased compared to December 31, 2019, as a result of improved underwriting. 

The balance of credit card loans reported as TDRs decreased at September 30, 2020, as compared to December 31, 2019, primarily due to customer usage in programs subject to TDR exclusion in accordance with the CARES Act as well as the exclusion of customer accounts that had previously been classified as TDR for which the account has been returned to a market interest rate and the customer has demonstrated financial stability. The balance of personal loans reported as TDRs at September 30, 2020, as compared to December 31, 2019, was essentially flat. The balance of private student reported as TDRs increased at September 30, 2020, as compared to December 31, 2019, due to continued loan growth and improved awareness of programs available to assist borrowers having difficulties making payment obligations. We plan to continue to 

use TDR programs as we believe they are useful in assisting customers experiencing financial difficulties and allowing them to make timely payments. See Note 3: Loan Receivables to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further description of our use of TDR programs to provide relief to customers experiencing financial hardship.

Other Income 

The following table presents the components of other income (dollars in millions): &#160; For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2020 vs 2019 (Decrease) Increase For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 vs. 2019 (Decrease) Increase 2020 2019 $ % 2020 2019 $ % Discount and interchange revenue, net (1)

(1) Net of rewards, including Cashback Bonus rewards, of $514 million and $520 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $1.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. 

Total other income decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same periods in 2019, primarily due to a decrease in discount and interchange revenue and loan fee income. The decrease in total other income was partially offset by an increase in gain on equity investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The decrease in discount and interchange revenue was partially offset by a decrease in rewards costs, both of which were the result of lower sales volume due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Loan fee income decreased due to lower volume and late fees. Late fees decreased as a result of lower delinquencies as we continue to work with our customers through the economic stresses from COVID-19. Gain on equity investments increased primarily from sales of investments during the first and second quarters. 

Other Expense 

The following table represents the components of other expense (dollars in millions): &#160; For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2020 vs. 2019 Increase (Decrease) For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 vs. 2019 Increase (Decrease) &#160; 2020 2019 $ % 2020 2019 $ % Employee compensation and benefits $ 471 $ 439 $ 32 7 % $ 1,390 $ 1,291 $ 99 8 % Marketing and business development 140 230 (90) (39) % 500 649 (149) (23) % Information processing and communications 111 96 15 16 % 342 296 46 16 % Professional fees 151 189 (38) (20) % 525 539 (14) (3) % Premises and equipment 26 26 &#8212; &#8212; % 83 80 3 4 % Other expense 106 127 (21) (17) % 401 354 47 13 % Total other expense $ 1,005 $ 1,107 $ (102) (9) % $ 3,241 $ 3,209 $ 32 1 % 

Total other expense decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by marketing and business development and professional fees. Marketing and business development decreased due to COVID-19 related expense reductions in brand advertising for card. Professional fees were lower primarily driven by a decrease in collection fees. This was offset by an increase in employee compensation and benefits due to higher average salaries. 

Total other expense increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The increase was primarily driven by employee compensation and benefits, a COVID-19 related non-cash impairment charge (included in Other expense) on the Diners Club business in the second quarter, and information processing and communications. Employee compensation and benefits increased as a result of a larger headcount base and higher average salaries. The impairment charge was triggered by changes in the international travel and entertainment businesses and a declining revenue outlook for the foreseeable future resulting from COVID-19. The increase in information processing and communications was due to investments in infrastructure. This was offset by a decrease in marketing costs due to COVID-19 related expense reductions in brand advertising for card. 

Income Tax Expense 

The following table presents the calculation of the effective income tax rate (dollars in millions, except effective income tax rate): &#160; For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30, &#160; 2020 2019 2020 2019 Income before income taxes $ 959 $ 994 $ 420 $ 2,911 Income tax expense $ 188 $ 224 $ 78 $ 662 Effective income tax rate 19.6 % 22.5 % 18.6 % 22.7 % 

Income tax expense decreased $36 million and $584 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2019. Income tax expense and the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, are lower due to lower projected pretax income for the full year. We calculate our provision for income taxes during interim reporting periods by applying an estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full year to pretax income or loss excluding unusual or infrequently occurring discrete items. As we are projecting lower pretax income for the full year, the impact of certain favorable items, such as tax credits, on the effective tax rate is amplified, thereby resulting in a full-year effective tax rate that is lower than the historical annual effective tax rate. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the resolution of certain tax matters. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Impact of COVID-19 on Liquidity and Capital 

We entered the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 with strong capital and liquidity positions sized to allow us to maintain normal operations during extended periods of financial market stress and disruptions to wholesale and retail funding sources. Our reserves of high-quality liquid assets and access to diverse funding channels allowed us to refrain from issuing debt while certain wholesale funding markets experienced disruptions and wider credit spreads, particularly during the second quarter. Moreover, our direct-to-consumer and sweep deposit balances increased substantially during the second and third quarters as investors sought safe-haven assets. Consequently, our store of cash and other liquid assets has increased materially since the onset of the pandemic, thus curtailing our need for wholesale funding. We plan to maintain a prudent liquid asset buffer, particularly so long as heightened uncertainty around the macroeconomic and financial operating environment persists. 

We remain well-capitalized with capital ratios in excess of regulatory minimums and took prudent actions to preserve and augment our capital when the macroeconomic and operating environment turned uncertain. Of note, we suspended our plans to purchase shares of our common stock, took actions to reduce our exposures to higher-risk segments of our credit portfolio and issued preferred stock during the second quarter. We have completed numerous stress tests to assess the impact of a severe economic downturn on our capital and liquidity and maintain ample amounts of both to ensure we remain well-capitalized and funded while continuing to serve our customers and extend special accommodations to those who need it. 

Funding and Liquidity 

We seek to maintain stable, diversified and cost-effective funding sources and a strong liquidity profile in order to fund our business and repay or refinance our maturing obligations under both normal operating conditions and periods of economic or financial stress. In managing our liquidity risk, we seek to maintain a prudent liability maturity profile and ready access to an ample store of primary and contingent liquidity sources. Our primary funding sources include direct-to-consumer and brokered deposits, public term asset-backed securitizations and other short-term and long-term borrowings. Our primary liquidity sources include a liquidity portfolio comprised of highly liquid, unencumbered assets, including cash and cash 

equivalents, short term investments and investment securities and borrowing capacity through private term asset-backed securitizations. In addition, we have unused borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve discount window, which provides another source of contingent liquidity. 

During September 2020, in an initiative for one of Discover Bank's lending businesses, we entered into a short-term securities lending transaction with a counterparty. As part of the transaction, we lent $11.4 billion of U.S. Treasury bills and securities to the counterparty and received agency pass-through residential mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;RMBS&#8221;) as collateral from the borrower. See Note 2: Investments to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the securities lending transaction. 

Funding Sources 

Deposits 

We offer deposit products to customers through two channels: (i) through direct marketing, internet origination and affinity relationships ("direct-to-consumer deposits"); and (ii) indirectly through contractual arrangements with securities brokerage firms ("brokered deposits"). Direct-to-consumer deposits include online savings accounts, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, IRA certificates of deposit and checking accounts, while brokered deposits include certificates of deposit and sweep accounts. At September 30, 2020, we had $62.9 billion of direct-to-consumer deposits and $15.1 billion of brokered and other deposits. 

Credit Card Securitization Financing 

We securitize credit card receivables as a source of funding. We access the asset-backed securitization market using the Discover Card Master Trust I ("DCMT") and the Discover Card Execution Note Trust ("DCENT"), through which we issue DCENT DiscoverSeries notes in both public and private transactions. From time to time, we may add credit card receivables to these trusts to create sufficient funding capacity for future securitizations while managing seller's interest. We retain significant exposure to the performance of trust assets through holdings of the seller's interest and subordinated security classes of DCENT. At September 30, 2020, we had $11.2 billion of outstanding public asset-backed securities and $4.2 billion of outstanding subordinated asset-backed securities that had been issued to our wholly-owned subsidiaries. 

The securitization structures include certain features designed to protect investors. The primary feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements, the insufficiency of which triggers early repayment of the securities. We refer to this as "economic early amortization," which is based on excess spread levels. Excess spread is the amount by which income received by a trust during a collection period, including interest collections, fees and interchange, exceeds the fees and expenses of the trust during such collection period, including interest expense, servicing fees and charged-off receivables. In the event of an economic early amortization, which would occur if the excess spread fell below 0% on a three-month rolling average basis, we would be required to repay the affected outstanding securitized borrowings using available collections received by the trust. For the three months ended September 30, 2020, the DiscoverSeries three-month rolling average excess spread was 12.99%. The period of ultimate repayment would be determined by the amount and timing of collections received. 

Through our wholly-owned indirect subsidiary, Discover Funding LLC, we are required to maintain a contractual minimum level of receivables in the trust in excess of the face value of outstanding investors' interests. This excess is referred to as the minimum seller's interest. The required minimum seller's interest in the pool of trust receivables, which is included in credit card loan receivables restricted for securitization investors, is set at approximately 7% in excess of the total investors' interests (which includes interests held by third parties as well as those interests held by us). If the level of receivables in the trust were to fall below the required minimum, we would be required to add receivables from the unrestricted pool of receivables, which would increase the amount of credit card loan receivables restricted for securitization investors. A decline in the amount of the excess seller's interest could occur if balance repayments and charge-offs exceeded new lending on the securitized accounts or as a result of changes in total outstanding investors' interests. Seller's interest is impacted by seasonality as higher balance repayments tend to occur in the first calendar year quarter. If we could not add enough receivables to satisfy the minimum seller's interest requirement, an early amortization (or repayment) of investors' interests would be triggered. 

An early amortization event would impair our liquidity and may require us to utilize our available non-securitization related contingent liquidity or rely on alternative funding sources, which may or may not be available at the time. We have several strategies we can deploy to prevent an early amortization event. For instance, we could add additional receivables to the trust, which would reduce our available borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve discount window. As of September 30, 

2020, there were $27.0 billion of credit card receivables in the trust and no accounts were added to those restricted for securitization investors for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020. Alternatively, we could employ structured discounting, which was used effectively in 2009 to bolster excess spread and mitigate early amortization risk. 

The following table summarizes expected contractual maturities of the investors' interests in credit card securitizations, excluding those that have been issued to our wholly-owned subsidiaries (dollars in millions): At September 30, 2020 Total Less Than One Year One Year Through Three Years Four Years Through Five Years After Five Years Scheduled maturities of long-term borrowings - owed to credit card securitization investors $ 11,289 $ 4,017 $ 5,933 $ 1,339 $ &#8212; 

The triple-A rating of DCENT Class A Notes issued to date has been based, in part, on an FDIC rule which created a safe harbor that provides that the FDIC, as conservator or receiver, will not use its power to disaffirm or repudiate contracts, seek to reclaim or recover assets transferred in connection with a securitization, or recharacterize them as assets of the insured depository institution, provided such transfer satisfies the conditions for sale accounting treatment under previous GAAP. Although the implementation of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing , no longer qualified certain transfers of assets for sale accounting treatment, the FDIC approved a final rule that preserved the safe-harbor treatment applicable to revolving trusts and master trusts, including DCMT, so long as those trusts would have satisfied the original FDIC safe harbor if evaluated under GAAP pertaining to transfers of financial assets in effect prior to December 2009. Other legislative and regulatory developments may, however, impact our ability or desire to issue asset-backed securities in the future. 

Other Long-Term Borrowings&#8212;Student Loans 

At September 30, 2020, $136 million of remaining principal balance was outstanding on securitized debt assumed as part of our acquisition of The Student Loan Corporation. Principal and interest payments on the underlying student loans will reduce the balance of these secured borrowings over time. 

Other Long-Term Borrowings&#8212;Corporate and Bank Debt 

The following table provides a summary of Discover Financial Services (Parent Company) and Discover Bank outstanding fixed-rate debt (dollars in millions): At September 30, 2020 Principal Amount Outstanding Discover Financial Services (Parent Company) fixed-rate senior notes, maturing 2022-2027 $ 3,422 Discover Financial Services (Parent Company) fixed-rate retail notes, maturing 2021-2031 $ 341 Discover Bank fixed-rate senior bank notes, maturing 2021-2030 $ 6,100 Discover Bank fixed-rate subordinated bank notes, maturing 2028 $ 500 

Certain Discover Financial Services senior notes require us to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of their aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest in the event of a change of control involving us and a corresponding ratings downgrade to below investment grade. 

Short-Term Borrowings 

As part of our regular funding strategy, we may from time to time borrow short-term funds in the federal funds market or the repurchase ("Repo") market through repurchase agreements. Federal funds are short-term, unsecured loans between banks or other financial entities with a Federal Reserve account. Funds borrowed in the repo market are short-term, collateralized loans, usually secured with highly-rated investment securities such as U.S. Treasury bills or notes, or federal agency mortgage bonds or debentures. At September 30, 2020, there were no outstanding balances in the federal funds market or repurchase agreements. 

As noted above, during September 2020, we entered into a short-term securities lending transaction. As part of the transaction, we lent $11.4 billion of U.S. Treasury bills and securities to the counterparty and received agency pass-through RMBS as collateral from the borrower. To reflect the obligation to return the RMBS collateral, we recognized $10.7 billion in 

short-term borrowings, which are recorded within the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition as of September 30, 2020. We will release the RMBS when the securities lending transaction matures in November 2020. See Note 2: Investments to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the securities lending transaction. 

Additional Funding Sources 

Private Asset-Backed Securitizations 

We have access to committed borrowing capacity through privately placed asset-backed securitizations. At September 30, 2020, we had total committed capacity of $6.0 billion, none of which was drawn. While we may utilize funding from these private securitizations from time to time for normal business operations, their committed nature also makes them a reliable contingency funding source. Therefore, we reserve some undrawn capacity, informed by our liquidity stress test results, for potential contingency funding needs. We also seek to ensure the stability and reliability of these securitizations by staggering their maturity dates, renewing them approximately one year prior to their scheduled maturity dates and periodically drawing them for operational testing purposes and seasonal funding needs. 

Federal Reserve 

Discover Bank has access to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's discount window. As of September 30, 2020, Discover Bank had $32.6 billion of available borrowing capacity through the discount window based on the amount and type of assets pledged, primarily consumer loans. We have no borrowings outstanding under the discount window and reserve this capacity as a source of contingent liquidity. 

Funding Uses 

Our primary uses of funds include the extensions of loans and credit, primarily through Discover Bank; the purchase of investments for our liquidity portfolio; working capital; and debt and capital service. We assess funding uses and liquidity needs under stressed and normal operating conditions, considering primary uses of funding, such as on-balance sheet loans, and contingent uses of funding, such as the need to post additional collateral for derivatives positions. In order to anticipate funding needs under stress, we conduct liquidity stress tests to assess the impact of idiosyncratic, systemic and hybrid (idiosyncratic and systemic) scenarios with varying levels of liquidity risk reflecting a range of stress severity. 

Credit Ratings 

Our borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets, including those for securitizations and unsecured senior and subordinated debt, may be affected by the credit ratings of DFS, Discover Bank and the securitization trusts. Downgrades in these credit ratings could result in higher interest expense on our unsecured debt and asset securitizations, as well as higher collateral enhancement requirements for both our public and private asset securitizations. In addition to increased funding costs, deterioration in credit ratings could reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets. 

We also maintain agreements with certain of our derivative counterparties that contain provisions that require DFS and Discover Bank to maintain an investment grade credit rating from specified major credit rating agencies. At September 30, 2020, Discover Bank's credit rating met specified thresholds set by its counterparties. However, if its credit rating was to fall below investment grade, Discover Bank would be required to post additional collateral, which, as of September 30, 2020, would have been $9 million. DFS (Parent Company) had no outstanding derivatives as of September 30, 2020, and therefore, no collateral was required. 

The table below reflects our current credit ratings and outlooks. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, rating agencies have cited their expectation that the banking industry will experience heightened loan delinquencies and charge-offs as the labor market weakens. During the second quarter, Moody&#8217;s, Standard and Poor&#8217;s and Fitch Ratings affirmed our credit ratings; Standard and Poor&#8217;s and Fitch changed the outlook on our senior unsecured credit ratings from &#8220;stable&#8221; to &#8220;negative&#8221;, however, while Moody&#8217;s retains a &#8220;stable&#8221; outlook on our ratings. The credit ratings and outlooks on our debt did not change in the third quarter. A rating outlook reflects an agency's opinion regarding the likely rating direction over the medium term&#8212;often a period of about a year&#8212;but also indicates the agency's belief that the issuer's credit profile is consistent with its current rating level at that point in time.

(1) An "sf" in the rating denotes rating agency identification for structured finance product ratings. 

A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 

Liquidity 

We seek to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to sustain business operations, fund asset growth and satisfy debt obligations under stressed and normal operating conditions. In addition to the funding sources discussed in the previous section, we also maintain highly liquid, unencumbered assets in our liquidity portfolio that we expect to be able to convert to cash quickly and with little loss of value using either the repo market or outright sales. 

We maintain a liquidity risk and funding management policy, which outlines the overall framework and general principles we follow in managing liquidity risk across our business. The policy is approved by the Board of Directors with implementation responsibilities delegated to the Asset and Liability Management Committee (the "ALCO"). Additionally, we maintain a liquidity management framework document, which outlines the general strategies, objectives and principles we utilize to manage our liquidity position and the various liquidity risks inherent in our business model. We seek to balance the trade-offs between maintaining too much liquidity, which may be costly, with having too little liquidity, which could cause financial distress. Liquidity risk is centrally managed by the ALCO, which is chaired by our Treasurer and has cross-functional membership. The ALCO monitors the liquidity risk profiles of DFS and Discover Bank and oversees any actions Corporate Treasury may take to ensure that we maintain ready access to our funding sources and sufficient liquidity to meet current and projected needs. In addition, the ALCO and our Board of Directors regularly review our compliance with our liquidity limits at DFS and Discover Bank, which are established in accordance with the liquidity risk appetite set by our Board of Directors. 

We employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity. We utilize early warning indicators ("EWIs") to detect emerging liquidity stress events and a reporting and escalation process that is designed to be consistent with regulatory guidance. The EWIs include both idiosyncratic and systemic measures and are monitored on a daily basis and reported to the ALCO regularly. A warning from one or more of these indicators triggers prompt review and decision-making by our senior management team and, in certain instances, may lead to the convening of a senior-level response team and activation of our contingency funding plan. 

In addition, we conduct liquidity stress tests regularly and ensure contingency funding is in place to address potential liquidity shortfalls. We evaluate a range of stress scenarios that are designed in accordance with regulatory requirements, including idiosyncratic, systemic and a combination of such events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs. These scenarios measure the projected liquidity position at DFS and Discover Bank across a range of time horizons by comparing estimated contingency funding needs to available contingent liquidity. 

Our primary contingent liquidity sources include our liquidity portfolio and private securitizations with unused borrowing capacity. In addition, we have unused borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve discount window, which provides an additional source of contingent liquidity. We seek to maintain sufficient liquidity to be able to satisfy all maturing obligations and fund business operations for at least 12 months in a severe stress environment. In such an environment, we may also take actions to curtail the size of our balance sheet, which would reduce the need for funding and liquidity. 

At September 30, 2020, our liquidity portfolio is comprised of highly liquid, unencumbered assets, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and investment securities. Cash and cash equivalents were primarily in the form of deposits with the Federal Reserve and Treasury bills. Short-term investments were primarily comprised of Treasury bills with contractual maturities greater than 90 days but less than one year at the time of acquisition. Investment securities primarily included debt obligations of the U.S. Treasury and RMBS issued by U.S. government housing agencies or government-sponsored enterprises. These investments are considered highly liquid and we expect to have the ability to raise cash by selling them, utilizing repurchase agreements or pledging certain of these investments to access secured funding. The size and composition of our liquidity portfolio may fluctuate based upon the size of our balance sheet as well as operational requirements, market conditions and interest rate risk management strategies. For instance, our liquidity portfolio has grown materially during this year as our customer deposits increased and our loan balances declined, reflecting consumers&#8217; response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

At September 30, 2020, our liquidity portfolio and undrawn credit facilities were $64.4 billion, which was $8.1 billion higher than the balance at December 31, 2019. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, the average balance of our liquidity portfolio was $27.9 billion and $24.0 billion, respectively.

Capital 

Our primary sources of capital are the earnings generated by our businesses and the proceeds from issuances of capital securities. We seek to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support the growth and risks of our businesses and to meet regulatory requirements, rating agency targets and debt investor expectations. Within these constraints, we are focused on deploying capital in a manner that provides attractive returns to our stockholders. The level, composition and utilization of capital are influenced by changes in the economic environment, strategic initiatives and legislative and regulatory developments. 

Under regulatory capital requirements adopted by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, DFS, along with Discover Bank, must maintain minimum levels of capital. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could limit our business activities and have a direct material effect on our financial position and operating results. We must meet specific capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items, as calculated under regulatory guidance and regulations. Current or future legislative or regulatory reforms, such as the implementation of CECL, may require us to hold more capital or adversely impact our capital level. We consider the potential impacts of these reforms in managing our capital position. 

DFS and Discover Bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements that became effective January 2015 under final rules issued by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC to implement the provisions under the Basel Committee's December 2010 framework ("Basel III rules"). The Basel III rules require DFS and Discover Bank to maintain minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios and define what constitutes capital for purposes of calculating those ratios. Under Basel III rules for regulatory capital, DFS and Discover Bank are classified as "Standardized Approach" entities, defined as U.S. banking organizations with consolidated total assets over $50 billion but not exceeding $250 billion and consolidated total on-balance sheet foreign exposures less than $10 billion. 

As of January 1, 2019, thresholds within the Basel III rules were fully phased in with the exception of certain transition provisions that were frozen pursuant to regulation issued in November 2017. Pursuant to a final rule issued in July 2019, the transition provisions that were previously frozen have been replaced with new permanent thresholds as discussed below. Additionally, on March 27, 2020, federal bank regulatory agencies announced an interim final rule, which has since been adopted as a final rule, that allows banks that have implemented CECL the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. For purposes of calculating regulatory capital, we have elected to defer recognition of the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital for two years in accordance with the final rule; after that period of deferral, the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital will be phased in over a three-year period beginning in 2022. We estimate that electing this option raises our Common Equity Tier 1 ("CET1") capital ratios in 2020. For additional information regarding the risk-based capital and leverage ratios, see Note 12: Capital Adequacy to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

On March 4, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced the SCB final rule, which would impose limitations on our capital distributions if we do not maintain our capital ratios above stated regulatory minimum ratios based on the results of supervisory stress tests. We participated in the CCAR supervisory stress test this year and received our SCB of 3.5%, which primarily reflects the difference between our actual CET1 ratio as of the fourth quarter of 2019 and our projected minimum CET1 ratio based on the Federal Reserve&#8217;s models in its nine-quarter Severely Adverse stress scenario. The SCB became effective October 1, 2020. Under this rule, we will be required to assess if our planned capital actions are consistent with the effective capital distributions limitations that will apply on a pro-forma basis throughout the planning horizon. See "&#8212; Regulatory Environment and Developments &#8212; Banking &#8212; Capital Standards and Stress Testing" for additional information. 

The Basel III rules provide for certain threshold-based deductions from and adjustments to CET1 to the extent that any one such category or all such categories in the aggregate exceed certain percentages of CET1. In July 2019, federal banking regulators issued a final rule that, among other things, revised certain capital requirements for Standardized Approach banks by raising the 10% of CET1 deduction threshold for certain items to 25% and eliminating the 15% combined deduction threshold applying to these items. These changes became effective for all Standardized Approach banking institutions in April 2020. 

Basel III rules also require disclosures relating to market discipline. This series of disclosures is commonly referred to as "Pillar 3." The objective is to increase transparency of capital requirements for banking organizations. We are required to make prescribed regulatory disclosures on a quarterly basis regarding our capital structure, capital adequacy, risk exposures and risk-weighted assets. The Pillar 3 disclosures are made publicly available on our website in a report called "Basel III Regulatory Capital Disclosures." 

At September 30, 2020, DFS and Discover Bank met the requirements for "well-capitalized" status under Regulation Y and the prompt corrective action rules, respectively, exceeding the regulatory minimums to which they were subject under the applicable rules. Additionally, we are subject to regulatory requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve as part of its stress testing framework and CCAR program. Refer to "&#8212; Regulatory Environment and Developments" for more information. 

We disclose tangible common equity, which represents common equity less goodwill and intangibles. Management believes that common stockholders' equity excluding goodwill and intangibles is meaningful to investors as a measure of our true net asset value. As of September 30, 2020, tangible common equity is not formally defined by GAAP or codified in the federal banking regulations and, as such, is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. Other financial services companies may also disclose this measure and definitions may vary, so we advise users of this information to exercise caution in comparing this measure for different companies. 

The following table provides a reconciliation of total common stockholders' equity (a GAAP financial measure) to tangible common equity (dollars in millions): September 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 

Total common stockholders' equity (1) 

$ 9,196 $ 11,296 Less: goodwill (255) (255) Less: intangible assets, net (95) (155) Tangible common equity $ 8,846 $ 10,886 

(1) Total common stockholders' equity is calculated as total stockholders' equity less preferred stock. 

Discover is required to submit a capital plan and submit to supervisory stress tests as part of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s annual CCAR process. On April 6, 2020, we submitted our annual capital plan to the Federal Reserve covering the period July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. On June 25, 2020, we received the stress test results, which are discussed herein. We were also informed that we, along with all other CCAR firms, will be required to submit an additional capital plan by November 2, 2020, to reflect macroeconomic conditions since the COVID-19 outbreak began. 

We recently declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of $0.44 per share, payable on September 3, 2020, to holders of record on August 20, 2020, which is consistent with last quarter. In light of the current economic downturn, the Federal Reserve required all large banks participating in the CCAR supervisory stress test to cap common stock dividends at the lower of the prior quarter's dividend or the average of a firm&#8217;s net income over the preceding four quarters. We also recently declared a semi-annual cash dividend on our preferred stock (Series C) of $2,750 per share, equal to $27.50 per depositary share, payable on October 30, 2020, to holders of record on October 15, 2020, which is consistent with the amount paid in the second quarter of 2020. On June 22, 2020, we issued and sold 500,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/100th ownership interest in a share of 6.125% Fixed-Rate Reset Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series D, $0.01 par value, with a liquidation preference of $100,000 per Share (equivalent to $1,000 per depositary share). 

Our existing share repurchase program, which had $1.2 billion of remaining authorization expired on September 30, 2020. Having suspended share repurchases earlier this year in recognition of the pandemic-induced economic downturn, we repurchased no common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2020, and our Board of Directors has not approved a new share repurchase program. With Board of Directors' approval, we may reinstate our share repurchase program in the future, but the Federal Reserve has required all large banks participating in the CCAR supervisory stress test to suspend share repurchases for the third and fourth quarter. Thereafter, our decision to repurchase additional shares of common stock will depend on our financial results, prevailing and expected economic conditions, potential regulatory limitations and other considerations. Share repurchases under the program may be made through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or other purchases, including block trades, accelerated share repurchase transactions, or any combination of such methods. 

The amount and size of any future dividends and share repurchases will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors, such as the implementation of CECL. The declaration and payment of future dividends, as well as the amount thereof, are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors. Holders of our shares of common stock are subject to the prior dividend rights of holders of our preferred stock or the depositary shares representing such preferred stock outstanding. No dividend may be declared or paid or set aside for payment on our common stock if full dividends have not been declared and paid on all outstanding shares of preferred stock in any dividend period. In addition, as noted above, banking laws and regulations and our banking regulators may limit our ability to pay dividends and make share repurchases, including limitations on the extent to which our banking subsidiaries can provide funds to us through dividends, loans or otherwise. Further, current or future regulatory reforms may require us to hold more capital or adversely impact our capital level. There can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends or repurchase any shares of our common stock in the future. 

Certain Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

Guarantees 

Guarantees are contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require us to make payments to a guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying asset, liability, or equity security of a guaranteed party, rate or index. Also included in guarantees are contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to a guaranteed party based on another 

entity's failure to perform under an agreement. Our guarantees relate to transactions processed on the Discover Network and certain transactions processed by PULSE and Diners Club. See Note 13: Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our guarantees. 

Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments 

In the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Contractual obligations at September 30, 2020, which include deposits, long-term borrowings, operating lease obligations, interest payments on fixed-rate debt, purchase obligations and other liabilities were $103.7 billion. For a description of our contractual obligations, see our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments." 

We extend credit for consumer loans, primarily arising from agreements with customers for unused lines of credit on certain credit cards and certain other loan products, provided there is no violation of conditions established in the related agreement. At September 30, 2020, our unused credit arrangements were approximately $215.0 billion. These arrangements, substantially all of which we can terminate at any time and which do not necessarily represent future cash requirements, are periodically reviewed based on account usage, customer creditworthiness and loan qualification. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we guarantee payment on behalf of subsidiaries relating to contractual obligations with external parties. The activities of the subsidiaries covered by any such guarantees are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements.
