 Item 1A. 

Risk Factors.

In addition to the risk factors relating to M&#38;T as disclosed in response to Item 1A. to Part I of Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, a supplemental risk factor is presented below. 

M&#38;T&#8217;s business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations have been, and will likely continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;) pandemic has caused severe disruption to the U.S. and global economy and created significant volatility in the financial markets. The duration of this disruption and impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

&#160;

The pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions that have adversely affected, and are likely to continue to adversely affect, the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to negatively affect the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations will depend on future developments (including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the continued effectiveness of M&#38;T&#8217;s business continuity plans, the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on the Company&#8217;s employees, customers, clients, counterparties, vendors, service providers and other market participants, and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic ), which are highly uncertain and cannot be reasonably predicted. 

The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to:

&#160;

&#8226; 

Increased unemployment levels, interrupted income of consumers and decreased consumer confidence generally, leading to an increased risk of delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures&#59; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Increased disruption to businesses, permanent or temporary closure of businesses and decreased business confidence generally, leading to increased risk of delinquencies, defaults and bankruptcies&#59; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

A sudden and significant reduction in the valuation of the equity, fixed-income and commodity markets and the significant increase in the volatility of those markets&#59; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

A decrease in the rates and yields on U.S. Treasury securities, which has negatively impacted the Company&#8217;s net interest income and margin&#59;

&#160;

&#8226; 

Declines in collateral values&#59; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Increased demands on capital and liquidity, leading M&#38;T to cease repurchases of its common stock for the time being&#59; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

A reduction in the value of the assets that the Company manages or otherwise administers or services for customers, affecting related fee income and demand for the Company&#8217;s services&#59; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Heightened cybersecurity, information security and operational risks to the Company, including as a result of work-from-home arrangements&#59;

&#160;

&#8226; 

Disruptions to the business operations of the Company, including disruptions to branch and office openings, supply chains and employee travel and working arrangements&#59; and 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Disruptions to business operations at counterparties, vendors and other service providers. 

&#160;

The pandemic is likely to continue to contribute to these risks and impacts. As a result, the Company&#8217;s credit, operational and other risks are generally expected to increase until the pandemic subsides. In addition, the Company&#8217;s business operations continue to be at risk of adverse disruption if significant portions of the Company&#8217;s workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, failures in systems or technology that disrupt work-from-home arrangements or other effects of the pandemic, or if the Company is unable to keep branches or offices open, including because of risk of infection. 

&#160;

Governmental authorities have taken unprecedented measures to provide economic assistance to individual households and businesses, stabilize the markets and support economic growth. The success of these measures is not yet entirely known and those measures may not be sufficient to fully mitigate the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, some measures, such as a suspension of mortgage and other loan payments and foreclosures, may have a negative impact on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations. If such measures are not effective in mitigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company&#8217;s borrowers, the Company may also experience higher rates of default and increased credit losses in future periods. The Company also faces an increased risk of litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on market and economic conditions and actions governmental authorities take in response to those conditions. Furthermore, various government programs such as the Paycheck Protection Program are complex and the Company&#8217;s participation may lead to litigation and governmental, regulatory and third party scrutiny, negative publicity and damage to its reputation. 

&#160;

The length of the pandemic and the efficacy of the extraordinary measures being put in place to address it are unknown. It is unknown when there will be a return to normal business activity and a subsiding of the economic

&#160;

stress associated with the pandemic. Prolonged continuation of the pandemic could worsen these risks and impacts. Until the pandemic subsides, the Company expects continued draws on lines of credit, reduced revenues in many of its fee-related businesses and increased customer and client defaults, including defaults in unsecured loans. Even after the pandemic subsides, the U.S. economy may experience a prolonged economic slowdown or recession, and M&#38;T anticipates the Company&#8217;s businesses would be materially and adversely affected by a prolonged economic slowdown or recession. To the extent the pandemic adversely affects the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, liquidity, capital or results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the section entitled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in M&#38;T&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 and M&#38;T&#8217;s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
