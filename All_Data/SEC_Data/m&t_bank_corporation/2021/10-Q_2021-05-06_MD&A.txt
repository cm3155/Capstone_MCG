 Item 2. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Overview

Net income for M&#38;T Bank Corporation (&#8220;M&#38;T&#8221;) in the first quarter of 2021 was $447 million, compared with $269 million in the corresponding quarter of 2020 and $471 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Diluted and basic earnings per common share were $3.33 in the recent quarter, $1.93 in the first quarter of 2020 and $3.52 in the fourth quarter of 2020. The after-tax impact of merger-related expenses was $8 million ($10 million pre-tax), or $.06 of basic and diluted earnings per common share in the recent quarter. Such expenses were associated with M&#38;T&#8217;s pending acquisition of People&#8217;s United Financial, Inc. (&#8220;People&#8217;s United&#8221;), headquartered in Bridgeport, Connecticut. There were no merger-related expenses in the first or fourth quarters of 2020. 

The annualized rate of return on average total assets for M&#38;T and its consolidated subsidiaries (&#8220;the Company&#8221;) in 2021&#8217;s first quarter was 1.22%, compared with .90% in the year-earlier quarter and 1.30% in the fourth quarter of 2020. The annualized rate of return on average common shareholders&#8217; equity was 11.57% in the recent quarter, 7.00% in the first quarter of 2020 and 12.07% in the fourth 2020 quarter. 

On February 22, 2021, M&#38;T announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement with People&#8217;s United under which People&#8217;s United will be acquired by M&#38;T in an all-stock transaction. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, People&#8217;s United shareholders will receive consideration valued at .118 of an M&#38;T share in the form of M&#38;T common stock. People&#8217;s United outstanding preferred stock will be converted to a new series of M&#38;T preferred stock upon completion of the acquisition. The transaction is valued at approximately $7.7 billion (with the price based on M&#38;T&#8217;s closing price of $151.61 per share as of March 31, 2021).

As of March 31, 2021, People&#8217;s United reported $64.2 billion of assets, including $42.8 billion of loans and $10.4 billion of investment securities, $56.6 billion of liabilities, including $53.5 billion of deposits, and $7.6 billion of stockholders&#8217; equity. The merger is subject to a number of conditions, including regulatory approvals and approval by common shareholders of M&#38;T and People&#8217;s United, and is expected to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2021.

Financial results since the first quarter of 2020 were adversely impacted by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;) pandemic. Large portions of the U.S. economy were substantially curtailed for extended periods of time and, as a result, many commercial and consumer customers were adversely impacted. Specifically, those adverse economic impacts resulted in the Company recognizing elevated levels of provisions for credit losses during 2020 that reflected projections of credit losses based on macroeconomic forecasts at the end of each quarter of that year. The Company recorded provisions for credit losses of $250 million in the first 2020 quarter and $75 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. An improvement in economic conditions and forecasts at March 31, 2021 as compared with previous forecasts led the Company to recognize a provision recapture of $25 million in the first quarter of 2021. In response to the pandemic, the Federal Reserve took actions to lower interest rates that have negatively affected the Company&#8217;s net interest income since the beginning of the pandemic. Taxable-equivalent net interest income totaled $985 million in the recent quarter and $982 million and $993 million in the first and fourth quarters of 2020, respectively. 

On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (&#8220;CARES Act&#8221;) was signed into law. The CARES Act and applicable extensions provide relief to borrowers, including the opportunity to defer loan payments while not negatively affecting their credit standing, and also provide funding opportunities for small businesses under the Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;) from approved Small Business Administration (&#8220;SBA&#8221;) lenders, including M&#38;T Bank, the principal bank subsidiary of M&#38;T. For commercial and consumer customers, the Company has provided a host of relief options, including payment deferrals (including maturity extensions), loan covenant waivers and low interest rate loan products. M&#38;T Bank funded approximately $7.0 billion of PPP loans during 2020 and another $2.5 billion during the first quarter of 2021. PPP loans outstanding at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 totaled $6.2 billion and $5.4 billion, respectively.

Updated economic forecasts at the end of each of the quarters of 2020 resulted in higher estimates of expected credit losses in the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio than at January 1, 2020, when the Company adopted amended 

- 47 -

&#160;

accounting guidance for the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments, resulting in historically high levels of the provision for credit losses. Specifically, the level of the provision in 2020 reflected the ongoing impacts of the pandemic on economic activity in the hospitality and retail sectors, the uncertainty at December 31, 2020 as to the sufficiency and effectiveness of economic stimulus provided by the U.S. government to the economy, and concerns about ultimate collectability of real estate loans where borrowers requested re-payment forbearance. Improvement in the economic outlook at March 31, 2021 resulted in reduced estimates of expected credit losses. However, the Company expects that it will continue to be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic after March 31, 2021. 

The national effort to mitigate the pandemic has resulted in a challenging environment for businesses and their employees. The Company has taken actions designed to help provide a safe environment for its customers and employees and to provide relief to customers in a variety of ways. Examples of those actions include:

&#160;

&#8226; 

The deployment of a Pandemic Response Plan to manage the pandemic&#8217;s effects on operations, employees and customers, including seeking to ensure employee safety, maintaining continuity of operations and service levels for customers, preserving the Company&#8217;s financial strength, and complying with applicable laws and regulations. Actions have included placing restrictions on travel, implementing social distancing, health screening, sanitation and other protocols, and mandating for all employees whose jobs can be performed remotely to work from home where possible. The Company continues to assess the appropriateness of employees returning to the office while seeking to ensure a safe work environment&#59; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Nearly all M&#38;T Bank branches remain open, with open lobbies and normal access to drive-through windows and ATMs&#59; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

The vast majority of the Company&#8217;s non-branch employees continue to work remotely&#59; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Many loan customers are still receiving COVID-19 related relief in various forms, including modification and forbearance requests as of March 31, 2021 as described herein and in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements. 

Supplemental Reporting of Non-GAAP Results of Operations

M&#38;T consistently provides supplemental reporting of its results on a &#8220;net operating&#8221; or &#8220;tangible&#8221; basis, from which M&#38;T excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts) and gains (when realized) and expenses (when incurred) associated with merging acquired operations into the Company, since such items are considered by management to be &#8220;nonoperating&#8221; in nature. Although &#8220;net operating income&#8221; as defined by M&#38;T is not a GAAP measure, M&#38;T&#8217;s management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results.

Net operating income totaled $457 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared with $272 million in the year-earlier quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per common share in the first quarters of 2021 and 2020 were $3.41 and $1.95, respectively. Net operating income and diluted net operating earnings per common share were $473 million and $3.54, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2020. 

Net operating income in the recent quarter expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets was 1.29%, compared with .94% in the first quarter of 2020 and 1.35% in the 2020&#8217;s fourth quarter. Net operating income represented an annualized return on average tangible common equity of 17.05% in the first quarter of 2021, 10.39% in the year-earlier quarter and 17.53% in the fourth quarter of 2020. 

Reconciliations of GAAP amounts with corresponding non-GAAP amounts are provided in table 2.

Taxable-equivalent Net Interest Income

Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $985 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared with $982 million in the first quarter of 2020. That modest increase resulted from the impact of a $26.1 billion or 24% increase in average earning assets that was substantially offset by a 68 basis point (hundredths of one percent) narrowing of the net interest margin, or taxable-equivalent net interest income expressed as an annualized percentage of average earning assets, to 2.97% in the recent quarter from 3.65% in the year-earlier quarter. The higher average earning assets 

- 48 -

&#160;

reflected growth in deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and loans, partially offset by a decline in average investment securities balances. The narrowing of the net interest margin was largely the result of declines in rates earned on loans and deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, reflecting the lower interest rate environment due to actions initiated by the Federal Reserve to decrease its target Federal funds rate twice in March of 2020 (first by .50%, than another by 1.0%). Taxable-equivalent net interest income in the recent quarter declined $8 million from the fourth quarter of 2020 reflecting the fewer number of days in the first quarter of 2021. A three basis point narrowing of the net interest margin in the recent quarter from 3.00% in the prior quarter largely attributable to higher balances held in low yielding accounts at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was predominantly offset by a $2.4 billion or 2% rise in average earning assets. 

Average loans and leases totaled $99.4 billion in the first quarter of 2021, up $7.7 billion or 8% from $91.7 billion in the similar quarter of 2020. Commercial loans and leases averaged $27.7 billion in the first quarter of 2021, $3.4 billion or 14% higher than in the year-earlier quarter. That increase was the result of average outstanding PPP loans of $5.7 billion in the recent quarter that were predominantly funded in the second quarter of 2020 and in the first quarter of 2021. Average commercial real estate loans were $37.6 billion in the recent quarter, up $1.6 billion, or 4%, from $36.0 billion in the corresponding 2020 quarter. Included in average commercial real estate loans in the first quarters of 2021 and 2020 were loans held for sale of $258 million and $185 million, respectively. Reflecting purchases of government-guaranteed loans from Ginnie Mae pools that were serviced by the Company, average residential real estate loans rose $1.5 billion or 9% to $17.4 billion in the first quarter of 2021 from $15.9 billion in the year-earlier quarter. The loans purchased from Ginnie Mae pools averaged $3.8 billion in the recent quarter, compared with $800 million in the year-earlier quarter. Loans are purchased to reduce associated servicing costs, namely a requirement to advance principal and interest payments that had not been received from individual mortgagors, including payments deferred under COVID-19 forbearance arrangements. Loans purchased from Ginnie Mae pools totaled $1.3 billion in the recent quarter and $2.5 billion in the last three quarters of 2020. Also included in average residential real estate loans were loans held for sale of $663 million in the recent quarter and $409 million in the first quarter of 2020. Consumer loans averaged $16.6 billion in the first quarter of 2021, up $1.2 billion, or 8%, from $15.5 billion in the year-earlier quarter, due to growth in average recreational finance loans (consisting predominantly of loans secured by recreational vehicles and boats) and, to a lesser extent, automobile loans that was partially offset by declines in outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit.

Average loan and lease balances in the first quarter of 2021 increased $690 million from $98.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. Commercial loan and lease average balances in the recent quarter were little changed from the fourth quarter of 2020, as higher loans to motor vehicle and recreational finance dealers were offset by lower average PPP loans. Average commercial real estate loans in the first quarter of 2021 declined $98 million from $37.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. Commercial real estate loans held for sale averaged $307 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Average balances of residential real estate loans in the recently completed quarter rose $643 million, or 4%, from $16.8 billion in 2020&#8217;s fourth quarter, predominantly reflecting a higher level of repurchases of government-guaranteed loans. Purchased government-guaranteed loans averaged $2.6 billion in 2020&#8217;s fourth quarter. Residential real estate loans held for sale averaged $645 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Average consumer loans in the recent quarter increased $136 million, or 1%, from $16.5 billion in 2020&#8217;s fourth quarter, reflecting growth in recreational finance and automobile loans. The accompanying table summarizes quarterly changes in the major components of the loan and lease portfolio.

The investment securities portfolio averaged $6.6 billion in the first quarter of 2021, down $2.5 billion, or 27%, from $9.1 billion in the year-earlier quarter and $590 million lower than the $7.2 billion averaged in the fourth quarter of 2020. The lower average balance in the recent quarter as compared with the first and fourth quarters of 2020 predominantly reflects pay downs of mortgage-backed securities. The Company purchased $200 million of fixed rate residential mortgage-backed securities in March 2021. There were no other significant purchases and there were no significant sales of investment securities during three-month periods ended March 31, 2021, March 31, 2020 or December 31, 2020. The Company routinely has increases and decreases in its holdings of capital stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) of New York and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Those holdings are accounted for at cost and are adjusted based on amounts of outstanding borrowings and available lines of credit with those entities.

The investment securities portfolio is largely comprised of residential mortgage-backed securities and shorter-term U.S. Treasury and federal agency notes. When purchasing investment securities, the Company considers its liquidity position and its overall interest-rate risk profile as well as the adequacy of expected returns relative to risks assumed, including prepayments. The Company may occasionally sell investment securities as a result of changes in interest rates and spreads, actual or anticipated prepayments, credit risk associated with a particular security, or as a result of restructuring its investment securities portfolio in connection with a business combination. The amounts of investment securities held by the Company are influenced by such factors as available yield in comparison with alternative investments, demand for loans, which generally yield more than investment securities, ongoing repayments, the levels of deposits, and management of liquidity and balance sheet size and resulting capital ratios. 

Fair value changes in equity securities with readily determinable fair values are recognized in the consolidated statement of income. Net unrealized losses on such equity securities were $12 million and $21 million in the first quarters of 2021 and 2020, respectively, compared with net unrealized gains of $2 million in the final quarter of 2020. Those gains and losses were predominantly related to the Company&#8217;s holdings of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred stock. 

The Company regularly reviews its debt investment securities for declines in value below amortized cost that might be indicative of credit-related losses. In light of such reviews, there were no credit-related losses on debt investment securities recognized in either of the first quarters of 2021 or 2020 or in the final 2020 quarter. Based on management&#8217;s assessment of future cash flows associated with individual investment securities as of March 31, 2021, the Company did not expect to incur any material credit-related losses in its portfolios of debt investment securities. Additional information about the investment securities portfolio is included in notes 3 and 12 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Other earning assets include interest-bearing deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and other banks, trading account assets, federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities. Those other earning assets in the aggregate averaged $28.4 billion in the recently completed quarter, compared with $7.4 billion in the first quarter of 2020 and $26.1 billion in the final quarter of 2020. Interest-bearing deposits at banks averaged $27.7 billion, $6.1 billion and $22.2 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2021, March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The amounts of interest-bearing deposits at banks at the respective dates were predominantly comprised of deposits held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The levels of those deposits often fluctuate due to changes in trust-related deposits of commercial entities, purchases or maturities of investment securities, or borrowings to manage the Company&#8217;s liquidity. The higher balances in the two most recent quarters compared with the year-earlier period reflect increased commercial and consumer deposit balances. Agreements to resell securities averaged $678 million, $1.2 billion and $3.8 billion for the quarters ended March 31, 2021, March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

As a result of the changes described herein, average earning assets totaled $134.4 billion in the most recent quarter, compared with $108.2 billion and $131.9 billion in the first and fourth quarters of 2020, respectively. 

The most significant source of funding for the Company is core deposits. The Company considers noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits and time deposits of $250,000 or less as core deposits. The Company&#8217;s branch network is its principal source of core deposits, which generally carry lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities. Average core deposits totaled $120.2 billion in the first quarter of 2021, up 32% from $90.9 billion in the similar 2020 quarter. The increase in average core deposits in the recent quarter as compared with the first quarter of 2020 reflected higher balances of noninterest-bearing deposits and savings and interest-checking deposits. Average balances of savings and interest-checking core deposits rose $12.4 billion or 23% to $66.0 billion in the first 2021 quarter from $53.6 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $18.4 billion or 57% to $50.9 billion in the recent quarter from $32.5 billion in the first 2020 quarter. Those increases were largely due to higher average deposits of commercial customers, but also reflect higher levels of consumer deposits and deposits associated with residential mortgage servicing activities. Average core deposits were $115.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. Average savings and interest-checking core deposits increased $1.4 billion or 2% in the first 2021 quarter from $64.7 billion in the immediately preceding quarter. Average noninterest-bearing deposits in the recent quarter were $4.0 billion or 8% higher than the fourth quarter 2020 average of $46.9 billion, reflecting higher levels of liquidity being maintained by many commercial and consumer customers. The following table provides an analysis of quarterly changes in the components of average core deposits. &#160;

The Company also receives funding from other deposit sources, including branch-related time deposits over $250,000, deposits associated with the Company&#8217;s Cayman Islands office and brokered deposits. Time deposits over $250,000, excluding brokered deposits, averaged $477 million in the recent quarter, compared with $872 million in the first quarter of 2020 and $521 million in the fourth 2020 quarter. The decreases in such deposits since the first quarter of 2020 were predominantly the result of maturities of higher-rate time deposits. Cayman Islands office deposits averaged $683 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2021, compared with $1.7 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 and $826 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2020. The decreases in such deposits in

&#160;

the two most recent quarters as compared with the first quarter of 2020 reflect customer reaction to the declines in short-term interest rates that followed actions by the Federal Reserve in March 2020. The Company had brokered savings and interest-bearing transaction accounts, which in the aggregate averaged $4.4 billion during each of the recent quarter and the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with $2.7 billion in the first quarter of 2020.

The Company also uses borrowings from banks, securities dealers, various Federal Home Loan Banks, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and others as sources of funding. Short-term borrowings represent borrowing arrangements that at the time they were entered into had a contractual maturity of one year or less. Average short-term borrowings totaled $62 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared with $58 million in the year-earlier quarter and $64 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. 

Long-term borrowings averaged $3.9 billion in the recent quarter, compared $6.2 billion in the first quarter of 2020 and $5.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. Average balances of outstanding senior notes were $2.5 billion, $4.2 billion and $3.4 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2021, March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2020, respectively. In July 2020, M&#38;T Bank redeemed $750 million of fixed rate senior notes and in December 2020, redeemed $650 million of fixed rate senior notes that were due to mature on January 25, 2021. In addition, in January 2021, $350 million of variable rate senior notes matured. Subordinated capital notes included in long-term borrowings averaged $828 million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2021 and $1.4 billion in each of the three-month periods ended March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2020. On March 1, 2021, M&#38;T Bank redeemed $500 million of subordinated capital notes that were due to mature on December 1, 2021, and during December 2020, $409 million of subordinated capital notes matured. Junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities that were included in average long-term borrowings were $529 million, $525 million and $528 million during the first quarters of 2021 and 2020 and the final 2020 quarter, respectively. Additional information regarding junior subordinated debentures is provided in note 5 of Notes to Financial Statements. 

The Company has utilized interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain components of its loans and long-term debt. As of March 31, 2021, interest rate swap agreements were used as fair 

- 52 -

&#160;

value hedges of approximately $1.65 billion of outstanding fixed rate long-term borrowings. Additionally, interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of $17.35 billion were used as cash flow hedges of interest payments associated with variable rate commercial real estate loans. Further information on interest rate swap agreements is provided herein and in note 10 of Notes to Financial Statements. 

Changes in the composition of the Company&#8217;s earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as discussed herein, as well as changes in interest rates and spreads, can impact net interest income. Net interest spread, or the difference between the taxable-equivalent yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, was 2.90% in the recent quarter, compared with 3.35% in the initial 2020 quarter. The yield on earning assets during the first three months of 2021 was 3.08%, down 110 basis points from 4.18% in the similar 2020 period, while the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities declined 65 basis points to .18% in the recent quarter from .83% in the year-earlier period. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the net interest spread was also 2.90%, the yield on earning assets was 3.15% and the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was .25%. The narrowing of the net interest spread in the two most recent quarters as compared with the initial quarter of 2020 period reflects the decreases in short-term interest rates initiated by the Federal Reserve during March 2020.

Net interest-free funds consist largely of noninterest-bearing demand deposits and shareholders&#8217; equity, partially offset by bank owned life insurance and non-earning assets, including goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets. Net interest-free funds averaged $55.6 billion in the first quarter of 2021, compared with $38.2 billion in the year-earlier quarter and $52.5 billion in the fourth 2020 quarter. The increase in average net interest-free funds in the two most recent quarters as compared with the initial 2020 quarter reflects higher average balances of noninterest-bearing deposits. Shareholders&#8217; equity averaged $16.3 billion during the three-month period ended March 31, 2021, $15.7 billion during the year-earlier period and $16.2 billion during the three-month period ended December 31, 2020. Goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets averaged $4.6 billion in each of the quarters noted herein. The cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance averaged $1.9 billion in the three-month period ended March 31, 2021 and $1.8 billion in each of the three-month periods ended March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2020. Increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance and benefits received are not included in interest income, but rather are recorded in &#8220;other revenues from operations.&#8221; The contribution of net interest-free funds to net interest margin was .07% in the first quarter of 2021, compared with .30% and .10% in the first quarter of 2020 and the fourth quarter of 2020, respectively. The reduced contribution of net interest-free funds to net interest margin in the two most recent quarters as compared with the first quarter of 2020 reflects the lower rates on interest-bearing liabilities used to value net interest-free funds. 

Reflecting the changes to the net interest spread and the contribution of net interest-free funds as described herein, the Company&#8217;s net interest margin was 2.97% in the first quarter of 2021, compared with 3.65% in the year-earlier period and 3.00% in the fourth quarter of 2020. Future changes in market interest rates or spreads, as well as changes in the composition of the Company&#8217;s portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities that result in reductions in spreads, could adversely impact the Company&#8217;s net interest income and net interest margin.

Management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income under several interest rate scenarios. In managing interest rate risk, the Company has utilized interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Periodic settlement amounts arising from these agreements are reflected in either the yields on earning assets or the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was $19.0 billion (excluding $18.7 billion of forward-starting swap agreements) at March 31, 2021, $16.4 billion (excluding $41.8 billion of forward-starting swap agreements) at March 31, 2020 and $19.0 billion (excluding $32.1 billion of forward-starting swap agreements) at December 31, 2020. Under the terms of those interest rate swap agreements, the Company received payments based on the outstanding notional amount at fixed rates and made payments at variable rates. At each of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of $17.35 billion were serving as cash flow hedges of interest payments associated with variable rate commercial real estate loans, compared with $13.35 billion at March 31, 2020. Interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of $1.65 billion at each of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 and $3.05 billion at March 31, 2020 were serving as fair value hedges of fixed rate long-

- 53 -

&#160;

term borrowings. The Company has entered into forward-starting interest rate swap agreements predominantly to extend the term of its interest rate swap agreements serving as cash flow hedges, and provide a hedge against changing interest rates on certain of its variable rate loans. 

In a fair value hedge, the fair value of the derivative (the interest rate swap agreement) and changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in current earnings. The difference between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded as an adjustment to the interest income or interest expense of the respective hedged item. In a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative&#8217;s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the derivative&#8217;s gain or loss on cash flow hedges is accounted for similar to that associated with fair value hedges. The amounts of hedge ineffectiveness recognized during each of the quarters ended March 31, 2021, March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2020 were not material to the Company&#8217;s consolidated results of operations. Information regarding the fair value of interest rate swap agreements and hedge ineffectiveness is presented in note 10 of Notes to Financial Statements. Information regarding the effective portion of cash flow hedges is presented in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. The changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items primarily result from the effects of changing interest rates and spreads. 

The weighted-average rates to be received and paid under interest rate swap agreements currently in effect were 1.89% and .17%, respectively, at March 31, 2021. The average notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes, the related effect on net interest income and margin, and the weighted-average interest rates paid or received on those swap agreements are presented in the accompanying table. Additional information about the Company&#8217;s use of interest rate swap agreements and other derivatives is included in note 10 of Notes to Financial Statements.

As a financial intermediary, the Company is exposed to various risks, including liquidity and market risk. Liquidity refers to the Company&#8217;s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future obligations, including demands for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs, and other corporate purposes. Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ. 

The most significant source of funding for the Company is core deposits, which are generated from a large base of consumer, corporate and institutional customers. That customer base has, over the past several years, become more geographically diverse as a result of expansion of the Company&#8217;s businesses. Nevertheless, the Company faces competition in offering products and services from a large array of financial market participants, including banks, thrifts, mutual funds, securities dealers and others. The Company supplements funding provided through deposits 

- 54 -

&#160;

with various short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings, including overnight federal funds purchased, short-term advances from the FHLB of New York, brokered deposits, and longer-term borrowings . M&#38;T Bank has access to additional funding sources through borrowings from the FHLB of New York, lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, M&#38;T Bank&#8217;s Bank Note Program, and other available borrowing facilities. The Bank Note Program enables M&#38;T Bank to offer unsecured senior and subordinated notes. The Company has, from time to time, also issued subordinated capital notes and junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities to provide liquidity and enhance regulatory capital ratios. The Company&#8217;s junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities and other subordinated capital notes are considered Tier 2 capital and are includable in total regulatory capital. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, long-term borrowings aggregated $3.5 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively. 

Cayman Islands office deposits have been used by some customers of the Company as an alternative to other deposit and investment products. Cayman Islands office deposits totaled $642 million at March 31, 2021, $1.2 billion at March 31, 2020 and $652 million at December 31, 2020. The Company has also benefited from the placement of brokered deposits. The Company had brokered savings and interest-bearing checking deposit accounts which aggregated approximately $4.4 billion at March 31, 2021, $3.1 billion at March 31, 2020 and $4.5 billion at December 31, 2020. Brokered time deposits were not a significant source of funding as of those dates.

The Company&#8217;s ability to obtain funding from these sources could be negatively impacted should the Company experience a substantial deterioration in its financial condition or its debt ratings, or should the availability of funding become restricted due to a disruption in the financial markets. The Company attempts to quantify such credit-event risk by modeling scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact resulting from a short-term ratings downgrade over various grading levels. Such impact is estimated by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets. In addition to deposits and borrowings, other sources of liquidity include maturities of investment securities and other earning assets, repayments of loans and investment securities, and cash generated from operations, such as fees collected for services.

Certain customers of the Company obtain financing through the issuance of variable rate demand bonds (&#8220;VRDBs&#8221;). The VRDBs are generally enhanced by letters of credit provided by M&#38;T Bank. M&#38;T Bank oftentimes acts as remarketing agent for the VRDBs and, at its discretion, may from time-to-time own some of the VRDBs while such instruments are remarketed. When this occurs, the VRDBs are classified as trading account assets in the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet. Nevertheless, M&#38;T Bank is not contractually obligated to purchase the VRDBs. The value of VRDBs in the Company&#8217;s trading account was not material at March 31, 2021 or December 31, 2020. The total amounts of VRDBs outstanding backed by M&#38;T Bank letters of credit were $725 million at each of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, compared with $850 million at March 31, 2020. M&#38;T Bank also serves as remarketing agent for most of those bonds.

The Company enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business that require future cash payments. Such obligations include, among others, payments related to deposits, borrowings, leases and other contractual commitments. Off-balance sheet commitments to customers may impact liquidity, including commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, commercial letters of credit, financial guarantees and indemnification contracts, and commitments to sell real estate loans. Because many of these commitments or contracts expire without being funded in whole or in part, the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows. Further discussion of these commitments is provided in note 13 of Notes to Financial Statements.

M&#38;T&#8217;s primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses, shareholder dividends and treasury stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of dividends from its bank subsidiaries, which are subject to various regulatory limitations. Dividends from any bank subsidiary to M&#38;T are limited by the amount of earnings of the subsidiary in the current year and the two preceding years. For purposes of that test, at March 31, 2021 approximately $969 million was available for payment of dividends to M&#38;T from bank subsidiaries. M&#38;T also may obtain funding through long-term borrowings. Outstanding senior notes of M&#38;T at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were $779 million and $783 million, respectively. Junior subordinated debentures of M&#38;T associated with 

- 55 -

&#160;

trust preferred securities outstanding at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 totaled $529 million and $528 million, respectively. 

Management closely monitors the Company&#8217;s liquidity position on an ongoing basis for compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs anticipated in the ordinary course of business. Management does not anticipate engaging in any activities, either currently or in the long-term, for which adequate funding would not be available and would therefore result in a significant strain on liquidity at either M&#38;T or its subsidiary banks.

Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in the market prices and/or interest rates of the Company&#8217;s financial instruments. The primary market risk the Company is exposed to is interest rate risk. Interest rate risk arises from the Company&#8217;s core banking activities of lending and deposit-taking, because assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change. As a result, net interest income earned by the Company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates. The Company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and derivatives used to manage interest rate risk. Management&#8217;s philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income. The balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities, anticipated prepayments of loans and investment securities, and expected maturities of investment securities, loans and deposits. Management uses a &#8220;value of equity&#8221; model to supplement the modeling technique described above. Those supplemental analyses are based on discounted cash flows associated with on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Such analyses are modeled to reflect changes in interest rates and provide management with a long-term interest rate risk metric. The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk. At March 31, 2021, the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for risk management purposes that were currently in effect was $19.0 billion. In addition, the Company has entered into $18.7 billion of forward-starting interest rate swap agreements.

The Company&#8217;s Asset-Liability Committee, which includes members of senior management, monitors the sensitivity of the Company&#8217;s net interest income to changes in interest rates with the aid of a computer model that forecasts net interest income under different interest rate scenarios. In modeling changing interest rates, the Company considers different yield curve shapes that consider both parallel (that is, simultaneous changes in interest rates at each point on the yield curve) and non-parallel (that is, allowing interest rates at points on the yield curve to vary by different amounts) shifts in the yield curve. In utilizing the model, market-implied forward interest rates over the subsequent twelve months are generally used to determine a base interest rate scenario for the net interest income simulation. That calculated base net interest income is then compared to the income calculated under the varying interest rate scenarios. The model considers the impact of ongoing lending and deposit-gathering activities, as well as interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments, including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities. When deemed prudent, management has taken actions to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on- or off-balance sheet financial instruments and intends to do so in the future. Possible actions include, but are not limited to, changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products, modifying the composition of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and adding to, modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes.

The accompanying table as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 displays the estimated impact on net interest income in the base scenario described above resulting from parallel changes in interest rates across repricing categories during the first modeling year.

The Company utilized many assumptions to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income. The more significant of those assumptions included the rate of prepayments of mortgage-related assets, cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments held for non-trading purposes, loan and deposit volumes and pricing, and deposit maturities. In the scenarios presented, the Company also assumed gradual changes in interest rates during a twelve-month period as compared with the base scenario. In the declining rate scenario, the rate changes may be limited to lesser amounts such that interest rates remain at or above zero on all points of the yield curve. The assumptions used in interest rate sensitivity modeling are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the Company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ significantly from those presented due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and changes in market conditions and interest rate differentials (spreads) between maturity/repricing categories, as well as any actions, such as those previously described, which management may take to counter such changes. 

Changes in fair value of the Company&#8217;s financial instruments can also result from a lack of trading activity for similar instruments in the financial markets. That impact is most notable on the values assigned to some of the Company&#8217;s investment securities. Information about the fair valuation of investment securities is presented in notes 3 and 12 of Notes to Financial Statements.

The Company engages in limited trading account activities to meet the financial needs of customers and to fund the Company&#8217;s obligations under certain deferred compensation plans. Financial instruments utilized for trading account activities consist predominantly of interest rate contracts, such as interest rate swap agreements, and forward and futures contracts related to foreign currencies. The Company generally mitigates the foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with trading account activities by entering into offsetting trading positions that are also included in the trading account. The fair values of trading account positions associated with interest rate contracts and foreign currency and other option and futures contracts are presented in note 10 of Notes to Financial Statements. The amounts of gross and net trading account positions, as well as the type of trading account activities conducted by the Company, are subject to a well-defined series of potential loss exposure limits established by management and approved by M&#38;T&#8217;s Board of Directors. However, as with any non-government guaranteed financial instrument, the Company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to the Company&#8217;s trading account activities.

The notional amounts of interest rate contracts entered into for trading account purposes totaled $36.2 billion at March 31, 2021, $36.7 billion at March 31, 2020 and $37.8 billion at December 31, 2020. The notional amounts of foreign currency and other option and futures contracts entered into for trading account purposes were $910 million at March 31, 2021, compared with $928 million at March 31, 2020 and $776 million at December 31, 2020. Although the notional amounts of these contracts are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet, the unsettled fair values of all financial instruments used for trading account activities are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet. The fair values of all trading account assets and liabilities recognized on the balance sheet were $687 million and $95 million, respectively, at March 31, 2021 and $1.1 billion and $117 million, respectively, at December 31, 2020. The fair value asset and liability amounts at March 31, 2021 have been reduced by contractual settlements of $55 million and $502 million, respectively, and at December 31, 2020 have been reduced by contractual settlements of $6 million and $806 million, respectively. The lower balance of trading account assets at March 31, 2021 as compared with December 31, 2020 was largely the result of decreased values associated with interest rate swap agreements entered into with commercial customers that are not subject to periodic variation margin settlement

payments. Included in trading account assets were assets related to deferred compensation plans aggregating $ 20 million at March 31, 2021, compared with $19 million March 31, 2020 and $21 million December 31, 2020. Changes in the fair values of such assets are recorded as &#8220;trading account and foreign exchange gains&#8221; in the consolidated statement of income. Included in &#8220;other liabilities&#8221; in the consolidated balance sheet at each of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were $ 24 million of liabilities related to deferred compensation plans, compared with $ 22 million at March 31, 2020. Changes in the balances of such liabilities due to the valuation of allocated investment options to which the liabilities are indexed are recorded in &#8220;other costs of operations&#8221; in the consolidated statement of income. Also included in trading account assets were investments in mutual funds and other assets that the Company was required to hold under terms of certain non-qualified supplemental retirement and other benefit plans that were assumed by the Company in various acquisitions. Those assets totaled $ 29 million at each of March 31, 2021, March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2020. 

Given the Company&#8217;s policies, limits and positions, management believes that the potential loss exposure to the Company resulting from market risk associated with trading account activities was not material, however, as previously noted, the Company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to transactions related to the Company&#8217;s trading account activities. Additional information about the Company&#8217;s use of derivative financial instruments in its trading account activities is included in note 10 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Provision for Credit Losses

A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed necessary by management. A provision for credit losses recapture was recorded in the first quarter of 2021 for $25 million, compared with provisions of $250 million in the year-earlier quarter and $75 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. The provision recapture in the recent quarter reflects improvements in macroeconomic forecasts at March 31, 2021 as compared with previous forecasts. Nevertheless, the impact of those improvements was cautiously evaluated given the somewhat uneven and incomplete recovery evident in the economy through the recent quarter-end. The level of the provisions in the 2020 quarters reflected projections of expected credit losses that were based on economic forecasts at those dates. The Company&#8217;s estimates of expected losses reflect the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic activity, concerns about commercial real estate values in the hospitality and office building sectors, and the ultimate collectability of real estate loans where borrowers requested repayment forbearance. Net charge-offs of loans were $75 million &#160; in the recent quarter, $49 million in the first quarter of 2020 and $97 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Net charge-offs as an annualized percentage of average loans and leases were .31% &#160; in the first quarter of 2021, .22% in the year-earlier quarter and .39% in the final quarter of 2020. A summary of net charge-offs by loan type is presented in the table that follows.

The higher levels of net charge-offs of commercial loans in the fourth quarter of 2020 and commercial real estate loans in the first quarter of 2021 reflect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on borrowers&#8217; abilities to repay loans associated with the retail, office building and hospitality sectors. Included in net charge-offs of consumer loans were net charge-offs of: automobile loans of $2 million in the recent quarter, $7 million in the first quarter of 

- 58 -

&#160;

2020 and $4 million in the final quarter of 2020&#59; recreational finance loans of $7 million in the first quarter of 2021, $9 million in the year-earlier quarter and $ 8 million in the fourth 2020 quarter&#59; and home equity loans and lines of credit secured by one-to-four family residential properties of $2 million in last year&#8217;s first quarter and less than $1 million in the final 2020 quarter, compared with net recoveries of less than $1 million in the initial 2021 quarter. 

Nonaccrual loans aggregated $1.96 billion or 1.97% of total loans and leases outstanding at March 31, 2021, compared with $1.06 billion or 1.13% at March 31, 2020 and $1.89 billion or 1.92% at December 31, 2020. The higher level of nonaccrual loans at the past two quarter-ends as compared with March 31, 2020 reflects the continuing impact of the pandemic on borrowers&#8217; ability to make contractual payments on their loans, most notably loans in the hospitality sector.

Accruing loans past due 90 days or more were $1.08 billion or 1.09% of loans and leases at March 31, 2021, compared with $530 million or .56% at March 31, 2020 and $859 million or .87% of outstanding loans at December 31, 2020. Accruing loans past due 90 days or more included loans guaranteed by government-related entities of $1.04 billion, $464 million and $798 million at March 31, 2021, March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Guaranteed loans included one-to-four family residential mortgage loans serviced by the Company that were purchased to reduce associated servicing costs, including a requirement to advance principal and interest payments that had not been received from individual mortgagors. Despite the loans being purchased by the Company, the insurance or guarantee by the applicable government-related entity remains in force. The outstanding principal balances of those purchased loans that are guaranteed by government-related entities totaled $1.01 billion at March 31, 2021, $439 million a year earlier and $764 million at December 31, 2020. The remaining accruing loans past due 90 days or more not guaranteed by government-related entities were loans considered to be with creditworthy borrowers that were in the process of collection or renewal. In addition to the past due loans, the Company also has $2.4 billion of government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans that are not considered delinquent because the borrower has requested and received a COVID-19 related payment deferral. In general, those loans were also purchased to reduce associated servicing costs as described above and also remain covered by the insurance or guarantee of the applicable government-related entity, but are not considered to be past due in accordance with the accounting treatment afforded under the CARES Act and related regulatory and financial accounting guidance as described below and in note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements in M&#38;T&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report.

Loans that were 30-89 days past due were $692 million at March 31, 2021, compared with $1.4 billion at March 31, 2020 and $662 million at December 31, 2020. The lower levels of such past due loans at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were a result of loan payments received, many of which resulted in return to current status, and migrations of loans to nonaccrual status. COVID-19 related payment deferral modifications resulted in such loans being classified as current in accordance with regulatory guidance and, as a result, did not contribute in incremental additions to loans categorized as 30-89 days past due.

The United States has been operating under a state of emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic since March 13, 2020. The direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a dramatic reduction in economic activity that severely hampered the ability of some businesses and consumers to meet their repayment obligations. The CARES Act, in addition to providing financial assistance to both businesses and consumers, created a forbearance program for federally-backed mortgage loans, protects borrowers from negative credit reporting due to loan accommodations related to the national emergency, and provides financial institutions the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under GAAP related to troubled debt restructurings for a limited period of time to account for the effects of COVID-19. The banking regulatory agencies likewise issued guidance encouraging financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are, or may be, unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of the effects of COVID-19. That guidance, with concurrence of the Financial Accounting Standards Board and provisions of the CARES Act, allow modifications made on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19 to borrowers who were generally current with their payments prior to any relief, to not be treated as delinquent or as troubled debt restructurings. Modifications may include payment deferrals (including extensions of maturity dates), covenant waivers and fee waivers. The Company has worked with its customers affected by COVID-19 and, as previously noted, has granted modifications across many of its loan

&#160;

portfolios. To the extent that such modifications met the criteria previously described, such modifications have not been classified as delinquent or as troubled debt restructurings. A summary of loans for which COVID-19 forbearances have been granted and which are not considered impaired or past due is presented herein and in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements. 

The Company also modified the terms of select loans in an effort to assist borrowers that were not related to the COVID-19 pandemic. If the borrower was experiencing financial difficulty and a concession was granted, the Company considered such modifications as troubled debt restructurings. Loan modifications included such actions as the extension of loan maturity dates and the lowering of interest rates and monthly payments. The objective of the modifications was to increase loan repayments by customers and thereby reduce net charge-offs. Information about modifications of loans that are considered troubled debt restructurings is included in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Residential real estate loans modified under specified loss mitigation programs prescribed by government guarantors that were not related to the COVID-19 pandemic have not been included in renegotiated loans because the loan guarantee remains in full force and, accordingly, the Company has not granted a concession with respect to the ultimate collection of the original loan balance. Such loans aggregated $417 million, $176 million and $342 million at March 31, 2021, March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

Commercial loans and leases classified as nonaccrual totaled $295 million, $287 million and $307 million at March 31, 2021, March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2020, respectively. Commercial real estate loans in nonaccrual status aggregated $952 million, $227 million and $891 million at March 31, 2021, March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The increases in commercial real estate loans in nonaccrual status at the two most recent quarter-ends as compared with March 31, 2020 were largely due to the addition of $530 million of hotel loans in the second half of 2020.

Nonaccrual residential real estate loans totaled $529 million at March 31, 2021, compared with $413 million at March 31, 2020, and $513 million at December 31, 2020. The increases at the two most recent quarter-ends as compared with the year-earlier date were largely reflective of the effect of recent economic conditions on borrowers. Included in residential real estate loans classified as nonaccrual were limited documentation first mortgage loans of $143 million at March 31, 2021, compared with $119 million at March 31, 2020 and $147 million at December 31, 2020. Limited documentation first mortgage loans represent loans secured by residential real estate that at origination typically included some form of limited borrower documentation requirements as compared with more traditional loans. The Company no longer originates limited documentation loans. Residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest aggregated $1.04 billion at March 31, 2021, compared with $474 million at March 31, 2020, and $793 million at December 31, 2020. Those amounts related to government-guaranteed loans as previously noted. Information about the location of nonaccrual and charged-off residential real estate loans as of and for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 is presented in the accompanying table. 

Nonaccrual consumer loans were $182 million at March 31, 2021, compared with $135 million at March 31, 2020 and $183 million at December 31, 2020. Included in nonaccrual consumer loans at March 31, 2021, March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2020 were: automobile loans of $38 million, $19 million, and $39 million, respectively&#59; recreational finance loans of $27 million, $13 million, and $26 million, respectively&#59; and outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit of $79 million, $63 million, and $79 million, respectively. Information about the location of nonaccrual and charged-off home equity loans and lines of credit as of and for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 is presented in the accompanying table.

Information about past due and nonaccrual loans as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 is also included in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Real estate and other foreclosed assets totaled $30 million at March 31, 2021, compared with $84 million at March 31, 2020 and $35 million at December 31, 2020. The decline from March 31, 2020 is largely reflective of foreclosure moratoriums imposed by government authorities in numerous jurisdictions. Net gains or losses associated with real estate and other foreclosed assets were not material during the three-months ended March 31, 2021, March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2020. At March 31, 2021, the Company&#8217;s holdings of residential real estate-related properties comprised approximately 81% of foreclosed assets. 

A comparative summary of nonperforming assets and certain past due, renegotiated and impaired loan data and credit quality ratios is presented in the accompanying table.

(a) Predominantly residential real estate loans. 

Management determines the allowance for credit losses under accounting guidance that requires estimating the amount of current expected credit losses over the remaining contractual term of the loan and lease portfolio. A description of the methodologies used by the Company to estimate its allowance for credit losses can be found in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements. 

In establishing the allowance for credit losses, the Company estimates losses attributable to specific troubled credits identified through both normal and targeted credit review processes and also estimates losses for other loans and leases with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis. For purposes of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses, the Company evaluates its loan and lease portfolio by loan type. At the time of the Company&#8217;s analysis regarding the determination of the allowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2021, concerns existed about the somewhat uneven and incomplete recovery evident in the economy related to the COVID-19 pandemic, despite recent improvements in macroeconomic forecasts&#59; the ultimate effectiveness of economic stimulus being provided by the U.S. government&#59; the volatile nature of global markets, including the impact international economic conditions could have on the U.S. economy&#59; Federal Reserve positioning of monetary policy&#59; the extent to which additional repayment forbearance might be requested by borrowers, in particular commercial real estate borrowers&#59; and continued stagnant population and economic growth in the upstate New York and central Pennsylvania regions (approximately 49% of the Company&#8217;s loans and leases are to customers in New York State and Pennsylvania) that could see lingering effects of the economic downturn. The Company utilizes a loan grading system to differentiate risk amongst its commercial loans and commercial real estate loans. Loans with a lower

expectation of default are assigned one of ten possible &#8220;pass&#8221; loan grades and through the loss estimation modeling and other techniques used by the Company are generally considered to possess lower expected losses when determining the allowance for credit losses. Loans with an elevated level of credit risk are classified as &#8220;criticized&#8221; and are ascribed higher expected loss amounts when determining the allowance for credit losses. A criticized loan may be classified as &#8220;nonaccrual&#8221; if the Company no longer expects to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent 90 days or more. During 2021 and 2020, the Company re-graded significant portions of its commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, particularly those that were affected by COVID-19 impacts. Criticized commercial loans and commercial real estate loans totaled $8.4 billion at March 31, 2021, compared with $ 2.4 billion at March 31, 2020, and $7.2 billion at December 31, 2020. The rise in criticized loans at the two most recent quarter-ends as compared to March 31, 2020 reflects the impact of the pandemic on borrowers&#8217; financial condition and the continuing re-grading of loans by the Company. 

The COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental responses led to a significant reduction in economic activity that has been detrimental to many borrowers across the Company&#8217;s geographic regions. Borrowers have been and will likely continue to be adversely impacted by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Summaries of loans outstanding as of March 31, 2021 for which borrowers have been granted a COVID-19 related forbearance and loans extended under the PPP are provided in the accompanying table. Of the COVID-19 related modifications with payment deferrals at March 31, 2021, substantially all are scheduled to expire during 2021. 

As commercial loans and commercial real estate loans were approved for modifications related to COVID-19, loan officers and credit department personnel reviewed and reassigned loan grades, as deemed appropriate. The Company assessed loans considering the creditworthiness of the borrower, collateral values, the financial condition of any guarantors, and the expected collectability of contractual principal and interest payments. Loan-to-collateral values on investor-owned loans are generally relatively low and oftentimes the loans include some form of recourse. Loans secured by residential real estate with a COVID-19 payment forbearance were evaluated for collectability based on the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay considering past performance and estimated collateral values. If collectability was considered doubtful, loans were classified as nonaccrual.

Loan officers in different geographic locations with the support of the Company&#8217;s credit department personnel review and reassign loan grades based on their detailed knowledge of individual borrowers and their judgment of the impact on such borrowers resulting from changing conditions in their respective regions. The Company re-assessed its loan grades for those borrowers most impacted by COVID-19 in 2020 and expects that loans will continue to be regraded in subsequent periods as more information becomes available. At least annually, however, updated financial information is obtained from commercial borrowers associated with pass grade loans and additional analysis is performed. On a quarterly basis, the Company&#8217;s centralized credit department reviews all criticized commercial loans and commercial real estate loans greater than $1 million to determine the appropriateness of the assigned loan grade, including whether the loan should be reported as accruing or nonaccruing. For criticized nonaccrual loans, additional meetings are held with loan officers and their managers, workout specialists and senior management to discuss each of the relationships. In analyzing criticized loans, borrower-specific information is reviewed, including operating results, future cash flows, recent developments and the borrower&#8217;s outlook, and other pertinent data. The timing and extent of potential losses, considering collateral valuation and other factors, and the Company&#8217;s potential courses of action are contemplated.

With regard to residential real estate loans, the Company&#8217;s loss identification and estimation techniques make reference to loan performance and house price data in specific areas of the country where collateral securing the Company&#8217;s residential real estate loans is located. For residential real estate-related loans, including home equity 

- 64 -

&#160;

loans and lines of credit, the excess of the loan balance over the net realizable value of the property collateralizing the loan is charged-off when the loan becomes 150 days delinquent. That charge-off is based on recent indications of value from external parties that are generally obtained shortly after a loan becomes nonaccrual. Loans to consumers that file for bankruptcy are generally charged off to estimated net collateral value shortly after the Company is notified of such filings. At March 31, 2021, approximately 61% of the Company&#8217;s home equity portfolio consisted of first lien loans and lines of credit. Of the remaining junior lien loans in the portfolio, approximately 60% (or approximately 23% of the aggregate home equity portfolio) consisted of junior lien loans that were behind a first lien mortgage loan that was not owned or serviced by the Company. To the extent known by the Company, if a senior lien loan would be on nonaccrual status because of payment delinquency, even if such senior lien loan was not owned by the Company, the junior lien loan or line that is owned by the Company is placed on nonaccrual status. In monitoring the credit quality of its home equity portfolio for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses, the Company reviews delinquency and nonaccrual information and considers recent charge-off experience. When evaluating individual home equity loans and lines of credit for charge off and for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses, the Company gives consideration to the required repayment of any first lien positions related to collateral property. Home equity line of credit terms vary but such lines are generally originated with an open draw period of ten years followed by an amortization period of up to twenty years. At March 31, 2021 approximately 84% of all outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit related to lines that were still in the draw period, the weighted-average remaining draw periods were approximately five years, and approximately 22% were making contractually allowed payments that do not include any repayment of principal. 

Factors that influence the Company&#8217;s credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, generally, but also residential and commercial real estate valuations, in particular, given the size of the Company&#8217;s real estate loan portfolios. Commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective, as they are based upon many assumptions. Such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. Similarly, residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends, the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates, and general economic conditions affecting consumers.

The Company generally estimates current expected credit losses on loans with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis. To estimate expected losses, the Company utilizes statistically developed models to project principal balances over the remaining contractual lives of the loan portfolios and determine estimated credit losses through a reasonable and supportable forecast period. The Company&#8217;s approach for estimating current expected credit losses for loans and leases at March 31, 2021, March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2020 included utilizing macroeconomic assumptions to project losses over a two-year reasonable and supportable forecast period. Subsequent to the forecast period, the Company reverted to longer-term historical loss experience, over a period of one year, to estimate expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life. Forward-looking estimates of certain macroeconomic variables are determined by the M&#38;T Scenario Development Group, which is comprised of senior management business leaders and economists. The assumptions utilized as of March 31, 2021 included a decrease in the unemployment rate in the first quarter of 2021 to approximately 6.2% from 6.8% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020, followed by a gradual decrease of the unemployment rate through the first quarter of 2023 to 4.2%. The forecast assumes that GDP grows at a 6.3% annual rate during 2021 resulting in GDP returning to pre-pandemic levels during 2021.The commercial real estate price index was assumed to be flat from pre-pandemic levels over the next two years. Residential real estate prices were not assumed to fluctuate significantly. The forecast considered approved government stimulus through March 31, 2021, but not any further fiscal or monetary actions. The assumptions utilized as of December 31, 2020 included the national unemployment rate continuing at elevated levels, on average 6.9% through 2021, followed by a gradual return to long-term historical averages by the end of 2022. The forecast also assumed gross domestic product to grow at a 4.1% annual rate during 2021 resulting in a return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2022. Commercial real estate prices were assumed to decline by 6.8% in 2021, followed by improvement. Residential real estate prices were not assumed to fluctuate significantly. The forecast considered approved government stimulus at the end of 2020, but not any further fiscal or monetary actions. The forecast at March 31, 2020 reflected a sharp contraction of economic activity in the second quarter of 

- 65 -

&#160;

2020 resulting in a projected unemployment rate of 9.3% and an annualized rate of decrease in gross domestic product as low as 26.1%. The assumptions utilized were based on information available to the Company at or near March 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2020 at the time it was preparing its estimate of expected credit losses as of those dates. 

In establishing the allowance for credit losses the Company also considers the impact of portfolio concentrations, changes in underwriting practices, product expansions into new markets, imprecision in its economic forecasts, geopolitical conditions and other risk factors that influence its loss estimation process. Geopolitical conditions assessed at the end of the first quarter in 2021 included the potential impact of COVID-19 on economic activity that could influence the ability of customers to repay loan amounts in accordance with their contractual obligations. With respect to economic forecasts the Company assessed the likelihood of alternative economic scenarios during the two-year reasonable and supportable time period and of more negative or positive outcomes on its allowance for credit losses. Economic forecasts have changed rapidly in the recent past due to the uncertain impacts of COVID-19. Generally, an increase in unemployment rate or a decrease in any of the rate of change in gross domestic product, commercial real estate prices or home prices would have an adverse impact on expected credit losses and would likely result in an increase to the allowance for credit losses. Further information about the Company&#8217;s methodology to estimate expected credit losses is included in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Management believes that the allowance for credit losses at March 31, 2021 appropriately reflected expected credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of that date. The allowance for credit losses totaled $1.64 billion at March 31, 2021, compared with $1.38 billion at March 31, 2020 and $1.74 billion at December 31, 2020. As a percentage of loans outstanding, the allowance was 1.65% at March 31, 2021, 1.47% at March 31, 2020 and 1.76% at December 31, 2020. The level of the allowance reflects management&#8217;s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio using the methodology and considering the factors as described herein. Should the various economic forecasts and credit factors considered by management in establishing the allowance for credit losses change and should management&#8217;s assessment of losses in the loan portfolio also change, the level of the allowance as a percentage of loans could increase or decrease in future periods. The reported level of the allowance reflects management&#8217;s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as of each respective date.

Other Income

Other income totaled $506 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared with $529 million in the year-earlier quarter and $551 million in the final quarter of 2020. The lower level of other income as compared with the first quarter of 2020 resulted from declines in trading account and foreign exchange gains and service charges on deposit accounts, and a $23 million distribution from BLG in the initial quarter of 2020. Those factors were partially offset by increased residential mortgage banking revenues and trust income. The decreased income in the recent quarter as compared with the immediately preceding quarter predominantly reflects a fourth quarter 2020 distribution of $30 million from BLG and unrealized losses on investment securities.

Mortgage banking revenues were $139 million in the recent quarter, compared with $128 million in the first quarter of 2020 and $140 million in the final 2020 quarter. Mortgage banking revenues are comprised of both residential and commercial mortgage banking activities. The Company&#8217;s involvement in commercial mortgage banking activities includes the origination, sales and servicing of loans under the multi-family loan programs of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Residential mortgage banking revenues, consisting of realized gains from sales of residential real estate loans and loan servicing rights, unrealized gains and losses on residential real estate loans held for sale and related commitments, residential real estate loan servicing fees, and other residential real estate loan-related fees and income, were $107 million in the initial quarter of 2021, $98 million in the similar quarter of 2020 and $95 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. As compared with the respective prior quarters, the higher residential mortgage banking revenues in the recent quarter resulted from increased gains associated with loans held for sale and related commitments, reflecting higher origination volumes and improved margins.

New commitments to originate residential real estate loans to be sold were approximately $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2021, compared with $919 million in the year-earlier quarter and $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 

- 66 -

&#160;

2020. Realized gains from sales of residential real estate loans and loan servicing rights and recognized net unrealized gains or losses attributable to residential real estate loans held for sale, commitments to originate loans for sale and commitments to sell loans totaled to gains of $50 million in the first quarter of 2021, $32 million in the corresponding period of 2020 and $43 million in 2020&#8217;s final quarter. 

Loans held for sale that were secured by residential real estate aggregated $773 million at March 31, 2021, $374 million at March 31, 2020 and $777 million at December 31, 2020. Commitments to sell residential real estate loans and commitments to originate residential real estate loans for sale at pre-determined rates totaled $1.53 billion and $1.08 billion, respectively, at March 31, 2021, compared with $782 million and $712 million, respectively, at March 31, 2020 and $1.47 billion and $1.03 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2020. Net recognized unrealized gains on residential real estate loans held for sale, commitments to sell loans, and commitments to originate loans for sale were $48 million at March 31, 2021, $17 million at March 31, 2020 and $52 million at December 31, 2020. Changes in net unrealized gains or losses are recorded in mortgage banking revenues and resulted in net decreases in revenues of $4 million in the recent quarter and $7 million in the final 2020 quarter, compared with net increases in revenues of $5 million in the first quarter of 2020.

Revenues from servicing residential real estate loans for others were $57 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2021, compared with $67 million and $52 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Residential real estate loans serviced for others totaled $95.0 billion at March 31, 2021, $93.5 billion at March 31, 2020 and $94.4 billion at December 31, 2020. Reflected in residential real estate loans serviced for others were loans sub-serviced for others of $69.7 billion, $61.9 billion and $68.1 billion at March 31, 2021, March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Revenues earned for sub-servicing loans totaled $34 million during the recent quarter, $37 million in the first quarter of 2020 and $28 million in the final quarter of 2020. The contractual servicing rights associated with loans sub-serviced by the Company were predominantly held by affiliates of BLG. Information about the Company&#8217;s relationship with BLG and its affiliates is included in note 15 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Capitalized residential mortgage servicing assets totaled $218 million at March 31, 2021 (net of a $21 million valuation allowance), $224 million at March 31, 2020 (net of a $17 million valuation allowance) and $201 million at December 31, 2020 (net of a $30 million valuation allowance). During the recent quarter, the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights was reduced by $9 million, compared with additions to the valuation allowance of $10 million and $3 million in the first and fourth quarters of 2020, respectively. Those increases and decreases in the valuation allowance resulted from changes in the estimated fair value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights that reflected the impact of changes in interest rates on the expected rate of residential mortgage loan prepayments.

Commercial mortgage banking revenues totaled $32 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared with $30 million in the first quarter of 2020 and $45 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Included in such amounts were revenues from loan origination and sales activities of $17 million and $14 million in the first quarters of 2021 and 2020 respectively, and $31 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Commercial real estate loans originated for sale to other investors were approximately $619 million in the recent quarter, compared with $611 million in the first quarter of 2020 and $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. Loan servicing revenues totaled $15 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared with $16 million and $14 million in the first and fourth quarters of 2020, respectively. Capitalized commercial mortgage servicing assets were $136 million and $129 million at March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $133 million at December 31, 2020. Commercial real estate loans serviced for other investors totaled $22.6 billion at March 31, 2021, $21.0 billion at March 31, 2020 and $22.2 billion at December 31, 2020. Those servicing amounts included $4.0 billion at each of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 and $3.8 billion at March 31, 2020 of loan balances for which investors had recourse to the Company if such balances are ultimately uncollectable. Included in commercial real estate loans serviced for others were loans sub-serviced for others of $3.3 billion at each of March 31, 2021, March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2020. Commitments to sell commercial real estate loans and commitments to originate commercial real estate loans for sale were $348 million and $250 million, respectively, at March 31, 2021, $542 million and $291 million, respectively, at March 31, 2020 and $641 million 

- 67 -

&#160;

and $364 million, respectively, at December 31, 2020. Commercial real estate loans held for sale at March 31, 2021, March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2020 were $ 99 million, $ 250 million and $ 278 million, respectively. 

Service charges on deposit accounts were $93 million and $106 million in the first quarters of 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $96 million in the final quarter of 2020. The declines in such service charges in the two most recent quarters as compared with the first quarter of 2020 resulted predominantly from lower consumer service charges, largely resulting from higher customer deposit balances offsetting transaction-based fees, largely overdraft fees. 

Trust income includes fees related to two significant businesses. The Institutional Client Services (&#8220;ICS&#8221;) business provides a variety of trustee, agency, investment management and administrative services for corporations and institutions, investment bankers, corporate tax, finance and legal executives, and other institutional clients who: (i) use capital markets financing structures&#59; (ii) use independent trustees to hold retirement plan and other assets&#59; and (iii) need investment and cash management services. The Wealth Advisory Services (&#8220;WAS&#8221;) business offers personal trust, planning, fiduciary, asset management, family office and other services designed to help high net worth individuals and families grow, preserve and transfer wealth. Trust income aggregated $156 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared with $149 million in the year-earlier quarter and $151 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Revenues associated with the ICS business were approximately $89 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2021, compared with $85 million and $86 million during the quarters ended March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The higher revenues in the recent quarter as compared with the respective 2020 quarters were largely attributable to increased retirement services income resulting from growth in collective fund balances. Revenues attributable to WAS totaled approximately $59 million in each of three-month periods ended March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 and $56 million during the three-month period ended March 31, 2020. The higher revenues in the recent quarter as compared with the initial 2020 quarter were largely attributable to favorable equity market performance that was partially offset by proprietary fund money market fee waivers as a result of the current interest rate environment. Trust assets under management were $141.5 billion, $103.6 billion and $135.8 billion at March 31, 2021, March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Trust assets under management include the Company&#8217;s proprietary mutual funds&#8217; assets of $12.7 billion, $12.8 billion and $12.9 billion at March 31, 2021, March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Additional trust income from investment management activities was $8 million in each of the first quarters of 2021 and 2020 and $6 million in the fourth 2020 quarter, and is predominantly comprised of fees earned from retail customer investment accounts.

Brokerage services income, which includes revenues from the sale of mutual funds and annuities and securities brokerage fees, totaled $13 million in each of the first quarters of 2021 and 2020 and $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Trading account and foreign exchange activity resulted in gains of $6 million, $21 million and $7 million during the quarters ended March 31, 2021, March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The lower gains in the two most recent quarters as compared with the first quarter of 2020 were predominantly due to decreased activity related to interest rate swap agreements executed on behalf of commercial customers. The Company enters into interest rate and foreign exchange contracts with customers who need such services and concomitantly enters into offsetting trading positions with third parties to minimize the risks involved with these types of transactions. Information about the notional amount of interest rate, foreign exchange and other contracts entered into by the Company for trading account purposes is included in note 10 of Notes to Financial Statements and herein under the heading &#8220;Taxable-equivalent Net Interest Income.&#8221;

The Company recognized net losses on investment securities of $12 million in the recent quarter and $21 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared with net gains of $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. The gains and losses represented unrealized gains and losses on investments in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred stock.

Other revenues from operations were $111 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared with $133 million in the corresponding 2020 period and $143 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. The primary factor for the decrease in such revenues in the recent quarter as compared with the first and fourth quarters of 2020 was distributions from BLG in the 2020 periods. Included in other revenues from operations were the following significant components. Letter of credit and other credit-related fees aggregated $31 million in the recent quarter, $32 million in the year-earlier quarter and $26 million in the final quarter of 2020. Revenues from merchant discount and credit card fees 

- 68 -

&#160;

were $26 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared with $30 million in the year-earlier quarter and and $31 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Tax-exempt income from bank owned life insurance, which includes increases in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies and benefits received, totaled $10 million in each of the first quarter of 2021 and fourth quarter of 2020 and $12 million in the first quarter of 2020. Insurance-related sales commissions and other revenues totaled $14 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2021, compared with $15 million in the first quarter of 2020 and $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. M&#38;T&#8217;s investment in BLG resulted in income of $23 million and $30 million in the first and fourth quarters of 2020, respectively. There was no similar income in the initial 2021 quarter. 

Other Expense

Other expense totaled $919 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared with $906 million in the year-earlier quarter and $845 million in the final three months of 2020. Included in those amounts are expenses considered to be &#8220;nonoperating&#8221; in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $3 million in each of the two most recent quarters and $4 million in the first quarter of 2020 and merger-related expenses of $10 million in the initial 2021 quarter. Exclusive of those nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $907 million in the recent quarter, compared with $903 million in the year-earlier quarter and $842 million in the final 2020 quarter. As compared with the first quarter of 2020, higher expenses for salaries and employee benefits and professional services in the initial 2021 quarter were partially offset by a recent quarter reduction of the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights of $9 million. When compared with the fourth quarter of 2020, the recent quarter increase in noninterest operating expenses resulted from higher costs for salaries and employee benefits, reflecting seasonally higher stock-based compensation and employee benefits expenses during the recent quarter, and increased professional services expenses, partially offset by the recent quarter reduction of the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights. Table 2 provides a reconciliation of other expense to noninterest operating expense.

Salaries and employee benefits expense totaled $541 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared with $537 million in the year-earlier quarter and $476 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. The higher salaries and employee benefits expenses in the recent quarter as compared with the fourth quarter of 2020 reflect seasonally higher stock-based compensation, medical plan costs, payroll-related taxes, unemployment insurance and the Company&#8217;s contributions for retirement savings plan benefits related to annual incentive compensation payments that aggregated approximately $69 million. Similar expenses in the first quarter of 2020 were approximately $67 million. The Company, in accordance with GAAP, has accelerated the recognition of compensation costs for stock-based awards granted to retirement-eligible employees and employees who will become retirement-eligible prior to full vesting of the award. As a result, stock-based compensation expense during the first quarters of 2021 and 2020 included $34 million and $31 million, respectively, that would have been recognized over the normal vesting period if not for the accelerated recognition provisions of GAAP. That acceleration had no effect on the value of stock-based compensation awarded to employees. Salaries and employee benefits expense included stock-based compensation of $48 million and $43 million in the three-month periods ended March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020, respectively, and $11 million in the three-month period ended December 31, 2020. The number of full-time equivalent employees was 17,157 at March 31, 2021, compared with 17,416 and 17,076 at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

Excluding the nonoperating expense items described earlier from each quarter, nonpersonnel operating expenses were $366 million in the each of the quarters ended March 31, 2021, March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2020. As compared with the first and fourth quarters of 2020, higher contributions made to The M&#38;T Charitable Foundation and professional services costs in the recent quarter were offset by a $9 million reduction of the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights in the initial 2021 quarter (compared with additions to that valuation allowance of $10 million and $3 million in the first and fourth quarters of 2020, respectively). 

The efficiency ratio measures the relationship of noninterest operating expenses to revenues. The Company&#8217;s efficiency ratio was 60.3% during the recent quarter, compared with 58.9% and 54.6% in the first quarter of 2020 and fourth quarter of 2020, respectively. The calculation of the efficiency ratio is presented in Table 2.

&#160;

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes was $145 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared with $81 million in the year-earlier quarter and $149 million in the final quarter of 2020. The effective tax rates were 24.5%, 23.1% and 24.1% for the quarters ended March 31, 2021, March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

The effective tax rate is affected by the level of income earned that is exempt from tax relative to the overall level of pre-tax income, the level of income allocated to the various state and local jurisdictions where the Company operates, because tax rates differ among such jurisdictions, and the impact of any large discrete or infrequently occurring items. The Company&#8217;s effective tax rate in future periods will also be affected by any change in income tax laws or regulations and interpretations of income tax regulations that differ from the Company&#8217;s interpretations by any of various tax authorities that may examine tax returns filed by M&#38;T or any of its subsidiaries.

Capital

Shareholders&#8217; equity was $16.4 billion at March 31, 2021, representing 10.93% of total assets, compared with $15.8 billion or 12.70% a year earlier and $16.2 billion or 11.35% at December 31, 2020.

Included in shareholders&#8217; equity was preferred stock with financial statement carrying values of $1.25 billion at each of March 31, 2021, March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2020. 

Common shareholders&#8217; equity was $15.2 billion or $118.12 per share, at March 31, 2021, compared with $14.6 billion or $113.54 per share, a year earlier and $14.9 billion or $116.39 per share at December 31, 2020. Tangible equity per common share, which excludes goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets and applicable deferred tax balances, was $82.35 at the end of the recent quarter, compared with $77.60 at March 31, 2020 and $80.52 at December 31, 2020. The Company&#8217;s ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets was 7.26% at March 31, 2021, compared with 8.30% a year earlier and 7.49% at December 31, 2020. Reconciliations of total common shareholders&#8217; equity and tangible common equity and total assets and tangible assets as of each of those respective dates are presented in table 2.

Shareholders&#8217; equity reflects accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, which includes the net after-tax impact of unrealized gains or losses on investment securities classified as available for sale, remaining unrealized losses on held-to-maturity securities transferred from available for sale that have not yet been amortized, gains or losses associated with interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges, foreign currency translation adjustments and adjustments to reflect the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. Net unrealized gains on investment securities reflected in shareholders&#8217; equity, net of applicable tax effect, were $122 million or $.95 per common share, at March 31, 2021, $135 million, or $1.05 per common share, at March 31, 2020 and $145 million, or $1.13 per common share, at December 31, 2020. Changes in unrealized gains and losses on investment securities are predominantly reflective of the impact of changes in interest rates on the values of such securities. Information about unrealized gains and losses as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 is included in note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Reflected in the carrying amount of available-for-sale investment securities at March 31, 2021 were pre-tax effect unrealized gains of $177 million on securities with an amortized cost of $4.1 billion and pre-tax effect unrealized losses of $7 million on securities with an amortized cost of $103 million. Information concerning the Company&#8217;s fair valuations of investment securities is provided in notes 3 and 12 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Each reporting period the Company reviews its available-for-sale investment securities for declines in value that might be indicative of credit-related losses through an analysis of the creditworthiness of the issuer or the credit performance of the underlying collateral supporting the bond. If the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of a debt security a credit loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of income. A loss is also recognized if the Company intends to sell a bond or it more likely than not will be required to sell a bond before recovery of the amortized cost basis. 

As of March 31, 2021, based on a review of each of the securities in the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio, the Company concluded that it expected to realize the amortized cost basis of each security. As of March 

- 70 -

&#160;

31, 2021, the Company did not intend to sell nor is it anticipated that it would be required to sell any securities for which fair value was less than the amortized cost basis of the security. The Company intends to continue to closely monitor the performance of its securities because changes in their underlying credit performance or other events could cause the amortized cost basis of those securities to become uncollectable. 

Accounting guidance requires investment securities held to maturity to be presented at their net carrying value that is expected to be collected over their contractual term. The Company estimated no material allowance for credit losses for its investment securities classified as held-to-maturity at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 as the substantial majority of such investment securities were obligations backed by the U.S. government or its agencies. The Company assessed the potential for expected credit losses on privately issued mortgage-backed securities in the held-to-maturity portfolio by performing internal modeling to estimate bond-specific cash flows considering recent performance of the mortgage loan collateral and utilizing assumptions about future defaults and loss severity. These bond-specific cash flows also reflect the placement of the bond in the overall securitization structure and the remaining subordination levels. In total, at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company had in its held-to-maturity portfolio privately issued mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost basis of $73 million and $77 million, respectively, and a fair value of $68 million and $70 million, respectively. At March 31, 2021, 81% of the mortgage-backed securities were in the most senior tranche of the securitization structure. The mortgage-backed securities are generally collateralized by residential and small-balance commercial real estate loans originated between 2004 and 2008. After considering the repayment structure and estimated future collateral cash flows of each individual bond, the Company has concluded that as of March 31, 2021, it expected to recover the amortized cost basis of those privately issued mortgage-backed securities. Nevertheless, it is possible that adverse changes in the estimated future performance of mortgage loan collateral underlying such securities could impact the Company&#8217;s conclusions.

Adjustments to reflect the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans, net of applicable tax effect, reduced accumulated other comprehensive income by $468 million, or $3.64 per common share, at March 31, 2021, $333 million or $2.60 per common share, at March 31, 2020 and $481 million or $3.75 per common share, at December 31, 2020. 

On January 20, 2021, M&#38;T&#8217;s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase plan to repurchase up to $800 million of shares of M&#38;T&#8217;s common stock subject to all applicable regulatory limitations. There were no repurchases pursuant to that repurchase plan in the first quarter of 2021, and M&#38;T does not expect any repurchases while the acquisition of People&#8217;s United is pending. Pursuant to previously approved capital plans and authorizations by M&#38;T&#8217;s Board of Directors, M&#38;T repurchased 2,577,000 shares of its common stock for $374 million in the first quarter of 2020. There were no repurchases of M&#38;T common stock in the fourth quarter of 2020.

Cash dividends declared on M&#38;T&#8217;s common stock totaled $143 million in each of the first quarters of 2021 and 2020, compared with $142 million in the final quarter of 2020. Cash dividends declared on preferred stock aggregated $17 million in each of the two most recent quarters and in the first quarter of 2020. 

M&#38;T and its subsidiary banks are required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the federal banking agencies. Pursuant to those regulations, the minimum capital ratios are as follows:

The federal bank regulatory agencies have issued rules that allow banks and bank holding companies to phase-in the impact of adopting the expected credit loss accounting model on regulatory capital. Those rules allow banks and bank holding companies to delay for two years the day one impact on retained earnings of adopting the expected loss accounting standard and 25% of the cumulative change in the reported allowance for credit losses subsequent to the initial adoption, followed by a three-year transition period. M&#38;T and its subsidiary banks adopted these rules and the impact is reflected in the regulatory capital ratios presented below. 

The regulatory capital ratios of the Company and its bank subsidiaries, M&#38;T Bank and Wilmington Trust, N.A., as of March 31, 2021 are presented in the accompanying table.

The Company is subject to the comprehensive regulatory framework applicable to bank and financial holding companies and their subsidiaries, which includes examinations by a number of regulators. Regulation of financial institutions such as M&#38;T and its subsidiaries is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC and the banking and financial system as a whole, and generally is not intended for the protection of shareholders, investors or creditors other than insured depositors. Changes in laws, regulations and regulatory policies applicable to the Company&#8217;s operations can increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive environment in which the Company operates, all of which could have a material effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and in M&#38;T&#8217;s ability to pay dividends. For additional information concerning this comprehensive regulatory framework, refer to Part I, Item 1 of M&#38;T&#8217;s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Segment Information

The Company's reportable segments have been determined based upon its internal profitability reporting system, which is organized by strategic business unit. Financial information about the Company's segments is presented in note 14 of Notes to Financial Statements. The reportable segments are Business Banking, Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Discretionary Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking and Retail Banking. 

The Business Banking segment contributed net income of $46 million during the three-month period ended March 31, 2021, compared with $33 million in the first quarter of 2020 and $53 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. As compared with the year-earlier quarter, a $22 million increase in net interest income and a $6 million reduction in the provision for credit losses, due to lower net charge-offs, were partially offset by higher personnel-related costs of $4 million and a $3 million decrease in service charges on deposit accounts. The higher net interest income reflected higher average outstanding balances of deposits and loans of $5.0 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, and a 76 basis point widening of the net interest margin on loans offset, in part, by a narrowing of the net interest margin on deposits of 111 basis points. The decline in net income in the initial 2021 quarter as compared with the immediately preceding quarter reflected a $5 million increase in personnel-related costs, lower merchant discount and credit card fees of $2 million, and $2 million of higher centrally-allocated costs associated with data processing, risk management and other support services provided to the Business Banking segment. 

Net income of the Commercial Banking segment was $123 million in the recent quarter, compared with $144 million in the initial 2020 quarter and $122 million in the final 2020 quarter. The recent quarter&#8217;s decline in net income as compared with the first quarter of 2020 included an increase in the provision for credit losses of $26 million that reflected the impact of portfolio composition and net charge-offs, and a $5 million decrease in trading account and foreign exchange gains that resulted from lower activity related to interest rate swap agreements 

- 72 -

&#160;

executed on behalf of commercial customers. Those unfavorable factors were offset, in part, by a decline in personnel-related costs of $4 million. The slight increase in net income in the first quarter of 2021 quarter as compared with the fourth quarter of 2020 was due to higher fees for providing loan syndication services of $6 million and lower personnel-related costs of $6 million, partially offset by a $7 million increase in the provision for credit losses. 

The Commercial Real Estate segment recorded net income of $71 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared with $117 million in the year-earlier period and $70 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. The 39% decline in net income in the recent quarter as compared with the first quarter of 2020 reflected an increase in the provision for credit losses of $36 million, due to higher net charge-offs, a $13 million decline in net interest income, and lower trading account and foreign exchange gains of $10 million, due largely to decreased activity related to interest rate swap transactions executed on behalf of commercial customers. The lower net interest income reflected a narrowing of the net interest margin on deposits and loans of 105 basis points and 19 basis points, respectively. The recent quarter&#8217;s modest improvement in net income as compared with the immediately preceding quarter reflected decreases in the provision for credit losses and personnel-related expenses that were largely offset by a decline in commercial mortgage banking revenues, reflecting lower gains on loans originated for sale, and a decrease in net interest income. The $9 million decline in net interest income reflected a narrowing of the net interest margin on deposits and loans of 16 basis points and 3 basis points, respectively.

Net income earned by the Discretionary Portfolio segment totaled $91 million during the three-month period ended March 31, 2021, compared with $26 million in the year-earlier period and $108 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. The significant improvement in the recent quarter&#8217;s net income as compared with the initial 2020 quarter was predominantly due to an increase in net interest income of $77 million that reflected additional income from interest rate swap agreements utilized as part of the Company&#8217;s management of interest rate risk of $55 million. A 148 basis point and 55 basis point widening of the net interest margin on loans and deposits, respectively, also contributed to the higher net interest income. The 17% decline in net income in the initial 2021 quarter as compared with immediately preceding quarter reflected $12 million of valuation losses on marketable equity securities in the recent quarter (compared with valuation gains of $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2020) and lower net interest income of $7 million, largely reflecting a narrowing of the net interest margin on loans of 41 basis points.

Net income from the Residential Mortgage Banking segment was $50 million in the initial three months of 2021, compared with $25 million in the first quarter of 2020 and $27 million in 2020&#8217;s fourth quarter. The increase in net income in the recent quarter as compared with the year-earlier period reflected lower servicing-related costs (including intersegment costs and changes to the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights) of $21 million, higher net interest income of $18 million, reflecting increased average outstanding balances of loans and deposits of $2.3 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, and higher revenues associated with mortgage origination and sales activities (including intersegment revenues) of $17 million. Those favorable factors were partially offset by an $11 million decrease in revenues associated with servicing and sub-servicing residential real estate loans (including intersegment revenues) and $7 million of increases in centrally-allocated costs associated with data processing, risk management and other support services provided to the Residential Mortgage Banking segment. As compared with the final quarter of 2020, the improved performance in the recent quarter reflected lower servicing-related costs (including intersegment costs and changes to the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights) of $15 million, higher revenues associated with mortgage origination and sales activities (including intersegment revenues) of $6 million, and a $5 million increase in revenues associated with servicing and sub-servicing residential real estate loans (including intersegment revenues).

Net income earned by the Retail Banking segment totaled $85 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared with $110 million in the year-earlier quarter and $83 million in the final 2020 quarter. The 23% decline in net income in the recent quarter as compared with the first quarter of 2020 resulted predominantly from a $46 million decline in net interest income, due largely to an 85 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin on deposits, partially offset by an increase of average outstanding deposit balances of $6.0 billion, and a $10 million decrease in service charges on deposit accounts. Those factors were partially offset by a $17 million decrease in the provision for credit losses, due to lower net charge-offs, and lower personnel-related costs of $7 million. The recent quarter&#8217;s 

- 73 -

&#160;

slightly improved performance as compared with the fourth quarter of 2020 was due to decreases in the provision for credit losses and net occupancy expenses of $12 million. Those favorable factors were offset, in part, by $5 million decreases in each of service charges on deposit accounts and net interest income. The lower net interest income reflected a narrowing of the net interest margin on deposits of 9 basis points that was partially offset by an increase in average outstanding deposit balances of $2.1 billion. 

The &#8220;All Other&#8221; category reflects other activities of the Company that are not directly attributable to the reported segments. Reflected in this category are the amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of financial institutions, distributions from BLG, merger-related expenses resulting from acquisitions, and the net impact of the Company&#8217;s allocation methodologies for internal transfers for funding charges and credits associated with the earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities of the Company&#8217;s reportable segments and the provision for credit losses. The &#8220;All Other&#8221; category also includes trust income of the Company that reflects the ICS and WAS business activities. The various components of the &#8220;All Other&#8221; category resulted in net losses totaling $18 million in the first quarter of 2021 and $186 million in the year-earlier quarter, compared with net income of $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. The significantly lower loss in the recent quarter as compared with the initial 2020 quarter largely reflected: a decrease to the provision for credit losses of $312 million&#59; a $7 million increase in trust income&#59; lower advertising and promotional expenses of $6 million&#59; and the favorable impact from the Company&#8217;s allocation methodologies for internal transfers for funding charges and credits associated with earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities of the Company&#8217;s reportable segments. Those favorable factors were partially offset by lower income from BLG of $23 million&#59; $15 million in higher professional services&#59; and higher personnel-related expenses of $6 million, including incentive-based compensation and employee benefits expenses. As compared with the immediately preceding quarter, factors contributing to the unfavorable performance in the recent quarter included: a $75 million rise in personnel-related costs that included the seasonally higher stock-based compensation and employee benefits expenses&#59; $30 million of income received from BLG in the fourth quarter of 2020&#59; and $18 million of higher professional services costs. Partially offsetting those unfavorable factors were a decrease to the provision for credit losses of $73 million, lower FDIC assessments of $6 million, higher trust income of $5 million in the first quarter of 2021, and the favorable impact from the Company&#8217;s allocation methodologies.

Recent Accounting Developments

A discussion of recent accounting developments is included in note 16 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Forward-Looking Statements

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and other sections of this quarterly report contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the Company&#8217;s business, management&#8217;s beliefs and assumptions made by management. Any statement that does not describe historical or current facts is a forward-looking statement. 

Statements regarding the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations may constitute forward-looking statements and are subject to the risk that the actual effects may differ, possibly materially, from what is reflected in those forward-looking statements due to factors and future developments that are uncertain, unpredictable and in many cases beyond the Company's control, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic, and the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on customers, clients, third parties and the Company.

Statements regarding the Company&#8217;s expectations or predictions regarding the proposed transaction between M&#38;T and People&#8217;s United also are forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the expected timing, completion and effects of the proposed transaction as well as M&#38;T&#8217;s and People&#8217;s United&#8217;s expected financial results, prospects, targets, goals and outlook. 

Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; &#8220;intend,&#8221; &#8220;target,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;continue,&#8221; &#8220;positions,&#8221; &#8220;prospects&#8221; or &#8220;potential,&#8221; by future conditional verbs such as &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; or &#8220;may,&#8221; or by variations of such words or by similar expressions. These 

- 74 -

&#160;

statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions (&#8220;Future Factors&#8221;) which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the Company assumes no duty to update forward-looking statements. 

Future Factors include changes in interest rates, spreads on earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and interest rate sensitivity&#59; prepayment speeds, loan originations, credit losses and market values on loans, collateral securing loans, and other assets&#59; sources of liquidity&#59; common shares outstanding&#59; common stock price volatility&#59; fair value of and number of stock-based compensation awards to be issued in future periods&#59; risks, predictions and uncertainties relating to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the People&#8217;s United transaction&#59; the impact of changes in market values on trust-related revenues&#59; legislation and/or regulations affecting the financial services industry as a whole, and M&#38;T and its subsidiaries individually or collectively, including tax legislation or regulation&#59; regulatory supervision and oversight, including monetary policy and capital requirements&#59; changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, regulatory agencies or legislation&#59; increasing price and product/service competition by competitors, including new entrants&#59; rapid technological developments and changes&#59; the ability to continue to introduce competitive new products and services on a timely, cost-effective basis&#59; the mix of products/services&#59; containing costs and expenses&#59; governmental and public policy changes&#59; protection and validity of intellectual property rights&#59; reliance on large customers&#59; technological, implementation and cost/financial risks in large, multi-year contracts&#59; the outcome of pending and future litigation and governmental proceedings, including tax-related examinations and other matters&#59; continued availability of financing&#59; financial resources in the amounts, at the times and on the terms required to support M&#38;T and its subsidiaries' future businesses&#59; and material differences in the actual financial results of merger, acquisition and investment activities compared with M&#38;T's initial expectations, including the full realization of anticipated cost savings and revenue enhancements. 

These are representative of the Future Factors that could affect the outcome of the forward-looking statements. In addition, such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates, general economic and political conditions, either nationally or in the states in which M&#38;T and its subsidiaries do business, including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes and trends in the securities markets, and other Future Factors.

M&#38;T provides further detail regarding these risks, uncertainties and other factors elsewhere in this quarterly report and in other public filings, including the risk factors described in Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 and this quarterly report.
