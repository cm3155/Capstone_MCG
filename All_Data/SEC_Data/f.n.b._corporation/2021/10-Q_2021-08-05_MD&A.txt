 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

MD&#38;A represents an overview of and highlights material changes to our financial condition and consolidated results of operations at and for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. This MD&#38;A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto contained herein and our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 25, 2021. Our results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2021 are not necessarily indicative of results expected for the full year. 

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 

This Report may contain statements regarding our outlook for earnings, revenues, expenses, tax rates, capital and liquidity levels and ratios, asset quality levels, financial position and other matters regarding or affecting our current or future business and operations. These statements can be considered &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve various assumptions, risks and uncertainties which can change over time. Actual results or future events may be different from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements and may not align with historical performance and events. As forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, caution should be exercised against placing undue reliance upon such statements. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as "believe," "plan," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "outlook," "estimate," "forecast," "will," "should," "project," "goal," and other similar words and expressions. We do not assume any duty to update forward-looking statements, except as required by federal securities laws. 

Our forward-looking statements are subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties: 

&#8226; Our business, financial results and balance sheet values are affected by business, economic and political circumstances, including, but not limited to: (i) developments with respect to the U.S. and global financial markets; (ii) actions by the FRB, FDIC, UST, OCC and other governmental agencies, especially those that impact money supply, market interest rates or otherwise affect business activities of the financial services industry; (iii) a slowing of the U.S. economic environment; (iv) the impacts of tariffs or other trade policies of the U.S. or its global trading partners; and the sociopolitical environment in the U.S. 

&#8226; Business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses, including, where appropriate, through effective use of systems and controls, third-party insurance, derivatives, and capital management techniques, and to meet evolving regulatory capital and liquidity standards. 

&#8226; Competition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention, and on credit spreads, deposit gathering and product pricing, which can affect market share, deposits and revenues. Our ability to anticipate, react quickly and continue to respond to technological changes and COVID-19 challenges can also impact our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands. 

&#8226; Business and operating results can also be affected by widespread natural and other disasters, pandemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic crisis, dislocations, terrorist activities, system failures, security breaches, significant political events, cyber-attacks or international hostilities through impacts on the economy and financial markets generally, or on us or our counterparties specifically. 

&#8226; Legal, regulatory and accounting developments could have an impact on our ability to operate and grow our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, competitive position, and reputation. Reputational impacts could affect matters such as business generation and retention, liquidity, funding, and the ability to attract and retain management. These developments could include: 

&#9702; Changes resulting from a new U.S. presidential administration, including legislative and regulatory reforms, different approaches to supervisory or enforcement priorities, changes affecting oversight of the financial services industry, regulatory obligations or restrictions, consumer protection, taxes, employee benefits, compensation practices, pension, bankruptcy and other industry aspects, and changes in accounting policies and principles. 

&#9702; Changes to regulations or accounting standards governing bank capital requirements, loan loss reserves and liquidity standards. 

&#9702; Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or other claims and regulatory and other governmental investigations or other inquiries. These matters may result in monetary judgments or settlements or other 

remedies, including fines, penalties, restitution or alterations in our business practices, and in additional expenses and collateral costs, and may cause reputational harm to FNB. 

&#9702; Results of the regulatory examination and supervision process, including our failure to satisfy requirements imposed by the federal bank regulatory agencies or other governmental agencies. 

&#9702; The impact on our financial condition, results of operations, financial disclosures and future business strategies related to the impact on the ACL due to changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions as a result of applying the &#8220;current expected credit loss&#8221; accounting standard, or CECL. 

&#9702; A failure or disruption in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, including as a result of cyber-attacks or campaigns. 

&#8226; The COVID-19 pandemic and the federal, state, and local regulatory and governmental actions implemented in response to COVID-19 have resulted in a deterioration and disruption of the financial markets and national and local economic conditions, increased levels of unemployment and business failures, and the potential to have a material impact on, among other things, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or on our management, employees, customers and critical vendors and suppliers. In view of the many unknowns associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, our forward-looking statements continue to be subject to various conditions that may be substantially different in the future than what we are currently experiencing or expecting, including, but not limited to, a prolonged recovery of the U.S. economy and labor market and the possible change in commercial and consumer customer fundamentals, expectations and sentiments. As a result, the COVID-19 impact, including uncertainty regarding the potential impact of variant mutations of the virus, U.S. government responsive measures to manage it or provide financial relief, the uncertainty regarding its duration and the success of vaccination efforts, it is possible the pandemic may have a material adverse impact on our business, operations and financial performance. 

The risks identified here are not exclusive or the types of risks we may confront and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of these risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risk factors and other uncertainties described under Item 1A. Risk Factors and the Risk Management sections of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K , our subsequent 2021 Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q (including the risk factors and risk management discussions) and our other 2021 filings with the SEC, which are available on our corporate website at https://www.fnb-online.com/about-us/investor-relations-shareholder-services. More specifically, our forward-looking statements may be subject to the evolving risks and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its macro-economic impact and the resulting governmental, business and societal responses to it. We have included our web address as an inactive textual reference only. Information on our website is not part of our SEC filings. 

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

A description of our critical accounting policies is included in the MD&#38;A section of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 25, 2021 under the heading &#8220;Application of Critical Accounting Policies&#8221;. There have been no significant changes in critical accounting policies or the assumptions and judgments utilized in applying these policies since December 31, 2020. 

USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS 

To supplement our Consolidated Financial Statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as operating net income available to common stockholders, operating earnings per diluted common share, return on average tangible common equity, return on average tangible assets, tangible book value per common share, the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets, the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets, ACL to loans and leases, excluding PPP loans, pre-provision net revenue to average tangible common equity, efficiency ratio and net interest margin (FTE) to provide information useful to investors in understanding our operating performance and trends, and to facilitate comparisons with the performance of our peers. Management uses these measures internally to assess and better understand our underlying business performance and trends related to core business activities. The non-GAAP financial measures and key performance indicators we use may differ from the non-GAAP financial measures and key performance indicators other financial institutions use to assess their performance and trends. 

These non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplemental in nature, and not as a substitute for or superior to, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. When non-GAAP financial measures are disclosed, the SEC's Regulation G requires: (i) the presentation of the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and (ii) a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure presented and the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of non-GAAP operating 

measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included later in this report under the heading &#8220;Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Indicators to GAAP&#8221;. 

Management believes charges such as branch consolidation costs and COVID-19 expenses are not organic costs to run our operations and facilities. These charges are considered significant items impacting earnings as they are deemed to be outside of ordinary banking activities. The branch consolidation charges principally represent expenses to satisfy contractual obligations of the closed branches without any useful ongoing benefit to us. These costs are specific to each individual transaction, and may vary significantly based on the size and complexity of the transaction. The COVID-19 expenses represent special Company initiatives to support our employees and the communities we serve during an unprecedented time of a pandemic. 

To facilitate peer comparisons of net interest margin and efficiency ratio, we use net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets (loans and investments) to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments (this adjustment is not permitted under GAAP). Taxable-equivalent amounts for the 2021 and 2020 periods were calculated using a federal statutory income tax rate of 21%. 

FINANCIAL SUMMARY 

Net income available to common stockholders for the second quarter of 2021 was $99.4 million or $0.31 per diluted common share, compared to net income available to common stockholders for the second quarter of 2020 of $81.6 million or $0.25 per diluted common share. On an operating basis, the second quarter of 2021 earnings per diluted common share (non-GAAP) was also $0.31, excluding $2.6 million of significant items. On an operating basis, the second quarter of 2020, was $0.26, excluding $0.01 for significant items. 

Total revenue increased to $308 million as customer activity accelerated across our footprint, highlighted by strong sequential quarter total loan growth of 9% (annualized), excluding PPP. During the quarter, our business continued to benefit from strengthening economic conditions and positive credit quality trends which resulted in a corresponding reduction in provision expense. The second quarter results were also supported by continued expense discipline, reflecting a $5 million, or 3% linked-quarter, decrease in operating expenses, as well as diversified revenue sources with strong contributions from record wealth management revenues, as well as solid contributions from mortgage banking, capital markets, insurance and SBA lending. Our financial results reflected a return on tangible common equity (non-GAAP) of 16% and tangible book value per share (non-GAAP) growth of $0.19, or 2%, to $8.20 linked-quarter. 

Income Statement Highlights (Second quarter of 2021 compared to second quarter of 2020, except as noted) 

&#8226; Earnings per diluted common share were $0.31, compared to $0.25, in the second quarter of 2020, and $0.28 in the first quarter of 2021. 

&#8226; Operating earnings per diluted common share (non-GAAP) was $0.31, compared to $0.26, an increase of 19.2%. 

&#8226; Total revenue of $307.6 million, up 0.7%, compared to $305.6 million, and up 0.6% compared to $305.7 million in the first quarter of 2021. 

&#8226; Net interest income remained stable at $227.9 million as an improved funding mix offset lower yields on earnings assets. A $2.1 billion increase in low yielding interest-bearing deposits with banks was a significant contribution to the reduced earning asset yield. 

&#8226; Net interest margin (FTE) (non-GAAP) declined 18 basis points to 2.70% from 2.88%, as earning asset yields decreased 54 basis points primarily reflecting the impact of significant reductions in the short-term benchmark interest rates on variable-rate loans, significantly lower yields on investment securities and the effect of higher average cash balances on the mix of earning assets. Partially offsetting the lower earning asset yields, the total cost of funds improved 37 basis points to 0.30%, due to a 48 basis point reduction in interest-bearing deposit costs and an improved funding mix. On a linked-quarter basis, the net interest margin (FTE) (non-GAAP) decreased 5 basis points to 2.70% as earning asset yields declined 9 basis points and the total cost of funds decreased 6 basis points, with the cost of interest-bearing deposits decreasing 7 basis points. 

&#8226; The annualized net charge-offs to total average loans ratio was 0.06%, compared to 0.13%, with favorable asset quality trends across the loan portfolio. 

&#8226; The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $1.1 million for the second quarter, compared to an expense of $5.9 million in the first quarter of 2021 and $30.2 million in the second quarter of 2020. 

&#8226; Non-interest income of $79.8 million increased $2.1 million, or 2.8%, due to record wealth management revenue, higher service charges driven by increased customer activity and increased SBA contributions, partially offset by lower contributions from mortgage banking and capital markets given the change in market conditions for each of those business units in the second quarter of 2021. 

&#8226; The effective tax rate was 19.7%, compared to 16.0% due to the benefits from renewable energy investment tax credits recognized in the year-ago quarter. 

&#8226; The efficiency ratio (non-GAAP) equaled 56.8%, compared to 53.7%. 

Balance Sheet Highlights (period-end balances, June 30, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020, unless otherwise indicated) 

&#8226; Total average loans decreased $0.2 billion, or 0.8%, compared to the second quarter of 2020 reflecting commercial loan growth of $0.4 billion, or 2.5%, offset by a $0.6 billion, or 7.4%, decrease in average consumer loans primarily attributable to the sale of $0.5 billion in indirect auto loans in November 2020. 

&#8226; PPP loans outstanding totaled $1.6 billion at June 30, 2021, reflecting $2.0 billion in SBA loan forgiveness processed to date. There were $2.5 billion PPP loans outstanding at June 30, 2020. 

&#8226; Total average deposits grew $3.2 billion, or 11.9%, compared to the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to increases in average non-interest-bearing deposits of $1.9 billion, or 23.5%, and interest-bearing demand deposits of $1.9 billion, or 16.1%, partially offset by a decrease in average time deposits of $1.1 billion, or 25.9%. Average deposit growth reflected inflows from the PPP and government stimulus activities, in addition to organic growth in new and existing customer relationships, as well as current customer preferences to maintain larger balances in their deposit accounts than before the pandemic. 

&#8226; The ratio of loans to deposits was 82.4%, compared to 87.4%, as deposit growth outpaced loan growth. Additionally, the funding mix continued to improve with non-interest-bearing deposits totaling 33% of total deposits, compared to 31%. Cash balances increased $1.6 billion to $2.9 billion due primarily to deposits from PPP funding and government stimulus inflows. 

&#8226; Total assets were $38.4 billion, compared to $37.4 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion, or 2.8%, primarily due to the increase in cash and cash equivalents due to significant deposit growth. 

&#8226; The dividend payout ratio for the second quarter of 2021 was 39.1%, compared to 48.1% for the second quarter of 2020. 

&#8226; The ratio of the ACL to total loans and leases decreased to 1.42% from 1.43% at December 31, 2020. Excluding PPP loans that do not carry an ACL due to a 100% government guarantee, the ACL to total loan and leases ratio (non-GAAP) equaled 1.51%, compared to 1.56% at December 31, 2020. The ACL on loans and leases totaled $357 million at June 30, 2021, compared to $363 million at December 31, 2020. 

&#8226; Tangible book value per share (non-GAAP) of $8.20, increased $0.57, or 7% from June 30, 2020, reflecting FNB's continued strategy to build tangible book value per share while optimizing capital deployment. No shares were repurchased during the second quarter of 2021. 

&#8226; The CET1 regulatory capital ratio increased to 9.9%, up from 9.8%.

Industry Developments 

LIBOR 

The United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), who is the regulator of LIBOR, announced on March 5, 2021 that they will no longer require any panel bank to continue to submit LIBOR after December 31, 2021. As it pertains to U.S. dollar LIBOR, the FCA will consider the case to require continued publication of a number of LIBOR settings through June 30, 2023. Bank regulators, in a joint statement, have urged banks to stop using LIBOR altogether on new transactions by the end of 2021 to avoid the possible creation of safety and soundness risk. The FRB of New York has created a working group called the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (ARRC) to assist U.S. institutions in transitioning away from LIBOR as a benchmark 

interest rate. The ARRC has recommended the use of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as a replacement index for LIBOR. 

Similarly, we created an internal transition team that is managing our transition away from LIBOR. This transition team is a cross-functional team composed of representatives from the commercial, retail and mortgage banking lines of business, as well as representatives of loan operations, information technology, legal, finance and other support functions. The transition team has completed an assessment of tasks needed for the transition, identified contracts that contain LIBOR language, is in the process of reviewing existing contract language for the presence of appropriate fallback rate language, developed and implemented loan fallback rate language for when LIBOR is retired and identified risks associated with the transition. The transition team is considering SOFR and credit-sensitive alternative indices, that may gain market acceptance, as a replacement to LIBOR. The financial impact regarding pricing, valuation and operations of the transition is not yet known. Our transition team will work within the guidelines established by the FCA and ARRC to provide for a smooth transition away from LIBOR. 

As of June 30, 2021, approximately 40% of our loan portfolio consisted of loans whose variable rate index is LIBOR. Effective October 1, 2020, we finalized the transition to SOFR for all new adjustable rate mortgage originations. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Three Months Ended June 30, 2021 Compared to the Three Months Ended June 30, 2020 

Net income available to common stockholders for the three months ended June 30, 2021 was $99.4 million or $0.31 per diluted common share, compared to net income available to common stockholders for the three months ended June 30, 2020 of $81.6 million or $0.25 per diluted common share. The results for the second quarter of 2021 reflect a provision for credit losses net benefit of $1.1 million due to continued improvement in the underlying portfolio credit trends. This compares to provision expense of $30.2 million for the second quarter of 2020, reflecting COVID-19 related impacts on our ACL modeling results. Non-interest income for the second quarter of 2021 included record wealth management revenue of $15.0 million and contributions from increased SBA premium income. Non-interest expense for the second quarter of 2021 increased $6.6 million primarily due to higher salaries and employee benefits from higher production-related commissions and normal annual merit increases. 

Financial highlights are summarized below:

(1) The average balances and yields earned on securities are based on historical cost. 

(2) The interest income amounts are reflected on an FTE basis (non-GAAP), which adjusts for the tax benefit of income on certain tax-exempt loans and investments using the federal statutory tax rate of 21%. The yield on earning assets and the net interest margin are presented on an FTE basis. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and provides relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. 

(3) Average balances include non-accrual loans. Loans and leases consist of average total loans less average unearned income. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) decreased $0.5 million, or 0.2%, from $231.1 million for the second quarter of 2020 to $230.6 million for the second quarter of 2021. Average interest-earning assets of $34.2 billion increased $2.0 billion, or 6.2%, from 2020, due to a $2.1 billion increase in average cash balances largely due to the continued impact from government stimulus and deposits from PPP fundings, solid origination activity across our footprint and benefits from PPP activity. Average interest-bearing liabilities of $23.1 billion decreased $0.3 billion, or 1.2%, from 2020, this was driven by a decrease in average borrowings of $1.6 billion partially offset by an increase of $1.3 billion in average interest-bearing deposits which included deposits for PPP funding and government stimulus activities, as well as solid organic growth in customer relationships. Our net interest margin FTE (non-GAAP) declined 18 basis points to 2.70%, as earning asset yields decreased 54 basis points primarily reflecting the impact of significant reductions in the short-term benchmark interest rates on variable-rate loans, significantly lower yields on investment securities and the effect of higher average cash balances on the mix of earning assets. Partially offsetting the lower earning asset yields, the total cost of funds improved 37 basis points to 0.30%, compared to 0.67%, due to a 48 basis point reduction in interest-bearing deposit costs and an improved funding mix. 

The following table provides certain information regarding changes in net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) attributable to changes in the average volumes and yields earned on interest-earning assets and the average volume and rates paid for interest-bearing liabilities for the three months ended June 30, 2021, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2020:

(1) The amount of change not solely due to rate or volume changes was allocated between the change due to rate and the change due to volume based on the net size of the rate and volume changes. 

(2) Interest income amounts are reflected on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) which adjusts for the tax benefit of income on certain tax-exempt loans and investments using the federal statutory tax rate of 21%. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and provides relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. 

Interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) of $255.6 million for the second quarter of 2021, decreased $28.4 million, or 10.0%, from the same quarter of 2020, primarily due to the repricing impact from lower interest rates, partially offset by increased interest-earning assets of $2.0 billion. The increase in interest-earning assets was primarily driven by a $2.1 billion increase in average cash balances largely due to the continued impact from government stimulus and deposits from PPP fundings, partially offset by a $204.8 million, or 0.8%, decrease in average loans and leases. Average commercial loan growth totaled $431.1 million, or 2.5%. Excluding the PPP loans, commercial loan origination activity remained solid with organic growth in the Pittsburgh, Mid-Atlantic (Washington D.C., northern Virginia and Maryland markets), Cleveland, Raleigh, and South Carolina regions. Average consumer loans declined $0.6 billion, or 7.4%, primarily due to the sale of $0.5 billion of indirect auto installment loans in November 2020. Since PPP inception we originated $3.6 billion of PPP loans and had $2.0 billion in total PPP forgiveness. The yield on average interest-earning assets (non-GAAP) decreased 54 basis points from 

3.54% for the second quarter of 2020 to 3.00% for the second quarter of 2021, primarily reflecting the impact on the variable rate loans of significant reductions in 1-month LIBOR and the Prime rate. 

Interest expense of $25.0 million for the second quarter of 2021 decreased $27.9 million, or 52.8%, from the same quarter of 2020, due to a decrease in rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities and growth in average non-interest-bearing deposits over the same quarter of 2020. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $1.3 billion, or 6.9%, and average non-interest-bearing deposits increased $1.9 billion, or 23.5%. The growth in average deposits reflected inflows from the PPP and government stimulus activities, in addition to organic growth in new and existing customer relationships, as well as recent customer preferences to maintain larger deposit account balances than before the pandemic. Average short-term borrowings decreased $0.9 billion, or 35.4%, primarily reflecting decreases of $834.5 million and $226.5 million in short-term FHLB advances and federal funds purchased, respectively, partially offset by an increase of $115.7 million in customer repurchase accounts. Average long-term borrowings decreased $0.7 billion, or 41.5%, reflecting a decrease of $0.7 billion in long-term FHLB advances. During 2020, we utilized excess low-yielding cash to opportunistically terminate $715 million of FHLB borrowings, and in certain instances, the related interest rate swap. The terminated FHLB borrowings had a 2.49% interest rate with a remaining term of 1.6 years. The rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities decreased 48 basis points from 0.91% to 0.43% for the second quarter of 2021, primarily due to the interest rate actions made by the FOMC and our actions taken to reduce the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

Provision for credit losses is determined based on management&#8217;s estimates of the appropriate level of allowance for credit losses needed to absorb probable life-of-loan losses in the loan and lease portfolio, after giving consideration to charge-offs and recoveries for the period. The following table presents information regarding the credit loss expense and net charge-offs: 

TABLE 6 

Three Months Ended June 30, $ % (dollars in thousands) 2021 2020 Change Change Provision for credit losses (on loans and leases) $ (1,706) $ 30,177 $ (31,883) (105.7) %

Provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $1.1 million during the second quarter of 2021, a decrease of $32.5 million, from the same period of 2020. The second quarter of 2021 net benefit is comprised of $1.7 million net benefit on loan and leases outstanding and $0.6 million provision expense for unfunded loan commitments. The decrease reflects favorable credit quality and broad improvement across all loan portfolio credit metrics, with the year-ago quarter level primarily attributable to COVID-19 related impacts on macroeconomic forecasts used in the ACL model. Net loan charge-offs were $3.8 million, a decrease of $4.7 million. For additional information relating to the allowance and provision for credit losses, refer to the Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases section of this Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis. 

Non-Interest Income 

The breakdown of non-interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 is presented in the following table: 

TABLE 7 

Three Months Ended June 30, $ % (dollars in thousands) 2021 2020 Change Change Service charges $ 29,726 &#160; $ 23,938 $ 5,788 24.2 % Trust services 9,282 &#160; 7,350 1,932 26.3 Insurance commissions and fees 6,227 &#160; 5,835 392 6.7 Securities commissions and fees 5,747 &#160; 3,763 1,984 52.7 Capital markets income 7,012 &#160; 12,515 (5,503) (44.0) Mortgage banking operations 7,422 &#160; 16,550 (9,128) (55.2) Dividends on non-marketable equity securities 2,383 &#160; 2,766 (383) (13.8) Bank owned life insurance 4,766 &#160; 3,924 842 21.5 Net securities gains 87 &#160; 97 (10) (10.3) Other 7,120 &#160; 890 6,230 700.0 Total non-interest income $ 79,772 &#160; $ 77,628 $ 2,144 2.8 % 

Total non-interest income increased $2.1 million, or 2.8%, at $79.8 million for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $77.6 million the second quarter of 2020. The variances in the individual non-interest income items are explained in the following paragraphs. 

Service charges on loans and deposits of $29.7 million for the second quarter of 2021 increased $5.8 million, or 24.2%, from the same period of 2020, as the year-ago quarter reflected reduced customer activity at the beginning of the pandemic. 

Trust services of $9.3 million for the second quarter of 2021 increased $1.9 million, or 26.3%, from the same period of 2020. We continued to generate strong organic growth in accounts and services, while the market value of assets under management increased $1.5 billion, or 24.3%, to $7.6 billion at June 30, 2021. 

Securities commissions and fees of $5.7 million for the second quarter of 2021 increased $2.0 million, or 52.7%, from the same period of 2020 due to strong activity levels across the footprint. 

Capital markets decreased $5.5 million, or 44.0%, due to lower customer swap activity compared to the record levels in the beginning of 2020 given heightened volatility in interest rates last year. 

Mortgage banking operations income of $7.4 million for the second quarter of 2021 decreased $9.1 million, or 55.2%, from the same period of 2020, as the gain-on-sale margins tightened meaningfully in the second quarter of 2021 and mortgage held-for-sale pipelines declined from elevated levels, while sold production levels remained solid. During the second quarter of 2021, we sold $540.5 million of residential mortgage loans, compared to $437.7 million for the same period of 2020, an increase of 23.5%. 

Dividends on non-marketable equity securities of $2.4 million for the second quarter of 2021 decreased $0.4 million, or 13.8%, from the same period of 2020, primarily due to a decrease in the FHLB dividend rate and lower levels of FHLB borrowings given the strong growth in deposits. 

BOLI income of $4.8 million for the second quarter of 2021 increased $0.8 million, or 21.5%, from the same period of 2020, primarily due to life insurance claims. 

Other non-interest income was $7.1 million and $0.9 million for the second quarter of 2021 and 2020, respectively. The second quarter of 2021 included $2.0 million more in SBA premium income, $1.7 million more from improved Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) fund performance and various miscellaneous increases. 

Non-Interest Expense 

The breakdown of non-interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 is presented in the following table: 

TABLE 8 

Three Months Ended June 30, $ % (dollars in thousands) 2021 2020 Change Change Salaries and employee benefits $ 102,073 &#160; $ 93,992 $ 8,081 8.6 % Net occupancy 16,296 &#160; 13,594 2,702 19.9 Equipment 17,160 &#160; 15,610 1,550 9.9 Amortization of intangibles 3,024 &#160; 3,343 (319) (9.5) Outside services 18,695 &#160; 17,000 1,695 10.0 FDIC insurance 4,208 &#160; 5,371 (1,163) (21.7) Bank shares and franchise taxes 3,576 &#160; 4,029 (453) (11.2) Other 17,468 &#160; 22,993 (5,525) (24.0) Total non-interest expense $ 182,500 &#160; $ 175,932 $ 6,568 3.7 % 

Total non-interest expense of $182.5 million for the second quarter of 2021 increased $6.6 million, or 3.7%, from the same period of 2020. Non-interest expense increased $5.9 million, or 3.4%, on an operating basis when excluding $2.6 million of branch consolidation costs in the second quarter of 2021 and $2.0 million of COVID-19 expenses in the second quarter of 2020. The variances in the individual non-interest expense items are further explained in the following paragraphs. 

Salaries and employee benefits of $102.1 million for the second quarter of 2021 increased $8.1 million, or 8.6%, from the same period of 2020, primarily due to increased production-related commissions of $2.8 million and the normal impact from annual merit increases. Additionally, we recorded $0.6 million in COVID-19 salaries and employee benefits expenses during the second quarter of 2020. 

Net occupancy and equipment expense of $33.5 million for the second quarter of 2021 increased $4.3 million, or 14.6%, from $29.2 million for the same period of 2020, reflecting $2.1 million in branch consolidation costs during the second quarter of 2021, combined with continued investment in both the physical and digital channels. 

Outside services expense of $18.7 million for the second quarter of 2021 increased $1.7 million, or 10.0%, from $17.0 million from the same period of 2020, due to various increases related to third-party technology providers, legal costs and other consulting engagements. 

FDIC insurance of $4.2 million for the second quarter of 2021 decreased $1.2 million, or 21.7%, from the same period of 2020 as deposit growth provided additional liquidity and resulted in a lower FDIC assessment rate. 

Other non-interest expense was $17.5 million and $23.0 million for the second quarter of 2021 and 2020, respectively. During the second quarter of 2021, we recorded $0.5 million in branch consolidation costs in other non-interest expense. During the second quarter of 2020, we recorded $1.1 million of COVID-19 related expenses and an impairment charge of $4.1 million from a renewable energy investment tax credit transaction in other non-interest expense. The related renewable energy investment tax credits were recognized during the same quarter as a benefit to income taxes. 

The following table presents non-interest expense excluding significant items for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020:

Income Taxes 

The following table presents information regarding income tax expense and certain tax rates: 

TABLE 10 

&#160; Three Months Ended June 30, (dollars in thousands) 2021 2020 Income tax expense $ 24,882 &#160; $ 15,870 Effective tax rate 19.7 &#160; % 16.0 % Statutory federal tax rate 21.0 &#160; 21.0 

Both periods&#8217; tax rates are lower than the federal statutory tax rates of 21% due to tax benefits primarily resulting from tax-exempt income on investments and loans, tax credits and income from BOLI. Income tax expense was lower in 2020 due to lower pre-tax income levels and the impact from renewable energy investment tax credits in the second quarter of 2020. 

Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 Compared to the Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 

Net income available to common stockholders for the first six months of 2021 was $190.6 million or $0.59 per diluted common share, compared to net income available to common stockholders for the first six months of 2020 of $127.0 million or $0.39 per diluted common share. The provision for credit losses for the first six months of 2021 totaled $4.8 million, due to continued improvement in the underlying portfolio credit trends. This compares to $78.0 million in the first six months of 2020, due to the COVID-19 related impacts on macroeconomic forecasts used in the ACL model. Non-interest income totaled $162.6 million, increasing $16.4 million, or 11.2%, with broad-based contributions from across our businesses. Non-interest expense totaled $367.4 million, decreasing $3.5 million, or 0.9%. The first six months of 2021 included the impact of branch consolidations costs of $2.6 million. The first six months of 2020 included the impact of branch consolidation costs of $8.3 million and COVID-19 related expenses of $4.0 million.

The yield on earning assets and the net interest margin are presented on an FTE basis. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and provides relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. 

(3) Average balances include non-accrual loans. Loans and leases consist of average total loans less average unearned income. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) totaled $456.4 million, decreasing $10.6 million, or 2.3%. The decrease was primarily caused by the repricing impact on earning asset yields from lower interest rates and was partially offset by significant interest-earning asset growth of $2.5 billion or 8.1%. The net interest margin (FTE) (non-GAAP) declined 29 basis points to 2.72%. 

The following table provides certain information regarding changes in net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) attributable to changes in the average volumes and yields earned on interest-earning assets and the average volume and rates paid for interest-bearing liabilities for the six months ended June 30, 2021, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2020:

(1) The amount of change not solely due to rate or volume changes was allocated between the change due to rate and the change due to volume based on the net size of the rate and volume changes. 

(2) Interest income amounts are reflected on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) which adjusts for the tax benefit of income on certain tax-exempt loans and investments using the federal statutory tax rate of 21%. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and provides relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. 

Interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) of $509.9 million for the first six months of 2021, decreased $83.5 million, or 14.1%, from the same period of 2020, resulting from the decrease in benchmark interest rates, partially offset by an increase in interest-earning assets of $2.5 billion. The increase in interest-earning assets was primarily driven by a $0.9 billion, or 3.5%, increase in average total loans due to the net benefit from PPP loans and solid origination activity across our footprint. Average commercial loan growth totaled $1.5 billion, or 9.7%, including growth of $0.9 billion, or 13.8%, in commercial and industrial loans. Commercial loan growth was led by healthy commercial activity in the Pittsburgh, Mid-Atlantic, Cleveland and South Carolina regions. Average consumer loans declined $0.7 billion, or 7.9%, primarily due to the sale of $0.5 billion of indirect auto installment loans in November 2020. Additionally, the net reduction in the securities portfolio was a result of management's strategy to deploy excess liquidity into higher yielding loans, as average securities decreased $205.6 million, or 3.3%, given historically low and unattractive interest rates available for reinvestment purposes. For the first six months of 2021, the yield on average interest-earning assets (non-GAAP) decreased 78 basis points to 3.04%, compared to the first six months of 2020, primarily due the lower interest rate environment and the effect of higher average cash balance on the mix of earning assets. 

Interest expense of $53.5 million for the first six months of 2021 decreased $72.9 million, or 57.7%, from the same period of 2020, primarily due to a decrease in rates paid, partially offset by an increase in average interest-bearing deposits. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $1.6 billion, or 8.4%, which reflects the benefit of organic growth, as well as deposits from PPP funding and government stimulus activities. Average long-term borrowings decreased $520.9 million, or 33.7%, primarily due to a decrease of $598.9 million in long-term FHLB borrowings, partially offset by an increase of $88.9 million in senior debt. During 2020, we utilized excess low-yielding cash to opportunistically terminate $715 million of FHLB borrowings, and 

in certain instances, the related interest rate swap. The terminated FHLB borrowings had a 2.49% interest rate with a remaining term of 1.6 years. The rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities decreased 62 basis points to 0.47% for the first six months of 2021, compared to the first six months of 2020, due to the interest rate actions made by the FOMC and our actions taken to reduce the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The following table presents information regarding the credit loss expense and net charge-offs: 

TABLE 15 

Six Months Ended June 30, $ % (dollars in thousands) 2021 2020 Change Change Provision for credit losses (on loans and leases) $ 4,359 &#160; $ 78,005 $ (73,646) (94.4) %

Provision for credit losses was $4.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, a decrease of $75.7 million, from the same period of 2020. This year-to-date amount for 2021 is comprised of $4.4 million expense on loans and leases outstanding and $0.4 million for provision for unfunded loan commitments. The decrease reflects favorable asset quality trends across all loan portfolio credit metrics in 2021 and COVID-19 related impacts on macroeconomic forecasts used in the ACL model in 2020. Net charge-offs were $11.0 million during the six months ended June 30, 2021, compared to $14.2 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020. 

Non-Interest Income 

The breakdown of non-interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 is presented in the following table: 

TABLE 16 

Six Months Ended June 30, $ % (dollars in thousands) 2021 2020 Change Change Service charges $ 57,557 &#160; $ 54,066 $ 3,491 6.5 % Trust services 18,365 &#160; 15,312 3,053 19.9 Insurance commissions and fees 13,412 &#160; 12,387 1,025 8.3 Securities commissions and fees 11,365 &#160; 8,302 3,063 36.9 Capital markets income 14,724 &#160; 23,628 (8,904) (37.7) Mortgage banking operations 23,155 &#160; 15,517 7,638 49.2 Dividends on non-marketable equity securities 4,659 &#160; 7,444 (2,785) (37.4) Bank owned life insurance 7,714 &#160; 7,101 613 8.6 Net securities gains 128 &#160; 150 (22) (14.7) Other 11,498 &#160; 2,247 9,251 411.7 Total non-interest income $ 162,577 &#160; $ 146,154 $ 16,423 11.2 % n/m - not meaningful 

Total non-interest income increased $16.4 million, to $162.6 million for the first six months of 2021, an 11.2% increase from the same period of 2020. The variances in significant individual non-interest income items are further explained in the following paragraphs. 

Service charges on loans and deposits of $57.6 million for the first six months of 2021 increased $3.5 million, or 6.5%, as the first six months of 2020 reflected reduced customer activity at the beginning of the pandemic. 

Trust services of $18.4 million for the first six months of 2021 increased $3.1 million, or 19.9%, from the same period of 2020, primarily driven by strong organic revenue production and the market value of assets under management increasing $1.5 billion, or 24.3%, to $7.6 billion at June 30, 2021. 

Insurance commissions and fees of $13.4 million for the first six months of 2021 increased $1.0 million, or 8.3%, from the same period of 2020, primarily from organic revenue growth due to the benefit of our expanded footprint. 

Securities commissions and fees of $11.4 million for the first six months of 2021 increased $3.1 million, or 36.9%, due to strong activity levels across the footprint. 

Capital markets income of $14.7 million for the first six months of 2021 decreased $8.9 million, or 37.7%, from $23.6 million for the same period of 2020, due to lower customer swap activity compared to the record levels in the beginning of 2020 given heightened volatility in interest rates last year. 

Mortgage banking operations income of $23.2 million for the first six months of 2021 increased $7.6 million, or 49.2%, from the same period of 2020 as sold production levels increased 40%. During the first six months of 2021, we sold $1.1 billion of residential mortgage loans, a 42.1% increase compared to $0.7 billion for the same period of 2020. During the first six months of 2021, we recognized a $2.8 million favorable interest-rate related valuation adjustment on MSRs, compared to an $8.0 million unfavorable adjustment for the same period of 2020. Additionally, we recorded $1.7 million of lower MSR amortization for the first six months of 2021 due to lower prepayment speeds. 

Dividends on non-marketable equity securities of $4.7 million for the first six months of 2021 decreased $2.8 million, or 37.4%, from the same period of 2020, primarily due to a decrease in the FHLB dividend rate and lower levels of FHLB borrowings given the strong growth in deposits. 

Other non-interest income was $11.5 million and $2.2 million for the first six months of 2021 and 2020, respectively. The first six months of 2021 included $2.9 million more in SBA premium income, $2.4 million more from improved Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) fund performance and various miscellaneous increases. 

Non-Interest Expense 

The breakdown of non-interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 is presented in the following table: 

TABLE 17 

Six Months Ended June 30, $ % (dollars in thousands) 2021 2020 Change Change Salaries and employee benefits $ 209,376 &#160; $ 197,797 $ 11,579 5.9 % Net occupancy 32,459 &#160; 35,042 (2,583) (7.4) Equipment 34,190 &#160; 31,656 2,534 8.0 Amortization of intangibles 6,074 &#160; 6,682 (608) (9.1) Outside services 35,624 &#160; 33,896 1,728 5.1 FDIC insurance 9,052 &#160; 10,926 (1,874) (17.2) Bank shares and franchise taxes 7,355 &#160; 8,121 (766) (9.4) Other 33,232 &#160; 46,704 (13,472) (28.8) Total non-interest expense $ 367,362 &#160; $ 370,824 $ (3,462) (0.9) % 

Total non-interest expense of $367.4 million for the first six months of 2021 decreased $3.5 million, a 0.9% decrease from the same period of 2020. On an operating basis, non-interest expense increased $6.1 million, or 1.7%, when excluding significant items of $2.6 million in branch consolidations in the first six months of 2021 compared to $8.3 million in branch consolidation costs and $4.0 million of expenses associated with COVID-19 in the first six months of 2020. The variances in the individual non-interest expense items are further explained in the following paragraphs. 

Salaries and employee benefits of $209.4 million for the first six months of 2021 increased $11.6 million, or 5.9%, from the same period of 2020, primarily related to normal merit increases and production-related commissions and incentives corresponding with strong production levels from mortgage banking and our fee-based businesses. 

Net occupancy and equipment expense of $66.6 million for the first six months of 2021 was essentially flat from the same period of 2020. On an operating basis, net occupancy and equipment expense increased $5.1 million, or 8.7%, primarily due to expansion in key regions such as the Mid-Atlantic and South Carolina and continued digital technology investment in the first six months of 2021. 

Outside services expense of $35.6 million for the first six months of 2021 increased $1.7 million, or 5.1%, from $33.9 million from the same period of 2020, due to various minor increases related to third-party technology providers, legal costs and other consulting engagements. 

FDIC insurance expense of $9.1 million for the first six months of 2021 decreased $1.9 million, or 17.2%, from the first six months of 2020, primarily due to increased subordinated debt at FNBPA and improved liquidity metrics. 

Other non-interest expense was $33.2 million and $46.7 million for the first six months of 2021 and 2020, respectively, as the year-ago period included $2.1 million of COVID-19 related expenses and an impairment charge of $4.1 million from a renewable energy investment tax credit transaction in other non-interest expense. The related renewable energy investment tax credits were recognized during the same year-ago period as a benefit to income taxes. During the first six months of 2021 and 2020, we recorded $0.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively, in branch consolidation costs in other non-interest expense. 

The following table presents non-interest expense excluding significant items for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020:

Income Taxes 

The following table presents information regarding income tax expense and certain tax rates:

Both periods&#8217; tax rates are lower than the federal statutory tax rates of 21% due to tax benefits primarily resulting from tax-exempt income on investments and loans, tax credits and income from BOLI. Income tax expense was lower in 2020 due to lower pre-tax income levels and the impact from renewable energy investment tax credits in the first six months of 2020. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Cash and cash equivalents increased in 2021 primarily due to deposit growth of $1.3 billion from continued customer expansion in our footprint and government stimulus programs including PPP. 

Lending Activity 

The loan and lease portfolio consists principally of loans and leases to individuals and small- and medium-sized businesses within our primary markets in seven states and the District of Columbia. Our market coverage spans several major metropolitan areas including: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Baltimore, Maryland; Cleveland, Ohio; and Charlotte, Raleigh, Durham and the Piedmont Triad (Winston-Salem, Greensboro and High Point) in North Carolina. Since the inception of the PPP program, we originated $3.6 billion of PPP loans, including $1.0 billion during the first six months of 2021. 

Paycheck Protection Program 

The CARES Act included an allocation of $349 billion for loans to be issued by financial institutions through the SBA, utilizing the PPP. The Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act (PPP/HCE Act) was passed by Congress on April 23, 2020 and signed into law on April 24, 2020. The PPP/HCE Act authorized an additional $320 billion of funding for PPP loans. As of June 30, 2021, we had approximately $1.6 billion of PPP loans outstanding, net of unamortized net deferred fees of $44.6 million, which are included in the commercial and industrial category. During the first six months of 2021, $2.0 billion of PPP loan balances were forgiven by the SBA. 

PPP loans are forgivable, in whole or in part, if the proceeds are used for payroll and other permitted purposes in accordance with the requirements of the PPP. Loans closed prior to June 5, 2020, carry a fixed rate of 1.00% and a term of two years, if not forgiven, in whole or in part. Payments are deferred until after a forgiveness determination is made, if submitted within ten months of the end of the loan forgiveness Covered Period. The loans are 100% guaranteed by the SBA, which provides a reduced risk of loss to us on these loans. The SBA pays the originating bank a processing fee ranging from 1% to 5%, based on the size of the loan. This fee is recognized in interest income over the contractual life of the loan under the effective yield method, adjusted for expected prepayments on these pools of homogenous loans. We expect most of the remaining $44.6 million of net deferred fees to be recognized by March 31, 2022 based on expected loan forgiveness activity. On June 5, 2020, the President signed the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act (PPP Flexibility Act) which extended the term for new PPP loans to 5 years and permitted a lender to extend a 2-year PPP loan up to a 5-year term by mutual agreement of the lender 

and borrower. The PPP Flexibility Act also gives the borrower the option of 24 weeks to distribute the funds, and a borrower can remain eligible for loan forgiveness by using at least 60% of the funds for payroll costs. The SBA announced that lenders will have 60 days to review PPP loan forgiveness applications and that the SBA will remit the forgiveness payments within 90 days of receipt of approved forgiveness applications.

The commercial and industrial category includes PPP loans totaling $1.6 billion and $2.2 billion at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

Non-Performing Assets 

Following is a summary of non-performing assets: 

TABLE 22

Non-performing assets decreased $43.5 million, from $180.7 million at December 31, 2020 to $137.3 million at June 30, 2021. This reflects a decrease of $42.1 million in non-performing loans and leases and a decrease of $1.3 million in OREO. The decrease in non-performing loans was driven by the resolution of a few larger commercial credits, and the decrease in OREO was largely driven by the sale of residential mortgage properties. 

If the borrower was not experiencing financial difficulties immediately prior to COVID-19, short-term modifications, such as principal and interest deferments, are not being included in TDRs. These modifications will be closely monitored for any change in status.

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases 

On January 1, 2020, we adopted CECL which changed how we calculate the ACL as more fully described in Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K . The CECL model takes into consideration the expected credit losses over the life of the loan at the time the loan is originated compared to the incurred loss model under the prior standard. The model used to calculate the ACL is dependent on the portfolio composition and credit quality, as well as historical experience, current conditions and forecasts of economic conditions and interest rates. Specifically, the following considerations are incorporated into the ACL calculation: 

&#8226; a third-party macroeconomic forecast scenario; 

&#8226; a 24-month R&#38;S forecast period for macroeconomic factors with a reversion to the historical mean on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period; and 

&#8226; the historical through the cycle default mean calculated using an expanded period to include a prior recessionary period. 

COVID-19 Impacts on the ACL 

Beginning in March 2020, the broader economy experienced a significant deterioration in the macroeconomic environment driven by the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in notable adverse changes to forecasted economic variables utilized in our ACL modeling process. Based on these changes, we utilized a third-party pandemic recessionary scenario from the first quarter of 2020 through the third quarter of 2020 for ACL modeling purposes. At December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2021, we utilized a third-party consensus macroeconomic forecast due to the improving macroeconomic environment. Macroeconomic variables that we utilized from this scenario for our ACL calculation as of December 31, 2020 included, but were not limited to: (i) gross domestic product, which reflects growth of 4% in 2021, (ii) the Dow Jones Total Stock Market Index, which grows steadily throughout the R&#38;S forecast period, (iii) unemployment, which steadily declines and averages 6% over the R&#38;S forecast period and (iv) the Volatility Index, which remains stable over the R&#38;S forecast period. For our ACL calculation at June 30, 2021, the macroeconomic variables that we utilized included, but were not limited to: (i) gross domestic product, which reflects growth of 8% in 2021 and 3% in 2022, (ii) the Dow Jones Total Stock Market Index, which remains relatively flat through the R&#38;S forecast period, (iii) unemployment, which averages 4% over the R&#38;S forecast period and (iv) the Volatility Index, which remains stable over the R&#38;S forecast period. 

The ACL of $356.5 million at June 30, 2021 decreased $6.6 million, or 1.8%, from December 31, 2020 due to the improving credit metrics partially offset by commercial loan growth excluding PPP. Our ending ACL coverage ratio at June 30, 2021 was 1.42%, compared to 1.43% at December 31, 2020. Excluding PPP loans that do not carry an ACL due to a 100% government guarantee, the ACL to total loan and leases ratio equaled 1.51% at June 30, 2021 and 1.56% at December 31, 2020. Total provision for credit losses for the six months ended June 30, 2021 was $4.8 million. Net charge-offs were $11.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, compared to $14.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, reflecting COVID-19 impacts on certain segments of the loan portfolio. The ACL as a percentage of non-performing loans for the total portfolio increased from 213% as of December 31, 2020 to 278% as of June 30, 2021 following the decrease in non-performing loans during the quarter, while the total ACL decreased $6.6 million, as noted above. 

Deposits 

As a bank holding company, our primary source of funds is deposits. These deposits are provided by business, consumer and municipal customers who we serve within our footprint. 

Following is a summary of deposits: 

TABLE 24 

(in millions) June 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 $ Change % Change Non-interest-bearing demand $ 10,198 &#160; $ 9,042 $ 1,156 12.8 % Interest-bearing demand 13,657 &#160; 13,157 500 3.8 Savings 3,413 &#160; 3,261 152 4.7 Certificates and other time deposits 3,201 &#160; 3,662 (461) (12.6) Total deposits $ 30,469 &#160; $ 29,122 $ 1,347 4.6 % 

Total deposits increased $1.3 billion, or 4.6%, from December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of growth in non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing balances due to an expansion of customer relationships and higher customer balances, which were aided by inflows from the PPP and government stimulus activity. Customer preferences continued to shift away from higher rate certificates of deposit to lower yielding, more liquid products. The deposit growth helped us eliminate overnight borrowings and reduce higher-cost short-term FHLB borrowings and their related swaps. 

Capital Resources and Regulatory Matters 

The access to, and cost of, funding for new business initiatives, the ability to engage in expanded business activities, the ability to pay dividends and the level and nature of regulatory oversight depend, in part, on our capital position. 

The assessment of capital adequacy depends on a number of factors such as expected organic growth in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, asset quality, liquidity, earnings performance and sustainability, changing competitive conditions, regulatory changes or actions, and economic forces. We seek to maintain a strong capital base to support our growth and expansion activities, to provide stability to current operations and to promote public confidence. 

We have an effective shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. Pursuant to this registration statement, we may, from time to time, issue and sell in one or more offerings any combination of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts or units. On February 24, 2020, we completed an offering of $300.0 million of 2.20% fixed rate senior notes due in 2023 under this registration statement. The net proceeds of the debt offering after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses were $297.9 million. We used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes for general corporate purposes, which included investments at the holding company level, capital to support the growth of FNBPA, repurchase of our common shares and refinancing of outstanding indebtedness. 

On September 23, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an aggregate of $150 million of our common stock. The repurchases will be made from time to time on the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions. The purchases will be funded from available working capital. There is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that will be repurchased and we may discontinue purchases at any time. Since inception, we repurchased 7.0 million shares at a weighted average share price of $10.62 for $74.6 million under this repurchase program. 

Capital management is a continuous process, with capital plans and stress testing for FNB and FNBPA updated at least annually. These capital plans include assessing the adequacy of expected capital levels assuming various scenarios by projecting capital needs for a forecast period of 2-3 years beyond the current year. From time to time, we issue shares initially acquired by us as treasury stock under our various benefit plans. We may issue additional preferred or common stock to maintain our well-capitalized status. 

FNB and FNBPA are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies (see discussion under &#8220;Enhanced Regulatory Capital Standards&#8221;). Quantitative measures established by regulators to ensure capital adequacy require FNB and FNBPA to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total, tier 1 and CET1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined) and a minimum leverage ratio (as defined). Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could lead to initiation of certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary actions, by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements, dividends and future business and corporate strategies. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, FNB and FNBPA must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. FNB&#8217;s and FNBPA&#8217;s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. 

At June 30, 2021, the capital levels of both FNB and FNBPA exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and their regulatory capital ratios were above the minimum levels required to be considered &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; for regulatory purposes. 

In December 2018, the FRB and other U.S. banking agencies approved a final rule to address the impact of CECL on regulatory capital by allowing BHCs and banks, including FNB, the option to phase in the day-one impact of CECL over a three-year period. In March 2020, the FRB and other U.S. banking agencies issued an interim final rule that became effective on March 31, 2020, and provides BHCs and banks with an alternative option to temporarily delay the impact of CECL, relative to the incurred loss methodology for the ACL, on regulatory capital. We have elected this alternative option instead of the one described in the December 2018 rule. As a result, under the interim final rule, we will delay recognizing the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital until after a two-year deferral period, which for us extends through December 31, 2021. Beginning on January 1, 2022, we will be required to phase in 25% of the previously deferred capital impact of CECL, with an additional 25% to be phased in at the beginning of each subsequent year until fully phased in by the first quarter of 2025. Under the interim final rule, the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital that we will defer and later phase in is calculated as the entire day-one impact at adoption plus 25% of the subsequent change in the ACL during the two-year deferral period. During the second quarter of 2021, the total deferred impact on CET1 capital related to our adoption of CECL was approximately $68.7 million, or 25 basis points. 

In this unprecedented economic and uncertain environment, we frequently run stress tests for a variety of economic situations, including severely adverse scenarios that have economic conditions like the current conditions. Under these scenarios, the results of these stress tests indicate that our regulatory capital ratios would remain above the regulatory requirements and we would be able to maintain appropriate liquidity levels, demonstrating our expected ability to continue to support our constituencies under stressful financial conditions. 

Following are the capital amounts and related ratios for FNB and FNBPA:

In accordance with Basel III Capital Rules, the minimum capital requirements plus capital conservation buffer, which are presented for each period above, represent the minimum requirements needed to avoid limitations on distributions of dividends and certain discretionary bonus payments. 

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) 

The Dodd-Frank Act broadly affects the financial services industry by establishing a framework for systemic risk oversight, creating a resolution authority for institutions determined to be systemically important, mandating higher capital and liquidity requirements, requiring banks to pay increased fees to regulatory agencies and containing numerous other provisions aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services sector that significantly change the system of regulatory oversight as described in more detail under Part I, Item 1, &#8220;Business - Government Supervision and Regulation&#8221; included in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on February 25, 2021. Certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act remain subject to regulatory rulemaking and amendments to such previously promulgated rules, thereby making it difficult to anticipate with certainty the impact to us or the financial services industry resulting from this rulemaking process. 

LIQUIDITY 

Our goal in liquidity management is to satisfy the cash flow requirements of customers and the operating cash needs of FNB with cost-effective funding. Our Board of Directors has established an Asset/Liability Management Policy to guide management in achieving and maintaining earnings performance consistent with long-term goals, while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate risk, a &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; Balance Sheet and adequate levels of liquidity. Our Board of Directors has also established Liquidity and Contingency Funding Policies to guide management in addressing the ability to identify, measure, monitor and control both normal and stressed liquidity conditions. These policies designate our ALCO as the body responsible for meeting these objectives. The ALCO, which is comprised of members of executive management, reviews liquidity on a continuous basis and approves significant changes in strategies that affect Balance Sheet or cash flow positions. Liquidity is centrally managed daily by our Treasury Department. 

FNBPA generates liquidity from its normal business operations. Liquidity sources from assets include payments from loans and investments, as well as the ability to securitize, pledge or sell loans, investment securities and other assets. Liquidity sources from liabilities are generated primarily through the banking offices of FNBPA in the form of deposits and customer repurchase agreements. FNB also has access to reliable and cost-effective wholesale sources of liquidity. Short- and long-term funds are used to help fund normal business operations, and unused credit availability can be utilized to serve as contingency funding if we would be faced with a liquidity crisis. 

The principal sources of the parent company&#8217;s liquidity are its strong existing cash resources plus dividends it receives from its subsidiaries. These dividends may be impacted by the parent&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; capital needs, statutory laws and regulations, corporate policies, contractual restrictions, profitability and other factors. In addition, through one of our subsidiaries, we regularly issue subordinated notes, which are guaranteed by FNB. The cash position at June 30, 2021 was $311 million, down $69 million from year-end, due primarily to $42 million in share repurchases. Management has utilized various strategies to ensure sufficient cash on hand is available to meet the parent's funding needs. 

Two metrics that are used to gauge the adequacy of the parent company&#8217;s cash position are the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Months of Cash on Hand (MCH). The LCR is defined as the sum of cash on hand plus projected cash inflows over the next 12 months divided by projected cash outflows over the next 12 months. The MCH is defined as the number of months of corporate expenses and dividends that can be covered by the cash on hand. 

The LCR and MCH ratios are presented in the following table: 

TABLE 26 

June 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Internal Limit Liquidity coverage ratio 2.6 times 2.7 times &#62; 1 time Months of cash on hand 18.5 months 22.2 months &#62; 12 months 

Management concludes that our cash levels remain appropriate given the current market environment. 

Our liquidity position has been positively impacted by our ability to generate growth in relationship-based accounts. Organic growth in low-cost transaction deposits was complemented by management&#8217;s strategy of deposit gathering efforts focused on attracting new customer relationships and deepening relationships with existing customers, in part through internal lead generation efforts leveraging data analytics capabilities. We have also increased customer deposit relationships due to the success of our PPP. Total deposits were $30.5 billion at June 30, 2021, an increase of $1.3 billion, or 9.3% annualized, from December 31, 2020. Total non-interest-bearing demand deposit accounts grew $1.2 billion, or 25.8% annualized, and interest-bearing demand deposits increased $0.5 billion, or 7.7% annualized. Savings account balances increased $151.4 million, or 9.4% annualized. Time deposits declined $460.9 million, or 25.4% annualized, as customer preferences continued to shift away from higher rate certificates of deposit to lower yielding, more liquid products. As mentioned earlier, inflows from PPP and government stimulus checks were a significant factor in the deposit growth. 

As a result of the strong deposit activity, our cash balances held at the FRB increased $1.5 billion from year-end to $2.3 billion at June 30, 2021. 

FNBPA has significant unused wholesale credit availability sources that include the availability to borrow from the FHLB, the FRB, correspondent bank lines, access to brokered deposits, the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Fund (PPPLF) and other channels. In addition to credit availability, FNBPA also possesses salable unpledged government and agency securities 

that could be utilized to meet funding needs. We currently also have excess cash to meet our pledging requirements. The ALCO is currently targeting a 1% guideline level for salable unpledged government and agency securities due to an elevated influx of deposits, in part related to the PPP. 

The following table presents certain information relating to FNBPA&#8217;s credit availability and salable unpledged securities: 

TABLE 27 

(dollars in millions) June 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Unused wholesale credit availability $ 15,536 &#160; $ 16,434 Unused wholesale credit availability as a % of FNBPA assets 40.5 &#160; % 44.1 % Salable unpledged government and agency securities $ 521 &#160; $ 546 Salable unpledged government and agency securities as a % of FNBPA assets 1.4 &#160; % 1.5 % Cash and salable unpledged government and agency securities as a % of FNBPA assets 7.6 &#160; % 3.8 % 

The PPPLF accounted for $1.6 billion of the unused wholesale credit availability at June 30, 2021. The FRB will cease lending money under this program, effective July 30, 2021. We have no borrowings under this facility. Our strong cash position would also be available to meet our pledging requirements. 

Another metric for measuring liquidity risk is the liquidity gap analysis. The following liquidity gap analysis as of June 30, 2021 compares the difference between our cash flows from existing earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities over future time intervals. Management seeks to limit the size of the liquidity gaps so that sources and uses of funds are reasonably matched in the normal course of business. A reasonably matched position lays a better foundation for dealing with additional funding needs during a potential liquidity crisis. The twelve-month cumulative gap to total assets ratio was 8.4% as of June 30, 2021, compared to 8.2% as of December 31, 2020. Management calculates this ratio at least quarterly and it is reviewed monthly by ALCO.

In addition, the ALCO regularly monitors various liquidity ratios and stress scenarios of our liquidity position. The stress scenarios forecast that adequate funding will be available even under severe conditions. Management believes we have sufficient liquidity available to meet our normal operating and contingency funding cash needs. 

MARKET RISK 

Market risk refers to potential losses arising predominately from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices. We are primarily exposed to interest rate risk inherent in our lending and deposit-taking activities as a financial intermediary. To succeed in this capacity, we offer an extensive variety of financial products to meet the diverse needs of our customers. These products sometimes contribute to interest rate risk for us when product groups do not complement one another. For example, depositors may want short-term deposits, while borrowers may desire long-term loans. 

Changes in market interest rates may result in changes in the fair value of our financial instruments, cash flows and net interest income. Subject to its ongoing oversight, the Board of Directors has given ALCO the responsibility for market risk management, which involves devising policy guidelines, risk measures and limits, and managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital. We use derivative financial instruments for interest rate risk management purposes and not for trading or speculative purposes. 

Interest rate risk is comprised of repricing risk, basis risk, yield curve risk and options risk. Repricing risk arises from differences in the cash flow or repricing between asset and liability portfolios. Basis risk arises when asset and liability portfolios are related to different market rate indices, which do not always change by the same amount. Yield curve risk arises when asset and liability portfolios are related to different maturities on a given yield curve; when the yield curve changes shape, the risk position is altered. Options risk arises from &#8220;embedded options&#8221; within asset and liability products as certain borrowers have the option to prepay their loans, which may be with or without penalty, when rates fall, while certain depositors can redeem their certificates of deposit early, which may be with or without penalty, when rates rise. 

We use an asset/liability model to measure our interest rate risk. Interest rate risk measures we utilize include earnings simulation, EVE and gap analysis. Gap analysis and EVE are static measures that do not incorporate assumptions regarding future business. Gap analysis, while a helpful diagnostic tool, displays cash flows for only a single rate environment. EVE&#8217;s long-term horizon helps identify changes in optionality and longer-term positions. However, EVE&#8217;s liquidation perspective does not translate into the earnings-based measures that are the focus of managing and valuing a going concern. Net interest income simulations explicitly measure the exposure to earnings from changes in market rates of interest. In these simulations, our current financial position is combined with assumptions regarding future business to calculate net interest income under various hypothetical rate scenarios. The ALCO reviews earnings simulations over multiple years under various interest rate scenarios on a periodic basis. Reviewing these various measures provides us with a comprehensive view of our interest rate risk profile, which provides the basis for balance sheet management strategies. 

The following repricing gap analysis as of June 30, 2021 compares the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities subject to repricing over a period of time. Management utilizes the repricing gap analysis as a diagnostic tool in managing net interest income and EVE risk measures.

The twelve-month cumulative repricing gap to total assets was 22.8% and 19.6% as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The positive cumulative gap positions indicate that we have a greater amount of repricing earning assets than repricing interest-bearing liabilities over the subsequent twelve months. If interest rates increase as modeled, net interest income will increase and, conversely, if interest rates decrease as modeled, net interest income will decrease. The change in the cumulative repricing gap at June 30, 2021, compared to December 31, 2020, is primarily related to growth in deposits. As mentioned earlier, inflows from PPP and government stimulus checks were a significant factor of growth in non-interest-bearing balances. We are also using this opportunity to expand customer relationships. Customer preferences continued to shift away from higher rate certificates of deposit to lower yielding, more liquid products. The deposit growth helped us eliminate overnight borrowings and reduce other short-term borrowings. 

The allocation of non-maturity deposits and customer repurchase agreements to the one-month maturity category above is based on the estimated sensitivity of each product to changes in market rates. For example, if a product&#8217;s rate is estimated to increase by 50% as much as the market rates, then 50% of the account balance was placed in this category. 

Utilizing net interest income simulations, the following net interest income metrics were calculated using rate shocks which move market rates in an immediate and parallel fashion. The variance percentages represent the change between the net interest income and EVE calculated under the particular rate scenario compared to the net interest income and EVE that was calculated assuming market rates as of June 30, 2021. Using a static Balance Sheet structure, the measures do not reflect management's potential counteractions. 

The following table presents an analysis of the potential sensitivity of our net interest income and EVE to changes in interest rates using rate shocks:

June 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 ALCO Limits Net interest income change (12 months): + 300 basis points 23.2 &#160; % 17.9 % n/a + 200 basis points 15.4 &#160; 12.0 (5.0) % + 100 basis points 7.3 &#160; 5.9 (5.0) - 100 basis points (2.3) 0.4 (5.0) Economic value of equity: + 300 basis points 10.4 &#160; 8.8 (25.0) + 200 basis points 8.3 &#160; 7.1 (15.0) + 100 basis points 4.9 &#160; 4.5 (10.0) - 100 basis points (9.3) (9.4) (10.0) 

We also model rate scenarios which move all rates gradually over twelve months (Rate Ramps) and model scenarios that gradually change the shape of the yield curve. Assuming a static Balance Sheet, a +100 basis point Rate Ramp increases net interest income (12 months) by 3.8% at June 30, 2021 and 3.2% at December 31, 2020. The corresponding metrics for a minus 100 basis point Rate Ramp are (0.6)% and 0.4% at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Deposit rate assumptions are floored at zero in the negative scenarios. 

The FRB's rapid and large downward interest rate moves in March 2020 as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic lowered all market interest rates, specifically 1-month LIBOR. Thirty-seven percent of our net loans and leases are indexed to one-month LIBOR. Our increased cash position related to increased deposits has also been a significant factor in our metrics. Assuming no replacement, the estimated impact of available cash in the +200-shock scenario above accounts for 5.5% of the 15.4% total asset sensitivity. These factors were the primary drivers of the increase in asset sensitivity. In this historically low rate environment, our strategy is to remain asset sensitive to benefit from future increases in interest rates. 

There are multiple factors that influence our interest rate risk position and impact net interest income. These include external factors such as the shape of the yield curve and expectations regarding future interest rates, as well as internal factors regarding product offerings, product mix and pricing of loans and deposits. 

Management utilizes various tactics to achieve our desired interest rate risk (IRR) position. In response to the change in interest rates, management was proactive in addressing our IRR position. As mentioned earlier, we were successful in growing our 

transaction deposits which provides funding that is less interest rate-sensitive than short-term time deposits and wholesale borrowings. Also, we were able to lower rates on deposit products and shorten the average maturity of the certificates of deposit volumes. This continues to be an intense focus of management. Further, management took advantage of the interest rate environment to reduce borrowing costs. Management has reduced the level of wholesale borrowings by approximately $350 million this year and by nearly $2 billion over the last 12 months. On the lending side, we regularly sell long-term fixed-rate residential mortgages in the secondary market and have been successful in the origination of consumer and commercial loans with short-term repricing characteristics. In particular, we have made use of interest rate swaps to commercial borrowers (commercial swaps) to manage our IRR position as the commercial swaps effectively increase adjustable-rate loans. Total variable and adjustable-rate loans were 58.0% of total net loans and leases as of June 30, 2021 and 56.0% as of December 31, 2020. As of June 30, 2021, the commercial swaps totaled $5.0 billion of notional principal, with $498.9 million in original notional swap principal originated during the first six months of 2021. For additional information regarding interest rate swaps, see Note 10, "Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report. The investment portfolio is also used, in part, to manage our IRR position. 

We recognize that all asset/liability models have some inherent shortcomings. Asset/liability models require certain assumptions to be made, such as prepayment rates on interest-earning assets and repricing impact on non-maturity deposits, which may differ from actual experience. These business assumptions are based upon our experience, business plans, economic and market trends and available industry data. While management believes that its methodology for developing such assumptions is reasonable, there can be no assurance that modeled results will be achieved. Furthermore, the metrics are based upon the Balance Sheet structure as of the valuation date and do not reflect the planned growth or management actions that could be taken. 

RISK MANAGEMENT 

As a financial institution, we take on a certain amount of risk in every business decision, transaction and activity. Our Board of Directors and senior management have identified seven major categories of risk: credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, reputational risk, operational risk, legal and compliance risk and strategic risk. In its oversight role of our risk management function, the Board of Directors focuses on the strategies, analyses and conclusions of management relating to identifying, understanding and managing risks so as to optimize total shareholder value, while balancing prudent business and safety and soundness considerations. 

The Board of Directors adopted a risk appetite statement that defines acceptable risk levels and limits under which we seek to operate in order to optimize returns. As such, the board monitors a series of KRIs, or Key Risk Indicators, for various business lines, operational units, and risk categories, providing insight into how our performance aligns with our stated risk appetite. These results are reviewed periodically by the Board of Directors and senior management to ensure adherence to our risk appetite statement, and where appropriate, adjustments are made to applicable business strategies and tactics where risks are approaching stated tolerances or for emerging risks. 

We support our risk management process through a governance structure involving our Board of Directors and senior management. The joint Risk Committee of our Board of Directors and the FNBPA Board of Directors helps ensure that business decisions are executed within appropriate risk tolerances. The Risk Committee has oversight responsibilities with respect to the following: 

&#8226; identification, measurement, assessment and monitoring of enterprise-wide risk; 

&#8226; development of appropriate and meaningful risk metrics to use in connection with the oversight of our businesses and strategies; 

&#8226; review and assessment of our policies and practices to manage our credit, market, liquidity, legal, regulatory and operating risk (including technology, operational, compliance and fiduciary risks); and 

&#8226; identification and implementation of risk management best practices. 

The Risk Committee serves as the primary point of contact between our Board of Directors and the Risk Management Council, which is the senior management level committee responsible for risk management. Risk appetite is an integral element of our business and capital planning processes through our Board Risk Committee and Risk Management Council. We use our risk appetite processes to promote appropriate alignment of risk, capital and performance tactics, while also considering risk capacity and appetite constraints from both financial and non-financial risks. Our top-down risk appetite process serves as a limit for undue risk-taking for bottom-up planning from our various business functions. Our Board Risk Committee, in collaboration with our Risk Management Council, approves our risk appetite on an annual basis, or more frequently, as needed 

to reflect changes in the risk, regulatory, economic and strategic plan environments, with the goal of ensuring that our risk appetite remains consistent with our strategic plans and business operations, regulatory environment and our shareholders' expectations. Reports relating to our risk appetite and strategic plans, and our ongoing monitoring thereof, are regularly presented to our various management level risk oversight and planning committees and periodically reported up through our Board Risk Committee. 

As noted above, we have a Risk Management Council comprised of senior management. The purpose of this committee is to provide regular oversight of specific areas of risk with respect to the level of risk and risk management structure. Management has also established an Operational Risk Committee that is responsible for identifying, evaluating and monitoring operational risks across FNB, evaluating and approving appropriate remediation efforts to address identified operational risks and providing periodic reports concerning operational risks to the Risk Management Council. The Risk Management Council reports on a regular basis to the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors regarding our enterprise-wide risk profile and other significant risk management issues. Our Chief Risk Officer is responsible for the design and implementation of our enterprise-wide risk management strategy and framework through the multiple second line of defense areas, including the following departments: Enterprise-Wide Risk Management, Fraud Risk, Loan Review, Model Risk Management, Third-Party Risk Management, Anti-Money Laundering and Bank Secrecy Act, Community Reinvestment Act, Appraisal Review, Compliance and Information and Cyber Security. All second line of defense departments report to the Chief Risk Officer to ensure the coordinated and consistent implementation of risk management initiatives and strategies on a day-to-day basis. Our Enterprise-Wide Risk Management Department conducts risk and control assessments across all of our business and operational areas to ensure the appropriate risk identification, risk management and reporting of risks enterprise-wide. The Fraud Risk Department monitors for internal and external fraud risk across all of our business and operational units. The Loan Review Department conducts independent testing of our loan risk ratings to ensure their accuracy, which is instrumental to calculating our ACL. Our Model Risk Management Department oversees validation and testing of all models used in managing risk across our company. Our Third-Party Risk Management Department ensures effective risk management and oversight of third-party relationships throughout the vendor life cycle. The Anti-Money Laundering and Bank Secrecy Act Department monitors for compliance with money laundering risk and associated regulatory compliance requirements. Our Community Reinvestment Department monitors for compliance with the requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act. The Appraisal Review Department facilitates independent ordering and review of real estate appraisals obtained for determining the value of real estate pledged as collateral for loans to customers. Our Compliance Department is responsible for developing policies and procedures and monitoring compliance with applicable laws and regulations which govern our business operations. Our Information and Cyber Security Department is responsible for maintaining a risk assessment of our information and cybersecurity risks and ensuring appropriate controls are in place to manage and control such risks, through the use of the National Institute of Standards and Technology framework for improving critical infrastructure by measuring and evaluating the effectiveness of information and cybersecurity controls. As discussed in more detail under the COVID-19 section of this Report, we have in place various business and emergency continuity plans to respond to different crises and circumstances which include rapid deployment of our Crisis Management Team, Incident Management Team and Business Continuity Coordinators to activate our plans for various types of emergency circumstance. Further, our audit function performs an independent assessment of our internal controls environment and plays an integral role in testing the operation of the internal controls systems and reporting findings to management and our Audit Committee. Each of the Risk, Audit, Credit Risk and CRA Committees of our Board of Directors regularly report on risk-related matters to the full Board of Directors. In addition, both the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors and our Risk Management Council regularly assess our enterprise-wide risk profile and provide guidance on actions needed to address key and emerging risk issues. 

The Board of Directors believes that our enterprise-wide risk management process is effective and enables the Board of Directors to: 

&#8226; assess the quality of the information they receive; 

&#8226; understand the businesses, investments and financial, accounting, legal, regulatory and strategic considerations and the risks that FNB faces; 

&#8226; oversee and assess how senior management evaluates risk; and 

&#8226; assess appropriately the quality of our enterprise-wide risk management process. 

RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS TO GAAP 

Reconciliations of non-GAAP operating measures and key performance indicators discussed in this Report to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the following tables. 

TABLE 31 

Operating net income available to common stockholders 

Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, (in thousands) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Net income available to common stockholders $ 99,377 $ 81,600 $ 190,602 $ 127,007 COVID-19 expense &#8212; 1,989 &#8212; 3,951 Tax benefit of COVID-19 expense &#8212; (418) &#8212; (830) Branch consolidation costs 2,644 &#8212; 2,644 8,262 Tax benefit of branch consolidation costs (555) &#8212; (555) (1,735) Operating net income available to common stockholders (non-GAAP) $ 101,466 $ 83,171 $ 192,691 $ 136,655 

The table above shows how operating net income available to common stockholders (non-GAAP) is derived from amounts reported in our financial statements. We believe certain charges, such as branch consolidation costs and COVID-19 expenses, are not organic costs to run our operations and facilities. The branch consolidation charges principally represent expenses to satisfy contractual obligations of the closed branches without any useful ongoing benefit to us. These costs are specific to each individual transaction, and may vary significantly based on the size and complexity of the transaction. The COVID-19 expenses represent special company initiatives to support our front-line employees and the communities we serve during an unprecedented time of a pandemic.
