&#160; 

Overview 

The rapid rise in interest rates during 2022 and 2023, the resulting industry-wide reduction in the fair value of securities portfolios, and the bank runs that led to the failures of some financial institutions in March of 2023, among other events, have resulted in significant volatility in the U.S. banking sector and heightened focus on liquidity, uninsured deposits, deposit composition, unrecognized investment losses, and capital. 

During November 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC) approved a final rule to implement a special assessment to recover the losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund (the DIF) associated with protecting uninsured depositors following the closures of certain financial institutions in March of 2023. The assessment base for the special assessment is equal to an insured depository institution&#8217;s uninsured deposits as of December 31, 2022, adjusted to exclude the first $5 billion, and will be collected at an annual rate of 13.4 basis points for eight quarterly assessment periods. The Company&#8217;s portion of this special assessment was $52.8 million and was recognized in noninterest expense during the fourth quarter of 2023. During February 2024, the FDIC increased the estimated loss attributable to the 2023 bank failures by 25%, which in turn increased the special assessment the FDIC will charge to insured depository institutions. The Company recorded $13.0 million of expense related to the updated special assessment in the first quarter of 2024 and its impacts are discussed below. 

The Company focuses on the following four core financial objectives. Management believes these objectives will guide its efforts to achieve its vision, to deliver the Unparalleled Customer Experience, all while seeking to improve net income and strengthen the balance sheet while undertaking prudent risk management. 

The first financial objective is to continuously improve operating efficiencies. The Company has focused on identifying efficiencies that simplify our organizational and reporting structures, streamline back-office functions, and take advantage of synergies and newer technologies among various platforms and distribution networks. The Company has identified and expects to continue identifying ongoing efficiencies through the normal course of business that, when combined with increased revenue, will contribute to improved operating leverage. During the first quarter of 2024, total revenue increased $26.8 million, or 7.2%, as compared to the first quarter of 2023, while noninterest expense increased $17.8 million, or 7.5%, for the same period. As part of the initiative to improve operating efficiencies, the Company continues to invest in technological advances that it believes will help management drive operating leverage in the future through improved data analysis and automation. The Company also continues to evaluate core systems and will invest in enhancements that it believes will yield operating efficiencies. 

The second financial objective is to increase net interest income through profitable loan and deposit growth and the optimization of the balance sheet. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company had a decrease in net interest income of $2.3 million, or 0.9%, from the same period in 2023. The change in net interest income was driven by higher interest expense due to an unfavorable mix shift in the composition of liabilities, partially offset by increased loan growth. These changes are driven by the higher interest rate environment compared to the first quarter of 2023. The increase in interest income was driven by a $2.1 billion, or 9.8%, increase in average loans and a $1.8 billion, or 115.4%, increase in average interest-bearing due from banks, coupled with the impact of higher short-term and long-term interest rates. The funding for these assets was driven primarily by a 20.3% increase in average interest-bearing liabilities, including an increase in average borrowed funds of $983.1 million compared to the same period in 2023. Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased 28 basis points compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to increased cost and mix of interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by increased loan volumes, repricing of earning assets, and the benefit of interest free funds. Net interest spread contracted by 43 basis points during the same period. The Company expects to see continued volatility in the economic markets resulting from governmental responses to inflation and recessionary signs in the economy. These changing conditions could have impacts on the balance sheet and income statement of the Company for the remainder of the year. 

The third financial objective is to grow the Company&#8217;s revenue from noninterest sources. The Company seeks to grow noninterest revenues throughout all economic and interest rate cycles, while positioning itself to benefit in periods of economic growth. Noninterest income increased $29.0 million, or 22.3%, to $159.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. This change is primarily due to increases in investment securities gains, trust and securities processing income, other income and bankcard income. 

&#160; 

See greater detail below under Noninterest Income. The Company continues to emphasize its asset management, brokerage, bankcard services, healthcare services, and treasury management businesses. For the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, noninterest income represented 39.9% of total revenues, compared to 35.0% for the same period in 2023. The recent economic changes have impacted fee income, especially those with assets tied to market values and interest rates. 

The fourth financial objective is effective capital management. The Company places a significant emphasis on maintaining a strong capital position, which management believes promotes investor confidence, provides access to funding sources under favorable terms, and enhances the Company&#8217;s ability to capitalize on business growth and acquisition opportunities. The Company continues to maximize shareholder value through a mix of reinvesting in organic growth, evaluating acquisition opportunities that complement the Company&#8217;s strategies, increasing dividends over time, and appropriately utilizing a share repurchase program. At March 31, 2024, the Company had $3.2 billion in total shareholders&#8217; equity. This is an increase of $338.2 million, or 12.0%, compared to total shareholders&#8217; equity at March 31, 2023. At March 31, 2024, the Company had a total risk-based capital ratio of 13.03%. The Company did not repurchase shares of common stock during the first quarter of 2024, except for shares acquired pursuant to the Company's share-based incentive programs. 

Earnings Summary 

The following is a summary regarding the Company&#8217;s earnings for the first quarter of 2024. The changes identified in the summary are explained in greater detail below. The Company recorded net income of $110.3 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, compared to net income of $92.4 million for the same period a year earlier. Basic earnings per share for the first quarter of 2024 was $2.27 per share ($2.25 per share fully-diluted) compared to basic earnings per share of $1.91 per share ($1.90 per share fully-diluted) for the first quarter of 2023. Return on average assets and return on average common shareholders&#8217; equity for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 were 1.06% and 14.11%, respectively, compared to 0.97% and 13.76%, respectively, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023. 

Net interest income for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 decreased $2.3 million, or 0.9%, compared to the same period in 2023. For the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, average earning assets increased $3.4 billion, or 9.4%, compared to the same period in 2023. Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased to 2.48% for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, compared to 2.76% for the same period in 2023. 

The provision for credit losses decreased by $13.3 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. Provision expense for both periods is primarily impacted by macro-economic data and portfolio credit metrics. The Company&#8217;s nonperforming loans increased $2.3 million to $17.8 million at March 31, 2024, compared to March 31, 2023. The ACL on loans as a percentage of total loans decreased to 0.96% as of March 31, 2024, compared to 0.97% at March 31, 2023. For a description of the Company&#8217;s methodology for computing the ACL, please see the summary discussion in the &#8220;Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; section included below. 

Noninterest income increased by $29.0 million, or 22.3%, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. These changes are discussed in greater detail below under Noninterest Income. 

Noninterest expense increased by $17.8 million, or 7.5%, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. These changes are discussed in greater detail below under Noninterest Expense. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is a significant source of the Company&#8217;s earnings and represents the amount by which interest income on earning assets exceeds the interest expense paid on liabilities. The volume of interest-earning assets and the related funding sources, the overall mix of these assets and liabilities, and the rates paid on each affect 

&#160; 

net interest income. Net interest income for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 decreased $2.3 million, or 0.9%, compared to the same period in 2023. 

Table 1 shows the impact of earning asset rate changes compared to changes in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. As illustrated in this table, net interest spread for the three months ended March 31, 2024 decreased 43 basis points as compared to the same period in 2023. Net interest margin for the three months ended March 31, 2024 decreased 28 basis points compared to the same period in 2023. The changes are primarily due to increased cost and mix of interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by increased loan volumes and repricing of earning assets. The impact of the increased cost and mix of interest-bearing liabilities had a significant impact in the first quarter of 2024. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 112 basis points from the first quarter of 2023 while the yield on earning assets increased 69 basis points compared to the same period. Earning asset balance increases have been primarily driven by higher average loan and interest-bearing due from bank balances. These variances have led to a decrease in the Company&#8217;s net interest income during 2024, as compared to results for the same period in 2023. The Company expects to see continued volatility in the economic markets and governmental responses to changes in the economy. These changing conditions could have impacts on the balance sheet and income statement of the Company the remainder of the year. For the impact of the contribution from free funds, see the Analysis of Net Interest Margin within Table 2 below. Table 2 also illustrates how the changes in volume and interest rates have resulted in an increase in net interest income.

Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses 

The ACL represents management&#8217;s judgment of the total expected losses included in the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The Company&#8217;s process for recording the ACL is based on the evaluation of the Company&#8217;s lifetime historical loss experience, management&#8217;s understanding of the credit quality inherent in the loan portfolio, and the impact of the current economic environment, coupled with reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. 

&#160; 

A mathematical calculation of an estimate is made to assist in determining the adequacy and reasonableness of management&#8217;s recorded ACL. To develop the estimate, the Company follows the guidelines in ASC 326, Financial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses . The estimate reserves for assets held at amortized cost and any related credit deterioration in the Company&#8217;s available-for-sale debt security portfolio. Assets held at amortized cost include the Company&#8217;s loan book and held-to-maturity security portfolio. 

&#160; 

The process involves the consideration of quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the specific segmentation of loans. These factors have been established over decades of financial institution experience and 

&#160; 

include economic observation and loan loss characteristics. This process is designed to produce a lifetime estimate of the losses, at a reporting date, that includes evaluation of historical loss experience, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and the qualitative framework outlined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in the published 2020 Interagency Policy Statement. This process allows management to take a holistic view of the recorded ACL reserve and ensure that all significant and pertinent information is considered. 

&#160; 

The Company considers a variety of factors to ensure the safety and soundness of its estimate including a strong internal control framework, extensive methodology documentation, credit underwriting standards which encompass the Company&#8217;s desired risk profile, model validation, and ratio analysis. If the Company&#8217;s total ACL estimate, as determined in accordance with the approved ACL methodology, is either outside a reasonable range based on review of economic indicators or by comparison of historical ratio analysis, the ACL estimate is an outlier and management will investigate the underlying reason(s). Based on that investigation, issues or factors that previously had not been considered may be identified in the estimation process, which may warrant adjustments to estimated credit losses. 

The ending result of this process is a recorded consolidated ACL that represents management&#8217;s best estimate of the total expected losses included in the loan portfolio, held-to-maturity securities, and credit deterioration in available-for-sale securities. 

Based on the factors above, management of the Company recorded $10.0 million as provision for credit losses for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, compared to $23.3 million for the same period in 2023. This change is the result of applying the methodology for computing the allowance for credit losses, coupled with the impacts of the current and forecasted economic environment. As illustrated in Table 3 below, the ACL on loans decreased to 0.96% of total loans as of March 31, 2024, compared to 0.97% of total loans as of March 31, 2023. 

Table 3 presents a summary of the Company&#8217;s ACL for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, and for the year ended December 31, 2023. Net charge-offs were $3.0 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, compared to $4.6 million for the same period in 2023. See &#8220;Credit Risk Management&#8221; under &#8220;Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#8221; in this report for information relating to nonaccrual loans, past due loans, restructured loans and other credit risk matters.

Noninterest income increased by $29.0 million, or 22.3%, during the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. Table 4 above summarizes the components of noninterest income and the respective year-over-year comparison for each category. 

Trust and securities processing income consists of fees earned on personal and corporate trust accounts, custody of securities services, trust investments and wealth management services, mutual fund assets, and alternative asset servicing. The increase in these fees for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to an increase in fund services revenue, trust services income, and corporate trust revenue. For the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, fund services revenue increased $5.0 million, or 14.5%, trust services income increased $1.1 million, or 8.3%, and corporate trust revenue increased $1.0 million, or 6.8%, in each case compared to the same period in 2023. The recent volatile markets have impacted the income in this category. Since trust and securities processing fees are primarily asset-based, which are highly correlated to the change in market value of the assets, the related income for the remainder of the year will be affected by changes in the securities markets. Management continues to emphasize sales of services to both new and existing clients as well as increasing and improving the distribution channels. 

Bankcard fees for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 increased $3.8 million, or 20.9%, compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was driven by higher interchange income, coupled with lower rebate and reward costs. 

Investment securities gains, net for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 increased by $14.7 million, or 276.0%, compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was driven by a $10.7 million gain on disposition of one of the Company's securities without readily determinable fair value, coupled with the $4.8 million impairment of an available-for-sale subordinated debt security during the first quarter of 2023. The income in this category is highly correlated to the change in market value of the assets, and the related income for the remainder of the year will be affected by changes in the securities markets. The Company&#8217;s investment portfolio is continually evaluated for opportunities to improve its performance and risk profile relative to market conditions and the Company&#8217;s interest rate expectations. This can result in differences from quarter to quarter in the amount of realized gains or losses on this portfolio. 

Other noninterest income for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 increased $4.2 million, or 28.7%, compared to the same period in 2023, driven by a $4.0 million legal settlement and a $1.8 million gain on sale of land, both recorded in the first quarter of 2024. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $2.4 million in derivative income.

Noninterest expense increased by $17.8 million, or 7.5%, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. Table 5 above summarizes the components of noninterest expense and the respective year-over-year comparison for each category. 

Processing fees increased $4.7 million, or 20.2%, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to increased software subscription cost. 

Bankcard expense increased $3.4 million, or 48.1%, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher administrative expenses and fraud losses. 

Regulatory fees increased $13.8 million, or 249.4%, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to the $13.0 million FDIC special assessment recorded in the first quarter of 2024 as discussed above. 

Income Tax Expense 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s effective tax rate was 17.6% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to 17.2% for the same period in 2023. 

Strategic Lines of Business 

&#160; 

The Company has strategically aligned its operations into the following three reportable Business Segments: Commercial Banking, Institutional Banking, and Personal Banking. The Company&#8217;s senior executive officers regularly evaluate Business Segment financial results produced by the Company&#8217;s internal reporting system in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance for individual Business Segments. For comparability purposes, amounts in all periods are based on methodologies in effect at March 31, 2024. Previously reported results have been reclassified in this Form 10-Q to conform to the Company&#8217;s current organizational structure.

For the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, Commercial Banking net income increased $25.8 million to $83.1 million, as compared to the same period in 2023. Net interest income increased $6.2 million, or 4.1%, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily driven by strong loan growth, earning asset mix changes and the increase in short-term interest rates. Provision for credit losses decreased $13.5 million for the period, driven by portfolio metric changes and changes in macro-economic metrics in 2024 as compared to 2023, partially offset by loan growth. Noninterest income increased $20.1 million, or 87.6%, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase of $10.7 million in investment securities gains, an increase of $4.7 million in miscellaneous income driven by a legal settlement in the first quarter of 2024, an increase of $2.4 million in bankcard fees, and an increase of $1.8 million in service charges on deposit accounts. Noninterest expense increased $8.4 million, or 10.0%, to $92.4 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was driven by a $7.4 million increase in regulatory fees driven by the FDIC special assessment in the first quarter of 2024, and an increase of $1.5 million in salaries and employee benefits expense.

For the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, Institutional Banking net income decreased $7.3 million, or 17.6%, compared to the same period last year. Net interest income decreased $5.2 million, or 9.5%, compared to the same period last year, due to higher deposit interest expense driven by the increase in short-term interest rates. Noninterest income increased $8.5 million, or 10.1%, primarily due to increases of $6.1 million in trust and securities processing income driven by higher fund services and corporate trust revenue, and $1.8 million in bankcard fees primarily driven by higher interchange income. Noninterest expense increased $11.0 million, or 12.3%, primarily driven by increases of $6.2 million in regulatory fees driven by the FDIC special assessment in the first quarter of 2024, $2.7 million in salaries and employee benefits expense, $1.7 million in processing fees, $1.6 million in bankcard expense, and $1.0 million in equipment expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $1.3 million in technology, service, and overhead expenses.

For the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, Personal Banking net income decreased $0.7 million to a net loss of $6.9 million, as compared to the same period in 2023. Net interest income decreased $3.3 million, or 9.2%, compared to the same period last year due to higher deposit interest expense driven by the increase in short-term interest rates. Provision for credit losses decreased $0.1 million for the period driven by portfolio metric changes and changes in macro-economic metrics in 2024 as compared to 2023, partially offset by loan growth. Noninterest income increased $0.5 million, or 2.2%, for the same period driven by an increase of $1.1 million in trust and securities processing income, an increase of $1.0 million in miscellaneous other income primarily due to the gain on sale of land during the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by a decrease of $1.3 million in investment securities gains. Noninterest expense decreased $1.7 million, or 2.6%, primarily due to a decrease of $2.0 million in technology, service, and overhead expenses, and a decrease of $1.6 million in operational losses, partially offset by increases of $1.1 million in bankcard expense and $0.5 million in marketing and business development expense. 

Balance Sheet Analysis 

Total assets of the Company increased by $1.3 billion, or 3.0%, as of March 31, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase of $1.5 billion, or 29.3% in interest-bearing due from banks and an increase of $465.2 million, or 2.0%, in loan balances, partially offset by a decrease of $527.2 million, or 7.5%, in securities available for sale.

Loans represent the Company&#8217;s largest source of interest income. In addition to growing the commercial loan portfolio, management believes its middle market commercial business and its consumer business, including home 

&#160; 

equity and credit card loan products, are the market niches that represent its best opportunity to cross-sell fee-related services and generate additional noninterest income for the Company. 

Actual loan balances totaled $23.6 billion as of March 31, 2024, and increased $465.2 million, or 2.0%, compared to December 31, 2023, and increased $1.8 billion, or 8.4%, compared to March 31, 2023. Compared to December 31, 2023, commercial real estate loans increased $391.2 million, or 4.4%, and credit card loans increased $114.5 million, or 27.0%. Compared to March 31, 2023, commercial real estate loans increased $1.2 billion, or 15.4%, commercial and industrial loans increased $362.7 million, or 3.8%, consumer real estate loans increased $203.8 million, or 7.4%, and credit card loans increased $92.1 million, or 20.6%. The increase in credit card loans in both periods is related to the purchase of $109.4 million in co-branded credit card receivables during the first quarter of 2024. See further information in Note 4, &#8220;Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, commercial real estate loans comprised approximately 39.3% and 38.4%, respectively, of the Company's loan portfolio. Commercial real estate loans generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than consumer real estate loans because they typically have larger balances and are more affected by adverse conditions in the economy. Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate often depend upon the successful operation and management of the properties and the businesses which operate from within them, repayment of such loans may be affected by factors outside the borrower&#8217;s control, such as adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy or changes in government regulations. In recent years, commercial real estate markets have been particularly impacted by the economic disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has also been a catalyst for the evolution of various remote work options, which could impact the long-term performance of some types of office properties within our commercial real estate portfolio. Due to these risks, the Company is actively monitoring its exposure to commercial real estate. 

Generally, these loans are made for investment and real estate development or working capital and business expansion purposes and are primarily secured by real estate with a maximum loan-to-value of 80%. Most of these properties are non-owner occupied and have guarantees as additional security. The Company's investment CRE portfolio (which includes non-owner occupied and construction loans) totaled 27.8% and 26.5% of total Company loans as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The average investment CRE loan was approximately $6.3 million and $5.8 million, as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and 90% are recourse loans as of the end of each period. These loans have an average loan-to-value of 57% as of both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

The properties securing the commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location. This diversity helps reduce exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single market or industry. Notwithstanding, commercial real estate loans, in general, may be more adversely impacted by conditions in the real estate market or the economy. 

The following table presents the Company's investment CRE (which includes non-owner occupied and construction loans) by industry. The table separately discloses the top five industries as a percentage of the Company's loan portfolio as of either period presented, while the remainder are included in "Other."

The shift to work-from-home and hybrid work environments has caused a decreased utilization of, and demand for, office space. The Company is actively monitoring its exposure to office space in its non-owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio. The average loan size in the Company's office portfolio was approximately $9.0 million and $9.2 million, as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The average loan-to-value of the office portfolio was 64% as of both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and 84% are recourse loans as of the end of both periods. Further, only 24% and 30% of the Company's office portfolio as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, is in central business districts, which have been more heavily impacted by the shift to remote work. The remainder of the Company's office portfolio is in suburban or medical properties. 

The table below presents the Company's portfolio of office commercial real estate by the metropolitan statistical area (MSAs) in which the loan collateral is located. The table separately discloses all MSAs that represent at least 5.0% of the Company's office commercial real estate portfolio as of either period presented, while the remainder are included in "All Others."

Nonaccrual, past due and restructured loans are discussed under &#8220;Credit Risk Management&#8221; within &#8220;Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#8221; in this report. 

Investment Securities 

The Company&#8217;s investment portfolio contains trading, AFS, and HTM securities, as well as FRB stock, FHLB stock, and other miscellaneous investments. Investment securities totaled $12.7 billion as of March 31, 2024, and 

&#160; 

$13.3 billion as of December 31, 2023, and comprised 29.4% and 31.9% of the Company&#8217;s earning assets, respectively, as of those dates. 

The Company&#8217;s AFS securities portfolio comprised 51.6% of the Company&#8217;s investment securities portfolio at March 31, 2024 and 53.3% at December 31, 2023. The Company&#8217;s AFS securities portfolio provides liquidity as a result of the composition and average life of the underlying securities. This liquidity can be used to fund loan growth or to offset the outflow of traditional funding sources. The average life of the AFS securities portfolio was 57.8 months at March 31, 2024, compared to 52.6 months at December 31, 2023, and 59.8 months at March 31, 2023. In addition to providing a potential source of liquidity, the AFS securities portfolio can be used as a tool to manage interest rate sensitivity. The Company&#8217;s goal in the management of its AFS securities portfolio is to maximize return within the Company&#8217;s parameters of liquidity goals, interest rate risk, and credit risk. 

Management expects collateral pledging requirements for public funds, loan demand, and deposit funding to be the primary factors impacting changes in the level of AFS securities. There were $9.4 billion and $10.1 billion of securities pledged to secure U.S. Government deposits, other public deposits, certain trust deposits, derivative transactions, and repurchase agreements at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

The Company&#8217;s HTM securities portfolio consists of U.S. agency-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, general obligation bonds, and private placement bonds. The HTM portfolio, net of the ACL, totaled $5.6 billion at March 31, 2024 and $5.7 billion as of December 31, 2023. The average life of the HTM portfolio was 9.0 years at March 31, 2024, compared to 8.4 years at December 31, 2023, and 9.1 years at March 31, 2023. 

The securities portfolio generates the Company&#8217;s second largest component of interest income. The securities portfolio achieved an average yield on a tax-equivalent basis of 2.88% for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, compared to 2.61% for the same period in 2023. 

At March 31, 2024, the unrealized pre-tax net loss on the AFS securities portfolio was $665.9 million, or 9.2% of the $7.2 billion amortized cost value, an increase of $41.7 million as compared to December 31, 2023. At March 31, 2024, the unrealized pre-tax net loss on the securities designated as HTM was $601.3 million, or 10.7% of amortized cost value, compared to $508.5 million at December 31, 2023. During 2022, the Company transferred securities with an amortized cost balance of $4.1 billion and a fair value of $3.8 billion from the AFS category to the HTM category. The transfer of securities was made at fair value at the time of transfer. The remaining balance of unrealized pre-tax losses related to transferred securities was $198.4 million as of March 31, 2024, and $207.2 million as of December 31, 2023, and was included in the amortized cost balance of HTM securities. See further information in Note 5, &#8220;Securities&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Deposits and Borrowed Funds 

Deposits increased $1.1 billion, or 3.1%, from December 31, 2023 to March 31, 2024 and increased $5.0 billion, or 15.6%, from March 31, 2023 to March 31, 2024. Total noninterest-bearing deposits increased $1.1 billion and total interest-bearing deposits increased $323 thousand from December 31, 2023 to March 31, 2024. Total noninterest-bearing deposits increased $762.3 million, and interest-bearing deposits increased $4.2 billion from March 31, 2023 to March 31, 2024. Deposits can fluctuate at quarter-end due to the operational nature of our commercial and institutional clients and typical seasonal declines in public funds deposits, particularly in the first quarter. The shift from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing is related to the recent increases in short-term and long-term interest rates. Noninterest-bearing deposits were 35.9%, 33.9%, and 39.1% of total deposits at March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and March 31, 2023, respectively. 

Deposits represent the Company&#8217;s primary funding source for its asset base. In addition to the core deposits garnered by the Company&#8217;s retail branch structure, the Company continues to focus on its cash management services, as well as its trust and mutual fund servicing businesses, in order to attract and retain additional deposits. Management believes a strong core deposit composition is one of the Company&#8217;s key strengths given its competitive product mix. 

As of March 31, 2024, there were an estimated $25.3 billion of uninsured deposits, an increase of $868.5 million as compared to December 31, 2023, and an increase of $4.0 billion as compared to March 31, 2023. Estimated uninsured deposits comprised approximately 68.4%, 68.2%, and 66.6% of total deposits as of March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and March 31, 2023, respectively. A portion of these uninsured deposits represent 

&#160; 

affiliate deposits and collateralized deposits. Affiliate deposits represent deposit accounts owned by the wholly owned subsidiaries of UMB Financial Corporation that are on deposit at UMB Bank, n.a. Collateralized deposits are public fund deposits or corporate trust deposits that are collateralized by high quality securities within the investment portfolio. Excluding affiliate deposits of $2.0 billion and collateralized deposits of $5.4 billion, the adjusted estimated uninsured deposits were $17.9 billion as of March 31, 2024. The adjusted ratio of estimated uninsured deposits, excluding affiliate and collateralized deposits, as a percentage of total deposits was approximately 48.6% as of March 31, 2024. The adjusted ratio of estimated uninsured deposits, excluding affiliate and collateralized deposits, as a percentage of total deposits was approximately 45.3% as of December 31, 2023, and 43.1% as of March 31, 2023. 

The Company participates in the IntraFi Cash Service program, which allows its customers to place deposits into the program to receive reciprocal FDIC insurance coverage. The Company had $1.2 billion, $1.2 billion, and $811.2 million of deposits in the program as of March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and March 31, 2023, respectively. 

Long-term debt totaled $383.7 million at March 31, 2024, compared to $383.2 million as of December 31, 2023, and $381.8 million as of March 31, 2023. In September 2022, the Company issued $110.0 million in aggregate subordinated notes due in September 2032. The Company received $107.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, and used the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including, among other uses, contributing Tier 1 capital into the Bank. The subordinated notes were issued with a fixed-to-fixed rate of 6.25% and an effective rate of 6.64%, due to issuance costs, with an interest rate reset date of September 2027. 

In September 2020, the Company issued $200.0 million in aggregate subordinated notes due in September 2030. The Company received $197.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, and used the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including, among other uses, contributing Tier 1 capital into the Bank. The subordinated notes were issued with a fixed-to-fixed rate of 3.70% and an effective rate of 3.93%, due to issuance costs, with an interest rate reset date of September 2025. 

The remainder of the Company&#8217;s long-term debt was assumed from the acquisition of Marquette and consists of debt obligations payable to four unconsolidated trusts (Marquette Capital Trust I, Marquette Capital Trust II, Marquette Capital Trust III, and Marquette Capital Trust IV) that previously issued trust preferred securities. These long-term debt obligations have an aggregate contractual balance of $103.1 million. Interest rates on trust preferred securities are tied to the three-month term SOFR rate with spreads ranging from 133 basis points to 160 basis points and reset quarterly. The trust preferred securities have maturity dates ranging from January 2036 to September 2036. 

The Company has a revolving line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. which allows the Company to borrow up to $30.0 million for general working capital purposes. The interest rate applied to borrowed balances will be at the Company&#8217;s option either 1.40% above Term SOFR or 1.75% below the prime rate on the date of an advance. The Company pays a 0.4% unused commitment fee for unused portions of the revolving line of credit. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had no advances outstanding on this revolving line of credit. 

Short-term debt totaled $1.8 billion as March 31, 2024 and consists of a $1.0 billion short-term borrowing with the FHLB of Des Moines and an $800.0 million borrowing with the BTFP. The FHLB borrowing has an interest rate of 5.04% and is due in the second quarter of 2024. The BTFP borrowing has a rate of 4.76% and is due in the first quarter of 2025. The level of borrowings could be impacted by earning asset mix changes in the Company&#8217;s balance sheet from the impacts of recent industry volatility. See further information in Note 7, &#8220;Borrowed Funds&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled $2.2 billion as of March 31, 2024, $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2023, and $2.2 billion at March 31, 2023. Repurchase agreements are transactions involving the exchange of investment funds by the customer for securities by the Company under an agreement to repurchase the same or similar issues at an agreed-upon price and date. The level of borrowings could be impacted by earning asset mix changes in the Company&#8217;s balance sheet from the impacts of recent industry volatility. 

&#160; 

Capital and Liquidity 

The Company places a significant emphasis on the maintenance of a strong capital position, which promotes investor confidence, provides access to funding sources under favorable terms, and enhances the Company&#8217;s ability to capitalize on business growth and acquisition opportunities. Higher levels of liquidity, however, bear corresponding costs, measured in terms of lower yields on short-term, more liquid earning assets and higher expenses for extended liability maturities. The Company manages capital for each subsidiary based upon the subsidiary&#8217;s respective risks and growth opportunities as well as regulatory requirements. 

Total shareholders&#8217; equity was $3.2 billion at March 31, 2024, a $52.4 million increase compared to December 31, 2023, and a $338.2 million increase compared to March 31, 2023. Total accumulated other comprehensive loss was $594.5 million at March 31, 2024.

Through the Company&#8217;s relationship with the FHLB of Des Moines, the Company owns $55.2 million of FHLB stock and has access to additional liquidity and funding sources through FHLB advances. The Company&#8217;s borrowing capacity is dependent upon the amount of collateral the Company places at the FHLB. The Company had a $1.0 billion short-term advance outstanding at FHLB of Des Moines as of March 31, 2024. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2024, the FHLB of Des Moines issued a letter of credit for $150.0 million on behalf of the Company to secure deposits. This letter of credit will expire in July 2024. The Company&#8217;s remaining borrowing capacity with the FHLB was $952.7 million as of March 31, 2024.

Risk-based capital guidelines established by regulatory agencies set minimum capital standards based on the level of risk associated with a financial institution&#8217;s assets. The Company has implemented the Basel III regulatory capital rules adopted by the FRB. Basel III capital rules include a minimum ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5% and a minimum tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%. A financial institution&#8217;s total capital is also required to equal at least 8% of risk-weighted assets. 

The risk-based capital guidelines indicate the specific risk weightings by type of asset. Certain off-balance sheet items (such as standby letters of credit and binding loan commitments) are multiplied by credit conversion factors to translate them into balance sheet equivalents before assigning them specific risk weightings. The Company is also required to maintain a leverage ratio equal to or greater than 4%. The leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of tier 1 core capital to total average assets, less goodwill and intangibles.

U.S. banking agencies in December 2018 approved a final rule to address the impact of CECL on regulatory capital by allowing banking organizations the option to phase in the day-one impact of CECL until the first quarter of 2023. In March 2020, the U.S. banking agencies issued an interim final rule that provides banking organizations 

&#160; 

with an alternative option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. The Company elected this alternative option instead of the one described in the December 2018 rule. 

The Company's capital position as of March 31, 2024 is summarized in the table below and exceeded regulatory requirements.

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements 

The Company&#8217;s main off-balance sheet arrangements are loan commitments, commercial and standby letters of credit, futures contracts and forward exchange contracts, which have maturity dates rather than payment due dates. See Note 10, &#8220;Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed information on these arrangements. The level of the outstanding commitments could be impacted by volatility in the economic markets and governmental responses to inflation, geopolitical tensions, and supply chain constraints. These changing conditions could have impacts on the consolidated balance sheets of the Company for the remainder of the year. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to customers and suppliers, allowance for credit losses, bad debts, investments, financing operations, long-lived assets, taxes, other contingencies, and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which have formed the basis for making such judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Under different assumptions or conditions, actual results may differ from the recorded estimates. 

&#160; 

A summary of critical accounting policies is listed in the &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; section of the Form 10-K.
