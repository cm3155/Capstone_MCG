CAUTIONARY NOTICE ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

From time to time the Company has made, and in the future will make, forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; &#8220;intend,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;project,&#8221; &#8220;outlook,&#8221; &#8220;forecast,&#8221; &#8220;target,&#8221; &#8220;trend,&#8221; &#8220;plan,&#8221; &#8220;goal,&#8221; or other words of comparable meaning or future-tense or conditional verbs such as &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; or &#8220;could.&#8221; Forward-looking statements convey the Company&#8217;s expectations, intentions, or forecasts about future events, circumstances, results, or aspirations.

This report, including any information incorporated by reference in this report, contains forward-looking statements. The Company also may make forward-looking statements in other documents that are filed or furnished with the SEC. In addition, the Company may make forward-looking statements orally or in writing to investors, analysts, members of the media, or others.

All forward-looking statements, by their nature, are subject to assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, which may change over time and many of which are beyond the Company&#8217;s control. You should not rely on any forward-looking statement as a prediction or guarantee about the future. Actual future objectives, strategies, plans, prospects, performance, conditions, or results may differ materially from those set forth in any forward-looking statement. While no list of assumptions, risks, or uncertainties could be complete, some of the factors that may cause actual results or other future events, circumstances, or aspirations to differ from those in forward-looking statements include:

Results of Operations

Overview

&#160;

During the first quarter of 2020, the global economy began experiencing a downturn related to the impacts of the COVID-19 global pandemic. Such impacts have included significant volatility in the global stock and fixed income markets, a 150-basis-point reduction in the target federal funds rate, the enactment of the CARES Act, including the PPP administered by the Small Business Administration, and a variety of rulings from the Company&#8217;s banking regulators. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Company continues to actively monitor developments related to COVID-19 and its impact to its business, customers, employees, counterparties, vendors, and service providers. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company&#8217;s results of operations included building of the allowance for credit losses (ACL) and monitoring key macroeconomic variables utilized in the econometric models under the CECL accounting standard adopted on January 1, 2020 and $6.9 million of nonrecurring COVID-19 specific expenses. Additionally, the Company continued to see impacts of the volatile equity and debt markets and low interest rate environment in its fee-based businesses.

&#160;

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company formed a Pandemic Taskforce and a steering group comprised of associates across multiple lines of business and support functions and has taken several actions to offer various forms of support to our customers, employees, and communities that have experienced impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 65% of the Company&#8217;s associates are working remotely. The Company has also increased purchases of computer hardware to support a remote workforce, as well as incurred additional cleaning and janitorial expense to disinfect branch and office locations. In addition, the Company is actively working with customers impacted by the economic downturn by offering payment deferrals and other loan modifications where appropriate. See further details under &#8220;Credit Risk Management&#8221; within &#8220;Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.&#8221; Additionally, the Company has recorded over 5,000 loans totaling $1.5 billion under the PPP. 

&#160;

In light of volatility in the capital markets and economic disruptions, the Company continues to carefully monitor its capital and liquidity position. In March 2020, the U.S. banking agencies issued an interim final rule that provides banking organizations with an alternative option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL's effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. The Company elected this alternative in the first quarter of 2020. The Company continues to anticipate that it will have sufficient capital levels to meet all applicable regulatory capital requirements. 

The COVID-19 pandemic and stay-at-home and similar mandates have also necessitated certain actions related to the way the Company operates its business. As noted above, the Company transitioned most of its workforce off-site or to work-from-home to help mitigate health risks. The Company is also carefully monitoring the activities of its vendors and other third-party service providers to mitigate the risks associated with any potential service disruptions. The length of time it may be required to operate under such circumstances and future degrees of disruption remain uncertain. While the Company has not experienced material adverse disruptions to its internal operations due to the pandemic, it continues to review evolving risks and developments.

The Company focuses on the following four core financial objectives. Management believes these objectives will guide its efforts to achieve its vision, to deliver the Unparalleled Customer Experience, all while seeking to improve net income and strengthen the balance sheet while undertaking prudent risk management .

The first financial objective is to continuously improve operating efficiencies. The Company has focused on identifying efficiencies that simplify our organizational and reporting structures, streamline back office functions and take advantage of synergies and newer technologies among various platforms and distribution networks. The Company has identified and expects to continue identifying ongoing efficiencies through the normal course of business that, when combined with increased revenue, will contribute to improved operating leverage. For 2020, total revenue increased 17.6%, and noninterest expense also increased 5.5%, as compared to the previous year. The Company continues to invest in technological advances that it believes will help management drive operating leverage in the future through improved data analysis and automation. The Company also continues to evaluate core systems and will invest in enhancements that it believes will yield operating efficiencies.

The second financial objective is to increase net interest income through profitable loan and deposit growth and the optimization of the balance sheet. For 2020, net interest income increased $60.3 million, or 9.0%, as compared to the previous year. The Company has shown increased net interest income through the effects of increased volume and mix of average earning assets. Loans recorded under the PPP increased loan interest income by $29.5 million in 2020. The additional increase in interest income was driven by an increase of $1.3 billion in PPP loans. These increases were offset by the recent interest rate reductions related to the pandemic. Average loan balances increased $2.4 billion, or 18.5%, from prior year. Average PPP loans account for $1.0 billion of this increase. The funding for these assets was driven primarily by a 17.4% increase in average interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased 31 basis points compared to the same period in 2019.

&#160;

The third financial objective is to grow the Company&#8217;s revenue from noninterest sources. The Company seeks to grow noninterest revenues throughout all economic and interest rate cycles , while position ing itself to benefit in periods of economic growth. Noninterest income increased $ 133.4 million, or 31.3% , to $ 560.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 , compared to the same period in 2019 . This increase was primarily attributable to a n increase of $118.4 million in I nvestment securities gains , net , principally driven by the $108.8 million gain on the Company&#8217;s investment in Tattooed Chef, Inc., as well as increased fund serving income, and trading and investment banking income . Th ese change s are discussed in greater detail below under Noninterest income. As of December 31, 2020 , noninterest income represented 43.4% of total revenues, as compared to 38.9 % for 2019 . 

The fourth financial objective is effective capital management. The Company places a significant emphasis on maintaining a strong capital position, which management believes promotes investor confidence, provides access to funding sources under favorable terms, and enhances the Company&#8217;s ability to capitalize on business growth and acquisition opportunities. The Company continues to maximize shareholder value through a mix of reinvesting in organic growth, evaluating acquisition opportunities that complement the Company&#8217;s strategies, increasing dividends over time, and appropriately utilizing a share repurchase program. At December 31, 2020, the Company had a total risk-based capital ratio of 14.26% and $3.0 billion in total shareholders&#8217; equity, an increase of $410.5 million, or 15.7%, compared to total shareholders&#8217; equity at December 31, 2019. The Company repurchased 1.2 million shares of common stock at an average price of $53.27 per share during 2020 and declared $60.7 million in dividends, which represents a 1.8% increase compared to dividends declared during 2019.

Earnings Summary

The Company recorded consolidated income from continuing operations of $286.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This represents a 17.6% increase over 2019. Income from continuing operations for 2019 was $243.6 million, or an increase of 24.1% compared to 2018. Basic earnings per share from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, were $5.95 per share compared to $4.99 per share in 2019, an increase of 19.2%. Basic earnings per share from continuing operations were $3.98 per share in 2018, or an increase of 25.4% from 2018 to 2019. Fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 19.6% from 2019 to 2020 and increased 25.9% from 2018 to 2019. 

The Company&#8217;s net interest income increased to $731.2 million in 2020 compared to $670.9 million in 2019 and $610.4 million in 2018. In total, a favorable volume variance, partially offset by an unfavorable rate variance, resulted in a $60.3 million increase in net interest income in 2020, compared to 2019. See Table 2 on page 30. The favorable volume variance on earning assets was predominantly driven by the increase in average loan balances of $2.4 billion, or 18.5%, for 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased to 2.81% for 2020, compared to 3.12% for the same period in 2019, as the asset yields and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased, coupled with an increased balance sheet. This created significant margin compression. The Company has seen a decrease in the benefit from interest-free funds as compared to 2019 driven by the lower rate environment. The impact of this benefit decreased 28 basis points compared to 2019 and is illustrated on Table 3 on page 31. The magnitude and duration of this impact will be largely dependent upon the FRB&#8217;s policy decisions and market movements. See Table 20 in Item 7A on page 52 for an illustration of the impact of an interest rate increase or decrease on net interest income as of December 31, 2020.

The provision for credit losses totaled $130.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which is an increase of $97.7 million, or 297.3%, compared to the same period in 2019. This change is the result of the adoption of the CECL standard and applying this methodology for computing the allowance for credit losses, coupled with the impacts of the current and forecasted economic environment related to the COVID-19 pandemic. See further discussion in &#8220;Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; on page 31. 

The Company had an increase of $133.4 million, or 31.3%, in noninterest income in 2020, as compared to 2019, and an increase of $25.1 million, or 6.2%, in 2019, compared to 2018. The increase in 2020 is primarily attributable to an increase of $118.4 million in Investment securities gains, net, primarily driven by the $108.8 million gain on the Company&#8217;s investment in Tattooed Chef, Inc., as well as increased fund serving income, and trading and investment banking income. These are offset by decreases in brokerage and bankcard income. The change in noninterest income in 2020 from 2019, and 2019 from 2018 is illustrated in Table 6 on page 35.

Noninterest expense increased in 2020 by $43.1 million, or 5.5%, compared to 2019 and increased by $61.1 million, or 8.5%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase in 2020 is primarily driven by increases in salary and employee benefits expense, operating losses, and equipment expense. These increases were offset by a decrease in 

&#160;

marketing and business development expense. The increase in noninterest expense in 20 20 from 201 9 , and 201 9 from 201 8 is illustrated in Table 7 on page 3 6 . 

Net Interest Income

Net interest income is a significant source of the Company&#8217;s earnings and represents the amount by which interest income on earning assets exceeds the interest expense paid on liabilities. The volume of interest earning assets and the related funding sources, the overall mix of these assets and liabilities, and the interest rates paid on each affect net interest income. Table 2 summarizes the change in net interest income resulting from changes in volume and rates for 2020, 2019 and 2018. 

Net interest margin, presented in Table 1 on page 28, is calculated as net interest income on a fully tax- equivalent basis (FTE) as a percentage of average earning assets. Net interest income is presented on a tax-equivalent basis to adjust for the tax-exempt status of earnings from certain loans and investments, which are primarily obligations of state and local governments. A critical component of net interest income and related net interest margin is the percentage of earning assets funded by interest-free sources. Table 3 analyzes net interest margin for the three years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Net interest income, average balance sheet amounts and the corresponding yields earned and rates paid for the years 2018 through 2020 are presented in Table 1 below.

&#160;

The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the average earning assets and resulting yields, as well as the average interest-bearing liabilities and resulting yields, expressed in both dollars and rates.

##TABLE_START (1) 

Interest income and yields are stated on a fully tax-equivalent (FTE) basis, using a marginal tax rate of 21% for 2020, 2019, and 2018. The tax-equivalent interest income and yields give effect to tax-exempt interest income net of the disallowance of interest expense, for federal income tax purposes related to certain tax-free assets. Rates earned/paid may not compute to the rates shown due to presentation in millions. The tax-equivalent interest income totaled $26.7 million, $24.0 million, and $20.0 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START (2) 

Loan fees are included in interest income. Such fees totaled $13.7 million, $14.5 million, and $17.0 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.

##TABLE_END

Table 2

RATE-VOLUME ANALYSIS (in thousands) 

This analysis attributes changes in net interest income either to changes in average balances or to changes in average interest rates for earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The change in net interest income that is due to both volume and interest rate has been allocated to volume and interest rate in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amount of the change in each. All interest rates are presented on a tax-equivalent basis and give effect to tax-exempt interest income net of the disallowance of interest expense for federal income tax purposes, related to certain tax-free assets. The loan average balances and rates include nonaccrual loans.

##TABLE_END

&#160;

The Company experienced an increase in net interest income of $60.3 million, or 9.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019. This follows an increase of $60.5 million, or 9.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018. Average earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $4.7 billion, or 21.1%, compared to the same period in 2019. Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased to 2.81% for 2020 compared to 3.12% in 2019. 

The Company funds a significant portion of its balance sheet with noninterest-bearing demand deposits. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits represented 36.5%, 32.1% and 34.6% of total outstanding deposits at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As illustrated in Table 3, the impact from these interest-free funds was 15 basis points in 2020, as compared to 43 basis points in 2019 and 33 basis points in 2018. 

The Company has experienced an increase in net interest income during 2020 due to a volume variance of $115.8 million, offset by a negative rate variance of $55.5 million. The average rate on earning assets during 2020 has decreased by 88 basis points, while the average rate on interest-bearing liabilities decreased by 85 basis points, resulting in a three basis-point decrease in spread. The volume of loans has increased from an average of $12.8 billion in 2019 to an average of $15.1 billion in 2020 driven both by organic loan growth and participation in the PPP loan program. The volume of interest-bearing liabilities increased from $14.9 billion in 2019 to $17.5 billion in 2020. The Company expects to see continued volatility in the economic markets and government responses to these changes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These changing conditions and governmental responses could have impacts on the balance sheet and income statement of the Company in 2021. Loan-related earning assets tend to generate a higher spread than those earned in the Company&#8217;s investment portfolio. By design, the Company&#8217;s investment portfolio is moderate in duration and liquid in its composition of assets. 

During 2021, approximately $1.8 billion of available-for-sale securities are expected to have principal repayments. This includes approximately $592 million which will have principal repayments during the first quarter of 2021. The available-for-sale investment portfolio had an average life of 70.1 months, 70.9 months, and 56.8 months as of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. 

Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses

The ACL represents management&#8217;s judgment of total expected losses included in the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The Company&#8217;s process for recording the ACL is based on the evaluation of the Company&#8217;s lifetime historical loss experience, management&#8217;s understanding of the credit quality inherent in the loan portfolio, and the impact of the current economic environment, coupled with reasonable and supportable economic forecasts.

A mathematical calculation of an estimate is made to assist in determining the adequacy and reasonableness of management&#8217;s recorded ACL. To develop the estimate, the Company follows the guidelines in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 326, Financial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses (ASC 326). The estimate reserves for assets held at amortized cost and any related credit deterioration in the Company&#8217;s available-for-sale debt security portfolio. Assets held at amortized cost include the Company&#8217;s loan book and held-to-maturity security portfolio. 

&#160;

The process involves the consideration of quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the specific segmentation of loans. These factors have been established over decades of financial institution experience and include economic observation and loan loss characteristics. This process is designed to produce a lifetime estimate of the losses, at a reporting date, that includes evaluation of historical loss experience, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and the qualitative framework outlined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in the published 2020 Interagency Policy Statement. This process allows management to take a holistic view of the recorded ACL reserve and ensure that all significant and pertinent information is considered. 

The Company considers a variety of factors to ensure the safety and soundness of its estimate including a strong internal control framework, extensive methodology documentation, credit underwriting standards which encompass the Company&#8217;s desired risk profile, model validation, and ratio analysis. If the Company&#8217;s total ACL estimate, as determined in accordance with the approved ACL methodology, is either outside a reasonable range based on review of economic indicators or by comparison of historical ratio analysis, the ACL estimate is an outlier and management will investigate the underlying reason(s). Based on that investigation, issues or factors that previously had not been considered may be identified in the estimation process, which may warrant adjustments to estimated credit losses. 

The ending result of this process is a recorded consolidated ACL that represents management&#8217;s best estimate of the total expected losses included in the loan portfolio, held-to-maturity securities, and credit deterioration in available-for-sale securities. 

Table 4 presents the components of the allowance by loan portfolio segment. The Company manages the ACL against the risk in the entire loan portfolio and therefore, the allocation of the ACL to a particular loan segment may change in the future. Management of the Company believes the present ACL is adequate considering the Company&#8217;s loss experience, delinquency trends and current economic conditions. Future economic conditions and borrowers&#8217; ability to meet their obligations, however, are uncertainties which could affect the Company&#8217;s ACL and/or need to change its current level of provision. For more information on loan portfolio segments and ACL methodology refer to Note 3, &#8220;Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses,&#8221; in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Table 4

ALLOCATION OF ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES (in thousands) 

This table presents an allocation of the allowance for credit losses by loan portfolio segment, which represents the total expected losses derived by both quantitative and qualitative methods. The amounts presented are not necessarily indicative of actual future charge-offs in any particular category and are subject to change. The disclosure as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are presented based on the loan classes upon adoption of ASC 326, while prior period amounts continue to be presented in accordance with the loan classes under previously applicable GAAP.

Table 5 presents a five-year summary of the Company&#8217;s ACL. Also, please see &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk &#8211; Credit Risk Management&#8221; on page 54 in this report for information relating to nonaccrual, past due, restructured loans, and other credit risk matters. For more information on loan portfolio segments and ACL methodology refer to Note 3, &#8220;Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses,&#8221; in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

As illustrated in Table 5 below, the ACL increased as a percentage of total loans to 1.34% as of December 31, 2020, compared to 0.76% as of December 31, 2019. The provision for credit losses, including provision for off-balance sheet credit exposures, totaled $130.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which is an increase of $97.7 million, or 297.3%, compared to the same period in 2019. This increase is the result of the adoption of the CECL standard and applying this methodology for computing the allowance for credit losses, coupled with the impacts of the current and forecasted economic environment related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The provision for loan losses totaled $32.9 million and $70.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Noninterest Income

A key objective of the Company is the growth of noninterest income to provide a diverse source of revenue not directly tied to interest rates. Fee-based services are typically non-credit related and are not generally affected by fluctuations in interest rates. Noninterest income increased in 2020 by $133.4 million, or 31.3%, compared to 2019 and increased in 2019 by $25.1 million, or 6.2%, compared to 2018. The increase in 2020 is primarily attributable to an increase in investment securities gains, net, fund servicing income, and trading and investment banking income. These are offset by decreases in brokerage and bankcard income. The increase in 2019 is 

&#160;

primarily attributable to trading and investment banking, brokerage, trust and securities processing, company-owned life insurance, and derivative income. 

The Company&#8217;s fee-based services offer multiple products and services, which management believes will more closely align with customer product demands. The Company is currently emphasizing fee-based services including trust and securities processing, bankcard, securities trading and brokerage and cash and treasury management. Management believes that it can offer these products and services both efficiently and profitably, as most have common platforms and support structures.

Noninterest income and the year-over-year changes in noninterest income are summarized in Table 6 above. The dollar change and percent change columns highlight the respective net increase or decrease in the categories of noninterest income in 2020 compared to 2019, and in 2019 compared to 2018. 

Trust and securities processing income consists of fees earned on personal and corporate trust accounts, custody of securities services, trust investments and wealth management services, and mutual fund assets servicing. This income category increased by $17.7 million, or 10.0% in 2020, compared to 2019, and increased by $4.8 million, or 2.8%, in 2019, compared to 2018. During 2020, fund services income increased $10.6 million and corporate trust income increased $7.2 million. During 2019, corporate trust revenue increased $6.9 million, partially offset by a decrease of $1.4 million in fee income from fund services fees.

Trading and investment banking income increased $9.5 million, or 40.4%, in 2020 compared to 2019 and increased $7.9 million, or 50.6%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase in 2020 compared to 2019 and the increase in 2019 compared to 2018 was driven by increased bond trading income. 

Brokerage fees decreased $6.9 million, or 22.1%, in 2020 compared to 2019 but increased $5.5 million, or 21.1%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease in 2020 was driven by lower 12b-1 fees related to the reduction in interest rates during the year. The increase from 2018 to 2019 primarily due to an increase in money market and 12b-1 income driven by an increase in volume and interest rates. 

Bankcard fees decreased $6.2 million, or 9.3%, in 2020 compared to 2019, and decreased $1.8 million, or 2.6%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily driven by decreased interchange income, offset by decreased rewards and rebate expense. The decrease in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily driven by increased rebate expense. 

Investment securities gains, net increased $118.4 million in 2020 compared to 2019 but decreased by $1.3 million in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase in 2020 was driven by the $108.8 million gain on the Company&#8217;s investment in Tattooed Chef, Inc., an increase of $3.9 million in gains on equity securities without readily determinable fair values, and an increase of $3.8 million in gains on sales of available-for-sale securities. The decrease in 2019 was driven by a decrease in gains on equity securities without readily determinable fair values of $3.9 million, offset by an increase in gains on sale of available-for-sale securities of $2.6 million. 

&#160;

Other noninterest income is flat in 2020 compared to 2019 and increased $ 11 .3 million, or 36 .9 % , in 2019 compared to 2018. T he increase from 2018 to 2019 was primarily due to an increase in company-owned life insurance income and derivative income . Changes in company-owned life insurance are offset by proportionate changes in deferred compensation expense noted below. 

Noninterest Expense

Noninterest expense increased in 2020 by $43.1 million, or 5.5%, compared to 2019 and increased in 2019 by $61.1 million, or 8.5%, compared to 2018. From 2019 to 2020 the increases were driven by salary and employee benefits expense, other miscellaneous expense, and equipment expense, offset by a decrease in marketing and business development expense. The main drivers of the increase from 2018 to 2019 were salary and employee benefits expense, processing fees, and equipment expense. Table 7 below summarizes the components of noninterest expense and the respective year-over-year changes for each category.

Salaries and employee benefits expense increased $34.0 million, or 7.4%, in 2020 compared to 2019 and $42.4 million, or 10.1%, in 2019 compared to 2018. In 2020, bonus and commission expense increased $23.6 million, or 25.3%, driven by business volumes and revenue growth, and higher company performance. Salary and wage expense increased $12.1 million, or 4.3%. These increases were offset by a decrease in employee benefits expense of $1.7 million, or 2.1%. In 2019, employee benefit expense increased $16.1 million, or 23.8%, driven by higher deferred compensation expense. Salary and wage expense increased $14.4 million, or 5.3%, and bonus and commission expense increased $11.9 million, or 14.6%.

Equipment expense increased $6.6 million, or 8.4%, and $3.9 million, or 5.2% in 2020 and 2019, respectively. This increase is driven by increased computer hardware and software expenses for the ongoing investments in digital channel and integrated platform solutions to support business growth and the continued modernization of the Company&#8217;s core systems in both years.

Marketing and business development expense decreased $11.6 million, or 44.1%, in 2020 compared to 2019, but increased $1.9 million, or 7.7%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease in 2020 is driven by reduced travel and entertainment expenses and business development expense related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in 2019 was driven by the timing of advertising and business development projects and higher travel expenses as compared to 2018.

Processing fees expense increased $2.0 million, or 3.9%, in 2020 compared to 2019, and increased $5.2 million, or 11.1%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The increases in 2020 and 2019 are primarily driven by ongoing investments in digital channel and integrated platform solutions to support business growth and the continued modernization of the Company&#8217;s core systems. 

&#160;

Other noninterest expense increased $ 16 .2 million, or 59 . 8 % , and increased $2.2 million, or 8.6 % , in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in 2020 is primarily driven by higher operation al losses and derivative expense. The increase in 20 19 is primarily driven by higher operational losses , offset by lower other real estate and repossession expenses as compared to 2018 . &#160; &#160; 

Income Taxes

Income tax expense for continuing operations totaled $52.4 million, $42.4 million, and $27.3 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018 respectively. These amounts equate to effective tax rates of 15.5%, 14.8%, and 12.2% for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate from 2019 to 2020 is primarily attributable to a smaller portion of pre-tax income being earned from tax-exempt municipal securities. The increase in the effective tax rate from 2018 to 2019 is primarily attributable to a discrete tax benefit of $5.1 million related to 2017 federal provision-to-return adjustments recorded in 2018 with no corresponding adjustment in 2019. Of this amount, $5.0 million was due to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities upon completion of the 2017 federal tax return during the fourth quarter of 2018. 

For further information on income taxes refer to Note 17, &#8220;Income Taxes,&#8221; in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Business Segments

The Company has strategically aligned its operations into the following three reportable segments: Commercial Banking, Institutional Banking, and Personal Banking (collectively, the Business Segments). Senior executive officers regularly evaluate Business Segment financial results produced by the Company&#8217;s internal reporting system in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance for individual Business Segments. Prior to 2020, the Company had the following four Business Segments: Commercial Banking, Institutional Banking, Personal Banking, and Healthcare Services. In the first quarter of 2020, the Company merged the Healthcare Services segment into the Institutional Banking segment to better reflect how the Company&#8217;s core businesses, products and services are currently being evaluated by management. The management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each Business Segment using methodologies that are refined on an ongoing basis. For comparability purposes, amounts in all periods are based on methodologies in effect at December 31, 2020. Previously reported results have been reclassified in this Form 10-K to conform to the Company&#8217;s current organizational structure.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, Institutional Banking income from continuing operations decreased $13.6 million, or 17.8%, compared to the same period last year. Net interest income decreased $19.7 million, or 15.6%, compared to the same period last year, due to a decrease in funds transfer pricing driven by lower interest rates.

Noninterest expense increased $18.2 million, or 6.8%, primarily driven by increases of $8.4 million in technology, service, and overhead expenses, $8.3 million in salary and employee benefits expense, $2.3 million in bankcard expense, and increased amortization expense of $1.7 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $2.6 million in marketing and business development expense due to decreased travel and entertainment expense as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

##TABLE_END

&#160;

For the year ended December 31, 2020, Personal Banking recognized a net loss from continuing operations of $7.1 million, a decrease of $3.7 million as compared to the same period last year. Net interest income increased $16.9 million, or 12.8%, compared to the same period last year due to increased loan balances. Provision for credit losses increased $4.5 million due to the adoption of CECL, coupled with the current economic environment and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are key elements of these forecasts. Noninterest income increased $3.2 million, or 2.8%, primarily driven by an increase of $3.1 million in 

&#160;

equity earnings on alternative investments, and an increase of $2.9 million on gains on the sale of mortgage originations. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $2.6 million in deposit service charges. Noninterest expense in creased $ 20.0 million, or 8.2% , primarily due to an increase of $ 11.1 million in technology, service, and overhead expense for investments to support growth across the segment&#8217;s lines of business, an increase of $ 8.1 million in salary and employee benefits expense, an increase of $2.3 million in other expense due to higher operational losses in 2020, and an increase of $2.3 million in legal expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $2.0 million in marketing and business development due to decreased travel and entertainment expense as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and a decrease of $2.0 million in supplies and services expense . 

Balance Sheet Analysis

Loans and Loans Held For Sale

Loans represent the Company&#8217;s largest source of interest income. Loan balances held for investment increased by $2.7 billion, or 19.9%, in 2020. This increase was primarily driven by an increase of $1.4 billion, or 24.7%, in commercial loans, $765.5 million, or 14.9%, in commercial real estate loans, and $551.7 million, or 39.6%, in consumer real estate loans. The increase in commercial loans is largely driven by the Company&#8217;s participation in the PPP. PPP loans totaled $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2020.

##TABLE_END

&#160;

Included in Table 11 is a five-year breakdown of loans by type. Commercial &#38; industrial loans and commercial real estate loans continue to represent the largest segments of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio, comprising 

&#160;

approximately 43.8% and 36.7 % , respectively, of total loans and loans held for sale at the end of 2020 and 42.1% and 38.3%, respectively, of total loans and loans held for sale at the end of 2019 . 

Commercial loans represent the largest percent of total loans. Commercial loans at December 31, 2020 have increased $1.4 billion, or 24.7%, as compared to December 31, 2019, to 43.8% of total loans. Commercial loans represented 42.1% of total loans at December 31, 2019. The increase in commercial loans is largely driven by the Company&#8217;s participation in the PPP. PPP loans totaled $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2020. 

As a percentage of total loans, commercial real estate now comprises 36.7% of total loans compared to 38.3% in 2019. Commercial real estate loans increased $765.5 million, or 14.9%, compared to 2019. Generally, these loans are made for investment and real estate development or working capital and business expansion purposes and are primarily secured by real estate with a maximum loan-to-value of 80%. Most of these properties are non-owner occupied and have guarantees as additional security.

Consumer real estate loans increased $551.7 million, or 39.6%, and represented 12.1% of total loans. Specialty lending loans increased $17.4 million, or 3.5%, and represented 3.2% of total loans as of December 31, 2020. 

Nonaccrual, past due and restructured loans are discussed under &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk &#8211; Credit Risk Management&#8221; in Item 7A on page 54 of this report.

Investment Securities

The Company&#8217;s investment portfolio contains trading, available-for-sale (AFS), and held-to-maturity (HTM) securities as well as FRB stock, Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) stock, and other miscellaneous investments. Investment securities totaled $10.6 billion as of December 31, 2020 and $8.7 billion as of December 31, 2019 and comprised 34.0% and 35.1% of the Company&#8217;s earning assets, respectively, as of those dates. 

The Company&#8217;s AFS securities portfolio comprised 87.4% of the Company&#8217;s investment securities portfolio at December 31, 2020, compared to 85.4% at December 31, 2019. The Company&#8217;s AFS securities portfolio provides liquidity as a result of the composition and average life of the underlying securities. This liquidity can be used to fund loan growth or to offset the outflow of traditional funding sources. The average life of the AFS securities portfolio decreased from 70.9 months at December 31, 2019 to 70.1 months at December 31, 2020. In addition to providing a potential source of liquidity, the AFS securities portfolio can be used as a tool to manage interest rate sensitivity. The Company&#8217;s goal in the management of its AFS securities portfolio is to maximize return within the Company&#8217;s parameters of liquidity goals, interest rate risk and credit risk. 

Management expects collateral pledging requirements for public funds, loan demand, and deposit funding to be the primary factors impacting changes in the level of AFS securities. There were $7.8 billion of AFS securities pledged to secure U.S. Government deposits, other public deposits, certain trust deposits, derivative transactions, and repurchase agreements at December 31, 2020. Of this amount, securities with a market value of $371.5 million at December 31, 2020 were pledged at the Federal Reserve Discount Window but were unencumbered as of that date.

The Company&#8217;s HTM securities portfolio consists of private placement bonds, which are issued primarily to refinance existing revenue bonds in the healthcare and education sectors. The HTM portfolio totaled $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2020, a decrease of $101.5 million, or 9.1%, from December 31, 2019. The average life of the HTM portfolio was 6.1 years at December 31, 2020, compared to 6.3 years at December 31, 2019.

The securities portfolio generates the Company&#8217;s second largest component of interest income. The AFS and HTM securities portfolios achieved an average yield on a tax-equivalent basis of 2.45% for 2020, compared to 2.64% in 2019, and 2.41% in 2018. Securities available for sale had a net unrealized gain of $412.0 million at year-end, compared to a net unrealized gain of $123.4 million the preceding year. This market value change primarily reflects the impact of a larger portfolio size and declining market interest rates as of December 31, 2020, compared to December 31, 2019. These amounts are reflected, on an after-tax basis, in the Company&#8217;s Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders&#8217; equity, as an unrealized gain of $314.5 million at year-end 2020, compared to an unrealized gain of $93.7 million for 2019. The AFS securities portfolio contains securities that have unrealized losses (see the table of these securities in Note 4, &#8220;Securities,&#8221; in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 92 of this document). The unrealized losses in the Company&#8217;s investments in Government 

&#160;

Sponsored Entity (GSE) mortgage-backed securities, State and political subdivisions, and Corporates were caused by changes in interest rates, and not from a decline in credit of the underlying issuers. The U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency, and GSE mortgage-backed securities are all considered to be agency-backed securities with no risk of loss as they are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government. The changes in fair value in the agency-backed portfolios are solely driven by change in interest rates caused by changing economic conditions. The Company has no knowledge of any underlying credit issues and the cash flows underlying the debt securities have not changed and are not expected to be impacted by changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2020, the Company does not believe the decline in value in these portfolios is related to credit impairments and instead is due to declining interest rates. The Company does not have the intent to sell these securities and does not believe it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell these securities before a recovery of amortized cost. As of December 31, 2020, there is no ACL related to the Company&#8217;s available - for - sale securities as the decline in fair value did not result from credit issues. 

Included in Tables 12 and 13 are analyses of the cost, fair value and average yield (tax-equivalent basis) of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity.

Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are generally traded on an exchange and market prices are readily available. As of December 31, 2020, equity securities with readily determinable fair values includes the 

&#160;

Company&#8217;s investment in Tattooed Chef, Inc., which had a fair value of $106.9 million as of December 31, 2020. Equity securities without readily determinable fair values are generally carried at cost less impairment.

Other Earning Assets

Federal funds transactions essentially are overnight loans between financial institutions, which allow for either the daily investment of excess funds or the daily borrowing of another institution&#8217;s funds in order to meet short-term liquidity needs. The net borrowed position was $65.6 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $28.9 million at December 31, 2019. 

The Bank buys and sells federal funds as agent for non-affiliated banks. Because the transactions are pursuant to agency arrangements, these transactions do not appear on the balance sheet and averaged $362.5 million in 2020 and $239.2 million in 2019.

At December 31, 2020, the Company held securities purchased under agreements to resell of $1.7 billion compared to $1.6 billion at December 31, 2019. The Company uses these instruments as short-term secured investments, in lieu of selling federal funds, or to acquire securities required for collateral purposes. Balances will fluctuate based on the Company&#8217;s liquidity and investment decisions as well as the Company&#8217;s correspondent bank borrowing levels. These investments averaged $1.1 billion in 2020 and $533.1 million in 2019.

The Company also maintains an active securities trading inventory. The average holdings in the securities trading inventory in 2020 were $37.1 million, compared to $52.3 million in 2019, and were recorded at fair market value. As discussed in &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk &#8211; Trading Account&#8221; in Part II, Item 7A on page 54, the Company offsets the trading account securities by the sale of exchange-traded financial futures contracts, with both the trading account and futures contracts marked to market daily.

Interest-bearing due from banks totaled $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2020 compared to $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2019 and includes amounts due from the FRB and interest-bearing accounts held at other financial institutions. The amount due from the FRB averaged $1.2 billion and $560.9 million during December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in the FRB balance from 2019 to 2020 is primarily due to an increase in deposit balances as a result of the Company&#8217;s participation in the PPP. The interest-bearing accounts held at other financial institutions totaled $43.1 million and $29.3 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

Deposits and Borrowed Funds

Deposits represent the Company&#8217;s primary funding source for its asset base. In addition to the core deposits garnered by the Company&#8217;s retail branch structure, the Company continues to focus on its cash management services, as well as its asset management and mutual fund servicing businesses in order to attract and retain additional core deposits. Deposits totaled $27.1 billion at December 31, 2020 and $21.6 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $5.4 billion, or 25.2%. Deposits averaged $23.2 billion in 2020, and $19.3 billion in 2019.

Noninterest-bearing demand deposits averaged $7.8 billion in 2020 and $6.1 billion in 2019. These deposits represented 33.8% of average deposits in 2020, compared to 31.8% in 2019. The Company&#8217;s large commercial customer base provides a significant source of noninterest-bearing deposits. Many of these commercial accounts do not earn interest&#59; however, they receive an earnings credit to offset the cost of other services provided by the Company.

Long-term debt totaled $270.0 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $70.4 million at December 31, 2019. In September 2020, the Company issued $200.0 million in aggregate subordinated notes due in September 2030. The Company received $197.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, and used the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including, among other uses, contributing Tier 1 capital into the Bank. The subordinated notes were issued with a fixed-to-fixed rate of 3.70% and an effective rate of 3.93%, due to issuance costs, with an interest rate reset date of September 2025. The remainder of the Company&#8217;s long-term debt was assumed from the acquisition of Marquette and consists of debt obligations payable to four unconsolidated trusts (Marquette Capital Trust I, Marquette Capital Trust II, Marquette Capital Trust III, and Marquette Capital Trust IV) that previously issued trust preferred securities. These long-term debt obligations had an aggregate contractual balance of $103.1 million and had a carrying value of $71.7 million at December 31, 2020. Interest rates on trust preferred securities are tied to the three-month LIBOR with spreads ranging from 133 basis points to 160 basis points, and reset quarterly. The trust preferred securities have maturity dates ranging from January 2036 to September 2036. For further information on long-term debt refer to Note 9, &#8220;Borrowed Funds,&#8221; in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Capital Resources and Liquidity

The Company places a significant emphasis on the maintenance of a strong capital position, which it believes promotes investor confidence, provides access to funding sources under favorable terms, and enhances the Company&#8217;s ability to capitalize on business growth and acquisition opportunities. Higher levels of liquidity, however, bear corresponding costs, measured in terms of lower yields on short-term, more liquid earning assets and higher expenses for extended liability maturities. The Company manages capital for each subsidiary based upon the subsidiary&#8217;s respective risks and growth opportunities as well as regulatory requirements.

Total shareholders&#8217; equity increased $410.5 million, or 15.7% to $3.0 billion at December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019. 

The Board authorized, at its April 28, 2020, April 23, 2019, and April 24, 2018 meetings, the repurchase of up to two million shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock during the twelve months following each meeting (each a Repurchase Authorization). During 2020 and 2019, the Company acquired 1,208,623 shares and 67,923 shares, respectively, of its common stock pursuant to the applicable Repurchase Authorization. During March 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) to repurchase an aggregate of $30.0 million of the Company&#8217;s common stock through an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the ASR). Under the ASR, the Company repurchased a total of 653,498 shares, which was completed during the second quarter of 2020. The ASR was entered into pursuant to the April 23, 2019 Repurchase Authorization. The Company has not made any repurchase of its securities other than pursuant to the Repurchase Authorizations.

&#160;

Through the Company&#8217;s relationship with the FHLB of Des Moines, the Company owns $10.0 million of FHLB stock and has access to additional liquidity and funding sources through FHLB advances. The Company&#8217;s borrowing capacity is dependent upon the amount of collateral the Company places at the FHLB. The Company&#8217;s borrowing capacity with the FHLB was $ 1. 5 b ill ion as of December 31, 2020 . The Company had no outstanding FHLB advances at FHLB of Des Moines as of December 31, 2020 . 

Risk-based capital guidelines established by regulatory agencies set minimum capital standards based on the level of risk associated with a financial institution&#8217;s assets. The Company has implemented the Basel III regulatory capital rules adopted by the FRB. Basel III capital rules include a minimum ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5% and a minimum tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%. A financial institution&#8217;s total capital is also required to equal at least 8% of risk-weighted assets. 

The risk-based capital guidelines indicate the specific risk weightings by type of asset. Certain off-balance sheet items (such as standby letters of credit and binding loan commitments) are multiplied by credit conversion factors to translate them into balance sheet equivalents before assigning them specific risk weightings. The Company is also required to maintain a leverage ratio equal to or greater than 4%. The leverage ratio is tier 1 core capital to total average assets less goodwill and intangibles. The Company's capital position as of December 31, 2020 is summarized in the table below and exceeded regulatory requirements.

For further discussion of capital and liquidity, see the &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk &#8211; Liquidity Risk&#8221; in Item 7A on page 56 of this report.

Commitments, Contractual Obligations and Off-balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company&#8217;s main off-balance sheet arrangements are loan commitments, commercial and standby letters of credit, futures contracts and forward exchange contracts, which have maturity dates rather than payment due dates. These commitments and contingent liabilities are not required to be recorded on the Company&#8217;s balance sheet. Since commitments associated with letters of credit and lending and financing arrangements may expire unused, the amounts shown do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements. See Table 19 below, as well as Note 15, &#8220;Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 on pages 110 through 112 for detailed information and further discussion of these arrangements. Management does not anticipate any material losses from its off-balance sheet arrangements.

##TABLE_END

&#160;

As of December 31, 2020, our total liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits were $6.7 million. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the settlement of these liabilities. Therefore, these liabilities have been excluded from the table above. See Note 17, &#8220;Income Taxes,&#8221; in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to customers and suppliers, allowance for credit losses, bad debts, investments, financing operations, long-lived assets, taxes, other contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which have formed the basis for making such judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Under different assumptions or conditions, actual results may differ from the recorded estimates. 

Management believes that the Company&#8217;s critical accounting policies are those relating to: the allowance for credit losses and fair value measurements. 

Allowance for Credit Losses

The Company&#8217;s ACL represents management&#8217;s judgment of the total expected losses included in the Company&#8217;s assets held at amortized cost. The Company&#8217;s process for recording the ACL is based on the evaluation of the Company&#8217;s lifetime historical loss experience, management&#8217;s understanding of the credit quality inherent in the loan portfolio, and the impact of the current economic environment, coupled with reasonable and supportable economic forecasts.

&#160;

A mathematical calculation of an estimate is made to assist in determining the adequacy and reasonableness of management&#8217;s recorded ACL. To develop the estimate, the Company follows the guidelines in ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses . The estimate reserves for assets held at amortized cost and any related credit deterioration in the Company&#8217;s available-for-sale debt security portfolio. Assets held at amortized cost include the Company&#8217;s loan book and held-to-maturity security portfolio. 

&#160;

The process involves the consideration of quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the specific segmentation of loans. These factors have been established over decades of financial institution experience and include economic observation and loan loss characteristics. This process is designed to produce a lifetime estimate of the losses, at a reporting date, that includes evaluation of historical loss experience, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and the qualitative framework outlined by the Office of the Comptroller of the 

&#160;

Currency in the published 2020 Interagency Policy Statement. This process allows management to take a holistic view of the recorded ACL reserve and ensure that all significant and pertinent information is considered. 

&#160;

The Company considers a variety of factors to ensure the safety and soundness of its estimate including a strong internal control framework, extensive methodology documentation, credit underwriting standards which encompass the Company&#8217;s desired risk profile, model validation, and ratio analysis. If the Company&#8217;s total ACL estimate, as determined in accordance with the approved ACL methodology, is either outside a reasonable range based on review of economic indicators or by comparison of historical ratio analysis, the ACL estimate is an outlier and management will investigate the underlying reason(s). Based on that investigation, issues or factors that previously had not been considered may be identified in the estimation process, which may warrant adjustments to estimated credit losses.

The ending result of this process is a recorded consolidated ACL that represents management&#8217;s best estimate of the total expected losses included in the loan portfolio, held-to-maturity securities, and credit deterioration in available-for-sale securities.

For more information on loan portfolio segments and ACL methodology refer to Note 3, &#8220;Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses,&#8221; in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Fair Value Measurements

Fair value is measured in accordance with GAAP, which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value include the market approach, income approach and cost approach. The market approach uses prices or relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach involves discounting future amounts to a single present amount and is based on current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of the asset. 

GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). An instrument&#8217;s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the instrument&#8217;s fair value measurement. The three levels within the fair value hierarchy are described as follows: 

Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are available at the measurement date. 

Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets&#59; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active&#59; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability&#59; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability for which there is little, if any, market activity at the measurement date. Unobservable inputs reflect assumptions about what market participants would use to price the asset or liability. The inputs are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances, which might include the Company&#8217;s own financial data such as internally developed pricing models and discounted cash flow methodologies, as well as instruments for which the fair value determination requires significant management judgment. 

The Company&#8217;s fair value measurements involve various valuation techniques and models, which involve inputs that are observable, when available, and the most significant of which include available-for-sale and trading securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. 

Fair value pricing information obtained from third party data providers and pricing services for investment securities is reviewed for appropriateness on a periodic basis. The third-party service providers are also analyzed to understand and evaluate the valuation methodologies utilized. This review includes an analysis of current market prices compared to pricing provided by the third-party pricing service to assess the relative accuracy of the data provided.
