Overview

&#160;

During the first quarter of 2020, the global economy began experiencing a downturn related to the impacts of the COVID-19 global pandemic (the COVID-19 pandemic, or the pandemic). Such impacts have included significant volatility in the global stock and fixed income markets, a 150-basis-point reduction in the target federal funds rate, the enactment of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, including the 

&#160;

Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) administered by the Small Business Administration, and a variety of rulings from the Company&#8217;s banking regulators. 

&#160;

The Company continues to actively monitor developments related to COVID-19 and its impact to its business, customers, employees, counterparties, vendors, and service providers. During the third quarter of 2020, the Company&#8217;s results of operations included continued building of the allowance for credit losses and monitoring key macroeconomic variables utilized in the econometric models under the CECL accounting standard adopted on January 1, 2020 and $1.4 million of nonrecurring COVID-19 specific expenses. Additionally, the Company continued to see impacts of the volatile equity and debt markets and low interest rate environment in its fee-based businesses.

&#160;

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company formed a Pandemic Taskforce and a steering group comprised of associates across multiple lines of business and support functions and has taken several actions to offer various forms of support to our customers, employees, and communities that have experienced impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately 65% of the Company&#8217;s associates are working remotely. The Company has also increased purchases of computer hardware to support a remote workforce, as well as incurred additional cleaning and janitorial expense to disinfect branch and office locations. The Company is also actively working with customers impacted by the economic downturn by offering payment deferrals and other loan modifications. See further details under &#8220;Credit Risk Management&#8221; within &#8220;Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.&#8221; Additionally, the Company has recorded over 5,000 loans totaling $1.5 billion under the PPP. 

&#160;

In light of volatility in the capital markets and economic disruptions, the Company continues to carefully monitor its capital and liquidity position. In March 2020, the U.S. banking agencies issued an interim final rule that provides banking organizations with an alternative option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL's effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. The Company elected this alternative in the first quarter of 2020. The Company continues to anticipate that it will have sufficient capital levels to meet all applicable regulatory capital requirements. 

&#160;

The COVID-19 pandemic and stay-at-home and similar mandates have also necessitated certain actions related to the way the Company operates its business. As noted above, the Company transitioned most of its workforce off-site or to work-from-home to help mitigate health risks. The Company is also carefully monitoring the activities of its vendors and other third-party service providers to mitigate the risks associated with any potential service disruptions. The length of time it may be required to operate under such circumstances and future degrees of disruption remain uncertain. While the Company has not experienced material adverse disruptions to its internal operations due to the pandemic, it continues to review evolving risks and developments.

&#160;

The Company has detailed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in each applicable section of &#8220;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; included below.

The Company focuses on the following strategic objectives to guide its efforts to achieve its vision, to deliver the unparalleled customer experience, all while seeking to improve net income and strengthen the balance sheet while undertaking prudent risk management.

The first strategic objective is to continuously improve operating efficiencies. The Company has focused on identifying efficiencies that simplify our organizational and reporting structures, streamline back office functions and take advantage of synergies and newer technologies among various platforms and distribution networks. The Company has identified and expects to continue identifying ongoing efficiencies through the normal course of business that, when combined with increased revenue, will contribute to improved operating leverage. During the third quarter of 2020, total revenue increased $25.5 million, or 9.4%, as compared to the third quarter of 2019, while noninterest expense increased $6.6 million, or 3.4%, for the same period. Included in the noninterest expense increase is $2.9 million of severance and $1.4 million of nonrecurring COVID-19 related expenses. The remaining increase in noninterest expense is primarily driven by an increase in bonus and commission expense, deferred compensation expense, and salary and wage expense, partially offset by a decrease in marketing and business development expense, consulting expense, and operational losses. As part of the initiative to improve operating efficiencies, the Company continues to invest in technological advances that it believes will help management drive 

&#160;

operating leverage in the future through improved data analysis and automation. The Company also continues to evaluate core systems and will invest in enhancements that it believes will yield operating efficiencies. 

The second strategic objective is to increase net interest income through profitable loan and deposit growth and the optimization of the balance sheet. During the third quarter of 2020, the Company had an increase in net interest income of $16.1 million, or 9.6%, from the same period in 2019. The Company has shown increased net interest income through the effects of increased volume and mix of average earning assets. Loans recorded under the PPP increased loan interest income by $8.7 million in the third quarter of 2020. The additional increase in interest income was driven by an increase of $1.3 billion in non-PPP loans. These increases were offset by the recent interest rate reductions. Average loan balances increased $2.8 billion, or 22.0%, for the third quarter of 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. Average PPP loans account for $1.5 billion of this variance. The funding for these assets was driven primarily by a 19.8% increase in average interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased 36 basis points compared to the same period in 2019, in large part due to a decrease in one-month LIBOR rates, excess liquidity buildup, and repricing of earning assets in the low interest rate environment, offset by a 100-basis point decrease in cost of interest-bearing deposits. However, net interest spread contracted by only one basis point during the same period. The Company expects to see continued volatility in the economic markets and government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. These changing conditions and governmental responses could have impacts on the balance sheet and income statement of the Company for the remainder of the year. 

The third strategic objective is to grow the Company&#8217;s revenue from noninterest sources. The Company seeks to grow noninterest revenues throughout all economic and interest rate cycles, while positioning itself to benefit in periods of economic growth. Noninterest income increased $9.4 million, or 9.0%, to $113.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. This change is primarily due to an increase in trust and securities processing, the market value of company-owned life insurance, derivative income, and trading and investment banking income. See greater detail below under Noninterest Income. The Company continues to emphasize its asset management, brokerage, bankcard services, healthcare services, and treasury management businesses. At September 30, 2020, noninterest income represented 38.0% of total revenues, compared to 38.1% at September 30, 2019. The recent economic changes have impacted fee income, especially those with assets tied to market values and interest rates.

The fourth strategic objective is effective capital management. The Company places a significant emphasis on maintaining a strong capital position, which management believes promotes investor confidence, provides access to funding sources under favorable terms, and enhances the Company&#8217;s ability to capitalize on business growth and acquisition opportunities. The Company continues to maximize shareholder value through a mix of reinvesting in organic growth, evaluating acquisition opportunities that complement the Company&#8217;s strategies, increasing dividends over time, and appropriately utilizing a share repurchase program. At September 30, 2020, the Company had $2.9 billion in total shareholders&#8217; equity. This is an increase of $290.3 million, or 11.3%, compared to total shareholders&#8217; equity at September 30, 2019. At September 30, 2020, the Company had a total risk-based capital ratio of 14.17%. The Company repurchased 2,262 shares of common stock at an average price of $46.91 per share during the third quarter of 2020. Total risk-based capital was favorably impacted by the $200 million subordinated note issuance during the third quarter. For additional information regarding the subordinated note issuance, please see the summary discussion in the &#8220;Deposits and Borrowed Funds&#8221; section included below.

Earnings Summary

The following is a summary regarding the Company&#8217;s earnings for the third quarter of 2020. The changes identified in the summary are explained in greater detail below. The Company recorded net income of $73.1 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2020, compared to net income of $62.4 million for the same period a year earlier. This represents a 17.2% increase over the three-month period ended September 30, 2019. Basic earnings per share for the third quarter of 2020 was $1.52 per share ($1.52 per share fully-diluted) compared to $1.28 per share ($1.27 per share fully-diluted) for the third quarter of 2019. Return on average assets and return on average common shareholders&#8217; equity for the three-month period ended September 30, 2020 were 0.99% and 10.23%, respectively, compared to 1.03% and 9.69%, respectively, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2019. 

&#160;

Net interest income for the three and nine -month period s ended September 30 , 20 20 increased $ 1 6 . 1 million, or 9 . 6 % , and $ 38 . 0 million, or 7 .6%, respectively, compared to the same period s in 201 9 . For the three-month period ended September 30 , 20 20 , average earning assets increased by $ 5.5 billion, or 24.4 % , and for the nine -month period ended September 30, 2020, they increased by $ 4.5 billion, or 20.5 %, compared to the same period s in 2019. Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased to 2. 7 3 % and 2.8 2 % for the three and nine -month period s ended September 30 , 20 20 , respectively, compared to 3.09% and 3.16 % , for the same period s in 2019 , respectively . &#160; 

The provision for credit losses increased by $8.5 million to $16.0 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2020 and increased by $94.7 million to $125.5 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same periods in 2019. This increase is the result of the adoption of the CECL standard in the first quarter of 2020 and applying this methodology for computing the allowance for credit losses, coupled with the impacts of the current and forecasted economic downturn related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company&#8217;s nonperforming loans increased $21.9 million to $93.7 million at September 30, 2020, compared to September 30, 2019. The allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of total loans increased to 1.33% as of September 30, 2020, compared to 0.82% at September 30, 2019. For a description of the Company&#8217;s methodology for computing the allowance for credit losses, please see the summary discussion in the &#8220;Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; section included below.

Noninterest income increased by $9.4 million, or 9.0%, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2020, and increased by $15.5 million, or 4.9%, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020, compared to the same periods in 2019. These changes are discussed in greater detail below under Noninterest Income.

Noninterest expense increased by $6.6 million, or 3.4%, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2020, and increased by $19.7 million, or 3.4%, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020, compared to the same periods in 2019. These changes are discussed in greater detail below under Noninterest Expense.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income is a significant source of the Company&#8217;s earnings and represents the amount by which interest income on earning assets exceeds the interest expense paid on liabilities. The volume of interest-earning assets and the related funding sources, the overall mix of these assets and liabilities, and the rates paid on each affect net interest income. Net interest income for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2020 increased $16.1 million, or 9.6%, and $38.0 million, or 7.6%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019. 

Table 1 shows the impact of earning asset rate changes compared to changes in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. As illustrated in this table, net interest spread for the three months ended September 30, 2020 decreased one basis point as compared to the same period in 2019. Net interest margin for the three months ended September 30, 2020 decreased 36 basis points compared to the same period in 2019. Net interest spread for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020 decreased six basis points as compared to the same period in 2019. Net interest margin for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020 decreased 34 basis points compared to the same period in 2019. The changes are primarily due to favorable volume variance on loans and securities and favorable rate variances on interest-bearing deposits, offset by unfavorable rate variances on earning assets. PPP loans account for $1.5 billion and $902.3 million for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2020, respectively. These variances have led to an increase in the Company&#8217;s net interest income during 2020, as compared to results for the same period in 2019. The changes compared to last year have been impacted by the recent short-term interest rate cuts and increased liquidity on the balance sheet. The Company expects to see continued volatility in the economic markets and government responses to these changes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These changing conditions and governmental responses could have impacts on the balance sheet and income statement of the Company the remainder of the year. For the impact of the contribution from free funds, see the Analysis of Net Interest Margin within Table 2 below. Table 2 also illustrates how the changes in volume and interest rates have resulted in an increase in net interest income.

&#160;

Table 1 

AVERAGE BALANCE SHEETS/YIELDS AND RATES (tax-equivalent basis) (unaudited, dollars in thousands) 

The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the average earning assets and resulting yields, as well as the average interest-bearing liabilities and resulting yields, expressed in both dollars and rates. All average balances are daily average balances. The average yield on earning assets without the tax-equivalent basis adjustment would have been 2.81% for the three-month period ended September 30, 2020, and 3.88% for the same period in 2019. The average yield on earning assets without the tax-equivalent basis adjustment would have been 3.05% for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020 and 3.96% for the same period in 2019.

Table 2 presents the dollar amount of change in net interest income and margin due to volume and rate. Table 2 also reflects the effect that interest-free funds have on net interest margin. The average balance of interest-free funds (total earning assets less interest-bearing liabilities) increased $2.5 billion for the three-month period ended September 30, 2020, and increased $1.9 billion for the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020, compared to the same periods in 2019. The benefit from interest-free funds decreased 35 and 28 basis points in the three and nine-month periods, respectively, due to decreased yields on earning assets, offset by a decrease in interest rates of interest-bearing liabilities.

Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses

The ACL represents management&#8217;s judgment of the total expected losses included in the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The Company&#8217;s process for recording the ACL is based on the evaluation of the Company&#8217;s lifetime historical loss experience, management&#8217;s understanding of the credit quality inherent in the loan portfolio, and the impact of the current economic environment, coupled with reasonable and supportable economic forecasts.

&#160;

&#160;

A mathematical calculation of an estimate is made to assist in determining the adequacy and reasonableness of management&#8217;s recorded ACL . To develop the estimate, the C ompany follows the guidelines in ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments &#8211; C redit Losses . The estimate reserves for assets held at amortized cost and any related credit deterioration in the Company&#8217;s available-for-sale debt security portfolio. Assets held at amortized cost include the Company&#8217;s loan book and held-to-maturity security portfolio. 

&#160;

The process involves the consideration of quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the specific segmentation of loans. These factors have been established over decades of financial institution experience and include economic observation and loan loss characteristics. This process is designed to produce a lifetime estimate of the losses, at a reporting date, that includes evaluation of historical loss experience, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and the qualitative framework outlined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in the published 2020 Interagency Policy Statement. This process allows management to take a holistic view of the recorded ACL reserve and ensure that all significant and pertinent information is considered.

&#160;

The Company considers a variety of factors to ensure the safety and soundness of its estimate including a strong internal control framework, extensive methodology documentation, credit underwriting standards which encompass the Company&#8217;s desired risk profile, model validation, and ratio analysis. If the Company&#8217;s total ACL estimate, as determined in accordance with the approved ACL methodology, is either outside a reasonable range based on review of economic indicators or by comparison of historical ratio analysis, the ACL estimate is an outlier and management will investigate the underlying reason(s). Based on that investigation, issues or factors that previously had not been considered may be identified in the estimation process, which may warrant adjustments to estimated credit losses. 

The ending result of this process is a recorded consolidated ACL that represents management&#8217;s best estimate of the total expected losses included in the loan portfolio, held-to-maturity securities, and credit deterioration in available-for-sale securities.

Based on the factors above, management of the Company recorded $16.0 million and $125.5 million as provision for credit losses for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to $7.5 million and $30.9 million for the same periods in 2019, respectively. As illustrated in Table 3 below, the ACL on loans increased to 1.33% of total loans as of September 30, 2020, compared to 0.82% of total loans as of September 30, 2019. 

Table 3 presents a summary of the Company&#8217;s ACL for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, and for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net charge-offs were $18.3 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020, compared to $27.1 million for the same period in 2019. See &#8220;Credit Risk Management&#8221; under &#8220;Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#8221; in this report for information relating to nonaccrual loans, past due loans, restructured loans and other credit risk matters.

Noninterest Income

A key objective of the Company is the growth of noninterest income to provide a diverse source of revenue not directly tied to interest rates. Fee-based services are typically non-credit related and are not generally affected by fluctuations in interest rates.

The Company offers multiple fee-based products and services, which management believes will more closely align with customer demands. The Company is currently emphasizing fee-based products and services including trust and securities processing, bankcard, securities trading and brokerage, and cash and treasury management. 

&#160;

Management believes that it can offer these products and services both efficiently and profitably, as most have common platforms and support structures.

Noninterest income increased by $9.4 million, or 9.0%, during the three-month period ended September 30, 2020, and increased $15.5 million, or 4.9%, during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020, compared to the same periods in 2019. Table 4 above summarizes the components of noninterest income and the respective year-over-year comparison for each category.

Trust and securities processing income consists of fees earned on personal and corporate trust accounts, custody of securities services, trust investments and wealth management services, mutual fund assets, and alternative asset servicing. The increase in these fees for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2020, compared to the same periods in 2019, was primarily due to an increase in corporate trust and fund services revenues. For the three-month period ended June 30, 2020, fund services revenue increased $3.7 million, or 17.6% and corporate trust revenue increased $1.6 million, or 21.3%. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020, fund services revenue increased $8.2 million, or 13.4%, and corporate trust revenue increased $5.8 million, or 28.3%. The recent volatile markets have impacted the income in this category. Since trust and securities processing fees are primarily asset-based, which are highly correlated to the change in market value of the assets, the related income for the remainder of the year will be affected by changes in the securities markets. Management continues to emphasize sales of services to both new and existing clients as well as increasing and improving the distribution channels.

Trading and investment banking fees for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2020 increased $3.0 million, or 51.9%, and $6.5 million, or 38.9%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019. These increases were primarily driven by increased trading volume and increased market valuations of investments 

&#160;

in the C ompany&#8217;s trading portfolio . The income in this category is market driven and impacted by general increases or decreases in trading volume. 

Service charges on deposit accounts for the three-month period ended September 30, 2020 decreased by $1.0 million, or 4.7%, compared to the same period last year, driven by lower corporate service charges and return item fees. For the nine-month period, service charges on deposit accounts increased $1.2 million, or 1.8%, compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by income related to healthcare customer transfer and conversion fees recorded in the first quarter of 2020, offset by lower corporate service charges and return item fees.

Brokerage fees for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2020, decreased $3.3 million, or 40.5%, and $2.0 million, or 8.9%, respectively as compared to the same periods in 2019. These decreases were driven by lower 12b-1 fees. The recent reduction in short-term interest rates will impact the income in this category the remainder of the year.

During the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2020, $0.3 million and $5.5 million in gains, respectively, were recognized on the sales of securities available for sale, compared to gains on the sales of securities available for sale of $3.1 million and $2.5 million for the same periods in 2019. The investment portfolio is continually evaluated for opportunities to improve its performance and risk profile relative to market conditions and the Company&#8217;s interest rate expectations. This can result in differences from quarter to quarter in the amount of realized gains or losses.

Other noninterest income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2020, increased $9.7 million, or 262.0%, driven by increased company-owned life insurance and increased derivative income. For the nine-month period, other noninterest income decreased $1.4 million, or 4.5%, compared to the same period in 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by decreases in company-owned life insurance, offset by an increase in equity earnings on alternative investments and derivative income.

Income Tax Expense

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s effective tax rate was 11.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared to 15.1% for the same period in 2019. The decrease in the effective tax rate for 2020 is primarily attributable to a larger portion of pre-tax income being earned from tax-exempt municipal securities.

Strategic Lines of Business

&#160;

The Company has strategically aligned its operations into the following three reportable Business Segments: Commercial Banking, Institutional Banking, and Personal Banking. The Company&#8217;s senior executive officers regularly evaluate Business Segment financial results produced by the Company&#8217;s internal reporting system in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance for individual Business Segments. Prior to 2020, the Company had the following four Business Segments: Commercial Banking, Institutional Banking, Personal Banking, and Healthcare Services. In the first quarter of 2020, the Company merged the Healthcare Services segment into the Institutional Banking segment to better reflect how the Company&#8217;s core businesses, products and services are currently being evaluated by management. For comparability purposes, amounts in all periods are based on methodologies in effect at September 30, 2020. Previously reported results have been reclassified in this Form 10-Q to conform to the Company&#8217;s current organizational structure.

For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020, Commercial Banking net income decreased by $33.7 million, or 28.0%, to $86.6 million, as compared to the same period in 2019. Net interest income increased $35.7 million, or 11.6%, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, primarily driven by strong loan growth and earning asset mix changes. Commercial Banking added loans of $1.5 billion and loan interest income of $15.6 million related to the PPP during the second and third quarters of 2020. Provision for credit losses increased by $89.9 million for the period due to adoption of CECL, coupled with the current economic environment and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are key elements of these forecasts. Noninterest income decreased $4.7 million, or 7.5%, over the same 

&#160;

period in 201 9 primarily due to a de crease of $ 2.2 million in bankcard fees driven by decreased interchange income, a decrease of $ 2.1 million in other noninterest income due to de creased company-owned life insurance income , and a decrease of $1.2 million in deposit service charges . Noninterest expense de creased $ 15.4 million, or 7.7 % , to $ 186.3 million for the nine-month period ended September 30 , 20 20 , compared to the same period in 201 9 .

For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020, Institutional Banking net income decreased $2.8 million, or 5.0%, compared to the same period last year. Net interest income decreased $8.3 million, or 9.0%, compared to the same period last year, driven by a decrease in funds transfer pricing due to the decline in interest rates. Noninterest income increased $21.0 million, or 12.4%, primarily due to increases of $10.3 million in bond trading income, $6.4 million in fund services income and $5.8 million in corporate trust income, both recorded in trust and securities processing revenue, and $4.4 million in service charges on deposit accounts due to healthcare customer transfer and conversion fees. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $3.4 million in bankcard fees driven by lower interchange income and a decrease of $2.3 million in brokerage fees primarily due to lower 12b-1 fee income. Noninterest expense increased $18.2 million, or 9.2%, primarily driven by an increase of $10.3 million in salary and employee benefits expense, an increase of $6.4 million in technology, service, and overhead expenses, increased bankcard expense of $1.8 million, and increased amortization expense of $1.6 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $1.7 million in marketing and business development expense due to decreased travel and entertainment expense as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020, Personal Banking recognized a net loss of $9.1 million, which represents a decrease of $10.4 million as compared to the same period last year. Net interest income increased $10.7 million, or 10.8%, compared to the same period last year due to increased loan balances. Provision for credit losses increased $4.7 million due to adoption of CECL, coupled with the current economic environment and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are key elements of these forecasts. Non interest income decreased $0.9 million, or 1.1%, for the same period. This decrease is primarily driven by a decrease of $2.0 million in deposit service charges and a decrease of $1.1 million in other noninterest income due to lower company-owned life insurance income. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $2.0 million in equity earnings on alternative investments. Noninterest expense increased $17.0 million, or 9.6%, primarily due to an increase of $10.1 million in technology, service, and overhead expenses, $6.6 million in salary and employee benefits expense, and $1.8 million in other expense due to higher operational losses recorded in 2020. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.7 million in marketing and business development expense due to decreased travel and entertainment expense as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and a decrease of $0.7 million in furniture and equipment expense .

Balance Sheet Analysis

Total assets of the Company increased by $3.7 billion, or 13.9%, as of September 30, 2020, compared to December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase of $2.5 billion, or 18.8%, in loan balances and an increase of $1.3 billion, or 17.1%, in available for sale securities. 

Total assets of the Company increased $6.1 billion, or 25.3%, as of September 30, 2020, compared to September 30, 2019, primarily due to an increase in loan balances of $2.9 billion, or 22.3%, an increase in AFS securities of $1.3 billion, or 17.6%, an increase in interest-bearing due from banks of $1.5 billion, or 919.1%, and an increase in securities purchased under agreements to resell of $638.2 million, or 137.8%. Total assets, including interest-bearing due from banks and securities purchased under agreements to resell, are being impacted by excess liquidity in the market due to PPP.

Loans represent the Company&#8217;s largest source of interest income. In addition to growing the commercial loan portfolio, management believes its middle market commercial business and its consumer business, including home equity and credit card loan products, are the market niches that represent its best opportunity to cross-sell fee-related services and generate additional noninterest income for the Company.

Actual loan balances totaled $16.0 billion as of September 30, 2020, and increased $2.5 billion, or 18.8%, compared to December 31, 2019, and increased $2.9 billion, or 22.3%, compared to September 30, 2019. Compared to December 31, 2019, commercial and industrial loans increased $1.4 billion, or 24.7%, commercial real estate loans increased $695.5 million, or 13.5%, and consumer real estate loans increased $447.6 million, or 32.1%. Compared to September 30, 2019, commercial and industrial loans increased $1.7 billion, or 31.1%, commercial real estate loans increased $789.7 million, or 15.6%, and consumer real estate loans increased $532.6 million, or 40.7%, partially offset by a decrease of $109.8 million, or 18.1% in specialty lending loans. The increase in commercial and industrial loans as compared to both December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019 is primarily related to the Company&#8217;s participation in the PPP, with PPP loans totaling $1.5 billion as of September 30, 2020. 

Nonaccrual, past due and restructured loans are discussed under &#8220;Credit Risk Management&#8221; within &#8220;Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#8221; in this report.

Investment Securities 

The Company&#8217;s investment portfolio contains trading, AFS, and HTM securities, as well as FRB stock, FHLB stock, and other miscellaneous investments. Investment securities totaled $10.0 billion as of September 30, 2020, and $8.7 billion as of December 31, 2019, and comprised 35.1% of the Company&#8217;s earning assets as of both dates. 

The Company&#8217;s AFS securities portfolio comprised 87.2% of the Company&#8217;s investment securities portfolio at September 30, 2020 and 85.4% at December 31, 2019. The Company&#8217;s AFS securities portfolio provides liquidity as a result of the composition and average life of the underlying securities. This liquidity can be used to fund loan growth or to offset the outflow of traditional funding sources. The average life of the AFS securities portfolio was 70.2 months at September 30, 2020, compared to 70.9 months at December 31, 2019, and 60.8 months at September 30, 2019. In addition to providing a potential source of liquidity, the AFS securities portfolio can be used as a tool to manage interest rate sensitivity. The Company&#8217;s goal in the management of its AFS securities portfolio is to maximize return within the Company&#8217;s parameters of liquidity goals, interest rate risk, and credit risk.

Management expects collateral pledging requirements for public funds, loan demand, and deposit funding to be the primary factors impacting changes in the level of AFS securities. There were $6.9 billion of AFS securities pledged to secure U.S. Government deposits, other public deposits, certain trust deposits, derivative transactions, and repurchase agreements at September 30, 2020. Of this amount, securities with a market value of $393.6 million at September 30, 2020 were pledged at the Federal Reserve Discount Window but were unencumbered as of that date.

The Company&#8217;s HTM securities portfolio consists of private placement bonds, which are issued primarily to refinance existing revenue bonds in the healthcare and education sectors. The HTM portfolio, net of the ACL 

&#160;

totaled $1. 1 billion a t both September 30 , 20 20 and December 31, 201 9 . The average life of the HTM portfolio was 6. 0 years at September 30 , 20 20, 6.3 years at December 31, 201 9 , and 6. 4 years at September 30 , 201 9 . 

The securities portfolio generates the Company&#8217;s second largest component of interest income. The securities portfolio achieved an average yield on a tax-equivalent basis of 2.52% for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020, compared to 2.66% for the same period in 2019.

Deposits and Borrowed Funds

Deposits increased $3.1 billion, or 14.5%, from December 31, 2019 to September 30, 2020 and increased $5.4 billion, or 28.1%, from September 30, 2019 to September 30, 2020. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased $1.8 billion, and total interest-bearing deposits increased $1.3 billion from December 31, 2019 to September 30, 2020. Total interest-bearing deposits increased $3.3 billion, and noninterest-bearing deposits increased $2.1 billion from September 30, 2019 to September 30, 2020. The increase in deposits as compared to prior periods is related to the excess liquidity in the market created by the PPP and customer behavior changes related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Deposits represent the Company&#8217;s primary funding source for its asset base. In addition to the core deposits garnered by the Company&#8217;s retail branch structure, the Company continues to focus on its cash management services, as well as its trust and mutual fund servicing businesses, in order to attract and retain additional deposits. Management believes a strong core deposit composition is one of the Company&#8217;s key strengths given its competitive product mix.

Long-term debt totaled $269.0 million at September 30, 2020, compared to $70.4 million as of December 31, 2019, and $70.1 million as of September 30, 2019. In September 2020, the Company issued $200.0 million in aggregate subordinated notes due in September 2030. The Company received $197.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, and used the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including, among other uses, contributing Tier 1 capital into the Bank. The subordinated notes were issued with a fixed-to-fixed rate of 3.70% and an effective rate of 3.93%, due to issuance costs, with an interest rate reset date of September 2025. The remainder of the Company&#8217;s long-term debt was assumed from the acquisition of Marquette Financial Companies (Marquette) and consists of debt obligations payable to four unconsolidated trusts (Marquette Capital Trust I, Marquette Capital Trust II, Marquette Capital Trust III, and Marquette Capital Trust IV) that previously issued trust preferred securities. These long-term debt obligations have an aggregate contractual balance of $103.1 million. Interest rates on trust preferred securities are tied to the three-month LIBOR rate with spreads ranging from 133 basis points to 160 basis points, and reset quarterly. The trust preferred securities have maturity dates ranging from January 2036 to September 2036.

The Company has a revolving line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. which allows the Company to borrow up to $50.0 million for general working capital purposes. The interest rate applied to borrowed balances will be at the Company&#8217;s option either 1.00% above LIBOR or 1.75% below the prime rate on the date of an advance. The Company pays a 0.3% unused commitment fee for unused portions of the revolving line of credit. As of September 30, 2020, the Company had an outstanding balance of $15.0 million on this revolving line of credit. This borrowing is included in the Short-term debt line on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled $1.9 billion as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, and $1.8 billion at September 30, 2019. Repurchase agreements are transactions involving the exchange of investment funds by the customer for securities by the Company under an agreement to repurchase the same or similar issues at an agreed-upon price and date. The level of borrowings could be impacted by earning asset mix changes in the Company&#8217;s balance sheet from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Capital and Liquidity

The Company places a significant emphasis on the maintenance of a strong capital position, which promotes investor confidence, provides access to funding sources under favorable terms, and enhances the Company&#8217;s ability to capitalize on business growth and acquisition opportunities. Higher levels of liquidity, however, bear 

&#160;

corresponding costs, measured in terms of lower yields on short-term, more liquid earning assets and higher expenses for extended liability maturities. The Company manages capital for each subsidiary based upon the subsidiary&#8217;s respective risks and growth opportunities as well as regulatory requirements. 

Total shareholders&#8217; equity was $2.9 billion at September 30, 2020, a $247.7 million increase compared to December 31, 2019, and a $290.3 million increase compared to September 30, 2019. 

The Company&#8217;s Board of Directors authorized, at its April 28, 2020, April 23, 2019, and April 24, 2018 meetings, the repurchase of up to two million shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock during the twelve months following each meeting (each a Repurchase Authorization). During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company acquired 1,140,399 shares and 65,463 shares, respectively, of its common stock pursuant to the applicable Repurchase Authorization. In March 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with Bank of America (BoA) to repurchase an aggregate of $30.0 million of the Company&#8217;s common stock through an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the ASR). The Company repurchased a total of 653,498 shares under the ASR, which was completed during the second quarter. The ASR was entered into pursuant to the April 23, 2019 Repurchase Authorization and the Company has not made any repurchase of its securities other than pursuant to the Repurchase Authorizations. The Company is not currently engaging in repurchases. In the future, it may determine to resume repurchases.

At the Company&#8217;s quarterly board meeting, the Board of Directors declared a $0.32 per share quarterly cash dividend payable on January 4, 2021, to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 10, 2020.

Through the Company&#8217;s relationship with the FHLB of Des Moines, the Company owns $10.0 million of FHLB stock and has access to additional liquidity and funding sources through FHLB advances. The Company&#8217;s borrowing capacity is dependent upon the amount of collateral the Company places at the FHLB. The Company&#8217;s borrowing capacity with the FHLB was $1.4 billion as of September 30, 2020. The Company had no outstanding FHLB advances at FHLB of Des Moines as of September 30, 2020.

Risk-based capital guidelines established by regulatory agencies set minimum capital standards based on the level of risk associated with a financial institution&#8217;s assets. The Company has implemented the Basel III regulatory capital rules adopted by the FRB. Basel III capital rules include a minimum ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5% and a minimum tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%. A financial institution&#8217;s total capital is also required to equal at least 8% of risk-weighted assets. 

The risk-based capital guidelines indicate the specific risk weightings by type of asset. Certain off-balance sheet items (such as standby letters of credit and binding loan commitments) are multiplied by credit conversion factors to translate them into balance sheet equivalents before assigning them specific risk weightings. The Company is also required to maintain a leverage ratio equal to or greater than 4%. The leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of tier 1 core capital to total average assets, less goodwill and intangibles.

U.S. banking agencies in December 2018 approved a final rule to address the impact of CECL on regulatory capital by allowing banking organizations the option to phase in the day-one impact of CECL until the first quarter of 2023. In March 2020, the U.S. banking agencies issued an interim final rule that provides banking organizations with an alternative option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. The Company is electing this alternative option instead of the one described in the December 2018 rule.

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company&#8217;s main off-balance sheet arrangements are loan commitments, commercial and standby letters of credit, futures contracts and forward exchange contracts, which have maturity dates rather than payment due dates. See Note 10, &#8220;Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed information on these arrangements. The level of the outstanding commitments will be impacted by financial impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to customers and suppliers, allowance for credit losses, bad debts, investments, financing operations, long-lived assets, taxes, other contingencies, and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which have formed the basis for making such judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Under different assumptions or conditions, actual results may differ from the recorded estimates. 

A summary of critical accounting policies is listed in the &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; section of the Form 10-K.
