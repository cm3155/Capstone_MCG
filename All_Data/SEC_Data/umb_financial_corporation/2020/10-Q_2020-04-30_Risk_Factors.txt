 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

The following represents a material change in the Company&#8217;s risk factors from those disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. 

&#160;

The COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting the Company and its customers, counterparties, employees, and third-party service providers, and the continued adverse impacts on its business, financial position, results of operations, and prospects could be significant. 

&#160;

The spread of COVID-19 has created a global public-health crisis that has resulted in widespread volatility and deteriorations in household, business, economic, and market conditions. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company&#8217;s capital, liquidity, and other financial positions and on its business, results of operations, and prospects will depend on a number of evolving factors, including:

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226; 

The duration, extent, and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic . COVID-19 does not yet appear to be contained and could affect significantly more households and businesses. The duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be impossible to accurately predict. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

The response of governmental and nongovernmental authorities . The actions of many governmental and nongovernmental authorities have been directed toward curtailing household and business activity to contain COVID-19 while simultaneously deploying fiscal- and monetary-policy measures to partially mitigate the adverse effects on individual households and businesses. These actions are not always coordinated or consistent across jurisdictions but, in general, have been rapidly expanding in scope and intensity. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

The effect on the Company&#8217;s customers, counterparties, employees, and third-party service providers . COVID-19 and its associated consequences and uncertainties may affect individuals, households, and businesses differently and unevenly. In the near-term if not longer, however, the Company&#8217;s credit, operational, and other risks are generally expected to increase. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

The effect on economies and markets . Whether the actions of governmental and nongovernmental authorities will be successful in mitigating the adverse effects of COVID-19 is unclear. National, regional, and local economies and markets could suffer disruptions that are lasting. An economic slowdown could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s origination of new loans and the performance of its existing loans. In addition, governmental actions are meaningfully influencing the interest-rate environment, which could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. 

&#160;

We are unable to estimate the impact of COVID-19 on the Company&#8217;s business and operations at this time. The COVID-19 pandemic could cause the Company to experience higher credit losses in our lending portfolio, impairment of our goodwill and other financial assets, further reduced demand for its products and services, and other negative impacts on its financial position, results of operations, and prospects. Sustained adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may also prevent the Company from satisfying our minimum regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory requirements, failing to be able to sustain the paying of dividends to its shareholders, or result in downgrades in its credit ratings. 

&#160;

Because of CECL, the Company&#8217;s financial results may be negatively affected as soon as weak or deteriorating economic conditions are forecasted and alter our expectations for credit losses. In addition, due to the expansion of the time horizon over which it is required to estimate future credit losses under CECL, the Company may experience increased volatility in its future provisions for credit losses. As a result, factoring in COVID-19, the 

&#160;

Company incurred significant provision expense for credit losses in the first quarter of 2020 and may incur significant provision expense for credit losses in future periods as well.
