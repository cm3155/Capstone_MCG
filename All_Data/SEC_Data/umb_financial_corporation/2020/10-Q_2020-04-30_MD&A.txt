Overview

&#160;

During the first quarter of 2020, the global economy began experiencing a downturn related to the impacts of the COVID-19 global pandemic. Such impacts have included significant volatility in the global stock markets, a 150-basis-point reduction in the target federal funds rate, the enactment of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, including the Paycheck Protection Program administered by the Small Business Administration, and a variety of rulings from the Company&#8217;s banking regulators. 

&#160;

The Company continues to actively monitor developments related to COVID-19 and its impact to its business, customers, employees, counterparties, vendors, and service providers. During the first quarter of 2020, the most notable financial impacts to the Company&#8217;s results of operations included higher provision expense for credit losses primarily as a result of deterioration in macroeconomic variables such as unemployment, which are incorporated into our economic forecasts utilized to calculate our allowance for credit losses. Additionally, as a result of market conditions, the valuation of our equity securities portfolio has declined. 

&#160;

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has taken a number of actions to offer various forms of support to our customers, employees, and communities that have experienced impacts from this development. Approximately eighty percent of the Company&#8217;s associates are working remotely. Those associates that continue to be required to work in branch or office locations are being paid supplemental hazard pay. The Company has also increased purchases of computer hardware to support a remote workforce, as well as incurred additional cleaning and janitorial expense to disinfect branch and office locations. The Company is also actively working with customers impacted by the economic downturn, offering payment deferrals and other loan modifications. Additionally, as of the date of this filing, the Company has processed over 3,000 applications for more than $1.4 billion in loans under the Paycheck Protection Program administered by the Small Business Administration.

&#160;

In light of volatility in the capital markets and economic disruptions, the Company continues to carefully monitor its capital and liquidity position. In March 2020, the U.S. banking agencies issued an interim final rule that provides banking organizations with an alternative option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL's effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. The Company is electing this alternative option instead of the one described in the December 2018 rule previously issued by banking agencies. The Company continues to anticipate that it will have sufficient capital levels to meet all applicable regulatory capital requirements. 

&#160;

The COVID-19 pandemic and shelter-in-place mandates have also necessitated certain actions related to the way the Company operates its business. As noted above, the Company transitioned most of its workforce off-site or to work-from-home to help mitigate health risks. The Company is also carefully monitoring the activities of its vendors and other third-party service providers to mitigate the risks associated with any potential service disruptions. The length of time it may be required to operate under such circumstances and future degrees of disruption remain uncertain. While the Company has not experienced material adverse disruptions to its internal operations due to the pandemic, it continues to review evolving risks and developments.

&#160;

The Company has detailed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in each applicable section of &#8220;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; included below.

The Company focuses on the following strategic objectives to guide its efforts to achieve its vision, to deliver the unparalleled customer experience, all while seeking to improve net income and strengthen the balance sheet while undertaking prudent risk management.

The first strategic objective is to continuously improve operating efficiencies. The Company has focused on identifying efficiencies that simplify our organizational and reporting structures, streamline back office functions and take advantage of synergies and newer technologies among various platforms and distribution networks. The Company has identified and expects to continue identifying ongoing efficiencies through the normal course of business that, when combined with increased revenue, will contribute to improved operating leverage. During the first quarter of 2020, total revenue remained flat as compared to the first quarter of 2019, while noninterest expense decreased 1.1 percent for the same period. The decrease in noninterest expense is primarily driven by a significant decline in deferred compensation expense but is partially offset by an increase in equipment expense. As part of the initiative to improve operating efficiencies, the Company continues to invest in technological advances that it believes will help management drive operating leverage in the future through improved data analysis and automation. The Company also continues to evaluate core systems and will invest in enhancements that it believes will yield operating efficiencies.

The second strategic objective is to increase net interest income through profitable loan and deposit growth and the optimization of the balance sheet. During the first quarter of 2020, the Company had an increase in net interest income of $10.1 million, or 6.1 percent, from the same period in 2019. The Company has shown increased 

&#160;

net interest income through the effects of increased volume and mix of average earning assets. These changes were offset by the recent interest rate reductions. Average loan balances increased $1.3 billion, or 10.7 percent compared to the same period in 2019. The funding for these assets was driven primarily by a 14.6 percent increase in average interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased 23 basis points compared to the same period in 2019. The Company expects to see continued volatility in the economic markets and government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic . These changing conditions and governmental responses could have impacts on the balance sheet and income statement of the Company for the remainder of the year. 

The third strategic objective is to grow the Company&#8217;s revenue from noninterest sources. The Company seeks to grow noninterest revenues throughout all economic and interest rate cycles, while positioning itself to benefit in periods of economic growth. Noninterest income decreased $9.0 million, or 8.3 percent, to $98.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. This change is primarily due to a significant decrease in the market value of company-owned life insurance and is discussed in greater detail below under Noninterest Income. The Company continues to emphasize its asset management, brokerage, bankcard services, healthcare services, and treasury management businesses. At March 31, 2020, noninterest income represented 36.1 percent of total revenues, compared to 39.6 percent at March 31, 2019. The recent economic changes have impacted fee income, especially those with assets tied to market values.

The fourth strategic objective is effective capital management. The Company places a significant emphasis on maintaining a strong capital position, which management believes promotes investor confidence, provides access to funding sources under favorable terms, and enhances the Company&#8217;s ability to capitalize on business growth and acquisition opportunities. The Company continues to maximize shareholder value through a mix of reinvesting in organic growth, evaluating acquisition opportunities that complement the Company&#8217;s strategies, increasing dividends over time, and appropriately utilizing a share repurchase program. At March 31, 2020, the Company had $2.7 billion in total shareholders&#8217; equity. This is an increase of $312.6 million, or 13.3 percent, compared to total shareholders&#8217; equity at March 31, 2019. At March 31, 2020, the Company had a total risk-based capital ratio of 13.12 percent. The Company repurchased 1.0 million shares of common stock at an average price of $53.79 per share during the first quarter of 2020.

Earnings Summary

The following is a summary regarding the Company&#8217;s earnings for the first quarter of 2020. The changes identified in the summary are explained in greater detail below. The Company recorded a net loss of $3.4 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2020, compared to net income of $57.7 million for the same period a year earlier. This represents a 106.0 decrease over the three-month period ended March 31, 2019. Basic losses per share for the first quarter of 2020 was $0.07 per share ($0.07 per share fully-diluted) compared to earnings of $1.19 per share ($1.18 per share fully-diluted) for the first quarter of 2019. Return on average assets and return on average common shareholders&#8217; equity for the three-month period ended March 31, 2020 were (0.05) and (0.51) percent, respectively, compared to 1.02 and 10.48 percent, respectively, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2019. 

Net interest income for the three-month period ended March 31, 2020 increased $10.1 million, or 6.1 percent, compared to the same period in 2019. For the three-month period ended March 31, 2020, average earning assets increased by $3.0 billion, or 14.1 percent, compared to the same period in 2019. Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased to 2.97 percent for the three-month period ended March 31, 2020, compared to 3.20 percent for the same period in 2019. 

The provision for credit losses increased by $75.7 million to $88.0 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. This change is the result of the adoption of the CECL standard and applying this methodology for computing the allowance for credit losses, coupled with the impacts of the current and forecasted economic downturn related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company&#8217;s nonperforming loans increased $33.8 million to $97.0 million at March 31, 2020, compared to March 31, 2019, and increased $40.7 million, compared to December 31, 2019. The allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of total loans increased to 1.35 percent as of March 31, 2020, compared to 0.83 percent at March 31, 2019. For a description of the Company&#8217;s methodology for computing the allowance for credit losses, please see the summary discussion in the &#8220;Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; section included below.

&#160;

Noninterest income de creased by $ 9.0 million, or 8.3 percent , for the three-month period ended March 31, 20 20 , compared to the same period in 201 9 . These changes are discussed in greater detail below under Noninterest Income. 

Noninterest expense decreased by $2.0 million, or 1.1 percent, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. These changes are discussed in greater detail below under Noninterest Expense.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income is a significant source of the Company&#8217;s earnings and represents the amount by which interest income on earning assets exceeds the interest expense paid on liabilities. The volume of interest-earning assets and the related funding sources, the overall mix of these assets and liabilities, and the rates paid on each affect net interest income. Net interest income for the three-month period ended March 31, 2020 increased $10.1 million, or 6.1 percent, compared to the same period in 2019. 

Table 1 shows the impact of earning asset rate changes compared to changes in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. As illustrated in this table, net interest spread for the three months ended March 31, 2020 decreased nine basis points as compared to the same period in 2019. Net interest margin for the three months ended March 31, 2020 decreased by 23 basis points compared to the same period in 2019. The changes are primarily due to favorable volume variance on loans and securities and favorable rate variances on interest-bearing deposits, offset by unfavorable rate variances on earning assets. These interest rate variances have led to a small increase in interest income and a large decrease in interest expense, resulting in an increase in the Company&#8217;s net interest income during 2020 as compared to results for the same period in 2019. The changes compared to last year have been impacted by the recent short-term interest rate cuts. The Company expects to see continued volatility in the economic markets and government responses to these changes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. It will also be impacted by the Company&#8217;s active participation as a lender in the Paycheck Protection Program administered by the Small Business Administration. This program is one of the centerpieces of the recently passed CARES Act. As of the date of this filing, the Company has processed more than 3,000 applications in excess of $1.4 billion as part of this program. These changing conditions and governmental responses could have impacts on the balance sheet and income statement of the Company the remainder of the year. For the impact of the contribution from free funds, see the Analysis of Net Interest Margin within Table 2 below. Table 2 also illustrates how the changes in volume and interest rates have resulted in an increase in net interest income.

&#160;

Table 1 

AVERAGE BALANCE SHEETS/YIELDS AND RATES (tax-equivalent basis) (unaudited, dollars in thousands) 

The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the average earning assets and resulting yields, as well as the average interest-bearing liabilities and resulting yields, expressed in both dollars and rates. All average balances are daily average balances. The average yield on earning assets without the tax-equivalent basis adjustment would have been 3.47 percent for the three-month period ended March 31, 2020 and 3.99 percent for the same period in 2019.

Table 2 presents the dollar amount of change in net interest income and margin due to volume and rate. Table 2 also reflects the effect that interest-free funds have on net interest margin. The average balance of interest-free funds (total earning assets less interest-bearing liabilities) increased $913.9 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The benefit from interest-free funds decreased by 14 basis points in the three-month period due to decreased yields on earning assets, offset by a decrease in interest rates of interest-bearing liabilities.

Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses

The allowance for credit losses (ACL) represents management&#8217;s judgment of the total expected losses included in the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The Company&#8217;s process for recording the ACL is based on the evaluation of the Company&#8217;s lifetime historical loss experience, management&#8217;s understanding of the credit quality inherent in the loan portfolio, and the impact of the current economic environment, coupled with reasonable and supportable economic forecasts.

&#160;

A mathematical calculation of an estimate is made to assist in determining the adequacy and reasonableness of management&#8217;s recorded ACL. To develop the estimate, the Company follows the guidelines in ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses . The estimate reserves for assets held at amortized cost and any related credit deterioration in the Company&#8217;s available-for-sale debt security portfolio. Assets held at amortized cost include the Company&#8217;s loan book and held-to-maturity security portfolio. 

&#160;

&#160;

The process involves the consideration of quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the specific segmentation of loans. These factors have been established over decades of financial institution experience and include economic observation and loan loss characteristics. This process is designed to produce a lifetime estimate of the losses, at a reporting date, that includes evaluation of historical loss experience, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and the qualitative framework outlined by the O ffice of the Comptroller of the Currency in the published 2006 Interagency Policy Statement. This process allows management to take a holistic view of the recorded ACL reserve and ensure that all significant and pertinent information is considered. 

&#160;

The Company considers a variety of factors to ensure the safety and soundness of its estimate including a strong internal control framework, extensive methodology documentation, credit underwriting standards which encompass the Company&#8217;s desired risk profile, model validation, and ratio analysis. If the Company&#8217;s total ACL estimate, as determined in accordance with the approved ACL methodology, is either outside a reasonable range based on review of economic indicators or by comparison of historical ratio analysis, the ACL estimate is an outlier and management will investigate the underlying reason(s). Based on that investigation, issues or factors that previously had not been considered may be identified in the estimation process, which may warrant adjustments to estimated credit losses. 

The ending result of this process is a recorded consolidated ACL that represents management&#8217;s best estimate of the total expected losses included in the loan portfolio, held-to-maturity securities, and credit deterioration in available-for-sale securities.

Based on the factors above, management of the Company recorded $88.0 million as provision for credit losses for the three-month period ended March 31, 2020, compared to $12.4 million for the same period in 2019. As illustrated in Table 3 below, the ACL on loans increased to 1.35 percent of total loans as of March 31, 2020, compared to 0.83 percent of total loans as of March 31, 2019. 

Table 3 presents a summary of the Company&#8217;s ACL for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, and for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net charge-offs were $7.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, compared to $12.3 million for the same period in 2019. See &#8220;Credit Risk Management&#8221; under &#8220;Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#8221; in this report for information relating to nonaccrual loans, past due loans, restructured loans and other credit risk matters.

Noninterest Income

A key objective of the Company is the growth of noninterest income to provide a diverse source of revenue not directly tied to interest rates. Fee-based services are typically non-credit related and are not generally affected by fluctuations in interest rates.

The Company offers multiple fee-based products and services, which management believes will more closely align with customer demands. The Company is currently emphasizing fee-based products and services including trust and securities processing, bankcard, securities trading and brokerage, and cash and treasury management. 

&#160;

Management believes that it can offer these products and services both efficiently and profitably, as most have common platforms and support structures.

Noninterest income decreased by $9.0 million, or 8.3 percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. Table 4 above summarizes the components of noninterest income and the respective year-over-year comparison for each category.

Trust and securities processing income consists of fees earned on personal and corporate trust accounts, custody of securities services, trust investments and wealth management services, mutual fund assets, and alternative asset servicing. The increase in these fees for the three-month period ended March 31, 2020, compared to the same period last year, was primarily due to an increase in corporate trust and fund services revenues. Corporate trust revenue increased $2.7 million, or 44.5 percent, and fund services revenue increased $1.8 million, or 9.2 percent, compared to the same period in 2019. Wealth management revenue increased $0.5 million, or 2.9 percent, compared to the same period in 2019. The recent volatile markets have impacted the income in this category. Since trust and securities processing fees are primarily asset-based, which are highly correlated to the change in market value of the assets, the related income for the remainder of the year will be affected by changes in the securities markets. Management continues to emphasize sales of services to both new and existing clients as well as increasing and improving the distribution channels.

Trading and investment banking fees for the three-month period ended March 31, 2020 decreased $3.9 million, or 69.1 percent, compared to the same period in 2019. This decrease was driven by a decrease in the market valuations of investments in the Company&#8217;s trading portfolio primarily driven by the market decline in March related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The income in this category is market driven and impacted by general increases or decreases in trading volume.

Service charges on deposit accounts for the three-month period ended March 31, 2020 increased by $3.8 million, or 17.9 percent, compared to the same period in 2019. This increase was primarily driven by income related to healthcare customer transfer and conversion fees recorded in the first quarter. Service charge income could be impacted by various programs related to the recent COVID-19 pandemic.

Brokerage fees for the three-month period ended March 31, 2020, increased $2.6 million, or 36.1 percent, compared to the same period in 2019. These increases were driven by higher money market balances and the related 12b-1 fees. The recent reduction in short-term interest rates will impact the income in this category the remainder of the year.

Other noninterest income for the three-month period ended March 31, 2020, decreased $16.4 million, or 125.0 percent, compared to the same period in 2019. These decreases were primarily driven by decreases in company-

&#160;

owned life insurance and derivative income, and partially offset by a n in crease in equity earnings on alternative investments and gains on sale of other assets .

Noninterest expense decreased by $2.0 million, or 1.1 percent, for the three months ended March 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. Table 5 above summarizes the components of noninterest expense and the respective year-over-year comparison for each category. 

Salaries and employee benefits decreased by $5.0 million, or 4.3 percent, for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Employee benefits expense decreased $15.5 million, or 56.6 percent, for the three months ended March 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019 driven by lower deferred compensation expense. Salaries and wages increased $6.1 million, or 9.0 percent, and bonus and commission expense increased $4.5 million, or 21.2 percent, for the three months ended March 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. 

Equipment expense increased $1.6 million, or 7.9 percent, for the three months ended March 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to higher equipment maintenance and software costs.

Processing fees expense increased $1.3 million, or 10.4 percent, for the three months ended March 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to system investments to support growth across the Company&#8217;s business lines.

Legal and consulting expense increased $477 thousand, or 8.5 percent, for the three months ended March 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to the timing of multiple projects. 

Other noninterest expense decreased $1.2 million, or 14.9 percent, for the three months ended March 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease is primarily due to decreased operating losses and lower derivative expense.

Income Tax Expense

&#160;

The Company recognized an income tax benefit of $0.8 million, or 19.2 percent, on a pre-tax loss of $4.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to income tax expense of $10.5 million, or 15.4 percent, on pre-tax income of $68.3 million for the same period in 2019. The amount of tax benefit recorded for the 

&#160;

three months ended March 31, 2020 reflects management&#8217;s estimate of the annual effective tax rate applied to the year-to-date loss from continuing operations adjusted for the tax impact of items discrete to the quarter. The Company&#8217;s pre-tax loss for the three months ended March 31, 2020 is expected to be offset by income in 2020. As such, management has determined it is more-likely-than-not that realization of tax benefits recorded in our financial statements will occur within the calendar year. 

Strategic Lines of Business

&#160;

The Company has strategically aligned its operations into the following three reportable Business Segments: Commercial Banking, Institutional Banking, and Personal Banking. The Company&#8217;s senior executive officers regularly evaluate Business Segment financial results produced by the Company&#8217;s internal reporting system in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance for individual Business Segments. Prior to 2020, the Company had the following four Business Segments: Commercial Banking, Institutional Banking, Personal Banking, and Healthcare Services. In the first quarter of 2020, the Company merged the Healthcare Services segment into the Institutional Banking segment to better reflect how the Company&#8217;s core businesses, products and services are currently being evaluated by management. For comparability purposes, amounts in all periods are based on methodologies in effect at March 31, 2020. Previously reported results have been reclassified in this Form 10-Q to conform to the Company&#8217;s current organizational structure.

For the three months ended March 31, 2020, Commercial Banking recognized a net loss of $18.7 million, which represents a decrease of $57.4 million, as compared to the same period in 2019. Net interest income increased $7.1 million, or 7.1 percent, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, primarily driven by strong loan growth and earning asset mix changes. Provision for credit losses increased by $71.9 million due to adoption of CECL, coupled with the current economic environment and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are key elements of these forecasts. Noninterest income decreased $11.9 million, or 51.5 percent, over the same period in 2019 primarily due to a decrease of $10.8 million in other noninterest income driven by decreased company-owned life insurance income and derivative income. Noninterest expense decreased $7.8 million, or 11.6 percent, to $59.0 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. This decrease was driven by a $9.4 million decrease in technology, service, and overhead expenses. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $1.3 million in salary and employee benefits expense.

For the three months ended March 31, 2020, Institutional Banking net income increased $2.7 million, or 14.5 percent, compared to the same period last year. Net interest income increased $1.3 million, or 4.0 percent, compared to the same period last year, due to an increase in deposits and related increase in funds transfer pricing. Noninterest income increased $6.1 million, primarily due to increases of $4.6 million in trust and securities processing revenue, $4.5 million in service charges on deposit accounts, and $2.2 million in brokerage revenue. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $5.4 million in other noninterest income driven by lower company-owned life insurance income. Noninterest expense increased $3.1 million, or 4.7 percent, primarily driven by an increase of $4.9 million in salary and employee benefits expense, partially offset by a decrease of $1.1 million in operational losses as compared to the same period in 2019.

For the three months ended March 31, 2020, Personal Banking recognized a net loss of $6.0 million, which represents a decrease of $6.4 million as compared to the same period last year. Net interest income increased $1.7 million, or 5.1 percent, compared to the same period last year due to increased loan balances. Provision for credit losses increased $3.8 million due to adoption of CECL, coupled with the current economic environment and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are key elements of these forecasts. Non interest income decreased $3.1 million, or 11.0 percent, for the same period. This decrease is primarily driven by a decrease of $5.6 million in other noninterest income due to lower company-owned life insurance income, partially offset by an increase of $1.9 million in equity earnings on alternative investments. Noninterest expense increased $2.7 million, or 4.6 percent, primarily due to an increase of $2.3 million in salary and employee benefits expense.

&#160;

Loans represent the Company&#8217;s largest source of interest income. In addition to growing the commercial loan portfolio, management believes its middle market commercial business and its consumer business, including home equity and credit card loan products, are the market niches that represent its best opportunity to cross-sell fee-related services and generate additional noninterest income for the Company.

Actual loan balances totaled $14.0 billion as of March 31, 2020, and increased $519.8 million, or 3.9 percent, compared to December 31, 2019, and increased $1.4 billion, or 11.2 percent, compared to March 31, 2019. Compared to December 31, 2019, commercial and industrial loans increased $290.9 million, or 5.1 percent, commercial real estate loans increased $140.4 million, or 2.7 percent, and consumer real estate loans increased $50.7 million, or 3.6 percent. Compared to March 31, 2019, commercial and industrial loans increased $688.0 million, or 13.1 percent, commercial real estate loans increased $619.2 million, or 13.3 percent, and consumer real estate loans increased $221.0 million, or 18.1 percent. The increase in total loans is driven by the Company&#8217;s focus on optimizing the balance sheet, coupled with recent loan demand related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The size of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio will be impacted by the continued volatility in the markets related to the COVID-19 pandemic. It will also be impacted by the Company&#8217;s active participation as a lender in the Paycheck Protection Program administered by the Small Business Administration. This program is one of the centerpieces of the recently passed CARES Act. As of the date of this filing, the Company has processed more than 3,000 applications in excess of $1.4 billion as part of this program. 

Nonaccrual, past due and restructured loans are discussed under &#8220;Credit Risk Management&#8221; within &#8220;Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#8221; in this report.

Investment Securities 

The Company&#8217;s investment portfolio contains trading, AFS, and HTM securities, as well as FRB stock, FHLB stock, and other miscellaneous investments. Investment securities totaled $8.9 billion as of March 31, 2020, and $8.7 billion as of December 31, 2019, and comprised 36.4 percent and 35.1 percent of the Company&#8217;s earning assets, respectively, as of those dates. 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s AFS securities portfolio comprised 8 5.4 percent of the Company&#8217;s investment securities portfolio at both March 31, 20 20 and December 31, 201 9 . The Company&#8217;s AFS securities portfolio provides liquidity as a result of the composition and average life of the underlying securities. This liquidity can be used to fund loan growth or to offset the outflow of traditional funding sources. The average life of the AFS securities portfolio was 60.6 months at March 31, 20 20 , compared to 70.9 months at December 31, 201 9 , and 57.7 months at March 31, 201 9 . In addition to providing a potential source of liquidity, the AFS securities portfolio can be used as a tool to manage interest rate sensitivity. The Company&#8217;s goal in the management of its AFS securities portfolio is to maximize return within the Company&#8217;s parameters of liquidity goals, interest rate risk, and credit risk. 

Management expects collateral pledging requirements for public funds, loan demand, and deposit funding to be the primary factors impacting changes in the level of AFS securities. There were $6.0 billion of AFS securities pledged to secure U.S. Government deposits, other public deposits, certain trust deposits, derivative transactions, and repurchase agreements at March 31, 2020. Of this amount, securities with a market value of $979.2 million at March 31, 2020 were pledged at the Federal Reserve Discount Window but were unencumbered as of that date.

The Company&#8217;s HTM securities portfolio consists of private placement bonds, which are issued primarily to refinance existing revenue bonds in the healthcare and education sectors. The HTM portfolio, net of the ACL totaled $1.1 billion as of March 31, 2020, a decrease of $5.2 million, or 0.5 percent, from December 31, 2019. The average life of the HTM portfolio was 6.2 years at March 31, 2020, 6.3 years at December 31, 2019, and 6.9 years at March 31, 2019.

The securities portfolio generates the Company&#8217;s second largest component of interest income. The securities portfolio achieved an average yield on a tax-equivalent basis of 2.67 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2020, compared to 2.64 percent for the same period in 2019.

Deposits and Borrowed Funds

Deposits decreased $427.7 million, or 2.0 percent, from December 31, 2019 to March 31, 2020 and increased $1.8 billion, or 9.3 percent, from March 31, 2019 to March 31, 2020. Total interest-bearing deposits decreased $752.8 million, and non-interest bearing deposits increased $325.1 million from December 31, 2019 to March 31, 2020. Total interest-bearing deposits increased $989.2 million and noninterest-bearing deposits increased $821.1 million from March 31, 2019 to March 31, 2020.

Deposits represent the Company&#8217;s primary funding source for its asset base. In addition to the core deposits garnered by the Company&#8217;s retail branch structure, the Company continues to focus on its cash management services, as well as its trust and mutual fund servicing businesses, in order to attract and retain additional deposits. Management believes a strong core deposit composition is one of the Company&#8217;s key strengths given its competitive product mix.

Long-term debt totaled $121.6 million at March 31, 2020, compared to $97.5 million as of December 31, 2019, and $81.6 million as of March 31, 2019. The majority of the Company&#8217;s long-term debt was assumed from the acquisition of Marquette Financial Companies (Marquette) and consists of debt obligations payable to four unconsolidated trusts (Marquette Capital Trust I, Marquette Capital Trust II, Marquette Capital Trust III, and Marquette Capital Trust IV) that previously issued trust preferred securities. These long-term debt obligations had an aggregate contractual balance of $103.1 million and had an aggregate carrying value of $70.7 million as of March 31, 2020. Interest rates on trust preferred securities are tied to the three-month LIBOR rate with spreads ranging from 133 basis points to 160 basis points, and reset quarterly. The trust preferred securities have maturity dates ranging from January 2036 to September 2036.

The Company has $50.9 million in contractual equity contribution commitments to various low-income housing investment projects. These low-income housing investment projects require the Company to invest in an underlying fund that is recorded in Other securities on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company receives tax credits over the life of the low-income housing investment projects. These commitments are included in the Long-term debt line on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

&#160;

The Company has a revolving line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. which allows the Company to borrow up to $50.0 million for general working capital purposes. The interest rate applied to borrowed balances will be at the Company&#8217;s option either 1.00 percent above LIBOR or 1.75 percent below the prime rate on the date of an advance. The Company pays a 0.3 percent unused commitment fee for unused portions of the revolving line of credit. As of March 31, 2020, the Company had an outstanding balance of $15.0 million on this revolving line of credit. This borrowing is included in the Short-term debt line on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled $1.9 billion at both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, and $1.5 billion at March 31, 2019. Repurchase agreements are transactions involving the exchange of investment funds by the customer for securities by the Company under an agreement to repurchase the same or similar issues at an agreed-upon price and date. The level of borrowings could be impacted by mix changes in the Company&#8217;s balance sheet from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Capital and Liquidity

The Company places a significant emphasis on the maintenance of a strong capital position, which promotes investor confidence, provides access to funding sources under favorable terms, and enhances the Company&#8217;s ability to capitalize on business growth and acquisition opportunities. Higher levels of liquidity, however, bear corresponding costs, measured in terms of lower yields on short-term, more liquid earning assets and higher expenses for extended liability maturities. The Company manages capital for each subsidiary based upon the subsidiary&#8217;s respective risks and growth opportunities as well as regulatory requirements.

Total shareholders&#8217; equity was $2.7 billion at March 31, 2020, a $57.0 million increase compared to December 31, 2019, and a $312.6 million increase compared to March 31, 2019. 

The Company&#8217;s Board of Directors authorized, at its April 28, 2020, April 23, 2019, and April 24, 2018 meetings, the repurchase of up to two million shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock during the twelve months following each meeting (each a Repurchase Authorization). During the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company acquired 1,020,365 shares and 61,765 shares of its common stock pursuant to the applicable Repurchase Authorization. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with Bank of America (BoA) to repurchase an aggregate of $30.0 million of the Company&#8217;s common stock through an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the ASR). Under the ASR, the Company repurchased a total of 537,182 shares. The final settlement of the transactions under the ASR is expected to occur during the second quarter of 2020. The ASR was entered into pursuant to the April 23, 2019 Repurchase Authorization and the Company has not made any repurchase of its securities other than pursuant to the Repurchase Authorizations. The Company is not currently engaging in repurchases, other than in connection with the settlement of the ASR. In the future, it may determine to resume repurchases.

At the Company&#8217;s quarterly board meeting, the Board of Directors declared a $0.31 per share quarterly cash dividend payable on July 1, 2020, to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 10, 2020.

Through the Company&#8217;s relationship with the FHLB of Des Moines, the Company owns $10.0 million of FHLB stock and has access to additional liquidity and funding sources through FHLB advances. The Company&#8217;s borrowing capacity is dependent upon the amount of collateral the Company places at the FHLB. The Company&#8217;s borrowing capacity with the FHLB was $1.3 billion as of March 31, 2020. The Company had no outstanding FHLB advances at FHLB of Des Moines as of March 31, 2020.

Risk-based capital guidelines established by regulatory agencies set minimum capital standards based on the level of risk associated with a financial institution&#8217;s assets. The Company has implemented the Basel III regulatory capital rules adopted by the FRB. Basel III capital rules include a minimum ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5 percent and a minimum tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6 percent. A financial institution&#8217;s total capital is also required to equal at least 8 percent of risk-weighted assets. 

&#160;

The risk-based capital guidelines indicate the specific risk weightings by type of asset. Certain off-balance sheet items (such as standby letters of credit and binding loan commitments) are multiplied by credit conversion factors to translate them into balance sheet equivalents before assigning them specific risk weightings. The Company is also required to maintain a leverage ratio equal to or greater than 4 percent. The leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of tier 1 core capital to total average assets, less goodwill and intangibles. 

&#160;

U.S. banking agencies in December 2018 approved a final rule to address the impact of CECL on regulatory capital by allowing banking organizations the option to phase in the day-one impact of CECL until the first quarter of 2023. In March 2020, the U.S. banking agencies issued an interim final rule that provides banking organizations with an alternative option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. The Company is electing this alternative option instead of the one described in the December 2018 rule.

The Company's capital position as of March 31, 2020 is summarized in the table below and exceeded regulatory requirements.

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company&#8217;s main off-balance sheet arrangements are loan commitments, commercial and standby letters of credit, futures contracts and forward exchange contracts, which have maturity dates rather than payment due dates. See Note 10, &#8220;Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed information on these arrangements. The level of the outstanding commitments will be impacted by financial impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related 

&#160;

to customers and suppliers, allowance for credit losses, bad debts, investments, financing operations, long-lived assets, taxes, other contingencies , and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which have formed the basis for making such judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Under different assumptions or conditions, actual results may differ from the recorded estimates. 

A summary of critical accounting policies is listed in the &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; section of the Form 10-K.
