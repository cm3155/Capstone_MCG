Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Overview
Earnings Summary U.S. Bancorp and its subsidiaries (the “Company”)
reported net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp of $1.3 billion for the first
quarter of 2024, or $0.78 per diluted common share, compared with $1.7 billion,
or $1.04 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2023. Return on
average assets and return on average common equity were 0.81 percent and
10.0 percent, respectively, for the first quarter of 2024, compared with 1.03
percent and 14.1 percent, respectively, for the first quarter of 2023. The results
for the first quarter of 2024 included the impact of $265 million ($199 million netof-tax) of notable items, including $155 million of merger and integration charges
associated with the acquisition of MUFG Union Bank, N.A. (“MUB”) and a $110
million charge for the anticipated increase in the FDIC special assessment to
recover losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund related to certain 2023 bank
failures. Combined, these items decreased diluted earnings per common share
by $0.12. The results for the first quarter of 2023 included the impact of $244
million ($183 million net-of-tax) of merger and integration charges, which
decreased diluted earnings per common share by $0.12.
Total net revenue for the first quarter of 2024 was $460 million (6.4 percent)
lower than the first quarter of 2023, reflecting a 14.0 percent decrease in net
interest income and a 7.7 percent increase in noninterest income. The decrease
in net interest income from the first quarter of 2023 was primarily due to the
impact of higher interest rates on deposit mix and pricing, partially offset by
higher rates on earning assets. The increase in noninterest income was driven
by higher fee revenue across most categories.
Noninterest expense in the first quarter of 2024 was $96 million (2.1 percent)
lower than the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to prudent expense
management, continued focus on operational efficiency, and synergies from the
MUB acquisition, partially offset by the impact of the FDIC special assessment
charge and higher compensation and employee benefits expense to support
business growth.
The provision for credit losses for the first quarter of 2024 of $553 million
was $126 million (29.5 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2023, driven by
normalization in the credit environment, partially offset by relative stability in the
economic outlook. Net charge-offs in the first quarter of 2024 were $488 million,
compared with $373 million in the first quarter of 2023. Refer to “Corporate Risk
Profile” for further information on the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs,
nonperforming assets and other factors considered by the Company in
assessing the credit quality of the loan portfolio and establishing the allowance
for credit losses.
Statement of Income Analysis
Net Interest Income Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, was
$4.0 billion in the first quarter of 2024, representing a decrease of $653 million
(14.0 percent) compared with the first quarter of 2023. The decrease was
primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on deposit
mix and pricing, partially offset by higher rates on earning assets. Average
earning assets for the first quarter of 2024 were $11.5 billion (1.9 percent) lower
than the first quarter of 2023, reflecting decreases in loans and investment
securities, partially offset by an increase in interest-bearing deposits with banks.
The net interest margin, on a taxable-equivalent basis, in the first quarter of
2024 was 2.70 percent, compared with 3.10 percent in the first quarter of 2023.
The decrease in net interest margin from the first quarter of 2023 was primarily
due to the impact of deposit mix and pricing. Refer to the “Consolidated Daily
Average Balance Sheet and Related Yields and Rates” table for further
information on net interest income.
Average total loans in the first quarter of 2024 were $15.7 billion (4.1
percent) lower than the first quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to
lower other retail loans, commercial loans and commercial real estate loans,
partially offset by higher credit card loans. Average other retail loans decreased
$9.9 billion (18.5 percent), driven by lower auto loans primarily due to balance
sheet repositioning and capital management actions taken in the second quarter
of 2023. Average commercial loans decreased $4.9 billion (3.6 percent)
primarily due to decreased demand as corporate customers accessed the
capital markets. Average commercial real estate loans decreased $2.6 billion
(4.6 percent) primarily due to payoffs exceeding a reduced level of new
originations. Average credit cards loans increased $2.4 billion (9.3 percent)
primarily driven by higher spend volume and lower payment rates.
Average investment securities in the first quarter of 2024 were $4.9 billion
(2.9 percent) lower than the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to balance sheet
repositioning and liquidity management.
Average total deposits for the first quarter of 2024 were $7.3 billion (1.4
percent) lower than the first quarter of 2023. Average noninterest-bearing
deposits for the first quarter of 2024 were $45.0 billion (34.6 percent) lower than
the first quarter of 2023, driven by decreases in Wealth, Corporate, Commercial
and Institutional Banking, and Consumer and Business Banking balances.
Average time deposits for the first quarter of 2024 were $19.7 billion (55.5
percent) higher than the first quarter of 2023, mainly due to increases in
Consumer and Business Banking balances, partially offset by decreases in
Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking balances. Changes in
time deposits are primarily related to those deposits managed as an alternative
to other funding sources, based largely on relative pricing and liquidity
characteristics. Average total savings deposits for the first quarter of 2024 were
$18.0 billion (5.2 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2023, driven by
increases in Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking, and
Consumer and Business Banking balances.
Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses was $553 million in
the first quarter of 2024, compared with $427 million in the first quarter of 2023.
The $126 million (29.5
4 U.S. Bancorp
percent) increase was driven by normalization in the credit environment, partially
offset by relative stability in the economic outlook. Net charge-offs increased
$115 million (30.8 percent) in the first quarter of 2024, compared with the first
quarter of 2023, reflecting higher charge-offs in most loan categories consistent
with normalizing credit conditions, partially offset by the impact of charge-offs in
the first quarter of 2023 related to the uncollectible amount of acquired loans
associated with the acquisition of MUB. Refer to “Corporate Risk Profile” for
further information on the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs,
nonperforming assets and other factors considered by the Company in
assessing the credit quality of the loan portfolio and establishing the allowance
for credit losses.
Noninterest Income Noninterest income was $2.7 billion in the first quarter of
2024, representing an increase of $193
million (7.7 percent) compared with the first quarter of 2023. The increase from
the prior year reflected higher commercial products revenue, trust and
investment management fees, payment services revenue and mortgage banking
revenue. Commercial products revenue increased $54 million (16.2 percent)
primarily due to higher corporate bond fees. Trust and investment management
fees increased $51 million (8.6 percent), driven by business growth and
favorable market conditions. Payment services revenue increased $41 million
(4.4 percent) primarily due to higher card revenue driven by higher spend
volume and favorable rates, along with higher merchant processing services
revenue due to higher spend volume. Mortgage banking revenue increased $38
million (29.7 percent) primarily driven by higher gain on sale margins.

Noninterest Expense Noninterest expense was $4.5 billion in the first quarter
of 2024, representing a decrease of $96 million (2.1 percent) from the first
quarter of 2023. The decrease from the prior year reflected prudent expense
management, continued focus on operational efficiency, synergies from the
MUB acquisition and lower merger and integration charges, partially offset by
the impact of the FDIC special assessment and higher compensation and
employee benefits expense. Net occupancy and equipment expense decreased
$25 million (7.8 percent) and professional services expense decreased $24
million (17.9 percent), primarily due to continued focus on prudent expense
management and operational efficiency. Compensation and employee benefits
expense increased $45 million (1.7 percent) primarily due to merit increases,
higher performance-based incentives and higher employee benefits.
Income Tax Expense The provision for income taxes was $347 million (an
effective rate of 20.7 percent) for the first quarter of 2024, compared with $455
million (an effective rate of 21.1 percent) for the first quarter of 2023. For further
information on income taxes, refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Balance Sheet Analysis
Loans The Company’s loan portfolio was $374.6 billion at March 31, 2024,
compared with $373.8 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of $753 million
(0.2 percent). The increase was driven by higher commercial loans and
residential mortgages, partially offset by lower other retail loans, commercial real
estate loans and credit card loans.
Commercial loans increased $2.8 billion (2.2 percent) at March 31, 2024,
compared with December 31, 2023, primarily due to growth in corporate
banking.
Residential mortgages held in the loan portfolio increased $549 million (0.5
percent) at March 31, 2024, compared with December 31, 2023, driven by
originations. Residential mortgages originated and placed in the Company’s
loan portfolio include jumbo mortgages and branch-originated first lien home
equity loans to borrowers with high credit quality.
Other retail loans decreased $1.1 billion (2.6 percent) at March 31, 2024,
compared with December 31, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in auto loans.
Commercial real estate loans decreased $778 million (1.5 percent) at
March 31, 2024, compared with December 31, 2023, primarily due to payoffs
exceeding a reduced level of new originations.
Credit card loans decreased $716 million (2.5 percent) at March 31, 2024,
compared with December 31, 2023, primarily the result of customers seasonally
paying down balances.
The Company generally retains portfolio loans through maturity; however,
the Company’s intent may change over
time based upon various factors such as ongoing asset/liability management
activities, assessment of product profitability, credit risk, liquidity needs, and
capital implications. If the Company’s intent or ability to hold an existing portfolio
loan changes, it is transferred to loans held for sale.
Loans Held for Sale Loans held for sale, consisting primarily of residential
mortgages to be sold in the secondary market, were $2.1 billion at March 31,
2024, compared with $2.2 billion at December 31, 2023. The decrease in loans
held for sale was principally due to a lower level of mortgage loan closings in the
first quarter of 2024, compared with the fourth quarter of 2023. Almost all of the
residential mortgage loans the Company originates or purchases for sale follow
guidelines that allow the loans to be sold into existing, highly liquid secondary
markets, in particular in government agency transactions and to governmentsponsored enterprises (“GSEs”).
Investment Securities Investment securities totaled $155.4 billion at March 31,
2024, compared with $153.8 billion at December 31, 2023. The $1.6 billion (1.1
percent) increase was primarily due to $2.1 billion of net investment purchases,
partially offset by a $173 million unfavorable change in net unrealized gains
(losses) on available-for-sale investment securities.
The Company’s available-for-sale investment securities are carried at fair
value with changes in fair value reflected in other comprehensive income (loss)
unless a portion of a security’s unrealized loss is related to credit and an
allowance for credit losses is necessary. At March 31, 2024, the Company’s net
unrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities were $7.1 billion
($5.3 billion net-of-tax), compared with $6.9 billion ($5.2 billion net-of-tax) at
December 31, 2023. The unfavorable change in net unrealized gains (losses)
was primarily due to decreases in the fair value of mortgage-backed and state
and political subdivisions securities as a result of changes in interest rates.
Gross unrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities totaled $7.2
billion at March 31, 2024, compared with $7.1 billion at December 31, 2023.
When evaluating credit losses, the Company considers various factors such as
the nature of the investment security, the credit ratings or financial condition of
the issuer, the extent of the unrealized loss, expected cash flows of the
underlying collateral, the existence of any government or agency guarantees,
and market conditions. At March 31, 2024, the Company had no plans to sell
securities with unrealized losses, and believed it is more likely than not that it
would not be required to sell such securities before recovery of their amortized
cost.

Deposits Total deposits were $528.1 billion at March 31, 2024, compared with
$512.3 billion at December 31, 2023. The $15.8 billion (3.1 percent) increase in
total deposits reflected increases in total savings deposits, time deposits and
noninterest-bearing deposits. Money market deposit balances increased
$11.6 billion (5.8 percent), primarily due to higher Consumer and Business
Banking, and Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking
balances. Interest checking balances increased $1.7 billion (1.3 percent),
primarily due to higher Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking
balances. Savings account balances decreased $2.5 billion (5.9 percent), driven
by lower Consumer and Business Banking balances. Time deposits increased
$3.8 billion (7.3 percent) at March 31, 2024, compared with December 31, 2023,
driven by higher Consumer and Business Banking balances. Changes in time
deposits are primarily related to those deposits managed as an alternative to
other funding sources, based largely on relative pricing and liquidity
characteristics. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased $1.2 billion (1.4 percent)
at March 31, 2024, compared with December 31, 2023, primarily due to the
impacts of seasonally higher trust and corporate deposit inflows and delays in
planned institutional deposit outflows at the end of the first quarter of 2024,
resulting in temporarily higher balances.
Borrowings The Company utilizes both short-term and long-term borrowings as
part of its asset/liability management and funding strategies. Short-term
borrowings, which include federal funds purchased, commercial paper,
repurchase agreements, borrowings secured by high-grade assets and other
short-term borrowings, were $17.1 billion at March 31,
2024, compared with $15.3 billion at December 31, 2023. The $1.8 billion (11.9
percent) increase in short-term borrowings was primarily due to an increase in
repurchase agreement balances. Long-term debt was $52.7 billion at March 31,
2024, compared with $51.5 billion at December 31, 2023. The $1.2 billion (2.4
percent) increase was primarily due to $3.5 billion of medium-term note
issuances, partially offset by $2.1 billion of medium-term note repayments. Refer
to the “Liquidity Risk Management” section for discussion of liquidity
management of the Company.
Corporate Risk Profile
Overview Managing risks is an essential part of successfully operating a
financial services company. The Company’s Board of Directors has approved a
risk management framework which establishes governance and risk
management requirements for all risk-taking activities. This framework includes
Company and business line risk appetite statements which set boundaries for
the types and amount of risk that may be undertaken in pursuing business
objectives and initiatives. The Board of Directors, primarily through its Risk
Management Committee, oversees performance relative to the risk
management framework, risk appetite statements, and other policy
requirements.
The Executive Risk Committee (“ERC”), which is chaired by the Chief Risk
Officer and includes the Chief Executive Officer and other members of the
executive management team, oversees execution against the risk management
framework and risk appetite statements. The ERC focuses on current and
emerging risks, including strategic and

(b)(c)
(d)
U.S. Bancorp 7
reputation risks, by directing timely and comprehensive actions. Senior
operating committees have also been established, each responsible for
overseeing a specified category of risk.
The Company’s most prominent risk exposures are credit, interest rate,
market, liquidity, operational, compliance, strategic, and reputation. Credit risk is
the risk of loss associated with a change in the credit profile or the failure of a
borrower or counterparty to meet its contractual obligations. Interest rate risk is
the current or prospective risk to earnings and capital, or market valuations,
arising from the impact of changes in interest rates. Market risk arises from
fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and security prices that
may result in changes in the values of financial instruments, such as trading and
available-for-sale investment securities, mortgage loans held for sale
(“MLHFS”), mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) and derivatives that are
accounted for on a fair value basis. Liquidity risk is the risk that financial
condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by the
Company’s inability, or perceived inability, to meet its cash flow obligations in a
timely and complete manner in either normal or stressed conditions. Operational
risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising
from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, people (including
human errors or misconduct), or adverse external events, including the risk of
loss resulting from breaches in data security. Operational risk can also include
the risk of loss due to failures by third parties with which the Company does
business. Compliance risk is the risk that the Company may suffer legal or
regulatory sanctions, financial losses, and reputational damage if it fails to
adhere to compliance requirements and the Company’s compliance policies.
Strategic risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience
arising from adverse business decisions, poor implementation of business
decisions, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the banking industry and
operating environment. Reputation risk is the risk to current or anticipated
earnings, capital, or franchise or enterprise value arising from negative public
opinion. This risk may impair the Company’s competitiveness by affecting its
ability to establish new relationships or services, or continue serving existing
relationships. In addition to the risks identified above, other risk factors exist that
may impact the Company. Refer to “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for a detailed
discussion of these factors.
The Company’s Board and management-level governance committees are
supported by a “three lines of defense” model for establishing effective checks
and balances. The first line of defense, the business lines, manages risks in
conformity with established limits and policy requirements. In turn, business line
leaders and their risk officers establish programs to ensure conformity with
these limits and policy requirements. The second line of defense, which includes
the Chief Risk Officer’s organization as well as policy and oversight activities of
corporate support functions, translates risk appetite and strategy into actionable
risk limits and policies. The second line of defense monitors first line of defense
conformity with limits and policies and
provides reporting and escalation of emerging risks and other concerns to senior
management and the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors.
The third line of defense, internal audit, is responsible for providing the Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors and senior management with independent
assessment and assurance regarding the effectiveness of the Company’s
governance, risk management and control processes.
Management regularly provides reports to the Risk Management Committee
of the Board of Directors. The Risk Management Committee discusses with
management the Company’s risk management performance and provides a
summary of key risks to the entire Board of Directors, covering the status of
existing matters, areas of potential future concern and specific information on
certain types of loss events. The Risk Management Committee considers
quarterly reports by management assessing the Company’s performance
relative to the risk appetite statements and the associated risk limits, including:
• Macroeconomic environment and other qualitative considerations, such as
regulatory and compliance changes, litigation developments, geopolitical
events, and technology and cybersecurity;
• Credit measures, including adversely rated and nonperforming loans,
leveraged transactions, credit concentrations and lending limits;
• Interest rate and market risk, including market value and net income
simulation, and trading-related Value at Risk (“VaR”);
• Liquidity risk, including funding projections under various stressed scenarios;
• Operational and compliance risk, including losses stemming from events such
as fraud, processing errors, control breaches, breaches in data security or
adverse business decisions, as well as reporting on technology performance,
and various legal and regulatory compliance measures;
• Capital ratios and projections, including regulatory measures and stressed
scenarios; and
• Strategic and reputation risk considerations, impacts and responses.
Credit Risk Management The Company’s strategy for credit risk management
includes well-defined, centralized credit policies, uniform underwriting criteria,
and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all commercial and
consumer credit exposures. The strategy also emphasizes diversification on a
geographic, industry and customer level, regular credit examinations and
management reviews of loans exhibiting deterioration of credit quality. In
evaluating its credit risk, the Company considers changes, if any, in underwriting
activities, the loan portfolio composition (including product mix and geographic,
industry or customer-specific factors), collateral values, trends in loan
performance and macroeconomic factors, such as changes in unemployment
rates, gross domestic product levels, inflation, interest rates and consumer
bankruptcy filings. The Risk Management Committee oversees the Company’s
credit risk management process.
8 U.S. Bancorp
In addition, credit quality ratings, as defined by the Company, are an
important part of the Company’s overall credit risk management and evaluation
of its allowance for credit losses. Loans with a pass rating represent those loans
not classified on the Company’s rating scale for problem credits, as minimal
credit risk has been identified. Loans with a special mention or classified rating,
including consumer lending and small business loans that are 90 days or more
past due and still accruing, nonaccrual loans and loans in a junior lien position
that are current but are behind a first lien position on nonaccrual, encompass all
loans held by the Company that it considers to have a potential or well-defined
weakness that may put full collection of contractual cash flows at risk. The
Company’s internal credit quality ratings for consumer loans are primarily based
on delinquency and nonperforming status. Refer to Note 4 in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s loan
portfolios including internal credit quality ratings. In addition, refer to
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Credit Risk Management” in the
Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2023, for a more detailed discussion on credit risk management processes.
The Company manages its credit risk, in part, through diversification of its
loan portfolio which is achieved through limit setting by product type criteria,
such as industry, and identification of credit concentrations. The Company
categorizes its loan portfolio into two segments, which is the level at which it
develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine the allowance
for credit losses. The Company’s two loan portfolio segments are commercial
lending and consumer lending.
The commercial lending segment includes loans and leases made to small
business, middle market, large corporate, commercial real estate, financial
institution, non-profit and public sector customers. Key risk characteristics
relevant to commercial lending segment loans include the industry and
geography of the borrower’s business, purpose of the loan, repayment source,
borrower’s debt capacity and financial flexibility, loan covenants, and nature of
pledged collateral, if any, as well as macroeconomic factors such as
unemployment rates, gross domestic product levels, corporate bond spreads
and long-term interest rates. These risk characteristics, among others, are
considered in determining estimates about the likelihood of default by the
borrowers and the severity of loss in the event of default. The Company
considers these risk characteristics in assigning internal risk ratings to, or
forecasting losses on, these loans, which are the significant factors in
determining the allowance for credit losses for loans in the commercial lending
segment.
The consumer lending segment represents loans and leases made to
consumer customers, including residential mortgages, credit card loans, and
other retail loans such as revolving consumer lines, auto loans and leases and
home equity loans and lines. Key risk characteristics relevant to consumer
lending segment loans primarily relate to the borrowers’ capacity and willingness
to repay and include unemployment rates, consumer bankruptcy filings,
household debt levels, real disposable income and other macroeconomic
factors, customer payment history and credit scores, effect of higher interest
rates on variable rate or
adjustable rate loans, and in some cases, updated loan-to-value (“LTV”)
information reflecting current market conditions on secured loans. These and
other risk characteristics are reflected in forecasts of delinquency levels,
bankruptcies and losses which are the primary factors in determining the
allowance for credit losses for the consumer lending segment.
The Company further disaggregates its loan portfolio segments into various
classes based on their underlying risk characteristics. The two classes within the
commercial lending segment are commercial loans and commercial real estate
loans. The three classes within the consumer lending segment are residential
mortgages, credit card loans and other retail loans.
The Company’s consumer lending segment utilizes several distinct business
processes and channels to originate consumer credit, including traditional
branch lending, mobile and online banking, indirect lending, alliance
partnerships and correspondent banks. Each distinct underwriting and
origination activity manages unique credit risk characteristics and prices its loan
production commensurate with the differing risk profiles.
Residential mortgage originations are generally limited to prime borrowers
and are performed through the Company’s branches, loan production offices,
mobile and online services, and a wholesale network of originators. The
Company may retain residential mortgage loans it originates on its balance
sheet or sell the loans into the secondary market while retaining the servicing
rights and customer relationships. Utilizing the secondary markets enables the
Company to effectively reduce its credit and other asset/liability risks. For
residential mortgages that are retained in the Company’s portfolio and for home
equity and second mortgages, credit risk is managed by adherence to LTV and
borrower credit criteria during the underwriting process.
The Company estimates updated LTV information on its outstanding
residential mortgages quarterly, based on a method that combines automated
valuation model updates and relevant home price indices. LTV is the ratio of the
loan’s outstanding principal balance to the current estimate of property value.
For home equity and second mortgages, combined loan-to-value (“CLTV”) is the
combination of the first mortgage original principal balance and the second lien
outstanding principal balance, relative to the current estimate of property value.
Certain loans do not have an LTV or CLTV, primarily due to lack of availability of
relevant automated valuation model and/or home price indices values, or lack of
necessary valuation data on acquired loans.

Loan Delinquencies Trends in delinquency ratios are an indicator, among other
considerations, of credit risk within the Company’s loan portfolios. The entire
balance of a loan account is considered delinquent if the minimum payment
contractually required to be made is not received by the date specified on the
billing statement. Delinquent loans purchased and loans that could be
purchased from GNMA mortgage pools under delinquent loan repurchase
options, whose repayments are primarily insured by the Federal Housing
Administration or guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans
Affairs, are excluded from delinquency statistics.
Accruing loans 90 days or more past due totaled $714 million at March 31,
2024, compared with $698 million at December 31, 2023. Accruing loans 90
days or more past due are not included in nonperforming assets and continue to
accrue interest because they are adequately secured by collateral, are in the
process of collection and are reasonably expected to result in repayment or
restoration to current status, or are managed in homogeneous portfolios with
specified charge-off timeframes adhering to regulatory guidelines. The ratio of
accruing loans 90 days or more past due to total loans was 0.19 percent at
March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

that continue to accrue interest, compared with $595 million and $2.0 billion at December 31, 2023, respectively.
(b) Includes revolving credit, installment and automobile loans.
Modified Loans In certain circumstances, the Company may modify the terms
of a loan to maximize the collection of amounts due when a borrower is
experiencing financial difficulties or is expected to experience difficulties in the
near-term. In most cases the modification is either a concessionary reduction in
interest rate, extension of the maturity date or reduction in the principal balance
that would otherwise not be considered.
Modified loans accrue interest if the borrower complies with the revised
terms and conditions and has demonstrated repayment performance at a level
commensurate with the modified terms over several payment cycles, which is
generally six months or greater.
The Company continues to work with customers to modify loans for
borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties. Many of the Company’s
loan modifications are determined on a case-by-case basis in connection with
ongoing loan collection processes. The modifications vary within each of the
Company’s loan classes. Commercial lending segment modifications generally
include extensions of the maturity date and may be accompanied by an increase
or decrease to the interest rate. The Company may
also work with the borrower to make other changes to the loan to mitigate
losses, such as obtaining additional collateral and/or guarantees to support the
loan.
The Company has also implemented certain residential mortgage loan
modification programs. The Company modifies residential mortgage loans under
Federal Housing Administration, United States Department of Veterans Affairs,
and its own internal programs. Under these programs, the Company offers
qualifying homeowners the opportunity to permanently modify their loan and
achieve more affordable monthly payments. These modifications may include
adjustments to interest rates, conversion of adjustable rates to fixed rates,
extensions of maturity dates or deferrals of payments, capitalization of accrued
interest and/or outstanding advances, or in limited situations, partial forgiveness
of loan principal. In most instances, participation in residential mortgage loan
modification programs requires the customer to complete a short-term trial
period. A permanent loan modification is contingent on the customer
successfully completing the trial period arrangement, and the loan documents
are not modified until that time.
(a)
(b)
12 U.S. Bancorp
Credit card and other retail loan modifications are generally part of distinct
modification programs providing customers modification solutions over a
specified time period, generally up to 60 months.
The Company also makes short-term modifications, in limited
circumstances, to assist borrowers experiencing temporary hardships. Shortterm consumer lending modification programs include payment reductions,
deferrals of up to three past due payments, and the ability to return to current
status if the borrower makes required payments. The Company may also make
short-term modifications to commercial lending loans, with the most common
modification being an extension of the maturity date of three months or less.
Such extensions generally are used when the maturity date is imminent and the
borrower is experiencing some level of financial stress, but the Company
believes the borrower will pay all contractual amounts owed.
Nonperforming Assets The level of nonperforming assets represents another
indicator of the potential for future credit losses. Nonperforming assets include
nonaccrual loans, modified loans not performing in accordance with modified
terms and not accruing interest, modified loans that have not met the
performance period required to return to accrual status, other real estate owned
(“OREO”) and other
nonperforming assets owned by the Company. Interest payments collected from
assets on nonaccrual status are generally applied against the principal balance
and not recorded as income. However, interest income may be recognized for
interest payments if the remaining carrying amount of the loan is believed to be
collectible.
At March 31, 2024, total nonperforming assets were $1.8 billion, compared
to $1.5 billion at December 31, 2023. The $292 million (19.5 percent) increase in
nonperforming assets was primarily due to higher nonperforming commercial
and commercial real estate loans, including the commercial real estate office
sector. Office nonperforming loans as a percent of total office loans increased to
10.0 percent at March 31, 2024, compared to 7.6 percent at December 31,
2023. The ratio of total nonperforming assets to total loans and other real estate
was 0.48 percent at March 31, 2024, compared with 0.40 percent at
December 31, 2023.
OREO was $25 million at March 31, 2024, compared with $26 million at
December 31, 2023, and was related to foreclosed properties that previously
secured loan balances. These balances exclude foreclosed GNMA loans whose
repayments are primarily insured by the Federal Housing Administration or
guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.

Analysis of Loan Net Charge-offs Total loan net charge-offs were $488 million
for the first quarter of 2024, compared with $373 million for the first quarter of
2023. The $115 million (30.8 percent) increase reflected higher charge-offs in
most loan categories consistent with normalizing credit conditions, partially
offset by the impact of charge-offs in the first quarter of 2023 related to the
uncollectible amount of acquired loans associated with the acquisition of MUB.
The ratio of total loan net charge-offs to average loans outstanding on an
annualized basis for the first quarter of 2024 was 0.53 percent, compared with
0.39 percent for the first quarter of 2023.
Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Credit Losses The
allowance for credit losses is established for current expected credit losses on
the Company’s loan and lease portfolio, including unfunded credit commitments.
The allowance considers expected losses for the remaining lives of the
applicable assets, inclusive of expected recoveries. The allowance for credit
losses is increased through provisions charged to earnings and reduced by net
charge-offs.
Management evaluates the appropriateness of the allowance for credit
losses on a quarterly basis. Multiple economic scenarios are considered over a
three-year reasonable and supportable forecast period, which includes
increasing consideration of historical loss experience over years two and three.
These economic scenarios are constructed with interrelated projections of
multiple economic variables, and loss estimates are produced that consider the
historical correlation of those economic variables with credit losses. After the
forecast period, the Company fully reverts to long-term historical loss
experience, adjusted for
prepayments and characteristics of the current loan and lease portfolio, to
estimate losses over the remaining life of the portfolio. The economic scenarios
are updated at least quarterly and are designed to provide a range of
reasonable estimates from better to worse than current expectations. Scenarios
are weighted based on the Company’s expectation of economic conditions for
the foreseeable future and reflect significant judgment and consideration of
economic forecast uncertainty. Final loss estimates also consider factors
affecting credit losses not reflected in the scenarios, due to the unique aspects
of current conditions and expectations. These factors may include, but are not
limited to, changes in borrower behavior or conditions in specific lending
segments, loan servicing practices, regulatory guidance, and/or fiscal and
monetary policy actions.
Because business processes and credit risks associated with unfunded
credit commitments are essentially the same as for loans, the Company utilizes
similar processes to estimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments, which
is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Both the
allowance for loan losses and the liability for unfunded credit commitments are
included in the Company’s analysis of credit losses and reported reserve ratios.
The allowance recorded for credit losses utilizes forward-looking expected
loss models to consider a variety of factors affecting lifetime credit losses. These
factors include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic variables such as
unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels, inflation,
interest rates, and corporate bond spreads, as well as loan and borrower
characteristics, such as internal risk ratings on commercial loans and consumer
credit scores, delinquency status, collateral type and
U.S. Bancorp 15
available valuation information, consideration of end-of-term losses on lease
residuals, and the remaining term of the loan, adjusted for expected
prepayments. For each loan portfolio, including those loans modified under
various loan modification programs, model estimates are adjusted as necessary
to consider any relevant changes in portfolio composition, lending policies,
underwriting standards, risk management practices, economic conditions or
other factors that may affect the accuracy of the model. Expected credit loss
estimates also include consideration of expected cash recoveries on loans
previously charged-off or expected recoveries on collateral-dependent loans
where recovery is expected through sale of the collateral at fair value less
selling costs. Where loans do not exhibit similar risk characteristics, an
individual analysis is performed to consider expected credit losses.
The allowance recorded for individually evaluated loans greater than $5
million in the commercial lending segment is based on an analysis utilizing
expected cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate, the
observable market price of the loan, or the fair value of the collateral, less selling
costs, for collateral-dependent loans as appropriate.
When evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses for
any loans and lines in a junior lien position, the Company considers the
delinquency and modification status of the first lien, based on either servicing
data for first lien accounts serviced by the Company or the status of first lien
mortgage accounts reported on customer credit bureau files when the first lien is
not serviced by the Company. This information is considered within the overall
assessment of economic conditions, problem loans, recent loss experience and
other factors in determining the allowance for credit losses.
When a loan portfolio is purchased, the acquired loans are divided into those
considered purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration (“PCD”)
and those not considered PCD. An allowance is established for each population
and considers product mix, risk characteristics of the portfolio and delinquency
status and refreshed LTV ratios when possible. PCD loans also consider
whether the loan has experienced a charge-off, bankruptcy or significant
deterioration since origination. The allowance established for purchased loans
not considered PCD is recognized through provision expense upon acquisition,
whereas the allowance established for loans considered PCD at acquisition is
offset by an increase in the basis of the acquired loans. Any subsequent
increases and decreases in the allowance related to purchased loans,
regardless of PCD status, are recognized through provision expense, with
charge-offs charged to the allowance. The Company had a total net book
balance of $3.0 billion of PCD loans, primarily related to the MUB acquisition,
included in its loan portfolio at March 31, 2024.
The Company’s methodology for determining the appropriate allowance for
credit losses also considers the imprecision inherent in the methodologies used
and allocated to the various loan portfolios. As a result, amounts determined
under the methodologies described above are adjusted by management to
consider the potential impact of other qualitative factors not captured in
quantitative model
adjustments which include, but are not limited to, the following: model
imprecision, imprecision in economic scenario assumptions, and emerging risks
related to either changes in the economic environment that are affecting specific
portfolios, or changes in portfolio concentrations over time that may affect model
performance. The consideration of these items results in adjustments to
allowance amounts included in the Company’s allowance for credit losses for
each loan portfolio.
Although the Company determined the amount of each element of the
allowance separately and considers this process to be an important credit
management tool, the entire allowance for credit losses is available for the entire
loan portfolio. The actual amount of losses can vary significantly from the
estimated amounts.
At March 31, 2024, the allowance for credit losses was $7.9 billion,
compared with an allowance of $7.8 billion at December 31, 2023. The $65
million (0.8 percent) increase in the allowance for credit losses at March 31,
2024, compared with December 31, 2023, was primarily driven by credit
migration in consumer and small business cards. The Company continued to
monitor economic uncertainty related to high interest rates, persistent
inflationary pressures and other economic factors that affect the financial
strength of corporate and consumer borrowers. Commercial real estate
valuations were also affected by rising interest rates and the changing demand
for office properties. The Company has monitored the commercial real estate
office portfolio and established an allowance to loan coverage ratio of
approximately 10 percent at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. In
addition to these broad economic factors, expected loss estimates considered
various factors including customer specific information impacting changes in risk
ratings, projected delinquencies and the impact of economic deterioration on
selected borrowers’ liquidity and ability to repay.
The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period-end loans was 2.11
percent at March 31, 2024, compared with 2.10 percent at December 31, 2023.
The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 454
percent at March 31, 2024, compared with 541 percent at December 31, 2023.
The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to annualized loan net charge-offs
was 403 percent at March 31, 2024, compared with 411 percent of full year
2023 net charge-offs at December 31, 2023.
Economic conditions considered in estimating the allowance for credit losses
at March 31, 2024 included changes in projected gross domestic product and
unemployment levels. These factors were evaluated through a combination of
quantitative calculations using multiple economic scenarios and additional
qualitative assessments that considered the degree of economic uncertainty in
the current environment. The projected unemployment rates for 2024
considered in the estimate range from 3.1 percent to 7.7 percent.

Residual Value Risk Management The Company manages its risk to changes
in the residual value of leased vehicles, office and business equipment, and
other assets through disciplined residual valuation at the inception of a lease,
diversification of its leased assets, regular residual asset valuation reviews and
monitoring of residual value gains or losses upon the disposition of assets. As of
March 31, 2024, no significant change in the amount of residual values or
concentration of the portfolios had occurred since December 31, 2023. Refer to
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Residual Value Risk Management”
in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2023, for further discussion on residual value risk management.
Operational Risk Management The Company operates in many different
businesses in diverse markets and relies on the ability of its employees and
systems to process a high number of transactions. Operational risk is inherent in
all business activities, and the management of this risk is important to the
achievement of the Company’s objectives. Business lines have direct and
primary responsibility and accountability for identifying, controlling, and
monitoring operational risks embedded in their business activities, including
those additional or increased risks created by economic and financial
disruptions.
The Company maintains a system of controls with the objective of providing
proper transaction authorization and execution, proper system operations,
proper oversight of third parties with whom it does business, safeguarding of
assets from misuse or theft, and ensuring the reliability and security of financial
and other data. The Company also maintains a cybersecurity risk program
which provides centralized planning and management of related and
interdependent work with a focus on risks from cybersecurity threats. The
Company's cybersecurity risk program is integrated into the Company's overall
business and operational strategies and requires that the Company allocate
appropriate resources to maintain the program. Refer to “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis — Operational Risk Management” in the Company’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for further
discussion on operational risk management.
Compliance Risk Management The Company may suffer legal or regulatory
sanctions, material financial loss, or damage to its reputation if it fails to comply
with laws, regulations, rules, standards of good practice, and codes of conduct,
including those related to compliance with Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money
laundering requirements, sanctions compliance requirements as administered
by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, consumer protection and other
requirements. The Company has controls and processes in place for the
assessment, identification, monitoring, management and reporting of
compliance risks and issues, including those created or increased by economic
and financial disruptions. Refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis —
Compliance Risk Management” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2023, for further discussion on compliance risk
management.
Interest Rate Risk Management In the banking industry, changes in interest
rates are a significant risk that can impact earnings as well as the safety and
soundness of an entity. The Company manages its exposure to changes in
interest rates through asset and liability management activities within guidelines
established by its Asset Liability Management Committee (“ALCO”) and
approved by the Board of Directors. The ALCO has the responsibility for
approving and overseeing compliance with the ALCO management policies,
including interest rate risk exposure. One way the Company measures and
analyzes its interest rate risk is through analysis of net interest income
sensitivities across a range of scenarios.
Net interest income sensitivity analysis includes evaluating all of the
Company’s assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, inclusive of
new business activity under various interest rate scenarios that differ in the
direction, amount and speed of change over time, as well as the overall shape
of the yield curve. The balance sheet includes assumptions regarding loan and
deposit volumes and pricing which are based on quantitative analysis, historical
trends and management outlook and strategies. Deposit balances, mix and
pricing are dynamic across interest rate scenarios and will change both with the
absolute level of rates as well as the assumed interest rate shock. Deposit
pricing changes, commonly referred to as the deposit beta, represents the
amount by which the Company’s interest-bearing deposit rates have or will
change given a change in short-term market rates. Base case and net interest
income sensitivities are reviewed monthly by the ALCO and are used to guide
asset/liability management strategies.
The Company also manages interest rate sensitivity by utilizing market value
of equity modeling, which measures the degree to which the market values of
the Company’s assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments will
change given a change in interest rates. Management measures the impact of
changes in market values due to interest rates under a number of scenarios,
including immediate and sustained parallel shifts, and flattening or steepening of
the yield curve. The Company manages its interest rate risk position by holding
assets with desired interest rate risk characteristics on its balance sheet,
executing certain pricing strategies for loans and deposits and deploying
investment portfolio, funding and derivative strategies.
Table 9 summarizes the projected impact to net interest income over the
next 12 months of various potential interest rate changes. The sensitivity of the
projected impact to net interest income over the next 12 months is dependent on
balance sheet growth, product mix, deposit behavior, pricing and funding
decisions. From December 31, 2023 to March 31, 2024, interest rate sensitivity
to higher rates decreased, primarily due to changes in deposit composition and
rates paid on deposits as a result of the elevated interest rate environment
throughout the first quarter of 2024. As of March 31, 2024, the Company is
relatively neutral to further parallel upward moves in interest rates while the
sensitivity to lower rates has improved driven by the projected repricing of the
deposit portfolio in declining rate scenarios. While the Company utilizes models
and assumptions based on historical information and expected behaviors, actual
outcomes could vary significantly.

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and Other Risks To manage the
sensitivity of earnings and capital to interest rate, prepayment, credit, price and
foreign currency fluctuations (asset and liability management positions), the
Company enters into derivative transactions. The Company uses derivatives for
asset and liability management purposes primarily in the following ways:
• To convert fixed-rate debt and available-for-sale investment securities from
fixed-rate payments to floating-rate payments;
• To convert floating-rate loans and debt from floating-rate payments to fixedrate payments;
• To mitigate changes in value of the Company’s unfunded mortgage loan
commitments, funded MLHFS and MSRs;
• To mitigate remeasurement volatility of foreign currency denominated
balances; and
• To mitigate the volatility of the Company’s net investment in foreign operations
driven by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
In addition, the Company enters into interest rate, foreign exchange and
commodity derivative contracts to support the business requirements of its
customers (customer-related positions). The Company minimizes the market
and liquidity risks of customer-related positions by either entering into similar
offsetting positions with broker-dealers, or on a portfolio basis by entering into
other derivative or non-derivative financial instruments that partially or fully offset
the exposure from these customer-related positions. The Company may enter
into derivative contracts that are either exchange-traded, centrally cleared
through clearinghouses or over-the-counter. The Company does not utilize
derivatives for speculative purposes.
The Company does not designate all of the derivatives that it enters into for
risk management purposes as accounting hedges because of the inefficiency of
applying the accounting requirements and may instead elect fair value
accounting for the related hedged items. In particular, the Company enters into
interest rate swaps, swaptions, forward commitments to buy to-be-announced
securities (“TBAs”), U.S. Treasury and Eurodollar futures and options on U.S.
Treasury futures to mitigate fluctuations in the value of its MSRs, but does not
designate those derivatives as accounting hedges. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding MSRs,
including management of the changes in fair value.
Additionally, the Company uses forward commitments to sell TBAs and other
commitments to sell residential mortgage loans at specified prices to
economically hedge the interest rate risk in its residential mortgage loan
production activities. The forward commitments to sell and the unfunded
mortgage
loan commitments on loans intended to be sold are considered derivatives
under the accounting guidance related to accounting for derivative instruments
and hedging activities. The Company has elected the fair value option for the
MLHFS.
Derivatives are subject to credit risk associated with counterparties to the
contracts. Credit risk associated with derivatives is measured by the Company
based on the probability of counterparty default. The Company manages the
credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various
counterparties, by entering into master netting arrangements, and, where
possible, by requiring collateral arrangements. The Company may also transfer
counterparty credit risk related to interest rate swaps to third parties through the
use of risk participation agreements. In addition, certain interest rate swaps,
interest rate forwards and credit contracts are required to be centrally cleared
through clearinghouses to further mitigate counterparty credit risk. The
Company also mitigates the credit risk of its derivative positions, as well as the
credit risk on loans or lending portfolios, through the use of credit contracts.
For additional information on derivatives and hedging activities, refer to
Notes 12 and 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Market Risk Management In addition to interest rate risk, the Company is
exposed to other forms of market risk, principally related to trading activities
which support customers’ strategies to manage their own foreign currency,
interest rate risk, commodities risk and funding activities. For purposes of its
internal capital adequacy assessment process, the Company considers risk
arising from its trading activities, as well as the remeasurement volatility of
foreign currency denominated balances included on its Consolidated Balance
Sheet (collectively, “Covered Positions”), employing methodologies consistent
with the requirements of regulatory rules for market risk. The Company’s Market
Risk Committee (“MRC”), within the framework of the ALCO, oversees market
risk management. The MRC monitors and reviews the Company’s Covered
Positions and establishes policies for market risk management, including
exposure limits for each portfolio. The Company uses a VaR approach to
measure general market risk. Theoretically, VaR represents the statistical risk of
loss the Company has to adverse market movements over a one-day time
horizon. The Company uses the Historical Simulation method to calculate VaR
for its Covered Positions measured at the ninety-ninth percentile using a oneyear look-back period for distributions derived from past market data. The
market factors used in the calculations include those pertinent to market risks
inherent in the underlying trading portfolios, principally those that affect the
Company’s corporate bond trading business, foreign currency transaction
business, client derivatives
20 U.S. Bancorp
business, loan trading business and municipal securities business, as well as
those inherent in the Company’s foreign denominated balances and the
derivatives used to mitigate the related measurement volatility. On average, the
Company expects the one-day VaR to be exceeded by actual losses two to
three times per year related to these positions. The Company monitors the
accuracy of internal VaR models and modeling processes by back-testing model
performance, regularly updating the historical data used by the VaR models and
regular model validations to assess the accuracy of the models’ input,
processing, and reporting components. All models are required to be
independently reviewed and approved prior to being placed in use. If the
Company were to experience market losses in excess of the estimated VaR
more often than expected, the VaR models and associated assumptions would
be analyzed and adjusted.
The average, high, low and period-end one-day VaR amounts for the
Company’s Covered Positions were as follows:
Three Months Ended March 31
(Dollars in Millions) 2024 2023
Average $ 3 $ 5
High 4 6
Low 2 4
Period-end 3 5
The Company did not experience any actual losses for its combined
Covered Positions that exceeded VaR during the three months ended March 31,
2024 and 2023. The Company stress tests its market risk measurements to
provide management with perspectives on market events that may not be
captured by its VaR models, including worst case historical market movement
combinations that have not necessarily occurred on the same date.
The Company calculates Stressed VaR using the same underlying
methodology and model as VaR, except that a historical continuous one-year
look-back period is utilized that reflects a period of significant financial stress
appropriate to the Company’s Covered Positions. The period selected by the
Company includes the significant market volatility of the last four months of
2008.
The average, high, low and period-end one-day Stressed VaR amounts for the
Company’s Covered Positions were as follows:
Three Months Ended March 31
(Dollars in Millions) 2024 2023
Average $ 9 $ 12
High 12 16
Low 7 10
Period-end 10 14
Valuations of positions in client derivatives and foreign currency activities are
based on discounted cash flow or other valuation techniques using marketbased assumptions. These valuations are compared to third-party quotes or
other market prices to determine if there are significant variances. Significant
variances are approved by senior management in the Company’s corporate
functions. Valuation of positions in the corporate bond trading, loan trading and
municipal securities businesses are based on trader marks. These
trader marks are evaluated against third-party prices, with significant variances
approved by senior management in the Company’s corporate functions.
The Company also measures the market risk of its hedging activities related
to residential MLHFS and MSRs using the Historical Simulation method. The
VaRs are measured at the ninety-ninth percentile and employ factors pertinent
to the market risks inherent in the valuation of the assets and hedges. A oneyear look-back period is used to obtain past market data for the models.
The average, high and low VaR amounts for the residential MLHFS and related
hedges and the MSRs and related hedges were as follows:

Liquidity Risk Management The Company’s liquidity risk management process
is designed to identify, measure, and manage the Company’s funding and
liquidity risk to meet its daily funding needs and to address expected and
unexpected changes in its funding requirements. The Company engages in
various activities to manage its liquidity risk. These activities include diversifying
its funding sources, stress testing, and holding readily-marketable assets which
can be used as a source of liquidity if needed. In addition, the Company’s
profitable operations, sound credit quality and strong credit ratings and capital
position have enabled it to develop a large and reliable base of core deposit
funding within its market areas and in domestic and global capital markets.
The Company’s Board of Directors approves the Company’s liquidity policy.
The Risk Management Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors
oversees the Company’s liquidity risk management process and approves a
contingency funding plan. The ALCO reviews the Company’s liquidity policy and
limits, and regularly assesses the Company’s ability to meet funding
requirements arising from adverse company-specific or market events.
The Company regularly projects its funding needs under various stress
scenarios and maintains a contingency funding plan consistent with the
Company’s access to diversified sources of contingent funding. The Company
maintains a substantial level of total available liquidity in the form of on-balance
sheet and off-balance sheet funding sources. These liquidity sources include
cash at the Federal Reserve Bank and certain European central banks,
unencumbered liquid assets, and capacity to borrow from the Federal Home
Loan Bank (“FHLB”) and at the Federal Reserve Bank’s Discount Window.
Unencumbered liquid
U.S. Bancorp 21
assets in the Company’s investment securities portfolio provide asset liquidity
through the Company’s ability to sell the securities or pledge and borrow against
them. Refer to Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and
“Balance Sheet Analysis” for further information on investment securities
maturities and trends. Asset liquidity is further enhanced by the Company’s
practice of pledging loans to access secured borrowing facilities through the
FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank.
The following table summarizes the Company’s total available liquidity from onbalance sheet and off-balance sheet funding sources:
(Dollars in Millions)

Cash held at the Federal Reserve
Bank and other central banks $ 68,945 $ 52,403

Borrowing capacity from the
Federal Reserve Bank and
FHLB 177,811 215,763
Total available liquidity $ 299,115 $ 302,386
Borrowing capacity from the Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB declined from
December 31, 2023 to March 31, 2024 primarily due to the expiration of the
Federal Reserve Bank’s Bank Term Funding Program (“BTFP”). This decline
was partially offset by an increase in available investment securities as a portion
of the securities previously pledged through the BTFP were made available for
sale or pledging. Cash increased from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by
customer deposit inflows.
The Company’s diversified deposit base provides a sizeable source of
relatively stable and low-cost funding, while reducing the Company’s reliance on
the wholesale markets. Total deposits were $528.1 billion at March 31, 2024,
compared with $512.3 billion at December 31, 2023. Average first quarter 2024
noninterest-bearing deposit balances reflected decreases of 34.6 percent and
6.4 percent compared with the first quarter of 2023 and fourth quarter of 2023,
respectively. These decreases reflected the continuing shift of noninterestbearing balances into interest-bearing deposit products resulting from the higher
interest rate environment. Average total deposits for both the first quarter of
2024 and 2023 funded approximately 77 percent of the Company’s total assets
of these same periods, respectively. Refer to “Balance Sheet Analysis” for
further information on the Company’s deposits.
Additional funding is provided by long-term debt and short-term borrowings.
Long-term debt was $52.7 billion at March 31, 2024, and is an important funding
source because of its multi-year borrowing structure. Short-term borrowings
were $17.1 billion at March 31, 2024, and supplement the Company’s other
funding sources. Refer to “Balance Sheet Analysis” for further information on the
Company’s long-term debt and short-term borrowings.
In addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis, the Company
monitors the parent company’s liquidity. The parent company’s routine funding
requirements consist primarily of operating expenses, dividends paid to
shareholders, debt service, repurchases of common stock
and funds used for acquisitions. The parent company obtains funding to meet its
obligations from dividends collected from its subsidiaries and the issuance of
debt and capital securities. The Company establishes limits for the minimal
number of months into the future where the parent company can meet existing
and forecasted obligations with cash and securities held that can be readily
monetized. The Company measures and manages this limit in both normal and
adverse conditions. The Company maintains sufficient funding to meet expected
capital and debt service obligations for 24 months without the support of
dividends from subsidiaries and assuming access to the wholesale markets is
maintained. The Company maintains sufficient liquidity to meet its capital and
debt service obligations for 12 months under adverse conditions without the
support of dividends from subsidiaries or access to the wholesale markets. The
parent company is currently in excess of required liquidity minimums.
At March 31, 2024, parent company long-term debt outstanding was $35.7
billion, compared with $34.3 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase was
primarily due to $3.5 billion of medium-term note issuances, partially offset by
$2.1 billion of medium-term note repayments. As of March 31, 2024, there was
$3.6 billion of parent company debt scheduled to mature in the remainder of
2024. Future debt maturities may be met through medium-term note and capital
security issuances and dividends from subsidiaries, as well as from parent
company cash and cash equivalents.
The Company is subject to a regulatory Liquidity Coverage Ratio (“LCR”)
requirement which requires large banking organizations to maintain an adequate
level of unencumbered high quality liquid assets to meet estimated liquidity
needs over a 30-day stressed period. For the three months ended March 31,
2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company’s average daily LCR was 109.4
percent and 109.2 percent, respectively. The Company was compliant with this
requirement for both of these periods.
The Company is also subject to a regulatory Net Stable Funding Ratio
(“NSFR”) requirement which requires large banking organizations to maintain a
minimum level of stable funding based on the liquidity characteristics of their
assets, commitments, and derivative exposures over a one-year time horizon.
The Company was compliant with this requirement at March 31, 2024 and
December 31, 2023.
Refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Liquidity Risk
Management” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2023, for further discussion on liquidity risk management.
European Exposures The Company provides merchant processing and
corporate trust services in Europe either directly or through banking affiliations in
Europe. Revenue generated from sources in Europe represented approximately
2 percent of the Company’s total net revenue for the three months ended
March 31, 2024. Operating cash for these businesses is deposited on a shortterm basis typically with certain European central banks. For deposits placed at
other European banks, exposure is mitigated by the Company placing deposits
at multiple banks and managing the amounts on deposit at any bank based on
institution-specific deposit limits. At March 31, 2024, the
22 U.S. Bancorp
Company had an aggregate amount on deposit with European banks of
approximately $6.8 billion, predominately with the Central Bank of Ireland and
Bank of England.
In addition, the Company provides financing to domestic multinational
corporations that generate revenue from customers in European countries,
transacts with various European banks as counterparties to certain derivativerelated activities, and through a subsidiary, manages money market funds that
hold certain investments in European sovereign debt. Any deterioration in
economic conditions in Europe, including the impacts resulting from the RussiaUkraine conflict, is not expected to have a significant effect on the Company
related to these activities.
Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Other Contractual Obligations
The Company participates in many different contractual arrangements which
may or may not be recorded on its balance sheet, with unrelated or consolidated
entities, under which the Company has an obligation to pay certain amounts,
provide credit or liquidity enhancements or provide market risk support. These
arrangements include commitments to extend credit, letters of credit and various
forms of guarantees. Refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information on guarantees and contingent liabilities.
These arrangements also include any obligation related to a variable interest
held in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, credit
enhancement or market risk support. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the
Company’s interests in variable interest entities.
Capital Management The Company is committed to managing capital to
maintain strong protection for depositors and creditors and for maximum
shareholder benefit. The Company also manages its capital to exceed
regulatory capital requirements for banking organizations. To achieve its capital
goals, the Company employs a variety of capital management tools, including
dividends, common share repurchases, and the issuance of subordinated debt,
non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, common stock and other capital
instruments. The regulatory capital requirements effective for the Company
follow Basel III, with the Company being subject to calculating its capital
adequacy as a
percentage of risk-weighted assets under the standardized approach. Beginning
in 2022, the Company began to phase into its regulatory capital requirements
the cumulative deferred impact of its 2020 adoption of the accounting guidance
related to the impairment of financial instruments based on the current expected
credit losses (“CECL”) methodology plus 25 percent of its quarterly credit
reserve increases during 2020 and 2021. This cumulative deferred impact will
continue to be phased into the Company’s regulatory capital during 2024,
culminating with a fully phased in regulatory capital calculation beginning in
2025. Table 10 provides a summary of statutory regulatory capital ratios in effect
for the Company at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. All regulatory
ratios exceeded regulatory “well-capitalized” requirements.
In July 2023, the U.S. federal bank regulatory authorities proposed a rule
implementing the Basel Committee’s finalization of the post-crisis regulatory
capital reforms. The proposal provides for a July 1, 2025 effective date, subject
to a three-year transition period. The proposal includes the Fundamental Review
of the Trading Book, which replaces the market risk rule, and introduces new
standardized approaches for credit risk, operational risk and credit valuation
adjustment (CVA) risk, which would replace the current models-based
approaches. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the proposed
rule and expects that any final rule would result in the Company being required
to maintain increased levels of regulatory capital.
The Company believes certain other capital ratios are useful in evaluating its
capital adequacy. The Company’s tangible common equity, as a percent of
tangible assets and as a percent of risk-weighted assets determined in
accordance with transitional regulatory capital requirements related to the CECL
methodology under the standardized approach, was 5.2 percent and 7.8
percent, respectively, at March 31, 2024, compared with 5.3 percent and 7.7
percent, respectively, at December 31, 2023. In addition, the Company’s
common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio, reflecting the full
implementation of the CECL methodology was 9.9 percent at March 31, 2024,
compared with 9.7 percent at December 31, 2023. Refer to “Non-GAAP
Financial Measures” beginning on page 27 for further information on these other
capital ratios.

Total U.S. Bancorp shareholders’ equity was $55.6 billion at March 31, 2024,
compared with $55.3 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily
the result of corporate earnings, partially offset by dividends paid and changes
in unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investment securities
included in other comprehensive income (loss).
The Company announced on December 22, 2020 that its Board of Directors
had approved an authorization to repurchase $3.0 billion of its common stock
beginning January 1, 2021. The Company suspended all common stock
repurchases at the beginning of the third quarter of 2021, except for those done
exclusively in connection with its stock-based compensation programs, due to
its acquisition of MUB. The Company will evaluate its share repurchases in
connection with the potential capital requirements given proposed regulatory
capital rules and related landscape. Capital distributions, including dividends
and stock repurchases, are subject to the approval of the Company’s Board of
Directors and compliance with regulatory requirements.

Line of Business Financial Review
The Company’s major lines of business are Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and
Institutional Banking, Consumer and Business Banking, Payment Services, and
Treasury and Corporate Support.
Basis for Financial Presentation Business line results are derived from the
Company’s business unit profitability reporting systems by specifically attributing
managed balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related
income or expense. Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information on the business lines’ basis for financial
presentation.
Designations, assignments and allocations change from time to time as
management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating performance or
product lines change or business segments are realigned to better respond to
the
Company’s diverse customer base. During 2024 and 2023, certain organization
and methodology changes were made, including the Company combining its
Wealth Management and Investment Services and Corporate and Commercial
Banking lines of businesses to create the Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and
Institutional Banking line of business during the third quarter of 2023. Prior
period results were restated and presented on a comparable basis.
Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking Wealth,
Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking provides core banking,
specialized lending, transaction and payment processing, capital markets, asset
management, and brokerage and investment related services to wealth, middle
market, large corporate, government and institutional clients. Wealth, Corporate,
Commercial and Institutional Banking contributed $651 million of the Company’s
net income in the first quarter of 2024, or a decrease of $291 million (30.9
percent) compared with the first quarter of 2023.
Net revenue decreased $192 million (7.5 percent) in the first quarter of 2024,
compared with the first quarter of 2023. Net interest income, on a taxableequivalent basis, decreased $285 million (18.4 percent) in the first quarter of
2024, compared with the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to the impact of
deposit mix and pricing, partially offset by higher rates on earning assets.
Noninterest income increased $93 million (9.1 percent) in the first quarter of
2024, compared with the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher trust and
investment management fees driven by business growth and favorable market
conditions, and higher commercial products revenue mainly due to higher
corporate bond fees.
Noninterest expense increased $32 million (2.4 percent) in the first quarter of
2024, compared with the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher
compensation and employee benefits expense. The provision for credit losses
increased $164 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared with the first
quarter of 2023, primarily due to commercial real estate credit quality and select
commercial downgrades.
Consumer and Business Banking Consumer and Business Banking
comprises consumer banking, small business banking and consumer lending.
Products and services are delivered through banking offices, telephone
servicing and sales, online services, direct mail, ATM processing, mobile
devices, distributed mortgage loan officers, and intermediary relationships
including auto dealerships, mortgage banks, and strategic business partners.

income in the first quarter of 2024, or a decrease of $169 million (21.9 percent)
compared with the first quarter of 2023.
Net revenue decreased $305 million (11.1 percent) in the first quarter of
2024, compared with the first quarter of 2023. Net interest income, on a taxableequivalent basis, decreased $327 million (14.0 percent) in the first quarter of
2024, compared with the first quarter of 2023, due to the impact of deposit mix
and pricing, partially offset by higher rates on earning assets. Noninterest
income increased $22 million (5.5 percent) in the first quarter of 2024, compared
with the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher
(a)

mortgage banking revenue driven by higher gain on sale margins, partially offset
by a decrease in service charges.
Noninterest expense decreased $127 million (7.4 percent) in the first quarter
of 2024, compared with the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to lower net
shared services expense and compensation and employee benefits expense.
The provision for credit losses increased $48 million in the first quarter of 2024,
compared with the first quarter of 2023, due to normalizing credit conditions.
Payment Services Payment Services includes consumer and business credit
cards, stored-value cards, debit cards, corporate, government and purchasing
card services and merchant processing. Payment Services contributed $248
million of the Company’s net income in the first quarter of 2024, or a decrease of
$62 million (20.0 percent) compared with the first quarter of 2023.
Net revenue increased $123 million (7.7 percent) in the first quarter of 2024,
compared with the first quarter of 2023. Net interest income, on a taxableequivalent basis, increased $80 million (12.2 percent) in the first quarter of 2024,
compared with the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher loan yields driven
by higher interest rates and customer revolve rates, along with higher loan
balances, partially offset by higher funding costs. Noninterest income increased
$43 million (4.6 percent) in the first quarter of 2024, compared with the first
quarter of 2023, driven by higher card revenue due to higher spend volume and
favorable rates, along with increased merchant processing services due to
higher spend volume.
Noninterest expense increased $66 million (6.9 percent) in the first quarter of
2024, compared with the first quarter of 2023, reflecting higher net shared
services expense driven by investment in infrastructure and technology
development. The provision for credit losses increased $139 million (63.2
percent) in the first quarter of 2024, compared with the first quarter of 2023,
primarily due to increasing delinquency rates and charge-offs.
Treasury and Corporate Support Treasury and Corporate Support includes
the Company’s investment portfolios, funding, capital management, interest rate
risk management, income taxes not allocated to the business lines, including
most investments in tax-advantaged projects, and the residual aggregate of
those expenses associated with corporate activities that are managed on a
consolidated basis. Treasury and Corporate Support recorded a net loss of $181
million in the first quarter of 2024, compared with a net loss of $324 million in the
first quarter of 2023.
Net revenue decreased $86 million (31.7 percent) in the first quarter of 2024,
compared with the first quarter of 2023. Net interest income, on a taxableequivalent basis, decreased $121 million (99.2 percent) in the first quarter of
2024, compared with the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher funding
costs, partially offset by higher yields on the investment securities portfolio and
cash balances. Noninterest income increased $35 million (23.5 percent) in the
first quarter of 2024, compared with the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to
prior year losses on securities and an increase in commercial products revenue,
partially offset by a decrease in other revenue.
Noninterest expense decreased $67 million (12.2 percent) in the first quarter
of 2024, compared with the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to prudent
expense management, continued focus on operational efficiency, synergies from
the MUB acquisition and lower merger and integration charges, along with a
decline in the future delivery exposure for merchant and airline processing and
other liabilities. These decreases were partially offset by the impact of the FDIC
special assessment, higher compensation and employee benefits expense and
higher net shared services expense. The provision for credit losses decreased
$225 million (99.6 percent) in the first quarter of 2024, compared with the first
quarter of 2023, primarily due to relative stability in the economic outlook in the
current quarter.
Income taxes are assessed to each line of business at a managerial tax rate
of 25.0 percent with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the
consolidated effective tax rate included in Treasury and Corporate Support.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the Company
considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and
adequacy, including:
• Tangible common equity to tangible assets,
• Tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets, and
• Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, reflecting the full
implementation of the CECL methodology.
These capital measures are viewed by management as useful additional
methods of evaluating the Company’s utilization of its capital held and the level
of capital available to withstand unexpected negative market or economic
conditions. Additionally, presentation of these measures allows investors,
analysts and banking regulators to assess the Company’s capital position
relative to other financial services companies. These capital measures are not
defined in generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), or are not
currently effective or defined in banking regulations. In addition, certain of these
measures differ from currently effective capital ratios defined by banking
regulations principally in that the currently effective ratios, which are
subject to certain transitional provisions, temporarily exclude the impact of the
2020 adoption of accounting guidance related to impairment of financial
instruments based on the CECL methodology. As a result, these capital
measures disclosed by the Company may be considered non-GAAP financial
measures. Management believes this information helps investors assess trends
in the Company’s capital adequacy.
The Company also discloses net interest income and related ratios and
analysis on a taxable-equivalent basis, which may also be considered nonGAAP financial measures. The Company believes this presentation to be the
preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant
comparison of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.
In addition, certain performance measures, including the efficiency ratio and net
interest margin utilize net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis.
There may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a
result, the Company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial
statements and other financial information contained in this report in their
entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure.
The following tables show the Company’s calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures:

Critical Accounting Policies
The accounting and reporting policies of the Company comply with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States and conform to general
practices within the banking industry. The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions. The Company’s financial position and results of operations can be
affected by these estimates and assumptions, which are integral to
understanding the Company’s financial statements. Critical accounting policies
are those policies management believes are the most important to the portrayal
of the Company’s financial condition and results, and require management to
make estimates that are difficult, subjective or complex. Most accounting
policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies.
Management has discussed the development and the selection of critical
accounting policies with the Company’s Audit Committee. Those policies
considered to be critical accounting policies relate to the allowance for credit
losses, fair value estimates, MSRs, and income taxes. These accounting
policies are discussed in detail in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis —
Critical Accounting Policies” and the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2023.
Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management,
including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the
Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)). Based
upon this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer
have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
During the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there was no change
made in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting.
