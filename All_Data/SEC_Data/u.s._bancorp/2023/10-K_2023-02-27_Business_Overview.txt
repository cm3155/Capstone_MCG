MUFG Union Bank Acquisition 

On December 1, 2022, the Company acquired MUB&#8217;s core regional banking franchise from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. Pursuant to the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of MUB for a purchase price consisting of $5.5 billion in cash and approximately 44 million shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock. The Company also received additional MUB capital of $3.5 billion upon completion of the acquisition. The additional capital received is held at the MUB subsidiary and required to be repaid to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. on or prior to the fifth anniversary date of the completion of the purchase, in accordance with the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement. As such, it is recognized as debt at the parent company. The transaction excludes the purchase of substantially all of MUB&#8217;s Global Corporate &#38; Investment Bank (other than certain deposits), certain middle and back-office functions, and other assets. MUB operates approximately 300 branches in California, Washington and Oregon. The Company&#8217;s 2022 results reflect MUB&#8217;s operations for the month of December 2022, and the Company&#8217;s balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 includes MUB&#8217;s balances acquired or assumed in the transaction, including $81.4 billion in total assets, $53.1 billion of loans and $82.0 billion of deposits. As of the date of acquisition, MUB is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and an affiliate of USBNA, the Company&#8217;s primary banking subsidiary. The Company expects to merge MUB into USBNA in connection with the conversion of MUB customers and systems to the USBNA platform over Memorial Day weekend in 2023.

Additional information regarding the Company&#8217;s business segments can be found on pages 56 to 59 of the Company&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report under the heading &#8220;Line of Business Financial Review,&#8221; which is incorporated herein by reference. 

Human Capital 

The Company&#8217;s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract, develop and retain skilled employees. The Company recognizes that supporting, engaging and continuously upskilling its workforce is key to meeting evolving corporate and customer needs. To further those efforts, the Company is dedicated to fostering a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment; providing pay that is competitive and fair, as well as other benefits and programs that promote wellness; and supporting employees&#8217; professional development through programs that promote engagement, learning and productivity. As of December 31, 2022, the Company employed a total of 78,192 employees globally, including employees from the acquisition of MUB on December 1, 2022. 

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion The Company continues to expand its talent pipeline to increase the representation of women at leadership levels and people of color at all levels, including at the executive and senior management level. The Company&#8217;s hiring program includes the inclusion of at least one woman or one person of color on interview slates for all roles at the Company. In addition, the Company&#8217;s High Impact Development Program focuses on growing its leadership pipeline of women and people of color. This program creates increased visibility and connections with executive leadership, meaningful learning and development opportunities, robust action plans and cohort networking/peer support. The Company also provides inclusive leadership learning journeys designed to coach and develop its leaders in driving employee and team performance through inclusive behaviors and best practices. 

To help create and sustain an inclusive workforce, the Company sponsors Business Resource Groups (&#8220;BRGs&#8221;), including Asian heritage, Black heritage, Nosotros Latinos, Indigenous Peoples, U.S. Bank women, Spectrum LGBTQ, Proud to Serve: Military and Veterans, European Inclusion, and Disability employee groups, with chapters across the Company. These BRGs enable employees from a wide variety of backgrounds, identities and perspectives to connect in ways that empower them to contribute, innovate and grow. Through these BRGs, employees can come together to discuss topics of interest to them, develop professional skills and build overall employee engagement, helping to create and sustain an inclusive workforce that drives business growth and propels accountability for diversity and inclusion within the Company. 

These programs, practices and policies are part of the Company&#8217;s strategy to have an ethnically and gender diverse employee base. As of December 31, 2022, of the Company&#8217;s employees in the United States, 

&#160;

58% percent were women and 36% percent were people of color. As of December 31, 2022, 33% percent of the Company&#8217;s employees at the executive and senior management level in the United States were women and 18% percent were people of color. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, of the Company&#8217;s 13 directors, 6 were women and 4 were people of color. The diversity percentages noted above do not include employees from the MUB acquisition who joined the Company on December 1, 2022, as the data regarding MUB employees is being verified as part of the acquisition integration process. All diversity information is based on information self-disclosed by the employee or director to the Company. To provide transparency on progress relating to its commitment to seek and promote diverse talent, the Company publicly discloses consolidated EEO-1 data. The Company&#8217;s 2022 EEO-1 data will include the validated MUB data when released. 

Equitable and Competitive Compensation, Health &#160;&#38; Wellness Programs Maintaining competitive compensation and benefits practices is a continued focus for the Company, with periodic peer and benchmarking reviews used to assist with competitive alignment and employee retention. In 2022, the Company made material compensation investments in its workforce, including increasing the minimum base hourly wage from $15 to $20 per hour for U.S. employees and implementing targeted off-cycle compensation increases to certain employee groups globally to improve competitive compensation and address escalating inflationary pressures. More than 50% of the Company&#8217;s employees were positively impacted by these actions in 2022. The Company remains committed to fair pay and continues to prioritize pay equity efforts. To further the Company&#8217;s efforts to provide fair and equitable compensation to its diverse employees, the Company has processes to address any gender and racial pay inequities identified within its workforce. This work starts with fair hiring practices. The Company also has guidelines in place for both internal and external job postings to assist the Company&#8217;s leaders in making fair compensation decisions based on the demands and responsibilities of each role, candidate experience, and pay related to comparable internal positions. The Company conducts periodic reviews of base pay of employee groups across gender and racial categories with the assistance of an independent third-party consultant. Should gender or race-based disparities in pay be identified, the Company adjusts compensation levels to eliminate those disparities. In the 2022 review, on average, employees of the Company in the United States who are women were paid greater than 99 percent of what their male counterparts were paid, and employees of the Company in the United States who are people of color were paid greater than 99 percent of what their white counterparts were paid, taking into account several factors including comparable jobs, experience and location. The 2022 review did not include employees from the MUB acquisition who joined the Company on December 1, 2022. 

The Company also provides its employees with comprehensive benefits programs, including competitive healthcare, retirement, leave, recognition, wellness, disability, life insurance, time-off, flexible work, and educational assistance programs, based on the Company&#8217;s recognition that such benefits are important to attract and retain employees. In 2022 the Company enhanced the parental leave, fertility, and part-time employee benefits to further support its employee base. In addition to its competitive 401(k) matching program, the Company maintains an active cash balance pension program for its U.S. employees, including newly hired employees. 

The Company continues to support flexible work programs with remote, hybrid and in-person work arrangements, providing additional optionality and flexibility for most employees, which helps the Company attract and retain talent. The Company continues to adapt and evolve its flexible work programs as it recognizes the changes to employee and customer priorities as a result of the pandemic and its customers&#8217; changing needs. 

Employee Engagement and Retention As part of its efforts to develop and retain skilled employees, the Company remains focused on monitoring employee engagement. The Company&#8217;s employee listening program allows the Company to collect quantitative and qualitative feedback from employees on an ongoing basis, which then supports and informs the Company on human capital strategies and decisions that impact its employee base. 

As part of its talent strategy, the Company strives to support continuous employee learning and development. The Company provides a number of talent development offerings for employees to improve skills that are critical in the current and future working environment and empowers employees to discover ways to 

&#160;

thrive and grow their careers, which aligns with the Company&#8217;s Employment Value Proposition. For example, the Company&#8217;s learning programs include the Digital Academy and the People Leader Center, which focus on digital skill development and core leadership skill development, respectively. The Company also introduced enhanced cultural sensitivity and customer interaction training in 2022 for its frontline employees that focuses on building skills to serve all our customers with excellence. In addition, every employee is automatically included in the Company&#8217;s Development Network that provides all employees with opportunities to network, learn, develop leadership skills and contribute to the Company and its communities. Succession planning and talent development processes remain a top priority for the Company along with continuous improvements to its training and development programs. During 2022, employees completed over 1.4 million hours of training through the Company&#8217;s enterprise learning programs to better support its professional development, and customer and business needs. 

Human Capital Governance The Company&#8217;s Board of Directors oversees the Company&#8217;s human capital management. The Board&#8217;s Compensation and Human Resources Committee discharges the Board&#8217;s oversight responsibilities relating to the Company&#8217;s compensation programs and employee benefit plans, overseeing the Company&#8217;s human capital strategy and talent management program and employee diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. The Board&#8217;s Public Responsibility Committee also oversees the Company&#8217;s diversity, equity and inclusion strategy. The Company&#8217;s Chief Human Resources Officer regularly reports to the Board&#8217;s Compensation and Human Resources Committee on human capital matters such as human resource practices and programs, including employee benefits and compensation programs. To promote accountability for the Company&#8217;s diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer chairs the Company&#8217;s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee, with the Company&#8217;s Chief Diversity Officer reporting directly to the Chief Executive Officer and serving as a member of its senior management team. 

Competition 

The financial services industry is highly competitive. The Company competes with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, mutual savings banks, finance companies, mortgage banking companies, credit unions, investment companies, credit card companies and a variety of other financial services, advisory and technology companies. The financial services industry continues to undergo rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services, including innovative ways that customers can make payments or manage their accounts, such as through the use of mobile payments, digital wallets or digital currencies. In recent years, competition has increased from institutions not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as domestic banks and bank holding companies, including by financial technology companies, or &#8220;fintechs,&#8221; which may offer bank-like products or services that compete directly with the Company&#8217;s products and services. Competition is based on a number of factors, including, among others, customer service, quality and range of products and services offered, price, reputation, interest rates on loans and deposits, lending limits and customer convenience, including the ability to address customer needs by using technology to provide products and services that customers want to adopt. The Company&#8217;s ability to continue to compete effectively also depends in large part on its ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate existing employees, while managing compensation and other costs. For additional information relating to how the Company attracts and retains employees, see &#8220;Human Capital&#8221; above. 

Information Security 

Information security, including cybersecurity, is a high priority for the Company. Recent highly publicized events have highlighted the importance of cybersecurity, including cyberattacks against financial institutions, governmental agencies and other organizations that resulted in the compromise of personal and/or confidential information, the theft or destruction of corporate information, and demands for ransom payments to release corporate information encrypted by so-called &#8220;ransomware.&#8221; A successful cyberattack, including an attack at a third-party vendor the Company utilizes, could harm the Company&#8217;s reputation and/or impair its ability to provide services to its customers. The Company has expended, and may in the future expend, significant 

&#160;

resources to implement technologies and various response and recovery plans and procedures as part of its information security program. For additional information on cybersecurity risks the Company faces, refer to the section entitled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; on pages 140 to 155 of the 2022 Annual Report. 

Government Policies 

The operations of the Company&#8217;s various businesses are affected by federal and state laws and legislative changes and by policies of various regulatory authorities of the numerous states in which they operate, the United States and foreign governments. These laws, rules and policies include, for example, statutory maximum legal lending rates, domestic monetary policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;), United States fiscal policy, international currency regulations and monetary policies and capital adequacy and liquidity constraints imposed by bank regulatory agencies. 

Supervision and Regulation 

U.S. Bancorp and its subsidiaries are subject to the extensive regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies (&#8220;BHCs&#8221;) and their subsidiaries. This regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the deposit insurance fund (the &#8220;DIF&#8221;) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the &#8220;FDIC&#8221;), consumers, the stability of the financial system in the United States, and the health of the national economy, and not for investors in the Company. 

This section summarizes certain provisions of the principal laws and regulations applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries. The descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described below. 

General As a BHC, the Company is subject to regulation under the BHC Act and to inspection, examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve. USBNA, MUB and their respective subsidiaries are subject to regulation, examination and supervision primarily by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the &#8220;OCC&#8221;) and also by the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#8220;CFPB&#8221;), the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (the &#8220;CFTC&#8221;) in certain areas. 

Supervision and regulation by the responsible regulatory agencies generally include comprehensive annual reviews of all major aspects of the Company&#8217;s, USBNA&#8217;s and MUB&#8217;s business and condition, regular on-site examinations, and imposition of periodic reporting requirements and limitations on investments and certain types of activities. If the applicable regulatory agencies deem the Company to be operating in a manner that is inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices, the agencies can require the entry into informal or formal supervisory agreements, including board resolutions, memoranda of understanding, written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders, pursuant to which the Company would be required to take identified corrective actions to address cited concerns and to refrain from taking certain actions. Supervision and examinations are confidential, and the outcomes of these actions generally are not made public. 

Banking and other financial services statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review by the United States Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies. In addition to laws and regulations, state and federal bank regulatory agencies may issue policy statements, interpretive letters and similar written guidance applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries. Any change in the statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company, including changes in their interpretation or implementation, could have a material effect on its business or organization. 

As a BHC with over $100 billion in total consolidated assets, the Company is subject to the Dodd-Frank Act&#8217;s enhanced prudential standards, as applied to &#8220;Category III&#8221; institutions under the federal banking regulators&#8217; rules that tailor how enhanced prudential standards apply to large U.S. banking organizations (the &#8220;Tailoring Rules&#8221;). The Tailoring Rules also apply certain enhanced prudential standards to our subsidiary depository institutions, USBNA and MUB, as described in more detail below. 

&#160;

In connection with the Company&#8217;s acquisition of MUB, the Company committed (the &#8220;Federal Reserve Commitments&#8221;) to submit to the Federal Reserve quarterly implementation plans for complying with requirements applicable to &#8220;Category II&#8221; institutions ( i.e. , institutions with $700 billion or more in total assets or $75 billion or more in cross-jurisdictional activities). The Company also committed to meet requirements applicable to Category II institutions by the earlier of (i) the date required under the Tailoring Rules; and (ii) December 31, 2024, if the Federal Reserve notifies the Company by January 1, 2024, that the Company must comply with such rules. As a Category III institution, the Company must conduct a company-run stress test every two years, and the Company is subject to reduced Liquidity Coverage Ratio (&#8220;LCR&#8221;) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (&#8220;NSFR&#8221;) requirements that are calibrated at 85 percent of the full requirements. Refer to &#8220;Stress Testing&#8221; and &#8220;Basel III Liquidity Requirements&#8221; below. If the Company becomes subject to requirements applicable to Category II institutions, in addition to the items discussed below, the Company will be required to conduct company-run stress tests on an annual basis and will become subject to the full LCR and NSFR requirements. In addition, as a Category II institution, the Company would be an &#8220;advanced approaches&#8221; banking organization under the Federal Reserve&#8217;s current capital rules, which would, among other things, introduce significant additional complexity in the methodologies used to calculate the Company&#8217;s risk-weighted assets for purposes of determining the Company&#8217;s regulatory capital ratios. 

Supervisory Ratings Federal banking regulators regularly examine the Company and its insured depository institution subsidiaries, USBNA and MUB. Following those exams, the Company (under the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Large Financial Institution Rating System) and USBNA and MUB (under the CAMELS rating system) are assigned supervisory ratings. Disclosure of these ratings to third parties is not allowed without permission of the issuing regulator. A downgrade in these ratings could limit the Company&#8217;s ability to pursue acquisitions or conduct other expansionary activities for a period of time, require new or additional regulatory approvals before engaging in certain other business activities or investments, affect USBNA&#8217;s or MUB&#8217;s deposit insurance assessment rates, and impose additional recordkeeping and corporate governance requirements, as well as generally increase regulatory scrutiny of the Company. 

BHC Activities The Company is a BHC under the BHC Act and has elected to be a financial holding company (&#8220;FHC&#8221;). BHCs that qualify and elect to be treated as FHCs may engage in, and affiliate with financial companies engaging in, a broader range of activities than would otherwise be permitted for a BHC. 

If an FHC or a depository institution controlled by an FHC ceases to be well-capitalized or well-managed, the Federal Reserve may impose corrective capital and managerial requirements on the FHC and may place limitations on its ability to conduct all of the business activities that FHCs are generally permitted to conduct and its ability to make certain acquisitions. See &#8220;Permissible Business Activities&#8221; below. Disclosure of any failure to meet these standards is not allowed without permission of the Federal Reserve. If the failure to meet these standards persists, the FHC may be required to divest its depository institution subsidiaries or cease all activities other than those activities that may be conducted by BHCs that are not FHCs. In addition, if a depository institution controlled by an FHC does not receive a Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) rating of at least &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; at its most recent examination, the Federal Reserve will prohibit the FHC from conducting new business activities that FHCs are generally permitted to conduct and from making certain acquisitions. 

The Federal Reserve also requires BHCs to meet certain applicable capital and management standards. Failure by the Company to meet these standards could limit the Company from engaging in any new activity or acquiring other companies without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. 

Permissible Business Activities As an FHC, the Company may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature. &#8220;Financial in nature&#8221; activities include securities underwriting, dealing and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; merchant banking; and activities that the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the Secretary of the United States Treasury, determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity. &#8220;Complementary activities&#8221; are 

&#160;

activities that the Federal Reserve determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a safety and soundness risk. 

The Company generally is not required to obtain Federal Reserve approval to acquire a company engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature, as long as the Company meets the capital, managerial and CRA requirements to qualify as an FHC. However, the Company is required to receive approval for an acquisition in which the total consolidated assets to be acquired exceed $10 billion. FHCs are also required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve before they may acquire more than five percent of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of an unaffiliated BHC, bank or savings association. In addition, banks must receive approval before they may acquire, merge with, acquire substantially all of the assets of or assume any deposits of a bank or savings association and may be required to receive approval for acquisitions of other companies. 

Interstate Banking A BHC may acquire banks in states other than its home state, subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time (not to exceed five years). Also, such an acquisition is not permitted if the BHC controls, prior to or following the proposed acquisition, more than 10 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide, or, if the acquisition is the BHC&#8217;s initial entry into the state, more than 30 percent of the deposits of insured depository institutions in the state (or any lesser or greater amount set by the state). Banks may merge across state lines to create interstate branches and are permitted to establish new branches in another state to the same extent as banks chartered by that state. 

Regulatory Approval for Acquisitions In determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition, federal bank regulators will consider a number of factors, including the effect of the acquisition on competition, financial condition and future prospects (including current and projected capital ratios and levels); the competence, experience and integrity of management and its record of compliance with laws and regulations; the convenience and needs of the communities to be served (including the acquiring institution&#8217;s record of compliance under the CRA); the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities; and the extent to which the transaction would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the United States banking or financial system. In addition, approval of interstate transactions requires that the acquiror satisfy regulatory standards for well-capitalized and well-managed institutions. 

In July 2021, the current United States presidential administration issued an executive order on competition, which included provisions relating to bank mergers. These provisions encourage the Department of Justice and the federal banking regulators to update guidelines on banking mergers and to provide more scrutiny of bank mergers. The Company is unable to predict what impact the executive order or any guidelines that the Department of Justice and federal banking regulators adopt will have on the timing of or ability to obtain regulatory approvals of future mergers. 

Source of Strength The Company is required to act as a source of strength to USBNA and MUB, and to commit capital and financial resources to support these subsidiaries in circumstances where it might not otherwise do so. Under these requirements, the Federal Reserve may in the future require the Company to provide financial assistance to USBNA or MUB, should either experience financial distress. Capital loans by the Company to USBNA or MUB would be subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other debts of USBNA or MUB, as applicable. 

Cross Guaranty Provisions The cross guaranty provisions in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act require each insured depository institution owned by the same BHC to be financially responsible for the failure or resolution costs of any affiliated insured institution. Generally, the amount of the cross guaranty liability is equal to the estimated loss to the DIF for the resolution of the affiliated institution(s) in default. The FDIC&#8217;s claim under the cross guaranty provision is superior to claims of shareholders of the insured depository institution or its BHC and to most claims arising out of obligations or liabilities owed to affiliates of the institution, but is subordinate to 

&#160;

claims of depositors, secured creditors and holders of subordinated debt (other than affiliates) of the commonly controlled insured depository institution. The FDIC may decline to enforce the cross guaranty provision if it determines that a waiver is in the best interest of the DIF. 

OCC Heightened Standards USBNA and MUB are each subject to the OCC&#8217;s guidelines establishing heightened standards for large national banks, which establish minimum standards for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework for banks. The OCC may take action against institutions that fail to meet these standards. 

Enhanced Prudential Standards Under the Dodd-Frank Act, as modified by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act and the Tailoring Rules, large bank holding companies, such as the Company, are subject to certain enhanced prudential standards based on the banking organization&#8217;s size and certain &#8220;risk-based indicators.&#8221; The prudential standards include enhanced risk-based capital and leverage requirements, enhanced liquidity requirements, enhanced risk management and risk committee requirements, a requirement to submit a resolution plan, single-counterparty credit limits and stress tests. Certain of the enhanced prudential standards applicable to the Company are described below in further detail. 

Dividend Restrictions The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. Typically, the majority of the Company&#8217;s operating funds are received in the form of dividends paid to the Company by USBNA and MUB. Federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by national banks. In general, dividends payable by USBNA, MUB and the Company&#8217;s trust bank subsidiaries, as national banking associations, are limited by rules that compare dividends to net income for periods defined by regulation. 

The OCC, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC also have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise (including the Company, USBNA and MUB) if, in the banking regulator&#8217;s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization. 

In addition, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s final rule implementing the stress capital buffer (&#8220;SCB&#8221;) provides that a BHC must receive prior approval for any dividend, stock repurchase or other capital distribution, other than a capital distribution on a newly issued capital instrument, if the BHC is required to resubmit its capital plan. The rule also provides that a BHC must resubmit its capital plan if, among other things, the BHC determines there has been or will be a material change in the BHC&#8217;s risk profile, financial condition, or corporate structure since the BHC last submitted its capital plan. 

Capital Requirements The Company is subject to certain regulatory risk-based capital and leverage requirements under capital rules adopted by the Federal Reserve, and USBNA and MUB are each subject to substantially similar rules adopted by the OCC. These rules implement the Basel Committee&#8217;s framework for strengthening the regulation, supervision and risk management of banks (&#8220;Basel III&#8221;), as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. These quantitative calculations are minimums, and the Federal Reserve and OCC may determine that a banking organization, based on its size, complexity or risk profile, must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner. 

Under the Tailoring Rules, the Company, USBNA and MUB are each currently subject to &#8220;Category III&#8221; standards, and are &#8220;standardized approach&#8221; banking organizations that are subject to rules that provide for simplified capital requirements relating to the threshold deductions for mortgage servicing assets, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that a banking organization could not realize through net operating loss carry backs, and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions, as well as the inclusion of minority interests in regulatory capital. Growth in total consolidated assets (including assets obtained in acquisitions) or cross-jurisdictional activity (as defined in the Tailoring Rules) or action by the Federal Reserve in connection with the Federal Reserve Commitments could affect the Company&#8217;s continued classification as a &#8220;Category III&#8221; institution, which could result in the Company and its insured depository institution subsidiaries becoming &#8220;advanced approaches&#8221; banking organizations, a requirement to recognize elements of accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital, as well as other more stringent capital, liquidity, and other regulatory requirements. 

&#160;

Under the United States Basel III-based capital rules, the Company is subject to a minimum common equity tier 1 (&#8220;CET1&#8221;) capital ratio (CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets) of 4.5 percent, a minimum tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0 percent and a minimum total capital ratio of 8.0 percent. The Company is also subject to the SCB, which is based on the results of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s supervisory stress tests and the Company&#8217;s planned common stock dividends, and, if deployed by the Federal Reserve, up to a 2.5 percent common equity tier 1 countercyclical capital buffer. These additional requirements must be satisfied entirely with capital that qualifies as CET1. Although the Federal Reserve has not to date raised the countercyclical capital buffer above zero percent, the countercyclical capital buffer could change in the future. The SCB generally is assigned on an annual basis and becomes effective on October 1 of each year, subject to a 2.5 percent floor, and may vary over time. As of December 31, 2022, the SCB applicable to the Company is 2.5 percent. If the Federal Reserve were to raise the countercyclical capital buffer, or if the SCB applicable to the Company were to exceed 2.5 percent, this would also change the effective minimum capital ratios to which the Company is subject. For USBNA, the buffer requirement consists of the static capital conservation buffer equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. 

Banking organizations that fail to meet the effective minimum ratios will be subject to constraints on capital distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, and certain discretionary executive compensation, with the severity of the constraints depending on the extent of the shortfall and &#8220;eligible retained income&#8221; (defined as the greater of (i) net income for the four preceding quarters, net of distributions and associated tax effects not reflected in net income; and (ii) the average of all net income over the preceding four quarters). 

United States banking organizations are also subject to a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0 percent. As a Category III banking organization, the Company is also subject to a minimum Supplementary Leverage Ratio (&#8220;SLR&#8221;) of 3.0 percent that takes into account both on-balance sheet and certain off-balance sheet exposures. At December 31, 2022, the Company exceeded the applicable minimum tier 1 leverage ratio and SLR requirements. 

In December 2017, the Basel Committee finalized a package of revisions to the Basel III framework. The changes are meant to improve the calculation of risk-weighted assets (including by recalibrating risk weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain &#8220;unconditionally cancellable commitments,&#8221; including unused lines of credit) and improve the comparability of capital ratios by (i) enhancing the robustness and risk sensitivity of the standardized approaches for credit risk, credit valuation adjustment (&#8220;CVA&#8221;) risk and operational risk; (ii) constraining the use of the internal model approaches, by placing limits on certain inputs used to calculate capital requirements under the internal ratings-based (&#8220;IRB&#8221;) approach for credit risk and by removing the use of the internal model approaches for CVA risk and for operational risk; (iii) introducing a leverage ratio buffer to further limit the leverage of global systemically important banks; and (iv) replacing the existing Basel II output floor with a more robust risk-sensitive floor based on the Committee&#8217;s revised Basel III standardized approaches. In addition, in January 2019, the Basel Committee published a revised market risk framework that, among other things, revises the standardized approach for market risk. The Basel framework contemplated that these standards generally would be effective on January 1, 2023, with an aggregate output floor phasing in through January 1, 2028. The federal bank regulators have not yet proposed rules implementing these standards, and accordingly, the standards are not yet in effect for United States banking organizations. The effects of these revisions on the Company and USBNA will depend on the manner in which they are implemented by the United States federal banking agencies. 

In 2020, the United States federal banking agencies adopted a rule that allowed banking organizations, including the Company and USBNA, to elect to delay temporarily the estimated effects of adopting the current expected credit loss accounting standard (&#8220;CECL&#8221;) on regulatory capital until January 2022 and subsequently to phase in the effects through January 2025. Through the 2022 stress test cycle, the Federal Reserve has not yet incorporated CECL into the calculation of the allowance for credit losses in supervisory stress tests. For further discussion of CECL, see Notes 1 and 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2022 Annual Report. The Company and USBNA elected to delay and subsequently phase in the regulatory capital impact of CECL in accordance with this rule. 

For additional information regarding the Company&#8217;s regulatory capital, see &#8220;Capital Management&#8221; in the 2022 Annual Report. 

&#160;

Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review As required by the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (&#8220;CCAR&#8221;) rules, the Company submits a capital plan to the Federal Reserve on an annual basis. As part of the CCAR process, the Federal Reserve evaluates the Company&#8217;s plans to make capital distributions, including by repurchasing stock or making dividend payments, under a number of macroeconomic and Company-specific assumptions based on the Company&#8217;s and the Federal Reserve&#8217;s stress tests described under &#8220;Stress Testing&#8221; below. These capital plans consist of a number of mandatory elements, including an assessment of a company&#8217;s sources and uses of capital over a nine-quarter planning horizon assuming both expected and stressful conditions; a detailed description of a company&#8217;s process for assessing capital adequacy; and a demonstration of a company&#8217;s ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio (without taking the buffers into account) under expected and stressful conditions. 

Stress Testing The Federal Reserve&#8217;s CCAR framework and the Dodd-Frank Act stress testing framework require BHCs subject to Category III standards such as the Company to conduct an annual internal stress test in connection with its annual capital plan submission as well as biennial company-run stress tests, and subject such BHCs to annual supervisory stress tests conducted by the Federal Reserve. Among other things, the company-run stress tests employ stress scenarios developed by the Company as well as stress scenarios provided by the Federal Reserve and incorporate the Dodd-Frank Act capital actions (as opposed to the Company&#8217;s planned capital actions), which are intended to normalize capital distributions across large United States bank holding companies. The Federal Reserve conducts CCAR and Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress tests employing stress scenarios and internal supervisory models and incorporates the Company&#8217;s planned capital actions and the Dodd-Frank Act capital actions, respectively, into its stress tests. The Federal Reserve and the Company are currently required to publish the results of the annual supervisory and biennial company-run stress tests, respectively, no later than June 30 of each applicable year. If the Company were to become a &#8220;Category II&#8221; institution for purposes of the Tailoring Rules, whether as a result of growth in total consolidated assets (including assets obtained in acquisitions) or cross-jurisdictional activity (as defined in the Tailoring Rules) or action by the Federal Reserve in connection with the Federal Reserve Commitments, the Company would become subject to annual (rather than biennial) company-run stress tests. 

Under the OCC&#8217;s rules, national banks with assets in excess of $250 billion, including USBNA, are required to submit company-run stress test results to the OCC concurrently with their parent BHC&#8217;s CCAR submission to the Federal Reserve. The stress test is based on the OCC&#8217;s stress scenarios (which are typically the same as the Federal Reserve&#8217;s stress scenarios) and capital actions that are appropriate for the economic conditions assumed in each scenario. 

Basel III Liquidity Requirements As a Category III banking organization, the Company, USBNA and MUB are each subject to a minimum LCR under the Tailoring Rules. The LCR is designed to ensure that BHCs have sufficient high-quality liquid assets to survive a significant liquidity stress event lasting for 30 calendar days. In addition, the Company, USBNA and MUB are subject to the NSFR rule, which is designed to promote stable, longer-term funding of assets and business activities over a one-year time horizon. Under the Tailoring Rules and NSFR rule, the Company, USBNA and MUB as Category III banking organizations with less than $75 billion of weighted short-term wholesale funding, qualify for reduced LCR and NSFR requirements calibrated at 85 percent of the full requirements. If the Company were to become a &#8220;Category II&#8221; institution for purposes of the Tailoring Rules, whether as a result of growth in total consolidated assets (including assets obtained in acquisitions) or cross-jurisdictional activity (as defined in the Tailoring Rules) or action by the Federal Reserve in connection with the Federal Reserve Commitments, the Company would become subject to the full (100 percent) LCR and NSFR requirements, as well as daily (rather than monthly) liquidity reporting requirements. 

Prompt Corrective Action The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (&#8220;FDICIA&#8221;) provides a framework for regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates (including parent holding companies) by federal banking regulators. As part of that framework, the FDICIA requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; with respect to an FDIC-insured depository institution, such as USBNA or MUB, if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards. Supervisory actions by 

&#160;

the appropriate federal banking regulator under the &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; rules generally depend upon an institution&#8217;s classification within five capital categories. An institution that fails to remain well-capitalized becomes subject to a series of restrictions that increase in severity as its capital condition weakens. Such restrictions may include a prohibition on capital distributions, restrictions on asset growth or restrictions on the ability to receive regulatory approval of applications. The FDICIA also provides for enhanced supervisory authority over undercapitalized institutions, including authority for the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution. 

Prompt corrective action regulations apply only to banks and not to BHCs such as the Company. However, the Federal Reserve is authorized to take appropriate action at the BHC level, based on the undercapitalized status of the BHC&#8217;s subsidiary banking institutions. In certain instances, relating to an undercapitalized bank, the BHC would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiary&#8217;s capital restoration plan and could be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill those guarantee commitments. 

Deposit Insurance The DIF provides insurance coverage for certain deposits, up to a standard maximum deposit insurance amount of $250,000 per depositor. Deposits at USBNA and MUB are insured up to the applicable limits. The DIF is funded through assessments on insured depository institutions, including USBNA and MUB, based on the risk each institution poses to the DIF. The FDIC may increase USBNA&#8217;s or MUB&#8217;s insurance premiums based on various factors, including the FDIC&#8217;s assessment of its risk profile. 

In addition, large insured depository institutions, including USBNA, are subject to enhanced deposit account recordkeeping and related information technology system requirements meant to facilitate prompt payment of insured deposits if such an institution were to fail. 

In October 2022, the FDIC finalized a rule to increase the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules for all insured depository institutions by two basis points, beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The increased assessment rate is intended to improve the likelihood that the DIF reserve ratio would reach the required minimum of 1.35 percent by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2028. 

Depositor Preference Under federal law, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of a receiver of the institution for administrative expense and the claims of holders of domestic deposit liabilities have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution, including holders of publicly issued senior or subordinated debt and depositors in non-domestic offices. As a result, those debtholders and depositors would be treated differently from, and could receive, if anything, substantially less than, the depositors in domestic offices of the depository institution. 

Orderly Liquidation Authority Upon the insolvency of a BHC, such as the Company, the FDIC may be appointed as conservator or receiver of the BHC if the Secretary of the Treasury determines (upon the written recommendation of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve and after consultation with the President of the United States) that certain conditions set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act regarding the potential impact on financial stability of a financial company&#8217;s failure have been met. FDIC rules set forth a comprehensive method for the receivership of a covered financial company. Acting as a conservator or receiver, the FDIC would have broad powers to transfer any assets or liabilities of a BHC without the approval of its creditors. 

Resolution Plans The Company is required by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC to submit a periodic plan for the rapid and orderly resolution of the Company and its significant legal entities in the event of future material financial distress or failure. If the Federal Reserve and the FDIC jointly determine that the resolution plan is not credible and such deficiencies are not cured in a timely manner, the regulators may jointly impose on the Company more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on the Company&#8217;s growth, activities or operations. If the Company were to fail to address the deficiencies in its resolution plan when required, it could eventually be required to divest certain assets or operations. As a Category III banking organization, the Company is required to submit resolution plans on a triennial cycle (alternating between 

&#160;

targeted and full submissions). In December 2020, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC released targeted plan guidance and directed large foreign and domestic banks to file resolution plans including core elements of a firm&#8217;s resolution strategy as well as how each firm has integrated changes to and lessons learned from its response to COVID-19 into its resolution planning process. The Company submitted its targeted resolution plan in December 2021 and is scheduled to file its next full resolution plan in July 2024. Under the Federal Reserve Commitments, the Company has committed to the Federal Reserve that it will, within six months of completing the acquisition of MUB, provide the Federal Reserve and the FDIC with an interim update to its resolution plan. 

In September 2022, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC announced the development of new resolution plan guidance for Category II and Category III banking organizations but that agencies will seek and consider public comment prior to finalizing the guidance. The Company expects to be subject to the final guidance. In addition, USBNA and MUB are required to file periodically separate resolution plans with the FDIC that should enable the FDIC, as receiver, to resolve each institution under applicable receivership provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act in a manner that ensures that depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of the institution&#8217;s failure, maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its assets and minimizes the amount of any loss to the institution&#8217;s creditors. In June 2021, the FDIC issued a Statement on Resolution Plans for Insured Depository Institutions (the &#8220;FDIC Statement&#8221;). Among other things, the FDIC Statement established a three-year filing cycle for banks with $100 billion or more in total assets and provided details regarding the content that filers will be expected to prepare. Under this filing cycle, USBNA and MUB each submitted its most recent resolution plan to the FDIC in November 2022. 

In addition, in connection with the approval by the OCC of the merger of MUB into USBNA, USBNA committed (the &#8220;OCC Commitments&#8221;) to the OCC that it would (i) develop a list of business lines and/or portfolios (each an &#8220;object of sale&#8221;) that could be sold quickly in the event of stress; and (ii) prepare a plan, including a timeline, to effectuate such separability, including through the establishment of &#8220;data rooms&#8221; for each object of sale. Within six months of consummation of the merger of MUB into USBNA, USBNA must submit these items to the OCC for a written determination of no supervisory objection. 

Recovery Plans The OCC has established enforceable guidelines for recovery planning by insured national banks with average total consolidated assets of $250 billion or more, including USBNA. The guidelines provide that a covered bank should develop and maintain a recovery plan that is appropriate for its individual risk profile, size, activities, and complexity, including the complexity of its organizational and legal entity structure. The guidelines state that a recovery plan should, among other elements, (i) establish triggers, which are quantitative or qualitative indicators of the risk or existence of severe stress that should always be escalated to management or the board of directors, as appropriate, for purposes of initiating a response; (ii) identify a wide range of credible options that a covered bank could undertake to restore financial and operational strength and viability; and (iii) address escalation procedures, management reports, and communication procedures. USBNA&#8217;s recovery plan was reviewed and approved pursuant to these guidelines in December 2022. 

Transactions with Affiliates There are various legal restrictions on the extent to which the Company and its non-bank subsidiaries may borrow or otherwise engage in certain types of transactions with USBNA, MUB or their respective subsidiaries. Under the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Regulation W, USBNA, MUB and their respective subsidiaries are subject to quantitative and qualitative limits on extensions of credit (including credit exposure arising from repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowing and derivative transactions), purchases of assets, and certain other transactions with the Company or its other non-bank subsidiaries and affiliates. Additionally, transactions between USBNA, MUB or their respective subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Company or its other non-bank subsidiaries and affiliates, on the other hand, are required to be on arm&#8217;s length terms. Transactions between either USBNA or MUB and their affiliates must be consistent with standards of safety and soundness. 

Anti-Money Laundering and Sanctions The Company is subject to several federal laws that are designed to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, and to restrict transactions with persons, companies, or foreign governments sanctioned by United States authorities. This category of laws includes the Bank Secrecy Act (the 

&#160;

&#8220;BSA&#8221;), the Money Laundering Control Act, the USA PATRIOT Act (collectively, &#8220;AML laws&#8221;), and implementing regulations for the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the Trading with the Enemy Act, as administered by the United States Treasury Department&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#8220;sanctions laws&#8221;). 

As implemented by federal banking and securities regulators and the Department of the Treasury, AML laws obligate depository institutions and broker-dealers to verify their customers&#8217; identity, verify the identity of beneficial owners of legal entity customers, conduct customer due diligence, report on suspicious activity, file reports of certain transactions in currency, and conduct enhanced due diligence on certain accounts. Sanctions laws prohibit United States persons and certain foreign affiliates from engaging in any transaction with a restricted person or restricted country. Depository institutions and broker-dealers are required by their respective federal regulators to maintain policies and procedures in order to ensure compliance with the above obligations. Federal regulators regularly examine BSA/Anti-Money Laundering (&#8220;AML&#8221;) and sanctions compliance programs to ensure their adequacy and effectiveness, and the frequency and extent of such examinations and related remedial actions have been increasing. 

In January 2021, the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (&#8220;AMLA&#8221;), which amends the BSA, was enacted. Among other things, the AMLA codified a risk-based approach to anti-money laundering compliance for financial institutions; required the development of standards by the U.S. Department of the Treasury for evaluating technology and internal processes for BSA compliance; and expanded enforcement- and investigation-related authority, including a significant expansion in the available sanctions for certain BSA violations. Many of the statutory provisions in the AMLA will require additional rulemakings, reports and other measures, and the impact of the AMLA will depend on, among other things, rulemaking and implementation guidance. In June 2021, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, issued the priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism policy required under the AMLA. The priorities include corruption, cybercrime, terrorist financing, fraud, transnational crime, drug trafficking, human trafficking and proliferation financing. 

Community Reinvestment Act USBNA and MUB are subject to the provisions of the CRA. Under the terms of the CRA, banks have a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including providing credit to individuals residing in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The OCC assesses USBNA and MUB on their record in meeting the credit needs of the community served by that institution, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. CRA assessments also are considered by the Federal Reserve or OCC when reviewing applications by banking institutions to acquire, merge or consolidate with another banking institution or its holding company, to establish a new branch office that will accept deposits, or to relocate an office. In the case of a BHC applying for approval to acquire a bank or other BHC, the Federal Reserve will assess the CRA records of each subsidiary depository institution of the applicant BHC, and those records may be the basis for denying the application. USBNA received an &#8220;Outstanding&#8221; CRA rating in its most recent examination, covering the period from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2020. MUB received an &#8220;Outstanding&#8221; CRA rating in its most recent examination, covering the period from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2018. 

In May 2022, the OCC, together with the Federal Reserve and FDIC, issued a joint notice of proposed rulemaking to modernize the CRA regulatory framework. The proposed rule is intended, among other things, to adapt to changes in the banking industry, including the expanded role of mobile and online banking, and to tailor performance standards to account for differences in bank size and business models. The proposed rule would adjust CRA evaluations based on bank size and type, with many of the proposed changes applying only to banks with over $2 billion in assets and several applying only to banks with over $10 billion in assets, such as USBNA and MUB. The effects of the proposed CRA rules on USBNA and MUB will depend on the final form of any rulemaking. 

Regulation of Brokerage, Investment Advisory and Insurance Activities The Company conducts a broad range of securities activities, both retail and institutional, in the United States through U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc., PFM Fund Distributors, Inc. and UnionBanc Investment Services LLC (&#8220;broker-dealer entities&#8221;). These 

&#160;

activities are subject to regulations of the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and other authorities, including state regulators. These regulations generally cover licensing of securities personnel, interactions with customers and counterparties, trading operations, customer suitability and communications. Securities regulators impose capital requirements on the Company&#8217;s broker-dealer entities and periodically review their sales practice and financial operations. In addition, the Company&#8217;s broker-dealer entities are members of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which oversees the liquidation of member broker-dealers that close when the broker-dealer is bankrupt or in financial trouble and imposes membership fee assessments and other reporting requirements on the broker-dealer entities. 

The operations of the First American family of funds, the Company&#8217;s proprietary money market fund complex, also are subject to regulation by the SEC, including rules requiring a floating net asset value for institutional prime and tax-free money market funds and permitting the board of directors of the money market funds the ability to limit redemptions during periods of stress (allowing for the use of liquidity fees and redemption gates during such times). In December 2021, the SEC proposed amendments to the rules that govern money market funds. The proposed amendments, if implemented, may affect the operations of the funds, in particular, institutional prime and tax-exempt money market funds. 

The Company&#8217;s operations in the areas of insurance brokerage and reinsurance of credit life insurance are subject to regulation and supervision by various state insurance regulatory authorities, including the licensing of insurance brokers and agents. 

Regulation of Derivatives and the Swaps Marketplace Under the Dodd-Frank Act, USBNA, as a CFTC provisionally-registered swap dealer, is subject to rules regarding the regulation of the swaps marketplace and over-the-counter derivatives, including rules that require swap dealers and major swap participants to register with the CFTC, to meet robust business conduct standards to lower risk and promote market integrity, to meet certain recordkeeping and reporting requirements so that regulators can better monitor the markets, to centrally clear and trade swaps on regulated exchanges or execution facilities, and to be subject to certain capital and margin requirements. 

In addition, the OCC&#8217;s rules concerning swap margin and capital requirements for swap dealers regulated by the OCC mandate the exchange of initial and variation margin for non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps between swap entities regulated by the five agencies and certain counterparties. The amount of margin will vary based on the relative risk of the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap. Other rules generally exempt inter-affiliate transactions from initial margin requirements to the extent a depository institution&#8217;s total exposure to all affiliates is less than 15 percent of its tier 1 capital. 

The Volcker Rule Section 13 of the BHC Act and its implementing regulations, commonly referred to as the &#8220;Volcker Rule,&#8221; prohibit banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading, and prohibit certain interests in, or relationships with, hedge funds or private equity funds. The Volcker Rule applies to the Company, USBNA, MUB and their affiliates, and compliance requirements are tailored based on the size and scope of trading activities. The Company has a Volcker Rule compliance program in place that covers all of its subsidiaries and affiliates, including USBNA and MUB. 

Privacy and Data Protection Federal and state law contains extensive consumer privacy and data protection provisions. The Gramm Leach-Bliley Act (&#8220;GLBA&#8221;) requires financial institutions to periodically disclose their privacy policies and practices relating to sharing nonpublic personal information and enables retail customers to opt out of the sharing of such information with nonaffiliated third parties under certain circumstances. Other federal and state laws and regulations impact the Company&#8217;s ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-marketing purposes, or to contact customers with marketing offers. The GLBA also requires financial institutions to implement a comprehensive information security program. Security and privacy policies and procedures for the protection of personal and confidential information are in effect across all the Company&#8217;s businesses and geographic locations. 

Data privacy and data protection are areas of increasing state legislative focus, and several U.S. states have recently enacted comprehensive consumer privacy laws that impose compliance obligations with respect to personal information. For example, the Company is subject to the California Consumer Protection Act of 2018 

&#160;

and its implementing regulations (collectively, the &#8220;CCPA&#8221;). The CCPA gives consumers several rights with respect to their personal information, including the right to (i) know the information that has been collected about them and whether that information has been sold or shared with others; (ii) request deletion of their personal information (subject to certain exceptions); (iii) opt out of the sale of their personal information; and (iv) not be discriminated against for exercising these rights. The CCPA contains several exemptions to the CCPA&#8217;s requirements, including an exemption for personal information that is subject to the GLBA. The CCPA also provides residents of California (regardless of whether their information is covered under the GLBA exemption) with a limited private right of action, including the right to seek statutory damages, against businesses that fail to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices and the failure results in the unauthorized access and exfiltration, theft, or disclosure of certain types of the California residents&#8217; personal information. In November 2020, voters in the State of California approved the California Privacy Rights Act (&#8220;CPRA&#8221;), a ballot measure that amends and supplements the CCPA by, among other things, expanding certain rights relating to personal information and its use, collection, and disclosure by covered businesses. While the CPRA&#8217;s substantive amendments to the CCPA took effect on January 1, 2023, the process of providing implementing regulations for those amendments is ongoing, with finalized regulations not expected until months after the amendments&#8217; effective date. In addition, similar laws have been adopted by other states where the Company does business, including the Colorado Privacy Act, the Connecticut Act Concerning Personal Data Privacy and Online Monitoring of 2022, the Utah Consumer Privacy Act and the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act. Each of these state laws, however, includes an entity level exemption for &#8220;financial institutions&#8221; like the Company. The Company has made and will make operational adjustments in accordance with the requirements of applicable privacy and data protection laws. The United States Congress has also proposed legislation relating to data privacy and data protection, and the federal government may in the future pass such legislation. In addition, in the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;), privacy law is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation (&#8220;GDPR&#8221;), which is directly binding and applicable in each EU member state. The GDPR contains enhanced compliance obligations and increased penalties for non-compliance compared to the prior law governing data privacy in the EU and is regularly enforced by European regulators. 

Like other lenders, USBNA, MUB and other subsidiaries of the Company use consumer reports in their underwriting activities. Use of such information is regulated under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (&#8220;FCRA&#8221;), and the FCRA also regulates reporting information to consumer reporting agencies, prescreening individuals for credit offers, sharing of consumer reports between affiliates, and using affiliate credit data for marketing purposes. Similar state laws may impose additional requirements on the Company and its subsidiaries. 

The federal banking regulators, as well as the SEC, CFPB, CFTC, and related self-regulatory organizations, regularly issue guidance on cybersecurity that is intended to enhance cyber risk management among financial institutions. A financial institution&#8217;s management is required to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution&#8217;s operations after a cybersecurity incident. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations if the institution or its critical service providers experience a cybersecurity incident. 

In November 2021, the United States federal bank regulatory agencies adopted a rule regarding notification requirements for banking organizations related to significant computer security incidents. Under the final rule, which was effective April 1, 2022, a BHC, such as the Company, and a national bank, such as USBNA or MUB, is required to notify the Federal Reserve or OCC, respectively, within 36 hours of a computer security incident that results in actual harm to the confidentiality, integrity or availability of an information system or the information that the system processes, stores or transmits, which has materially disrupted or degraded, or is reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade, the banking organization&#8217;s ability to deliver services to a material portion of its customer base, jeopardize the viability of key operations of the banking organization, or impact the stability of the financial sector. Similarly, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions in Canada requires Federally Regulated Financial Institutions to report qualifying technology and cybersecurity incidents under the provisions of the August 13, 2021 Technology and Cyber Security Incident Reporting Advisory. 

&#160;

Consumer Protection USBNA&#8217;s and MUB&#8217;s retail banking activities are subject to a variety of federal and state statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers. These laws and regulations require, among other things, disclosures of the cost of credit and terms of deposit accounts, provide substantive consumer rights, prohibit discrimination in credit transactions, regulate the use of credit report information, provide financial privacy protections, prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive practices and subject USBNA and MUB to substantial regulatory oversight. Violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by customers, including actual damages, restitution and attorneys&#8217; fees, and may also result in significant reputational harm. USBNA&#8217;s and MUB&#8217;s regulators may also seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other remedies, including regulatory sanctions and civil money penalties. 

USBNA, MUB and their respective subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the CFPB with respect to federal consumer laws. The CFPB has undertaken numerous rule-making and other initiatives, including launching an initiative to reduce the amounts and types of fees financial institutions may charge, including by recently proposing a rule that would significantly reduce the permissible amount of credit card late fees, issuing informal guidance and taking enforcement actions against certain financial institutions. The CFPB&#8217;s rulemaking, examination and enforcement authority has affected and will continue to affect financial institutions that provide consumer financial products and services, including the Company, USBNA, MUB and the Company&#8217;s other subsidiaries. These regulatory activities may limit the types of financial services and products the Company may offer, which in turn may reduce the Company&#8217;s revenues. 

LIBOR Act In March 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the &#8220;LIBOR Act&#8221;) was enacted. The LIBOR Act provides a uniform approach for replacing LIBOR as a reference interest rate in certain LIBOR-linked contracts for a time when LIBOR is no longer published or is no longer representative. The LIBOR Act covers contracts that either do not include effective fallback provisions, for example, because they have no provisions for a replacement benchmark or provisions based on prior LIBOR values or dealer polls, or permit a party to select a replacement benchmark in its discretion. Under the LIBOR Act, references to the most common tenors of LIBOR in these contracts will be replaced as a matter of law, without the need to be amended by the parties, to instead reference a benchmark interest rate identified in Federal Reserve regulations that is based on the secured overnight funding rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;). In December 2022, the Federal Reserve issued final regulations to implement the LIBOR Act. The Federal Reserve&#8217;s final rule identified benchmark replacements, based on SOFR, for various types of contracts subject to the LIBOR Act. The Company continues to evaluate the effect of the LIBOR Act and its implementing regulations on the Company&#8217;s LIBOR-linked contracts. See the section entitled &#8220;LIBOR Transition&#8221; of the Company&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report for additional information regarding the Company&#8217;s efforts to transition away from LIBOR. 

Executive and Incentive Compensation Guidelines adopted by the federal banking agencies prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as &#8220;excessive&#8221; when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal stockholder. The Federal Reserve has issued comprehensive guidance on incentive compensation policies (the &#8220;Incentive Compensation Guidance&#8221;) intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine safety and soundness organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The Incentive Compensation Guidance is based upon the key principles that a banking organization&#8217;s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization&#8217;s ability to effectively identify and manage risks; (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management; and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization&#8217;s board of directors. The Incentive Compensation Guidance states that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk-management control or governance processes pose a risk to the organization&#8217;s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. 

During 2016, the federal bank regulatory agencies and the SEC proposed revised rules on incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion of total assets. These proposed rules have not been finalized. 

&#160;

In October 2022, the SEC adopted a final rule directing national securities exchanges and associations, including the New York Stock Exchange (the &#8220;NYSE&#8221;), to implement listing standards that require all listed companies to adopt policies mandating the recovery or &#8220;clawback&#8221; of excess incentive-based compensation earned by a current or former executive officer during the three fiscal years preceding a required accounting restatement, including to correct an error that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period. The excess compensation would be based on the amount the executive officer would have received had the incentive-based compensation been determined using the restated financial statements. The final rule requires the exchanges to propose conforming listing standards by February 26, 2023, and requires the standards to become effective no later than November 23, 2023. Each listed issuer, including the Company, would then be required to adopt a clawback policy within 60 days after its exchange&#8217;s listing standard has become effective. 

Other Supervision and Regulation The Company is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), both as administered by the SEC, by virtue of the Company&#8217;s status as a public company. As a listed company on the NYSE, the Company is subject to the rules of the NYSE for listed companies. 

Capital Covenants 

The Company has entered into several transactions involving the issuance of capital securities (&#8220;Capital Securities&#8221;) by certain Delaware statutory trusts formed by the Company (the &#8220;Trusts&#8221;), the issuance by the Company of preferred stock (&#8220;Preferred Stock&#8221;) or the issuance by a subsidiary of USBNA of preferred stock exchangeable for the Company&#8217;s Preferred Stock under certain circumstances (&#8220;Exchangeable Preferred Stock&#8221;). Simultaneously with the closing of certain of those transactions, the Company entered into a replacement capital covenant, as amended from time to time (as amended, each, a &#8220;Replacement Capital Covenant&#8221; and collectively, the &#8220;Replacement Capital Covenants&#8221;) for the benefit of persons that buy, hold or sell a specified series of long-term indebtedness of the Company or USBNA (the &#8220;Covered Debt&#8221;). Each of the Replacement Capital Covenants provides that neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries (including any of the Trusts) will repay, redeem or purchase any of the Preferred Stock, Exchangeable Preferred Stock or the Capital Securities and the securities held by the Trust (the &#8220;Other Securities&#8221;), as applicable, on or before the date specified in the applicable Replacement Capital Covenant, unless the Company has received proceeds from the sale of qualifying securities that (a) have equity-like characteristics that are the same as, or more equity-like than, the applicable characteristics of the Preferred Stock, the Exchangeable Preferred Stock, the Capital Securities or Other Securities, as applicable, at the time of repayment, redemption or purchase, and (b) the Company has obtained the prior approval of the Federal Reserve, if such approval is then required by the Federal Reserve or, in the case of the Exchangeable Preferred Stock, the approval of the OCC. 

The Company will provide a copy of any Replacement Capital Covenant to a holder of the relevant Covered Debt. For copies of any of these documents, holders should write to Investor Relations, U.S. Bancorp, 800 Nicollet Mall, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55402, or call (866) 775-9668.
