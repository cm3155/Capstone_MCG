Management’s Discussion and Analysis
OVERVIEW
Earnings Summary U.S. Bancorp and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) reported net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp of $1.7 billion for the first quarter of
2023, or $1.04 per diluted common share, compared with $1.6 billion, or $0.99 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2022. Return on average assets
and return on average common equity were 1.03 percent and 14.1 percent, respectively, for the first quarter of 2023, compared with 1.09 percent and
12.7 percent, respectively, for the first quarter of 2022. The results for the first quarter of 2023 included the impact of $244 million ($183 million net-of-tax) of
merger and integration-related charges associated with the acquisition of MUFG Union Bank, N.A. (“MUB”), which decreased diluted earnings per common
share by $0.12.
Total net revenue for the first quarter of 2023 was $1.6 billion (28.2 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2022, reflecting a 46.0 percent increase in net
interest income (45.9 percent on a taxable-equivalent basis) and a 4.6 percent increase in noninterest income. The increase in net interest income from the first
quarter of 2022 was due to the impact of rising interest rates on earning assets and the impacts of the MUB acquisition. The increase in noninterest income
reflected higher payment services revenue, trust and investment management fees, and commercial products revenue, partially offset by lower mortgage banking
revenue and losses on securities.
Noninterest expense in the first quarter of 2023 was $1.1 billion (30.1 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2022, reflecting merger and integration
charges and operating expenses related to the MUB acquisition, including core deposit intangible amortization expense, as well as increases in legacy
compensation and employee benefits expense to support business growth.
The provision for credit losses for the first quarter of 2023 of $427 million was $315 million higher than the first quarter of 2022, driven by the
acquisition of MUB, normalizing credit losses and continued economic uncertainty. Net charge-offs in the first quarter of 2023 were $373 million, compared
with $162 million in the first quarter of 2022. Refer to “Corporate Risk Profile” for further information on the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs,
nonperforming assets and other factors considered by the Company in assessing the credit quality of the loan portfolio and establishing the allowance for credit
losses.
Recent Industry Events Disruption in the banking industry in early March of 2023 resulted in significant deposit run-off at certain banking institutions and
reinforced the importance of maintaining a well-diversified business with an appropriate risk profile. The Company’s resilient and diversified deposit base,
ample liquidity levels and strong credit quality, supported by disciplined underwriting standards, are all aspects of the Company’s approach to strong risk
management. Key highlights included:
• From the beginning of the industry disruption on March 8, 2023, through the end of the first quarter, total deposit balances were relatively stable, decreasing
only 0.6 percent.
• Subsequent to March 31, 2023 and through April 30, 2023, total deposit balances decreased approximately $17 billion, of which $10 billion was related to
seasonal corporate trust fluctuations, and $3 billion was related to transitional MUB deposits.
• At March 31, 2023, the Company’s percent of insured deposits to total deposits was approximately 51 percent, with approximately 80 percent of uninsured
deposits comprised of operational wholesale trust and retail deposits, which tend to be more stable as customers are contractually bound or tied to treasury
management services and trust activities provided to corporate and institutional clients.
• At March 31, 2023, the Company’s total available liquidity was approximately $315 billion, representing approximately 126 percent of uninsured deposits.
• Over the last five quarters, and well ahead of the recent banking industry disruption, the Company reduced its investment securities portfolio from
approximately 30 percent to 25 percent of total assets, while increasing cash levels.
MUFG Union Bank Acquisition On December 1, 2022, the Company acquired MUB’s core regional banking franchise from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc.
Pursuant to the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of MUB for a purchase
price consisting of $5.5 billion in cash and approximately 44 million shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company also received additional MUB cash
of $3.5 billion upon completion of the acquisition. The additional cash received is held at the MUB subsidiary and required to be repaid to Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial

Group, Inc. on or prior to the fifth anniversary date of the completion of the purchase. As such, it is recognized as debt at the parent company. The transaction
excluded the purchase of substantially all of MUB’s Global Corporate & Investment Bank (other than certain deposits), certain middle and back-office
functions, and other assets. MUB operates approximately 300 branches in California, Washington and Oregon. The Company’s first quarter of 2023 results
reflect the full benefit of the acquisition into the reported results. As of the date of acquisition, MUB is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and an
affiliate of U.S. Bank National Association (“USBNA”), the Company’s primary banking subsidiary. The Company expects to merge MUB into USBNA in
connection with the conversion of MUB customers and systems to the USBNA platform over Memorial Day weekend in 2023.
STATEMENT OF INCOME ANALYSIS
Net Interest Income Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, was $4.7 billion in the first quarter of 2023, representing an increase of $1.5 billion
(45.9 percent) compared with the first quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily due to the impact of rising interest rates on earning assets and the acquisition
of MUB. Average earning assets were $77.8 billion (14.7 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2022, reflecting increases in loans and interest-bearing deposits
with banks, partially offset by a decrease in investment securities. The net interest margin, on a taxable-equivalent basis, in the first quarter of 2023 was
3.10 percent, compared with 2.44 percent in the first quarter of 2022. The increase in net interest margin from the first quarter of 2022 was primarily due to the
impact of higher rates on earning assets and the acquisition of MUB. Refer to the “Consolidated Daily Average Balance Sheet and Related Yields and Rates”
table for further information on net interest income.
Average total loans in the first quarter of 2023 were $73.8 billion (23.6 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2022. The increase was driven by growth
in the Company’s legacy loan portfolio as well as $52.8 billion in average loan balances from the MUB acquisition. Increases in residential mortgages (50.1
percent), commercial loans (21.7 percent), commercial real estate loans (42.2 percent) and credit card loans (17.1 percent) were partially offset by lower other
retail loans (13.2 percent). The increase in residential mortgages was driven by the impact related to the MUB acquisition, along with on-balance sheet loan
activities and slower refinancing activity. The increase in commercial loans was due to higher utilization driven by working capital needs of corporate
customers, slower payoffs given higher volatility in the capital markets, as well as core growth and the impact related to the MUB acquisition. The increase in
commercial real estate loans was driven by the impact of the MUB acquisition, while the increase in credit cards loans was primarily driven by higher spend
volumes, account growth and lower payment rates. The decrease in other retail loans was driven by lower auto and installment loans and lower retail leasing
balances, partially offset by higher home equity and second mortgages.
Average investment securities in the first quarter of 2023 were $8.6 billion (4.9 percent) lower than the first quarter of 2022, driven by balance sheet
repositioning and liquidity management in connection with the acquisition of MUB. The decrease from the first quarter of 2022 reflected sales of investments
securities, partially offset by the impact of acquired MUB investment securities.
Average total deposits for the first quarter of 2023 were $56.1 billion (12.4 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2022. Average total savings deposits
for the first quarter of 2023 were $43.5 billion (14.4 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2022, driven by the acquisition of MUB and increases in Corporate
and Commercial Banking, and Wealth Management and Investment Services balances, partially offset by a decrease in Consumer and Business Banking
balances. Average time deposits were $10.9 billion (44.1 percent) higher than the prior year, mainly due to the acquisition of MUB and an increase in Consumer
and Business Banking balances. Changes in time deposits are primarily related to those deposits managed as an alternative to other funding sources, based
largely on relative pricing and liquidity characteristics. Average noninterest-bearing deposits were $1.8 billion (1.4 percent) higher than the prior year, driven by
the impact of the MUB acquisition, partially offset by a decrease across all legacy business lines.
Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses was $427 million in the first quarter of 2023, compared with $112 million in the first quarter of 2022.
The increase of $315 million was driven by the acquisition of MUB, normalizing credit losses and continued economic uncertainty. Net charge-offs increased
$211 million in the first quarter of 2023, compared with the first quarter of 2022, reflecting $91 million of charge-offs related to the uncollectible amount of
acquired loans, which were considered purchased credit deteriorated as of the date of the MUB acquisition, as well as higher charge-offs in most loan categories
consistent with normalizing credit conditions. Refer to “Corporate Risk Profile” for further information on the provision for credit losses, net charge- offs,
nonperforming assets and other factors considered by the Company in assessing the credit quality of the loan portfolio and establishing the allowance for credit
losses.

Noninterest Income Noninterest income was $2.5 billion in the first quarter of 2023, representing an increase of $111 million (4.6 percent) compared with the
first quarter of 2022. The increase over the prior year reflected stronger trust and investment management fees, payment services revenue and commercial
products revenue, partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenue and losses on the sale of securities. Trust and investment management fees increased $90
million (18.0 percent) driven by lower money market fee waivers and core business growth, partially offset by unfavorable market conditions. Payment services
revenue increased $77 million (9.0 percent), as card revenue increased $22 million (6.5 percent) driven by higher sales volume and the acquisition of MUB,
corporate payment products revenue increased $31 million (19.6 percent) due to higher business spending across all product groups and merchant processing
services revenue increased $24 million (6.6 percent) driven by higher sales volume and merchant fees. Commercial products revenue increased $68 million
(25.6 percent) driven by higher trading revenue and the acquisition of MUB. Mortgage banking revenue decreased $72 million (36.0 percent) reflecting lower
application volume, given declining refinancing activities experienced in the mortgage industry, lower related gain on sale margins and fewer sales of
performing loans, partially offset by increases in mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) valuations, net of hedging activities.
Noninterest Expense Noninterest expense was $4.6 billion in the first quarter 2023, representing an increase of $1.1 billion (30.1 percent) over the first quarter
of 2022. The increase from the prior year reflected the impact of $244 million of merger and integration charges, as well as operating expenses related to the
MUB acquisition, higher compensation and employee benefits expense, higher other intangibles expense and higher other noninterest expense. Compensation
and employee benefits expense increased $397 million (17.7 percent) primarily due to MUB expense as well as merit increases and hiring to support business
growth and lower capitalized loan costs driven by lower mortgage production, partially offset by lower performance-based incentives. Other intangibles expense
increased $113 million driven by the core deposit intangible created as a result of the MUB acquisition. Other noninterest expense increased $103 million (32.0
percent) due to lower prior year accruals related to future delivery exposures for merchant and airline processing and other liabilities, higher Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance expense driven by an increase in the assessment base and rate, and MUB expense. Although the timing is unknown,
the Company expects that FDIC insurance assessments in future periods may be elevated due to recent failures by other banking institutions.
Income Tax Expense The provision for income taxes was $455 million (an effective rate of 21.1 percent) for the first quarter of 2023, compared with
$397 million (an effective rate of 20.3 percent) for the first quarter of 2022. For further information on income taxes, refer to Note 12 of the Notes to

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS
Loans The Company’s loan portfolio was $387.9 billion at March 31, 2023, compared with $388.2 billion at December 31, 2022, a decrease of $347 million
(0.1 percent). The decrease was driven by lower other retail loans, credit card loans and commercial real estate loans, partially offset by higher commercial loans
and residential mortgages.
Other retail loans decreased $2.0 billion (3.6 percent) at March 31, 2023, compared with December 31, 2022, primarily due to decreases in auto loans,
retail leasing balances, revolving credit balances and installment loans.
Credit card loans decreased $806 million (3.1 percent) at March 31, 2023, compared with December 31, 2022, primarily the result of customers
seasonally paying down balances.
Commercial real estate loans decreased $329 million (0.6 percent) at March 31, 2023, compared with December 31, 2022, due to payoffs exceeding a
reduced level of new originations.
Commercial loans increased $1.6 billion (1.2 percent) at March 31, 2023, compared with December 31, 2022, due to higher utilization driven by working
capital needs of corporate customers and slower payoffs given higher volatility in the capital markets, as well as core growth.
Residential mortgages held in the loan portfolio increased $1.1 billion (1.0 percent) at March 31, 2023, compared with December 31, 2022, due to
stronger on-balance sheet loan activities and slower refinance activity. Residential mortgages originated and placed in the Company’s loan portfolio include
jumbo mortgages and branch-originated first lien home equity loans to borrowers with high credit quality.
The Company generally retains portfolio loans through maturity; however, the Company’s intent may change over time based upon various factors such
as ongoing asset/liability management activities, assessment of product profitability, credit risk, liquidity needs, and capital implications. If the Company’s intent
or ability to hold an existing portfolio loan changes, it is transferred to loans held for sale.
Loans Held for Sale Loans held for sale, consisting primarily of residential mortgages to be sold in the secondary market, were $2.4 billion at March 31, 2023,
compared with $2.2 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase in loans held for sale was principally due to a higher level of mortgage loan closings in the first
quarter of 2023, compared with the fourth quarter of 2022. Almost all of the residential mortgage loans the Company originates or purchases for sale follow
guidelines that allow the loans to be sold into existing, highly liquid secondary markets, in particular in government agency transactions and to governmentsponsored enterprises (“GSEs”).

value equal to or below par.
(d) Weighted-average yields for obligations of state and political subdivisions are presented on a fully-taxable equivalent basis based on a federal income tax rate of 21 percent. Yields on investment securities
are computed based on amortized cost balances, excluding any premiums or discounts recorded related to the transfer of investment securities at fair value from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity.
Investment Securities Investment securities totaled $154.0 billion at March 31, 2023, compared with $161.7 billion at December 31, 2022. The $7.7 billion
(4.8 percent) decrease was primarily due to $9.3 billion of net investment sales and maturities, partially offset by a $1.3 billion favorable change in net
unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale investment securities.
The Company’s available-for-sale investment securities are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in other comprehensive income (loss)
unless a portion of a security’s unrealized loss is related to credit and an allowance for credit losses is necessary. At March 31, 2023, the Company’s net
unrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities were $7.2 billion ($5.4 billion net-of-tax), compared with $8.5 billion ($6.4 billion net-of-tax) at
December 31, 2022. The favorable change in net unrealized gains (losses) was primarily due to increases in the fair value of mortgage-backed, U.S. Treasury
and state and political securities as a result of changes in interest rates. Gross unrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities totaled $7.2 billion at
March 31, 2023, compared with $8.6 billion at December 31, 2022. When evaluating credit losses, the Company considers various factors such as the nature of
the investment security, the credit ratings or financial condition of the issuer, the extent of the unrealized loss, expected cash flows of the underlying collateral,
the existence of any government or agency guarantees, and market conditions. At March 31, 2023, the Company had no plans to sell securities with unrealized
losses, and believed it is more likely than not that it would not be required to sell such securities before recovery of their amortized cost.
Refer to Notes 4 and 15 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on investment securities.
Deposits Total deposits were $505.3 billion at March 31, 2023, compared with $525.0 billion at December 31, 2022. The first quarter of 2023 banking industry
disruption, beginning on March 8, did not meaningfully impact the Company’s overall deposit balances or composition. The Company’s total deposits were
approximately $508 billion on March 8, 2023, compared with $505 billion on March 31, 2023. The Company maintains a diverse and stable funding base that
includes a mix of both consumer and operational wholesale deposits. Consumer deposits account for more than 50 percent of total deposits. A significant portion
of the wholesale and trust deposits are collateralized, contractual or relationship based. At March 31, 2023, approximately 51 percent of deposits were insured
through the FDIC insurance fund and an additional 3 percent of deposits were fully collateralized. Of the uninsured deposits, approximately 80 percent of these
deposits were retail customers or operational in nature, creating greater stability to these deposits. In addition, at March 31, 2023 the Company had total
available liquidity representing 126 percent of uninsured balances.
The $19.6 billion (3.7 percent) decrease in total deposits reflected decreases in noninterest-bearing deposits and total savings deposits, partially offset by
an increase in time deposits. Noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $13.1 billion (9.5 percent) at March 31, 2023, compared with December 31, 2022, primarily
due to lower Corporate and Commercial Banking, Wealth Management and

Table of Contents
Investment Services, and Consumer and Business Banking balances. Savings account balances decreased $6.8 billion (9.4 percent), driven by lower Consumer
and Business Banking balances. Interest checking balances decreased $5.4 billion (4.0 percent), primarily due to lower Wealth Management and Investment
Services, Consumer and Business Banking, and Corporate and Commercial Banking balances. Money market deposit balances increased $1.1 billion
(0.7 percent), primarily due to higher Corporate and Commercial Banking balances, partially offset by lower Wealth Management and Investment Services
balances. Time deposits increased $4.6 billion (13.9 percent) at March 31, 2023, compared with December 31, 2022, driven by higher Consumer and Business
Banking balances, partially offset by lower Corporate and Commercial Banking balances. Changes in time deposits are primarily related to those deposits
managed as an alternative to other funding sources, based largely on relative pricing and liquidity characteristics.
Borrowings The Company utilizes both short-term and long-term borrowings as part of its asset/liability management and funding strategies. Short-term
borrowings, which include federal funds purchased, commercial paper, repurchase agreements, borrowings secured by high-grade assets and other short-term
borrowings, were $56.9 billion at March 31, 2023, compared with $31.2 billion at December 31, 2022. The $25.7 billion (82.2 percent) increase in short-term
borrowings was primarily due to increases in short-term Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances. Long-term debt was $42.0 billion at March 31, 2023,
compared with $39.8 billion at December 31, 2022. The $2.2 billion (5.6 percent) increase was primarily due to $3.7 billion of medium-term note issuances,
partially offset by $1.6 billion of bank note repayments and maturities. Refer to the “Liquidity Risk Management” section for discussion of liquidity
management of the Company.
CORPORATE RISK PROFILE
Overview Managing risks is an essential part of successfully operating a financial services company. The Company’s Board of Directors has approved a risk
management framework which establishes governance and risk management requirements for all risk-taking activities. This framework includes Company and
business line risk appetite statements which set boundaries for the types and amount of risk that may be undertaken in pursuing business objectives and
initiatives. The Board of Directors, primarily through its Risk Management Committee, oversees performance relative to the risk management framework, risk
appetite statements, and other policy requirements.
The Executive Risk Committee (“ERC”), which is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer and includes the Chief Executive Officer and other members of the
executive management team, oversees execution against the risk management framework and risk appetite statements. The ERC focuses on current and
emerging risks, including strategic and reputation risks, by directing timely and comprehensive actions. Senior operating committees have also been established,
each responsible for overseeing a specified category of risk.
Upon closing of the MUB acquisition, the Company’s risk management framework applies to the legal entities acquired from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
Group, Inc., including MUB. Prior to closing, the Company evaluated the frameworks, policies and procedures of the acquired entities as necessary. Updates
were made to align the acquired entities with the Company’s risk appetite and connect the elements of their respective risk governance and reporting into the
Company’s existing risk management framework. Connecting the existing MUB risk governance and reporting framework into the Company’s existing risk
management framework allows separate risk profiles, governance, and reporting for the Company and the acquired entities, during the period from acquisition
through bank merger, while also providing the ability to consolidate reporting for the Company. Upon completing the merger of MUB into USBNA, which is
expected to occur in connection with the conversion of MUB customers and systems to the USBNA platform over Memorial Day weekend in 2023, the MUB
risk governance and reporting framework will no longer be applicable.
The Company’s most prominent risk exposures are credit, interest rate, market, liquidity, operational, compliance, strategic, and reputation. Credit risk is
the risk of loss associated with a change in the credit profile or the failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its contractual obligations. Interest rate risk is
the current or prospective risk to earnings and capital, or market valuations, arising from the impact of changes in interest rates. Market risk arises from
fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and security prices that may result in changes in the values of financial instruments, such as trading and
available-for-sale securities, mortgage loans held for sale (“MLHFS”), MSRs and derivatives that are accounted for on a fair value basis. Liquidity risk is the
risk that financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by the Company’s inability, or perceived inability, to meet its cash flow
obligations in a timely and
U.S. Bancorp 9
Table of Contents
complete manner in either normal or stressed conditions. Operational risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from
inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, people (including human errors or misconduct), or adverse external events, including the risk of loss resulting
from breaches in data security. Operational risk can also include the risk of loss due to failures by third parties with which the Company does business.
Compliance risk is the risk that the Company may suffer legal or regulatory sanctions, financial losses, and reputational damage if it fails to adhere to
compliance requirements and the Company’s compliance policies. Strategic risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from
adverse business decisions, poor implementation of business decisions, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the banking industry and operating environment.
Reputation risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, or franchise or enterprise value arising from negative public opinion. This risk may impair
the Company’s competitiveness by affecting its ability to establish new relationships or services, or continue serving existing relationships. In addition to the
risks identified above, other risk factors exist that may impact the Company. Refer to “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2022, for a detailed discussion of these factors.
The Company’s Board and management-level governance committees are supported by a “three lines of defense” model for establishing effective checks
and balances. The first line of defense, the business lines, manages risks in conformity with established limits and policy requirements. In turn, business line
leaders and their risk officers establish programs to ensure conformity with these limits and policy requirements. The second line of defense, which includes the
Chief Risk Officer’s organization as well as policy and oversight activities of corporate support functions, translates risk appetite and strategy into actionable
risk limits and policies. The second line of defense monitors first line of defense conformity with limits and policies, and provides reporting and escalation of
emerging risks and other concerns to senior management and the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors. The third line of defense, internal
audit, is responsible for providing the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and senior management with independent assessment and assurance regarding
the effectiveness of the Company’s governance, risk management and control processes.
Management regularly provides reports to the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors. The Risk Management Committee discusses with
management the Company’s risk management performance, and provides a summary of key risks to the entire Board of Directors, covering the status of existing
matters, areas of potential future concern and specific information on certain types of loss events. The Risk Management Committee considers quarterly reports
by management assessing the Company’s performance relative to the risk appetite statements and the associated risk limits, including:
• Macroeconomic environment and other qualitative considerations, such as regulatory and compliance changes, litigation developments, geopolitical events,
and technology and cybersecurity;
• Credit measures, including adversely rated and nonperforming loans, leveraged transactions, credit concentrations and lending limits;
• Interest rate and market risk, including market value and net income simulation, and trading-related Value at Risk (“VaR”);
• Liquidity risk, including funding projections under various stressed scenarios;
• Operational and compliance risk, including losses stemming from events such as fraud, processing errors, control breaches, breaches in data security or
adverse business decisions, as well as reporting on technology performance, and various legal and regulatory compliance measures;
• Capital ratios and projections, including regulatory measures and stressed scenarios; and
• Strategic and reputation risk considerations, impacts and responses.
Credit Risk Management The Company’s strategy for credit risk management includes well-defined, centralized credit policies, uniform underwriting criteria,
and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all commercial and consumer credit exposures. The strategy also emphasizes diversification on a
geographic, industry and customer level, regular credit examinations and management reviews of loans exhibiting deterioration of credit quality. In evaluating
its credit risk, the Company considers changes, if any, in underwriting activities, the loan portfolio composition (including product mix and geographic, industry
or customer-specific concentrations), collateral values, trends in loan performance and macroeconomic factors, such as changes in unemployment rates, gross
domestic product levels, inflation, interest rates and consumer bankruptcy filings. The Risk Management Committee oversees the Company’s credit risk
management process.
In addition, credit quality ratings, as defined by the Company, are an important part of the Company’s overall credit risk management and evaluation of its

allowance for credit losses. Loans with a pass rating represent those loans not classified on the Company’s rating scale for problem credits, as minimal credit
risk has been identified. Loans with a special mention or classified rating, including consumer lending and small business loans that are 90 days or more past
due and still accruing, nonaccrual loans and loans in a junior lien position that are current but are behind a first lien position on nonaccrual, encompass all loans
held by the Company that it considers to have a potential or well-defined weakness that may put full collection of contractual cash flows at risk. The Company’s
internal credit quality ratings for consumer loans are primarily based on delinquency and nonperforming status, except for a limited population of larger loans
within those portfolios that are individually evaluated. For this limited population, the determination of the internal credit quality rating may also consider
collateral value and customer cash flows. Refer to Note 5 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s loan
portfolios including internal credit quality ratings. In addition, refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Credit Risk Management” in the Company’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, for a more detailed discussion on credit risk management processes.
The Company manages its credit risk, in part, through diversification of its loan portfolio which is achieved through limit setting by product type criteria,
such as industry, and identification of credit concentrations. The Company categorizes its loan portfolio into two segments, which is the level at which it
develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The Company’s two loan portfolio segments are commercial
lending and consumer lending.
The commercial lending segment includes loans and leases made to small business, middle market, large corporate, commercial real estate, financial
institution, non-profit and public sector customers. Key risk characteristics relevant to commercial lending segment loans include the industry and geography of
the borrower’s business, purpose of the loan, repayment source, borrower’s debt capacity and financial flexibility, loan covenants, and nature of pledged
collateral, if any, as well as macroeconomic factors such as unemployment rates, gross domestic product levels, corporate bond spreads and long-term interest
rates. These risk characteristics, among others, are considered in determining estimates about the likelihood of default by the borrowers and the severity of loss
in the event of default. The Company considers these risk characteristics in assigning internal risk ratings to, or forecasting losses on, these loans, which are the
significant factors in determining the allowance for credit losses for loans in the commercial lending segment.
The consumer lending segment represents loans and leases made to consumer customers, including residential mortgages, credit card loans, and other
retail loans such as revolving consumer lines, auto loans and leases, home equity loans and lines, and student loans, a run-off portfolio. Home equity or second
mortgage loans are junior lien closed-end accounts fully disbursed at origination. These loans typically are fixed rate loans, secured by residential real estate,
with a 10- or 15-year fixed payment amortization schedule. Home equity lines are revolving accounts giving the borrower the ability to draw and repay balances
repeatedly, up to a maximum commitment, and are secured by residential real estate. These include accounts in either a first or junior lien position. Typical terms
on home equity lines in the portfolio are variable rates benchmarked to the prime rate, with a 10-year draw period during which a minimum payment is
equivalent to the monthly interest, followed by a 20-year amortization period, respectively. At March 31, 2023, substantially all of the Company’s home equity
lines were in the draw period. Key risk characteristics relevant to consumer lending segment loans primarily relate to the borrowers’ capacity and willingness to
repay and include unemployment rates, consumer bankruptcy filings and other macroeconomic factors, customer payment history and credit scores, and in some
cases, updated loan-to-value (“LTV”) information reflecting current market conditions on real estate-based loans. These and other risk characteristics are
reflected in forecasts of delinquency levels, bankruptcies and losses which are the primary factors in determining the allowance for credit losses for the
consumer lending segment.
The Company further disaggregates its loan portfolio segments into various classes based on their underlying risk characteristics. The two classes within
the commercial lending segment are commercial loans and commercial real estate loans. The three classes within the consumer lending segment are residential
mortgages, credit card loans and other retail loans.
The Company’s consumer lending segment utilizes several distinct business processes and channels to originate consumer credit, including traditional
branch lending, mobile and on-line banking, indirect lending, alliance partnerships and correspondent banks. Each distinct underwriting and origination activity
manages unique credit risk characteristics and prices its loan production commensurate with the differing risk profiles.

Table of Contents
Residential mortgage originations are generally limited to prime borrowers and are performed through the Company’s branches, loan production offices,
mobile and on-line services, and a wholesale network of originators. The Company may retain residential mortgage loans it originates on its balance sheet or sell
the loans into the secondary market while retaining the servicing rights and customer relationships. Utilizing the secondary markets enables the Company to
effectively reduce its credit and other asset/liability risks. For residential mortgages that are retained in the Company’s portfolio and for home equity and second
mortgages, credit risk is managed by adherence to LTV and borrower credit criteria during the underwriting process.
The Company estimates updated LTV information on its outstanding residential mortgages quarterly, based on a method that combines automated
valuation model updates and relevant home price indices. LTV is the ratio of the loan’s outstanding principal balance to the current estimate of property value.
For home equity and second mortgages, combined loan-to-value (“CLTV”) is the combination of the first mortgage original principal balance and the second
lien outstanding principal balance, relative to the current estimate of property value. Certain loans do not have an LTV or CLTV, primarily due to lack of
availability of relevant automated valuation model and/or home price indices values, or lack of necessary valuation data on acquired loans.

Home equity and second mortgages were $12.7 billion at March 31, 2023, compared with $12.9 billion at December 31, 2022, and included $2.6 billion
of home equity lines in a first lien position and $10.1 billion of home equity and second mortgage loans and lines in a junior lien position. Loans and lines in a
junior lien position at March 31, 2023, included approximately $3.3 billion of loans and lines for which the Company also serviced the related first lien loan, and
approximately $6.8 billion where the Company did not service the related first lien loan. The Company was able to determine the status of the related first liens
using information the Company has as the servicer of the first lien or information reported on customer credit bureau files. The Company also evaluates other
indicators of credit risk for these junior lien loans and lines including delinquency, estimated average CLTV ratios and updated weighted-average credit scores in
making its assessment of credit risk, related loss estimates and determining the allowance for credit losses.

Loan Delinquencies Trends in delinquency ratios are an indicator, among other considerations, of credit risk within the Company’s loan portfolios. The entire
balance of a loan account is considered delinquent if the minimum payment contractually required to be made is not received by the date specified on the billing
statement. Delinquent loans purchased and loans that could be purchased from GNMA mortgage pools under delinquent loan repurchase options, whose
repayments are primarily insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, are excluded from
delinquency statistics.
Accruing loans 90 days or more past due totaled $494 million at March 31, 2023, compared with $491 million at December 31, 2022. Accruing loans 90
days or more past due are not included in nonperforming assets and continue to accrue interest because they are adequately secured by collateral, are in the
process of collection and are reasonably expected to result in repayment or restoration to current status, or are managed in homogeneous portfolios with
specified charge-off timeframes adhering to regulatory guidelines. The ratio of accruing loans 90 days or more past due to total loans was 0.13 percent at March
31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

(b) Includes revolving credit, installment and automobile loans.
Modified Loans In certain circumstances, the Company may modify the terms of a loan to maximize the collection of amounts due when a borrower is
experiencing financial difficulties or is expected to experience difficulties in the near-term. In most cases the modification is either a concessionary reduction in
interest rate, extension of the maturity date or reduction in the principal balance that would otherwise not be considered.
Modified loans accrue interest if the borrower complies with the revised terms and conditions and has demonstrated repayment performance at a level
commensurate with the modified terms over several payment cycles, which is generally six months or greater.
The Company continues to work with customers to modify loans for borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties. Many of the Company’s loan
modifications are determined on a case-by-case basis in connection with ongoing loan collection processes. The modifications vary within each of the
Company’s loan classes. Commercial lending segment modifications generally include extensions of the maturity date and may be accompanied by an increase
or decrease to the interest rate. The Company may also work with the borrower to make other changes to the loan to mitigate losses, such as obtaining additional
collateral and/or guarantees to support the loan.
The Company has also implemented certain residential mortgage loan modification programs. The Company modifies residential mortgage loans under
Federal Housing Administration, United States Department of Veterans Affairs, and its own internal programs. Under these programs, the Company offers
qualifying homeowners the opportunity to permanently modify their loan and achieve more affordable monthly payments. These modifications may include
adjustments to interest rates, conversion of adjustable rates to fixed rates, extensions of maturity dates or deferrals of payments, capitalization of accrued interest
and/or outstanding advances, or in limited situations, partial forgiveness of loan principal. In most instances, participation in residential mortgage loan
modification programs requires the customer to complete a short-term trial period. A permanent loan modification is contingent on the customer successfully
completing the trial period arrangement, and the loan documents are not modified until that time.
Credit card and other retail loan modifications are generally part of distinct modification programs providing customers modification solutions over a
14 U.S. Bancorp
Table of Contents
specified time period, generally up to 60 months.
The Company also makes short-term modifications, in limited circumstances, to assist borrowers experiencing temporary hardships, including previously
offering payment relief to borrowers that experienced financial hardship resulting directly from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Short-term consumer
lending modification programs include payment reductions, deferrals of up to three past due payments, and the ability to return to current status if the borrower
makes required payments. The Company may also make short-term modifications to commercial lending loans, with the most common modification being an
extension of the maturity date of three months or less. Such extensions generally are used when the maturity date is imminent and the borrower is experiencing
some level of financial stress, but the Company believes the borrower will pay all contractual amounts owed.
Nonperforming Assets The level of nonperforming assets represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses. Nonperforming assets include
nonaccrual loans, modified loans not performing in accordance with modified terms and not accruing interest, modified loans that have not met the performance
period required to return to accrual status, other real estate owned (“OREO”) and other nonperforming assets owned by the Company. Interest payments
collected from assets on nonaccrual status are generally applied against the principal balance and not recorded as income. However, interest income may be
recognized for interest payments if the remaining carrying amount of the loan is believed to be collectible.
At March 31, 2023, total nonperforming assets were $1.2 billion, compared to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2022. The $165 million (16.2 percent)
increase in nonperforming assets was primarily due to higher nonperforming commercial real estate loans resulting from an internal review of the acquired
MUB loan portfolio, completed once closing was achieved and access to loan documents and customer files was available. The ratio of total nonperforming
assets to total loans and other real estate was 0.30 percent at March 31, 2023, compared with 0.26 percent at December 31, 2022.
OREO was $23 million at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and was related to foreclosed properties that previously secured loan balances. These
balances exclude foreclosed GNMA loans whose repayments are primarily insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the United States
Department of Veterans Affairs.

Analysis of Loan Net Charge-offs Total loan net charge-offs were $373 million for the first quarter of 2023, compared with $162 million for the first quarter of
2022. The $211 million increase reflected $91 million of charge-offs related to the uncollectible amount of acquired loans, which were considered purchased
credit deteriorated as of the date of the MUB acquisition, as well as higher charge-offs in most loan categories consistent with normalizing credit conditions. The
ratio of total loan net charge-offs to average loans outstanding on an annualized basis for the first quarter of 2023 was 0.39 percent (0.30 percent excluding the
impact of the MUB acquisition-related charge-offs), compared with 0.21 percent for the first quarter of 2022.
Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses is established for current expected credit losses on the Company’s
loan and lease portfolio, including unfunded credit commitments. The allowance considers expected losses for the remaining lives of the applicable assets,
inclusive of expected recoveries. The allowance for credit losses is increased through provisions charged to earnings and reduced by net charge-offs.
Management evaluates the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis. Multiple economic scenarios are considered over a
three-year reasonable and supportable forecast period, which includes increasing consideration of historical loss experience over years two and three. These
economic scenarios are constructed with interrelated projections of multiple economic variables, and loss estimates are produced that consider the historical
correlation of those economic variables with credit losses. After the forecast period, the Company fully reverts to long-term historical loss experience, adjusted
for prepayments and characteristics of the current loan and lease portfolio, to estimate losses over the remaining life of the portfolio. The economic scenarios are
updated at least quarterly and are designed to provide a range of reasonable estimates from better to worse than current expectations. Scenarios are weighted
based on the Company’s expectation of economic conditions for the foreseeable future and reflect significant judgment and consideration of economic forecast
uncertainty. Final loss estimates also consider factors affecting credit losses not reflected in the scenarios, due to the unique aspects of current conditions and
expectations. These factors may include, but are not limited to, loan servicing practices, regulatory guidance, and/or fiscal and monetary policy actions.
Because business processes and credit risks associated with unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as for loans, the Company utilizes
similar processes to estimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments, which is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Both the
allowance for loan losses and the liability for unfunded credit commitments are included in the Company’s analysis of credit losses and reported reserve ratios.
The allowance recorded for credit losses utilizes forward-looking expected loss models to consider a variety of factors affecting lifetime credit losses.
These factors include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic variables such as unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels, inflation,
interest rates, and corporate bond spreads, as well as loan and borrower characteristics, such as internal risk ratings on commercial loans and consumer credit
scores,
U.S. Bancorp 17
Table of Contents
delinquency status, collateral type and available valuation information, consideration of end-of-term losses on lease residuals, and the remaining term of the
loan, adjusted for expected prepayments. For each loan portfolio, including those loans modified under various loan modification programs, model estimates are
adjusted as necessary to consider any relevant changes in portfolio composition, lending policies, underwriting standards, risk management practices, economic
conditions or other factors that may affect the accuracy of the model. Expected credit loss estimates also include consideration of expected cash recoveries on
loans previously charged-off or expected recoveries on collateral-dependent loans where recovery is expected through sale of the collateral at fair value less
selling costs. Where loans do not exhibit similar risk characteristics, an individual analysis is performed to consider expected credit losses.
The allowance recorded for individually evaluated loans greater than $5 million in the commercial lending segment is based on an analysis utilizing
expected cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate, the observable market price of the loan, or the fair value of the collateral, less selling
costs, for collateral-dependent loans as appropriate.
When evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses for any loans and lines in a junior lien position, the Company considers the
delinquency and modification status of the first lien. At March 31, 2023, the Company serviced the first lien on 33 percent of the home equity loans and lines in
a junior lien position. The Company also considers the status of first lien mortgage accounts reported on customer credit bureau files when the first lien is not
serviced by the Company. Regardless of whether the Company services the first lien, an assessment is made of economic conditions, problem loans, recent loss
experience and other factors in determining the allowance for credit losses. Based on the available information, the Company estimated $178 million or
1.4 percent of its total home equity portfolio at March 31, 2023, represented non-delinquent junior liens where the first lien was delinquent or modified.
When a loan portfolio is purchased, the acquired loans are divided into those considered purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration
(“PCD”) and those not considered PCD. An allowance is established for each population and considers product mix, risk characteristics of the portfolio and
delinquency status and refreshed LTV ratios when possible. PCD loans also consider whether the loan has experienced a charge-off, bankruptcy or significant
deterioration since origination. The allowance established for purchased loans not considered PCD is recognized through provision expense upon acquisition,
whereas the allowance established for loans considered PCD at acquisition is offset by an increase in the basis of the acquired loans. Any subsequent increases
and decreases in the allowance related to purchased loans, regardless of PCD status, are recognized through provision expense, with charge-offs charged to the
allowance. The Company had a total unpaid principal balance of $4.8 billion of PCD loans, primarily related to the MUB acquisition, included in its loan
portfolio at March 31, 2023.
The Company’s methodology for determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses also considers the imprecision inherent in the methodologies
used and allocated to the various loan portfolios. As a result, amounts determined under the methodologies described above are adjusted by management to
consider the potential impact of other qualitative factors not captured in quantitative model adjustments which include, but are not limited to, the following:
model imprecision, imprecision in economic scenario assumptions, and emerging risks related to either changes in the economic environment that are affecting
specific portfolios, or changes in portfolio concentrations over time that may affect model performance. The consideration of these items results in adjustments
to allowance amounts included in the Company’s allowance for credit losses for each loan portfolio.
Although the Company determined the amount of each element of the allowance separately and considers this process to be an important credit
management tool, the entire allowance for credit losses is available for the entire loan portfolio. The actual amount of losses can vary significantly from the
estimated amounts.
At March 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses was $7.5 billion (1.94 percent of period-end loans), compared with an allowance of $7.4 billion
(1.91 percent of period-end loans) at December 31, 2022. The allowance for credit losses at March 31, 2023 included a $62 million decrease due to a change in
accounting principle related to discontinuing the separate recognition and measurement of troubled debt restructurings. The increase in the allowance for credit
losses at March 31, 2023, compared with December 31, 2022, was primarily driven by increasing economic uncertainty and normalizing credit losses as well as
adjustments made to the purchase accounting estimate for PCD loans. Economic uncertainty and recession risk have been increasing due to rising interest rates,
inflationary concerns, market volatility and pressure on corporate earnings related to these factors. In addition to these broad economic factors, expected loss
estimates consider various factors including customer specific information

impacting changes in risk ratings, projected delinquencies and the impact of economic deterioration on selected borrowers’ liquidity and ability to repay.
The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 660 percent at March 31, 2023, compared with 762 percent at December 31, 2022.
The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to annualized loan net charge-offs was 497 percent at March 31, 2023, compared with 697 percent of full year
2022 net charge- offs at December 31, 2022.
Economic conditions considered in estimating the allowance for credit losses at March 31, 2023 included changes in projected gross domestic product and
unemployment levels. These factors are evaluated through a combination of quantitative calculations using multiple economic scenarios and additional
qualitative assessments that consider the high degree of economic uncertainty in the current environment. The projected unemployment rates for 2023
considered in the estimate range from 3.0 percent to 7.5 percent.
The following table summarizes the baseline forecast for key economic variables the Company used in its estimate of the allowance for credit losses at
March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022:

The allowance for credit losses related to commercial lending segment loans increased $51 million during the first quarter of 2023, reflecting the impact
of increasing economic uncertainty, normalizing credit conditions and select commercial real estate loan deterioration.
The allowance for credit losses related to consumer lending segment loans increased $68 million during the first quarter of 2023, due to the impact of
economic uncertainty, normalizing credit performance and the effects of higher interest rates on the life of the residential mortgage portfolios, partially offset by
a decrease related to a change in accounting principle.

Residual Value Risk Management The Company manages its risk to changes in the residual value of leased vehicles, office and business equipment, and other
assets through disciplined residual valuation at the inception of a lease, diversification of its leased assets, regular residual asset valuation reviews and
monitoring of residual value gains or losses upon the disposition of assets. As of March 31, 2023, no significant change in the amount of residual values or
concentration of the portfolios had occurred since December 31, 2022. Refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Residual Value Risk Management”
in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, for further discussion on residual value risk management.
Operational Risk Management The Company operates in many different businesses in diverse markets and relies on the ability of its employees and systems to
process a high number of transactions. Operational risk is inherent in all business activities, and the management of this risk is important to the achievement of
the Company’s objectives. Business lines have direct and primary responsibility and accountability for identifying, controlling, and monitoring operational risks
embedded in their business activities, including those additional or increased risks created by economic and financial disruptions. The Company maintains a
system of controls with the objective of providing proper transaction authorization and execution, proper system operations, proper oversight of third parties
with whom it does business, safeguarding of assets from misuse or theft, and ensuring the reliability and security of financial and other data. Refer to
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Operational Risk Management” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2022, for further discussion on operational risk management.
Compliance Risk Management The Company may suffer legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, or damage to its reputation through failure to
comply with laws, regulations, rules, standards of good practice, and codes of conduct, including those related to compliance with Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money
laundering requirements, sanctions compliance requirements as administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, consumer protection and other
requirements. The Company has controls and processes in place for the assessment, identification, monitoring, management and reporting of compliance risks
and issues, including those created or increased by economic and financial disruptions. Refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Compliance Risk
Management” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, for further discussion on compliance risk management.
Interest Rate Risk Management In the banking industry, changes in interest rates are a significant risk that can impact earnings and the safety and soundness of
an entity. The Company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates through asset and liability management activities within guidelines established by its
Asset Liability Management Committee (“ALCO”) and approved by the Board of Directors. The ALCO has the responsibility for approving and overseeing
compliance with the ALCO management policies, including interest rate risk exposure. One way the Company measures and analyzes its interest rate risk is
through net interest income simulation analysis.
Simulation analysis incorporates substantially all of the Company’s assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, together with forecasted
changes in the balance sheet and assumptions that reflect the current interest rate environment. Through this simulation, management estimates the impact on net
interest income of various interest rate changes that differ in the direction, amount and speed of change over time, as well as the shape of the yield curve. This
simulation includes assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to be affected by changes in loan and deposit growth. Assumptions are made to project
interest rates for new loans and deposits based on historical analysis, management’s outlook and re-pricing strategies. These assumptions are reviewed and
validated on a periodic basis with sensitivity analysis being provided for key variables of the simulation. The results are reviewed monthly by the ALCO and are
used to guide asset/liability management strategies.
The Company manages its interest rate risk position by holding assets with desired interest rate risk characteristics on its balance sheet, implementing
certain pricing strategies for loans and deposits and selecting derivatives and various funding and investment portfolio strategies. The Company also manages
interest rate sensitivity by utilizing market value of equity modeling, which measures the degree to which the market values of the Company’s assets and
liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments will change given a change in interest rates. Management measures the impact of changes in market values due to
interest rates under a number of scenarios, including immediate and sustained parallel shifts, and flattening or steepening of the yield curve.
The Company continues to actively monitor markets and proactively manage its balance sheet and heightened its focus on its interest rate risk
management governance process during the first quarter of 2023 banking industry disruption. Over the last five quarters, in advance of the recent industry
disruption and in connection with the preparation and completion of the MUB acquisition, the Company reduced its investment securities portfolio from

hedges on available-for-sale investment securities in response to economic uncertainty, industry dynamics, rising interest rates and increased market volatility.
Table 9 summarizes the projected impact to net interest income over the next 12 months of various potential interest rate changes. The sensitivity of the
projected impact to net interest income over the next 12 months is dependent on balance sheet growth, product mix, deposit behavior, pricing and funding
decisions. While the Company utilizes models and assumptions based on historical information and expected behaviors, actual outcomes could vary
significantly. Net interest income sensitivities reflect the impact of current market expectations for interest rates, driving an increase in baseline projected net
interest income. As market expectations are reflected in projected results, incremental interest rate sensitivity declines on a percentage basis.
Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and Other Risks To manage the sensitivity of earnings and capital to interest rate, prepayment, credit, price and
foreign currency fluctuations (asset and liability management positions), the Company enters into derivative transactions. The Company uses derivatives for
asset and liability management purposes primarily in the following ways:
• To convert fixed-rate debt and available-for-sale investment securities from fixed-rate payments to floating-rate payments;
• To convert floating-rate loans and debt from floating-rate payments to fixed-rate payments;
• To mitigate changes in value of the Company’s unfunded mortgage loan commitments, funded MLHFS and MSRs;
• To mitigate remeasurement volatility of foreign currency denominated balances; and
• To mitigate the volatility of the Company’s net investment in foreign operations driven by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
In addition, the Company enters into interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts to support the business requirements of its customers
(customer-related positions). The Company minimizes the market and liquidity risks of customer-related positions by either entering into similar offsetting
positions with broker-dealers, or on a portfolio basis by entering into other derivative or non-derivative financial instruments that partially or fully offset the
exposure from these customer-related positions. The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are either exchange-traded, centrally cleared through
clearinghouses or over-the-counter. The Company does not utilize derivatives for speculative purposes.
The Company does not designate all of the derivatives that it enters into for risk management purposes as accounting hedges because of the inefficiency
of applying the accounting requirements and may instead elect fair value accounting for the related hedged items. In particular, the Company enters into interest
rate swaps, swaptions, forward commitments to buy to-be-announced securities (“TBAs”), U.S. Treasury and Eurodollar futures and options on U.S. Treasury
futures to mitigate fluctuations in the value of its MSRs, but does not designate those derivatives as accounting hedges. Additionally, the Company uses forward
commitments to sell TBAs and other commitments to sell residential mortgage loans at specified prices to economically hedge the interest rate risk in its
residential mortgage loan production activities. The forward commitments to sell and the unfunded mortgage loan commitments on loans intended to be sold are
considered derivatives under the accounting guidance related to accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities. The Company has elected the fair
value option for the MLHFS.
Derivatives are subject to credit risk associated with counterparties to the contracts. Credit risk associated with derivatives is measured by the Company
based on the probability of counterparty default. The Company manages the credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various
counterparties, by entering into master netting arrangements, and, where possible, by requiring collateral arrangements. The Company may also transfer
counterparty credit risk related to interest rate swaps to third parties through the use of risk participation agreements. In addition, certain interest rate swaps,
interest rate forwards and credit contracts are required to be centrally cleared through clearinghouses to further mitigate counterparty credit risk. The Company
may mitigate credit risk on loans or lending portfolios through the use of credit contracts.

LIBOR Transition In July 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) announced that it would no longer require banks to submit rates
for the London InterBank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) after 2021. In March 2021, the FCA and the administrator of LIBOR announced that, with respect to the
most commonly used tenors of United States Dollar LIBOR, LIBOR will no longer be published on a representative basis after June 30, 2023. The publication
of all other tenors of United States Dollar LIBOR, as well as all non-United States Dollar LIBOR tenors, ceased to be provided or ceased to be representative
after December 31, 2021. The Company holds financial instruments impacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR, including certain loans, investment securities,
derivatives, borrowings and other financial instruments that use LIBOR as the benchmark rate. The Company also provides various services to customers in its
capacities as trustee, servicer, and asset manager, which involve financial instruments that will be similarly impacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR.
In order to facilitate the transition process, the Company has instituted a LIBOR Transition Office and commenced an enterprise-wide project to
(1) identify, assess, monitor and mitigate risks associated with the expected discontinuance or unavailability of LIBOR, (2) actively engage with industry
working groups and regulators, (3) develop and implement training and education materials with respect to LIBOR and its discontinuance for the Company and
for customers, (4) achieve operational readiness for the use of alternative reference rates (“ARRs”) in new financial instruments and transition existing LIBOR
financial instruments to ARRs, (5) develop and implement customer notification programs across the Company and engage impacted customers to remediate and
transition impacted instruments, and (6) develop reporting on remediation of LIBOR instruments across the Company for both internal and external
stakeholders. The Company has also invested in updating its systems, models, procedures and internal infrastructure as part of the transition program.
The Company transitioned its financial instruments associated to LIBOR currencies and tenors that ceased or became nonrepresentative on December 31,
2021, to ARRs, with limited exceptions. Additionally, in alignment with guidance from United States banking agencies and the FCA, the Company has ceased
the use of LIBOR as a reference rate in new contracts, with limited exceptions, and continues to increase the usage of ARRs such as the Secured Overnight
Financing Rate (“SOFR”). The Company also anticipates that additional financial instruments associated with the remaining United States Dollar LIBOR tenors
will require transition to a new reference rate by June 30, 2023. The Company has been undergoing an enterprise-wide effort to proactively reprice LIBOR loans
and derivatives that mature after June 30, 2023, with customers to an ARR. The Company has also adopted industry best practice guidelines for fallback
language for new transactions, converted its cleared interest rate swaps discounting to SOFR discounting, and distributed communications related to the
transition to certain impacted parties, both inside and outside the Company.
The Company’s MUB acquisition impacts the execution of the Company’s LIBOR transition strategies and execution plans. The Company is currently
assessing MUB’s LIBOR transition program, remediation strategies, and preparedness to execute on remediation strategies. In certain instances, the Company
and MUB have different remediation strategies. As a result, the Company is updating its LIBOR transition plans to ensure that the Company can execute
remediation plans across all products and business units, including with respect to MUB.
The Company is currently assessing the applicability and scope of the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the “LIBOR Act”), which was enacted on
March 15, 2022, and the Regulations Implementing the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (Regulation ZZ) (the “Final Rules”), which were implemented on
December 16, 2022. The LIBOR Act and Final Rules establish a process for replacing LIBOR in existing LIBOR contracts that do not provide for the use of a
clearly defined or practicable replacement benchmark rate by providing that a benchmark replacement identified by the Federal Reserve Board that is based on
SOFR will replace LIBOR as the benchmark for those contracts as a matter of law, without the need to be amended by the parties. The Company is currently
assessing its outstanding LIBOR portfolio to determine the eligibility of certain financial instruments for the LIBOR Act and will incorporate the LIBOR Act as
a remediation strategy where prudent. Refer to “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, for further
discussion on potential risks that could adversely affect the Company’s financial results as a result of the LIBOR transition.
Market Risk Management In addition to interest rate risk, the Company is exposed to other forms of market risk, principally related to trading activities which
support customers’strategies to manage their own foreign currency, interest rate risk and funding activities. For
U.S. Bancorp 23
Table of Contents
purposes of its internal capital adequacy assessment process, the Company considers risk arising from its trading activities, as well as the remeasurement
volatility of foreign currency denominated balances included on its Consolidated Balance Sheet (collectively, “Covered Positions”), employing methodologies
consistent with the requirements of regulatory rules for market risk. The Company’s Market Risk Committee (“MRC”), within the framework of the ALCO,
oversees market risk management. The MRC monitors and reviews the Company’s Covered Positions and establishes policies for market risk management,
including exposure limits for each portfolio. The Company uses a VaR approach to measure general market risk. Theoretically, VaR represents the statistical risk
of loss the Company has to adverse market movements over a one-day time horizon. The Company uses the Historical Simulation method to calculate VaR for
its Covered Positions measured at the ninety-ninth percentile using a one-year look-back period for distributions derived from past market data. The market
factors used in the calculations include those pertinent to market risks inherent in the underlying trading portfolios, principally those that affect the Company’s
corporate bond trading business, foreign currency transaction business, client derivatives business, loan trading business and municipal securities business, as
well as those inherent in the Company’s foreign denominated balances and the derivatives used to mitigate the related measurement volatility. On average, the
Company expects the one-day VaR to be exceeded by actual losses two to three times per year related to these positions. The Company monitors the accuracy of
internal VaR models and modeling processes by back-testing model performance, regularly updating the historical data used by the VaR models and regular
model validations to assess the accuracy of the models’ input, processing, and reporting components. All models are required to be independently reviewed and
approved prior to being placed in use. If the Company were to experience market losses in excess of the estimated VaR more often than expected, the VaR
models and associated assumptions would be analyzed and adjusted. VaR amounts reflect MUB beginning December 1, 2022, the day the acquisition transaction
closed.
The average, high, low and period-end one-day VaR amounts for the Company’s Covered Positions were as follows:
Three Months Ended March 31
(Dollars in Millions) 2023 2022
Average $ 5 $ 2
High 6 2
Low 4 1
Period-end 5 2
The Company did not experience any actual losses for its combined Covered Positions that exceeded VaR during the three months ended March 31, 2023
and 2022. The Company stress tests its market risk measurements to provide management with perspectives on market events that may not be captured by its
VaR models, including worst case historical market movement combinations that have not necessarily occurred on the same date.
The Company calculates Stressed VaR using the same underlying methodology and model as VaR, except that a historical continuous one-year look-back
period is utilized that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate to the Company’s Covered Positions. The period selected by the Company
includes the significant market volatility of the last four months of 2008.
The average, high, low and period-end one-day Stressed VaR amounts for the Company’s Covered Positions were as follows:

Low 10 6
Period-end 14 7
Valuations of positions in client derivatives and foreign currency activities are based on discounted cash flow or other valuation techniques using marketbased assumptions. These valuations are compared to third-party quotes or other market prices to determine if there are significant variances. Significant
variances are approved by senior management in the Company’s corporate functions. Valuation of positions in the corporate bond trading, loan trading and
municipal securities businesses are based on trader marks. These trader marks are evaluated against third-party prices, with significant variances approved by
senior management in the Company’s corporate functions.
The Company also measures the market risk of its hedging activities related to residential MLHFS and MSRs using the Historical Simulation method. The
VaRs are measured at the ninety-ninth percentile and employ factors pertinent to the market risks inherent in the

Liquidity Risk Management The Company’s liquidity risk management process is designed to identify, measure, and manage the Company’s funding and
liquidity risk to meet its daily funding needs and to address expected and unexpected changes in its funding requirements. The Company engages in various
activities to manage its liquidity risk. These activities include diversifying its funding sources, stress testing, and holding readily-marketable assets which can be
used as a source of liquidity if needed. In addition, the Company’s profitable operations, sound credit quality and strong credit ratings and capital position have
enabled it to develop a large and reliable base of core deposit funding within its market areas and in domestic and global capital markets.
The Company’s Board of Directors approves the Company’s liquidity policy. The Risk Management Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors
oversees the Company’s liquidity risk management process and approves a contingency funding plan. The ALCO reviews the Company’s liquidity policy and
limits, and regularly assesses the Company’s ability to meet funding requirements arising from adverse company-specific or market events.
The Company regularly projects its funding needs under various stress scenarios and maintains a contingency funding plan consistent with the Company’s
access to diversified sources of contingent funding. The Company maintains a substantial level of total available liquidity in the form of on-balance sheet and
off-balance sheet funding sources. These liquidity sources include cash at the Federal Reserve Bank and certain European central banks, unencumbered liquid
assets, and capacity to borrow from the FHLB and at the Federal Reserve Bank’s Discount Window and new Bank Term Funding Program, created in 2023.
Unencumbered liquid assets in the Company’s investment securities portfolio provides asset liquidity through the Company’s ability to sell the securities or
pledge and borrow against them. At March 31, 2023, the fair value of unencumbered investment securities totaled $130.5 billion, compared with $135.5 billion
at December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and “Balance Sheet Analysis” for further information on investment
securities maturities and trends. Asset liquidity is further enhanced by the Company’s practice of pledging loans to access secured borrowing facilities through
the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank.
The following table summarizes the Company’s total available liquidity from on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet funding sources:

Borrowing capacity from the Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB 211,399 125,682
Total available liquidity $ 315,000 $ 302,905
The Company’s diversified deposit base provides a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funding, while reducing the Company’s reliance on
the wholesale markets. Total deposits were $505.3 billion at March 31, 2023, compared with $525.0 billion at December 31, 2022. Refer to “Balance Sheet
Analysis” for further information on the Company’s deposits.
Additional funding is provided by long-term debt and short-term borrowings. Long-term debt was $42.0 billion at March 31, 2023, and is an important
funding source because of its multi-year borrowing structure. Short-term borrowings were $56.9 billion at March 31, 2023, and supplement the Company’s other
funding sources. Depositors and investors often consider the credit rating of a Company. The Company receives various credit ratings from four separate credit
rating agencies and has strong investment grade ratings from all agencies. After the first quarter of 2023, one credit rating agency, Moody’s Investors Service,
downgraded its credit rating of the Company which is now in line with other large regional banks. Refer to “Balance Sheet Analysis” for further information on
the Company’s long-term debt and short-term borrowings.
In addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis, the Company monitors the parent company’s liquidity. The parent company’s routine
funding requirements consist primarily of operating expenses, dividends paid to shareholders, debt service, repurchases of common stock and funds used for
acquisitions. The parent company obtains funding to meet its obligations from dividends collected from its subsidiaries and the issuance of debt and capital
securities. The Company establishes limits for the
U.S. Bancorp 25
Table of Contents
minimal number of months into the future where the parent company can meet existing and forecasted obligations with cash and securities held that can be
readily monetized. The Company measures and manages this limit in both normal and adverse conditions. The Company maintains sufficient funding to meet
expected capital and debt service obligations for 24 months without the support of dividends from subsidiaries and assuming access to the wholesale markets is
maintained. The Company maintains sufficient liquidity to meet its capital and debt service obligations for 12 months under adverse conditions without the
support of dividends from subsidiaries or access to the wholesale markets. The parent company is currently in excess of required liquidity minimums.
At March 31, 2023, parent company long-term debt outstanding was $30.8 billion, compared with $27.0 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase was
primarily due to $3.7 billion of medium-term note issuances. As of March 31, 2023, there was no parent company debt scheduled to mature in the remainder of
2023. Future debt maturities may be met through medium-term note and capital security issuances and dividends from subsidiaries, as well as from parent
company cash and cash equivalents.
The Company is subject to a regulatory Liquidity Coverage Ratio (“LCR”) requirement which requires banks to maintain an adequate level of
unencumbered high quality liquid assets to meet estimated liquidity needs over a 30-day stressed period. At March 31, 2023, the Company was compliant with
this requirement.
The Company is also subject to a regulatory Net Stable Funding Ratio (“NSFR”) requirement which requires banks to maintain a minimum level of stable
funding based on the liquidity characteristics of their assets, commitments, and derivative exposures over a one-year time horizon. At March 31, 2023, the
Company was compliant with this requirement.
Refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Liquidity Risk Management” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2022, for further discussion on liquidity risk management.
European Exposures The Company provides merchant processing and corporate trust services in Europe either directly or through banking affiliations in
Europe. Revenue generated from sources in Europe represented approximately 2 percent of the Company’s total net revenue for the three months ended
March 31, 2023. Operating cash for these businesses is deposited on a short-term basis typically with certain European central banks. For deposits placed at
other European banks, exposure is mitigated by the Company placing deposits at multiple banks and managing the amounts on deposit at any bank based on
institution-specific deposit limits. At March 31, 2023, the Company had an aggregate amount on deposit with European banks of approximately $7.5 billion,
predominately with the Central Bank of Ireland and Bank of England.
In addition, the Company provides financing to domestic multinational corporations that generate revenue from customers in European countries,
transacts with various European banks as counterparties to certain derivative-related activities, and through a subsidiary, manages money market funds that hold
certain investments in European sovereign debt. Any deterioration in economic conditions in Europe, including the impacts resulting from the Russia-Ukraine
conflict, is not expected to have a significant effect on the Company related to these activities.
Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Other Contractual Obligations The Company participates in many different contractual arrangements which may or
may not be recorded on its balance sheet, with unrelated or consolidated entities, under which the Company has an obligation to pay certain amounts, provide
credit or liquidity enhancements or provide market risk support. These arrangements include commitments to extend credit, letters of credit and various forms of
guarantees. Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on guarantees and contingent liabilities. These
arrangements also include any obligation related to a variable interest held in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, credit enhancement or
market risk support. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Company’s interests in variable
interest entities.

Basel III standardized approach:
Common equity tier 1 capital $ 42,027 $ 41,560
Tier 1 capital 49,278 48,813
Total risk-based capital 59,920 59,015
Risk-weighted assets 494,048 496,500
Common equity tier 1 capital as a percent of risk-weighted assets (a) 8.5% 8.4%
Tier 1 capital as a percent of risk-weighted assets 10.0 9.8
Total risk-based capital as a percent of risk-weighted assets 12.1 11.9
Tier 1 capital as a percent of adjusted quarterly average assets (leverage ratio) 7.5 7.9
Tier 1 capital as a percent of total on- and off-balance sheet leverage exposure (total leverage exposure ratio) 6.1 6.4
(a) The Company’s common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio, reflecting the full implementation of the CECL methodology, was 8.3 percent at March 31, 2023, compared with 8.1 percent at
December 31, 2022.
Capital Management The Company is committed to managing capital to maintain strong protection for depositors and creditors and for maximum shareholder
benefit. The Company also manages its capital to exceed regulatory capital requirements for banking organizations. To achieve its capital goals, the Company
employs a variety of capital management tools, including dividends, common share repurchases, and the issuance of subordinated debt, non-cumulative
perpetual preferred stock, common stock and other capital instruments. The regulatory capital requirements effective for the Company follow Basel III, with the
Company being subject to calculating its capital adequacy as a percentage of risk-weighted assets under the standardized approach. Beginning in 2022, the
Company began to phase into its regulatory capital requirements the cumulative deferred impact of its 2020 adoption of the accounting guidance related to the
impairment of financial instruments based on the current expected credit losses (“CECL”) methodology plus 25 percent of its quarterly credit reserve increases
during 2020 and 2021. This cumulative deferred impact will continue to be phased into the Company’s regulatory capital over the next two years, culminating
with a fully phased in regulatory capital calculation beginning in 2025. Table 10 provides a summary of statutory regulatory capital ratios in effect for the
Company at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. All regulatory ratios exceeded regulatory “well-capitalized” requirements.
The Company believes certain other capital ratios are useful in evaluating its capital adequacy. The Company’s tangible common equity, as a percent of
tangible assets and as a percent of risk-weighted assets determined in accordance with transitional regulatory capital requirements related to the CECL
methodology under the standardized approach, was 4.8 percent and 6.5 percent, respectively, at March 31, 2023, compared with 4.5 percent and 6.0 percent,
respectively, at December 31, 2022. In addition, the Company’s common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio, reflecting the full implementation of
the CECL methodology was 8.3 percent at March 31, 2023, compared with 8.1 percent at December 31, 2022. Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”
beginning on page 31 for further information on these other capital ratios.
Total U.S. Bancorp shareholders’ equity was $53.0 billion at March 31, 2023, compared with $50.8 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase was
primarily the result of corporate earnings and changes in unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investment securities included in other comprehensive
income (loss), partially offset by dividends paid.
The Company announced on December 22, 2020 that its Board of Directors had approved an authorization to repurchase $3.0 billion of its common stock
beginning January 1, 2021. The Company suspended all common stock repurchases at the beginning of the third quarter of 2021, except for those done
exclusively in connection with its stock-based compensation programs, due to its acquisition of MUB. The Company does not expect to evaluate potential
repurchases until its common equity tier 1 capital ratio is 9.0 percent, at which time the Company will evaluate the potential capital requirements given the
regulatory landscape. Capital distributions, including dividends and stock repurchases, are subject to the approval of the Company’s Board of Directors and
compliance with regulatory requirements.

LINE OF BUSINESS FINANCIAL REVIEW
The Company’s major lines of business are Corporate and Commercial Banking, Consumer and Business Banking, Wealth Management and Investment
Services, Payment Services, and Treasury and Corporate Support. These operating segments are components of the Company about which financial information
is prepared and is evaluated regularly by management in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance.
Basis for Financial Presentation Business line results are derived from the Company’s business unit profitability reporting systems by specifically attributing
managed balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related income or expense. Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information on the business lines’ basis for financial presentation.
Designations, assignments and allocations change from time to time as management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating performance or product
lines change or business segments are realigned to better respond to the Company’s diverse customer base. During 2023, certain organization and methodology
changes were made and, accordingly, 2022 results were restated and presented on a comparable basis.
Corporate and Commercial Banking Corporate and Commercial Banking offers lending, equipment finance and small-ticket leasing, depository services,
treasury management, capital markets services, international trade services and other financial services to middle market, large corporate, commercial real estate,
financial institution, non-profit and public sector clients. Corporate and Commercial Banking contributed $580 million of the Company’s net income in the first
quarter of 2023, or an increase of $172 million (42.2 percent) compared with the first quarter of 2022.
Net revenue increased $397 million (40.0 percent) in the first quarter of 2023, compared with the first quarter of 2022. Net interest income, on a taxableequivalent basis, increased $335 million (44.9 percent) in the first quarter of 2023, compared with the first quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily due to
the impacts of the MUB acquisition, higher loan balances and the impact of higher rates on the margin benefit from deposits, partially offset by lower spreads on
loans and lower noninterest-bearing deposits. Noninterest income increased $62 million (25.1 percent) in the first quarter of 2023, compared with the first
quarter of 2022, primarily due to the MUB acquisition and higher commercial products revenue mainly due to higher trading revenue.
Noninterest expense increased $169 million (38.1 percent) in the first quarter of 2023, compared with the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to higher
FDIC insurance expense, higher net shared services expense driven by investment in support of business growth and the impacts of the MUB acquisition,
including intangible amortization driven by the core deposit intangible. The provision for credit losses decreased $2 million (40.0 percent) in the first quarter of
2023, compared with the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to slower ending loan balance growth in the current year.

Consumer and Business Banking Consumer and Business Banking comprises consumer banking, small business banking and consumer lending. Products and
services are delivered through banking offices, telephone servicing and sales, on-line services, direct mail, ATM processing, mobile devices, distributed
mortgage loan officers, and intermediary relationships including auto dealerships, mortgage banks, and strategic business partners. Consumer and Business
Banking contributed $692 million of the Company’s net income in the first quarter of 2023, or an increase of $310 million (81.2 percent) compared with the first
quarter of 2022.
Net revenue increased $758 million (38.8 percent) in the first quarter of 2023, compared with the first quarter of 2022. Net interest income, on a taxableequivalent basis, increased $815 million (54.3 percent) in the first quarter of 2023, compared with the first quarter of 2022, due to the impacts of the MUB
acquisition and the favorable impact of higher rates on the margin benefit from deposits, partially offset by lower spreads on loans and lower loan fees.
Noninterest income decreased $57 million (12.6 percent) in the first quarter of 2023, compared with the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to lower mortgage
banking revenue reflecting lower application volume, lower related gain on sale margins and fewer performing loan sales, partially offset by an increase in the
fair value of MSRs, net of hedging activities. Noninterest income further decreased due to lower residual gains on vehicle sales and the impact of pricing
changes on deposit service charges, partially offset by the impact of the MUB acquisition.
Noninterest expense increased $378 million (27.0 percent) in the first quarter of 2023, compared with the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to increases
in net shared services expense due to investments in digital capabilities and the impact of the MUB acquisition, including intangible amortization driven by the
core deposit intangible, as well as lower capitalized loan costs driven by lower mortgage production. The provision for credit losses decreased $35 million (72.9
percent) in the first quarter of 2023, compared with the first quarter of 2022, due to a more favorable product mix in the current year.
Wealth Management and Investment Services Wealth Management and Investment Services provides private banking, financial advisory services, investment
management, retail brokerage services, insurance, trust, custody and fund servicing through four businesses: Wealth Management, Global Corporate Trust &
Custody, U.S. Bancorp Asset Management and Fund Services. Wealth Management and Investment Services contributed $399 million of the Company’s net
income in the first quarter of 2023, or an increase of $170 million (74.2 percent) compared with the first quarter of 2022.
Net revenue increased $317 million (36.4 percent) in the first quarter of 2023, compared with the first quarter of 2022. Net interest income, on a taxableequivalent basis, increased $212 million (76.8 percent) in the first quarter of 2023, compared with the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to the favorable impact
of higher rates on the margin benefit from deposits. Noninterest income increased $105 million (17.6 percent) in the first quarter of 2023, compared with the
first quarter of 2022, primarily driven by higher trust and investment management fees reflecting lower money market fund fee waivers and the impacts of the
MUB acquisition, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable market conditions.
Noninterest expense increased $110 million (19.7 percent) in the first quarter of 2023, compared with the first quarter of 2022, reflecting higher
compensation and employee benefits expense as a result of merit increases and core business growth, higher net shared services expense driven by investment in
support of business growth and the impact of the MUB acquisition. The provision for credit losses decreased $20 million in the first quarter of 2023, compared
with the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to slower ending loan balance growth in the current year.
Payment Services Payment Services includes consumer and business credit cards, stored-value cards, debit cards, corporate, government and purchasing card
services and merchant processing. Payment Services contributed $335 million of the Company’s net income in the first quarter of 2023, or a decrease of
$40 million (10.7 percent) compared with the first quarter of 2022.
Net revenue increased $109 million (7.4 percent) in the first quarter of 2023, compared with the first quarter of 2022. Net interest income, on a taxableequivalent basis, increased $29 million (4.7 percent) in the first quarter of 2023, compared with the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to higher loan yields
driven by higher interest rates and customer revolve rates, higher loan balances and higher loan fees, mostly offset by higher funding costs. Noninterest income
increased $80 million (9.3 percent) in the first quarter of 2023, compared with the first quarter of 2022, mainly due to continued strengthening of consumer and
business spending across most sectors. As a result, there was strong growth in corporate payment products revenue driven by improving business spending
across all product groups. In addition, merchant processing services revenue increased due to higher sales volume and higher merchant fees, partially offset by
the impact of foreign currency rate changes in Europe.
30 U.S. Bancorp
Table of Contents
Noninterest expense increased $66 million (7.8 percent) in the first quarter of 2023, compared with the first quarter of 2022, reflecting higher net shared
services expense driven by investment in infrastructure and technology development, in addition to higher compensation and employee benefits expense due to
merit increases and core business growth. The provision for credit losses increased $96 million (73.8 percent) in the first quarter of 2023, compared with the first
quarter of 2022, primarily due to the impacts of increasing delinquency rates and lower consumer liquidity.
Treasury and Corporate Support Treasury and Corporate Support includes the Company’s investment portfolios, funding, capital management, interest rate risk
management, income taxes not allocated to the business lines, including most investments in tax-advantaged projects, and the residual aggregate of those
expenses associated with corporate activities that are managed on a consolidated basis. Treasury and Corporate Support recorded a net loss of $308 million in
the first quarter of 2023, compared with net income of $163 million in the first quarter of 2022.
Net revenue decreased $2 million (0.7 percent) in the first quarter of 2023, compared with the first quarter of 2022. Noninterest income decreased
$79 million (32.5 percent) in the first quarter of 2023, compared with the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to lower tax-advantaged investment syndication
revenue and securities losses. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, increased $77 million in the first quarter of 2023, compared with the first
quarter of 2022, primarily due to the acquisition of MUB, partially offset by higher funding costs.
Noninterest expense increased $330 million in the first quarter of 2023, compared with the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to merger and integration
charges and operating expenses related to the acquisition of MUB, higher compensation and employee benefits expense reflecting merit increases, hiring to
support business growth, core business growth and higher production incentives, partially offset by lower net shared services expense. The provision for credit
losses increased $276 million in the first quarter of 2023, compared with the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to increased economic uncertainty in the current
year compared to the reduction in the allowance for credit losses associated with improving economic conditions in the first quarter of 2022.
Income taxes are assessed to each line of business at a managerial tax rate of 25.0 percent with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the
consolidated effective tax rate included in Treasury and Corporate Support.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
In addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the Company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy,
including:
• Tangible common equity to tangible assets,
• Tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets, and
• Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, reflecting the full implementation of the CECL methodology.
These capital measures are viewed by management as useful additional methods of evaluating the Company’s utilization of its capital held and the level of
capital available to withstand unexpected negative market or economic conditions. Additionally, presentation of these measures allows investors, analysts and
banking regulators to assess the Company’s capital position relative to other financial services companies. These capital measures are not defined in generally
accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), or are not currently effective or defined in banking regulations. In addition, certain of these measures differ from
currently effective capital ratios defined by banking regulations principally in that the currently effective ratios, which are subject to certain transitional
provisions, temporarily exclude the impact of the 2020 adoption of accounting guidance related to impairment of financial instruments based on the CECL
methodology. As a result, these capital measures disclosed by the Company may be considered non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes this
information helps investors assess trends in the Company’s capital adequacy.
The Company also discloses net interest income and related ratios and analysis on a taxable-equivalent basis, which may also be considered non-GAAP
financial measures. The Company believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison
of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. In addition, certain performance measures, including the efficiency ratio and net interest
margin utilize net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis.
There may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, the Company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial
statements and other financial information contained in this report in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure.

CRITICALACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accounting and reporting policies of the Company comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and conform to general
practices within the banking industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions. The Company’s financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions, which are integral to understanding
the Company’s financial statements. Critical accounting policies are those policies management believes are the most important to the portrayal of the
Company’s financial condition and results, and require management to make estimates that are difficult, subjective or complex. Most accounting policies are not
considered by management to be critical accounting policies. Management has discussed the development and the selection of critical accounting policies with
the Company’s Audit Committee. Those policies considered to be critical accounting policies relate to the allowance for credit losses, fair value estimates,
MSRs, and income taxes. These accounting policies are discussed in detail in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Critical Accounting Policies” and the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.
