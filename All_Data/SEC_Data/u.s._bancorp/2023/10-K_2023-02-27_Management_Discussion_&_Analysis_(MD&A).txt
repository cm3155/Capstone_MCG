Management’s Discussion and Analysis 

Overview 
In 2022, U.S. Bancorp and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) 
continued to demonstrate financial strength and a diversified 
business model by maintaining sound credit quality and a strong 
capital and liquidity position, while continuing to invest in key 
business initiatives to drive growth in the future. 

MUFG Union Bank Acquisition On December 1, 2022, the 
Company acquired MUFG Union Bank N.A.’s core regional banking 
franchise (“MUB”) from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. 
Pursuant to the terms of a previously announced Share Purchase 
Agreement, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding 
shares of common stock of MUB for a purchase price consisting of 
$5.5 billion in cash and approximately 44 million shares of the 
Company’s common stock. The Company also received additional 
MUB capital of $3.5 billion upon completion of the acquisition. The 
additional capital received is held at the MUB subsidiary and 
required to be repaid to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. on or 
prior to the fifth anniversary date of the completion of the purchase, 
in accordance with the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement. As 
such, it is recognized as debt at the parent company. The 
transaction excludes the purchase of substantially all of MUB’s 
Global Corporate & Investment Bank (other than certain deposits), 
certain middle and back-office functions, and other assets. MUB 
operates approximately 300 branches in California, Washington and 
Oregon. The Company’s 2022 results reflect MUB’s operations for 
the month of December 2022, and the Company’s balance sheet 
as of December 31, 2022 includes MUB’s balances acquired or 
assumed in the transaction, including $81.4 billion in total assets, 
$53.1 billion of loans and $82.0 billion of deposits. As of the date of 
acquisition, MUB is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and 
an affiliate of U.S. Bank National Association (“USBNA”), the 
Company’s primary banking subsidiary. The Company expects to 
merge MUB into USBNA in connection with the conversion of MUB 
customers and systems to the USBNA platform over Memorial Day 
weekend in 2023. 

Financial Performance The Company earned $5.8 billion in 2022, 
or $3.69 per diluted common share, compared with $8.0 billion, or 
$5.10 per diluted common share in 2021. Financial performance for 
2022, compared with 2021, included the following: 

  Net interest income increased $2.2 billion (17.8 percent) due 
to the impact of rising rates on earnings assets and growth in 
average loan and investment securities balances, partially 
offset by deposit pricing and changes in funding mix; 
  Noninterest income decreased $771 million (7.5 percent) 

primarily due to lower mortgage banking revenue, and lower 
other noninterest income driven by the impact of interest rate 
economic hedges related to the MUB acquisition, partially 
offset by higher trust and investment management fees and 
payment services revenue; 

  Noninterest expense increased $1.2 billion (8.6 percent), 
reflecting operating expenses and merger and integration 
charges related to the MUB acquisition, along with increases 
in compensation and employee benefits expense, marketing 
and business development expense and other noninterest 
expense; 

22 

  The provision for credit losses increased $3.2 billion, driven by 

the impact of loan growth and increasing economic 
uncertainty, as well as the initial provision for credit losses 
related to the MUB acquisition and the provision impact of 
balance sheet repositioning and capital management actions 
taken in 2022 in connection with the acquisition; 

  Average loans increased $36.6 billion (12.3 percent) primarily 
due to higher average commercial loans and residential 
mortgages, including the impact of the MUB acquisition; and 
  Average deposits increased $28.1 billion (6.5 percent), driven 
by increases in average total savings deposits and time 
deposits including the impact of the MUB acquisition, partially 
offset by a decrease in average noninterest bearing deposits. 

Credit Quality The Company continues to maintain strong credit 
quality as it prudently manages credit underwriting. 

  The allowance for credit losses was $7.4 billion at 

December 31, 2022, an increase of $1.2 billion compared 
with December 31, 2021. The increase included the impacts 
of the MUB acquisition, along with loan growth and increased 
economic uncertainty. 

  Nonperforming assets were $1.0 billion at December 31, 

2022, an increase of $138 million compared with 
December 31, 2021. The increase was driven by acquired 
balances related to the MUB acquisition, partially offset by 
decreases in nonperforming loans in the legacy portfolio. 
  Net charge-offs were $1.1 billion in 2022, an increase of 
$381 million compared with 2021. The increase reflected 
approximately $179 million related to the purchase accounting 
treatment for acquired MUB loans, as well as the impact 
related to balance sheet repositioning and capital 
management actions taken during 2022 in connection with 
the acquisition. 

Capital Management At December 31, 2022, all of the 
Company’s regulatory capital ratios exceeded regulatory “well-
capitalized” requirements. 

  The Company’s common equity tier 1 capital ratio was 

8.4 percent at December 31, 2022. 

  During 2022, the Company announced a 4.3 percent increase 

in the quarterly dividend rate per common share. 

The Company’s financial strength, diversified business model and 
strong credit quality position it well for 2023. Economic 
uncertainty in both the domestic and global economies currently 
exists. The Company’s business model is resilient due to 
disciplined credit underwriting standards and robust risk 
management infrastructure. The Company remains focused on 
prudent balance sheet growth and the prudent allocation of 
capital to lines of business and products best served to deliver on 
its strategic vision. The Company’s growth strategy is focused on 
creating value for its customers, communities and shareholders, 
which will allow it to continue to generate industry-leading 
performance.

Earnings Summary The Company reported net income 
attributable to U.S. Bancorp of $5.8 billion in 2022, or $3.69 per 
diluted common share, compared with $8.0 billion, or $5.10 per 
diluted common share, in 2021. Return on average assets and 
return on average common equity were 0.98 percent and 
12.6 percent, respectively, in 2022, compared with 1.43 percent 
and 16.0 percent, respectively, in 2021. The results for 2022 
included the impact of the 2022 acquisition of MUB. The 
transaction closed on December 1, 2022 and results reflect one 
month of operating results of MUB including $255 million of net 
interest income, $47 million of fee income and $221 million of 
noninterest expense. In addition, the results for 2022 included the 
impact of certain actions directly related to the acquisition, 
including $399 million of losses primarily related to interest rate 
economic hedges, entered into after regulatory approval for the 
acquisition was obtained, to manage the impact of interest rate 
volatility on capital prior to closing the transaction, $329 million of 
merger and integration charges, and $791 million of provision for 
credit losses related to acquired loans and balance sheet 
repositioning and capital management actions taken in the fourth 
quarter of 2022 in connection with the acquisition. Combined, 
these items decreased 2022 diluted earnings per common share 
by $0.76. 

Total net revenue for 2022 was $1.5 billion (6.5 percent) 

higher than 2021, reflecting a 17.9 percent increase in net interest 
income (17.8 percent on a taxable-equivalent basis) and a 
7.5 percent decrease in noninterest income. The increase in net 
interest income from the prior year was due to the impact of 
rising rates on earning assets and strong growth in average loan 
and investment securities balances, partially offset by deposit 
pricing and changes in funding mix. The reduction in noninterest 
income reflected lower mortgage banking revenue due to a 
decline in refinancing activities, and lower other noninterest 
income driven by the impact of interest rate economic hedges 
related to the MUB acquisition, partially offset by higher trust and 
investment management fees and payment services revenue. 
Noninterest expense in 2022 was $1.2 billion (8.6 percent) 
higher than 2021, reflecting operating expenses and merger and 
integration charges related to the MUB acquisition, as well as 
increases in legacy compensation and employee benefits 
expense, marketing and business development expense and 
other noninterest expense. 

Results for 2021 Compared With 2020 For discussion related 
to changes in financial condition and results of operations for 
2021 compared with 2020, refer to “Management’s Discussion 

and Analysis” in the Company’s Annual Report for the year ended 
December 31, 2021, included as Exhibit 13 to the Company’s 
Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on 
February 22, 2022. 

Statement of Income Analysis 
Net Interest Income Net interest income, on a taxable-
equivalent basis, was $14.8 billion in 2022, compared with 
$12.6 billion in 2021. The $2.2 billion (17.8 percent) increase in 
net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, in 2022 
compared with 2021, was primarily due to the impact of rising 
interest rates on earning assets, strong growth in loan and 
investment securities balances and the impact of loans and 
investment securities acquired related to MUB partially offset by 
deposit pricing and changes in funding mix. Average earning 
assets were $39.2 billion (7.7 percent) higher in 2022, compared 
with 2021, reflecting increases in loans and investment securities, 
partially offset by a decrease in interest-bearing deposits with 
banks. The net interest margin, on a taxable-equivalent basis, in 
2022 was 2.72 percent, compared with 2.49 percent in 2021. 
The increase in the net interest margin in 2022, compared with 
2021, was due to the impact of higher rates on earning assets, 
partially offset by deposit pricing and short-term borrowing costs 
given the rise in short-term interest rates. Refer to the “Interest 
Rate Risk Management” section for further information on the 
sensitivity of the Company’s net interest income to changes in 
interest rates. 

Average total loans were $333.6 billion in 2022, compared 

with $297.0 billion in 2021. The $36.6 billion (12.3 percent) 
increase was due to growth in all loan classes, including a 
$4.6 billion impact related to the MUB acquisition. Average 
commercial loans increased $20.9 billion (20.4 percent), primarily 
due to higher utilization driven by working capital needs of 
corporate customers, slower payoffs given higher volatility in the 
capital markets, as well as core growth. Average residential 
mortgages increased $10.1 billion (13.6 percent) driven by slower 
refinance activity, along with the impact related to the MUB 
acquisition. Average commercial real estate loans increased 
$2.3 billion (6.0 percent), primarily the result of reduced payoff 
activity and MUB balances. Average credit card loans increased 
$1.8 billion (8.5 percent) primarily due to increased consumer 
spending, account growth and lower payment rates. Average 
other retail loans increased $1.4 billion (2.4 percent), driven by 
higher auto and recreational vehicle loans, partially offset by lower 
retail leasing balances.

Average investment securities in 2022 were $14.7 billion (9.5 

percent) higher than in 2021, primarily due to purchases of 
mortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury securities, net of 
prepayments, sales and maturities in the legacy portfolio, along 
with the $1.2 billion impact of the MUB acquisition. 

Average total deposits for 2022 were $28.1 billion (6.5 

percent) higher than 2021, including the $7.2 billion impact of the 
MUB acquisition. Average total savings deposits were 
$28.8 billion (10.2 percent) higher in 2022, compared with 2021, 
driven by increases in Corporate and Commercial Banking, and 
Consumer and Business Banking balances, partially offset by 

decreases in Wealth Management and Investment Services 
balances. Average time deposits for 2022 were $6.1 billion 
(24.8 percent) higher than 2021, primarily driven by increases in 
Corporate and Commercial Banking balances, partially offset by 
decreases in Consumer and Business Banking balances. 
Changes in time deposits are primarily related to those deposits 
managed as an alternative to other funding sources, based 
largely on relative pricing and liquidity characteristics. Average 
noninterest-bearing deposits were $6.8 billion (5.4 percent) lower 
in 2022, compared with 2021, driven by decreases in Corporate 
and Commercial Banking, and Payment Services balances.

(a)  This table shows the components of the change in net interest income by volume and rate on a taxable-equivalent basis based on a federal income tax rate of 21 percent. This table does not 
take into account the level of noninterest-bearing funding, nor does it fully reflect changes in the mix of assets and liabilities. The change in interest not solely due to changes in volume or rates 
has been allocated on a pro-rata basis to volume and yield/rate. 

Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses 
reflects changes in economic conditions and the size and credit 
quality of the entire portfolio of loans. The Company maintains an 
allowance for credit losses considered appropriate by 
management for expected losses, based on factors discussed in 
the “Analysis and Determination of Allowance for Credit Losses” 
section. 

The provision for credit losses was $2.0 billion in 2022, 

compared with a benefit of $1.2 billion in 2021. The change was 
driven by the Company recognizing a provision for credit losses 
of $662 million during 2022 related to the acquisition of MUB and 
a $129 million provision impact of balance sheet repositioning 
and capital management actions taken in the fourth quarter of 
2022, along with the impact of strong loan growth in the legacy 
portfolio and increasing economic uncertainty. The benefit 
recognized in 2021 reflected the enactment of government 

stimulus programs and economic recovery from the pandemic in 
the United States, which resulted in decreases in the allowance 
for credit losses. Net charge-offs increased $381 billion 
(55.9 percent) in 2022, compared with 2021, reflecting 
$179 million of uncollectible MUB acquired loans, of which the 
majority of this balance related to loans that were previously 
charged-off by MUB, along with $189 million of net charge-offs 
related to balance sheet repositioning and capital management 
actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2022 in connection with the 
acquisition. 

Refer to “Corporate Risk Profile” for further information on the 
provision for credit losses, net charge-offs, nonperforming assets 
and other factors considered by the Company in assessing the 
credit quality of the loan portfolio and establishing the allowance 
for credit losses.

Includes $399 million of losses primarily related to interest rate economic hedges, entered into after regulatory approval for the MUB acquisition was obtained, to manage the impact of interest 
rate volatility on capital prior to closing the transaction. 

Noninterest Income Noninterest income in 2022 was 
$9.5 billion, compared with $10.2 billion in 2021. The $771 million 
(7.5 percent) decrease in 2022 from 2021 reflected lower 
mortgage banking revenue, lower other noninterest income, lower 
service charges and lower gains on the sale of securities, partially 
offset by higher trust and investment management fees and 
payment services revenue. Mortgage banking revenue decreased 
61.3 percent in 2022, compared with 2021, reflecting lower 
application volume, given declining refinancing activities 
experienced in the mortgage industry, lower related gain on sale 
margins and lower performing loan sales, partially offset by 
increases in mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) valuations, net of 
hedging activities. Other noninterest income decreased 
62.1 percent in 2022, compared with 2021, primarily due to the 
impact of interest rate economic hedges, entered into after 
regulatory approval of the MUB acquisition was obtained, to 
manage the impact of interest rate volatility on capital prior to 
closing the transaction in December, as well as lower retail 
leasing end-of-term residual gains. Service charges 

TABLE 5  Noninterest Expense 

Year Ended December 31 (Dollars in Millions) 

decreased 3.0 percent primarily due to the impact of the 
elimination of certain consumer overdraft fees in 2022. Trust and 
investment management fees increased 20.6 percent primarily 
due to lower money market fee waivers, activity related to the 
fourth quarter of 2021 acquisition of PFM Asset Management 
LLC (“PFM”) and core business growth, partially offset by 
unfavorable market conditions. Payment services revenue 
increased in 2022, compared with 2021, driven by a 21.4 percent 
increase in corporate payment products revenue and a 
9.0 percent increase in merchant processing services revenue. 
Corporate payment products revenue increased due to improving 
business spending across all product groups, while merchant 
processing services revenue increased driven by higher sales 
volume and merchant fees. The increase in merchant processing 
services revenue was partially offset by the impact of foreign 
currency rate changes, as the U.S. dollar has strengthened 
considerably compared to European currencies given recent 
uncertainties in Europe.

Noninterest Expense Noninterest expense in 2022 was 
$14.9 billion, compared with $13.7 billion in 2021. The 
Company’s efficiency ratio was 61.4 percent in 2022, compared 
with 60.4 percent in 2021. The $1.2 billion (8.6 percent) increase 
in noninterest expense in 2022 over 2021 was driven by higher 
compensation and employee benefits expense, marketing and 
business development expense, net occupancy and equipment 
expense and other noninterest expense. The increase in 
noninterest expense included the impact of the MUB acquisition, 
including $329 million of merger and integration-related charges 
and $42 million of intangible amortization primarily related to core 
deposit intangibles. Compensation and employee benefits 
expense increased 4.9 percent in 2022 over 2021, primarily due 
to MUB expense as well as merit increases and hiring to support 
business growth and higher post-pandemic medical expenses, 
partially offset by lower performance-based incentives and 
variable compensation. Marketing and business development 
expense increased 24.6 percent due to the timing of marketing 
campaigns as well as increased travel and entertainment. Net 
occupancy and equipment expense increased 4.6 percent to 
support business growth. Other noninterest expense increased 
15.8 percent due to accruals related to future delivery exposures 
for merchant and airline processing as processing volumes 
recover, higher Federal Deposit Insurance Company (“FDIC”) 
insurance expense driven by an increase in the assessment base 
and rate, and higher other accruals, partially offset by lower costs 
related to tax-advantaged projects and lower other expenses 
related to the decline in mortgage production. 

Income Tax Expense The provision for income taxes was 
$1.5 billion (an effective rate of 20.0 percent) in 2022, compared 
with $2.2 billion (an effective rate of 21.5 percent) in 2021. 

For further information on income taxes, refer to Note 19 of 

the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Balance Sheet Analysis 
Average earning assets were $545.3 billion in 2022, compared 
with $506.1 billion in 2021. The increase in average earning 
assets of $39.2 billion (7.7 percent), including the $6.5 billion 
(1.3 percent) impact of the MUB acquisition, was primarily due to 
increases in loans of $36.6 billion (12.3 percent) and investment 
securities of $14.7 billion (9.5 percent), partially offset by a 
decrease in interest-bearing deposits with banks of $8.5 billion 
(21.3 percent). 

For average balance information, refer to Consolidated Daily 
Average Balance Sheet and Related Yields and Rates on page 
138. 

Loans The Company’s loan portfolio was $388.2 billion at 
December 31, 2022, compared with $312.0 billion at 
December 31, 2021, an increase of $76.2 billion (24.4 percent), 
which includes $53.1 billion of loans acquired from MUB. The 
increase was driven by increases in residential mortgages of

Commercial Commercial loans, including lease financing, 
increased $23.7 billion (21.1 percent) at December 31, 2022, 
compared with December 31, 2021, due to higher utilization 
driven by working capital needs of corporate customers, slower 
payoffs given higher volatility in the capital markets, core growth 
and the impact of the MUB acquisition. Average commercial 

loans increased $20.9 billion (20.4 percent) in 2022, compared 
with 2021. Table 8 provides a summary of commercial loans by 
industry and geographical location.

Commercial Real Estate The Company’s portfolio of 
commercial real estate loans, which includes commercial 
mortgages and construction and development loans, increased 
$16.4 billion (42.1 percent) at December 31, 2022, compared 
with December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to the 
impact of the MUB acquisition. Average commercial real estate 
loans increased $2.3 billion (6.0 percent) in 2022, compared with 
2021. Table 9 provides a summary of commercial real estate 
loans by property type and geographical location. 

The Company’s commercial mortgage and construction and 
development loans had unfunded commitments of $13.8 billion 
and $11.8 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

The Company also finances the operations of real estate 
developers and other entities with operations related to real 
estate. These loans are not secured directly by real estate but 
have similar characteristics to commercial real estate loans. 
These loans were included in the commercial loan category and 
totaled $19.5 billion and $16.6 billion at December 31, 2022 and 
2021, respectively.

Residential Mortgages Residential mortgages held in the loan 
portfolio at December 31, 2022, increased $39.4 billion (51.4 
percent) compared to December 31, 2021, due to $26.4 billion of 
acquired MUB residential mortgages, as well as stronger 
on-balance sheet loan activities and slower refinance activity. 
Average residential mortgages increased $10.1 billion (13.6 
percent) in 2022, compared with 2021. Residential mortgages 
originated and placed in the Company’s loan portfolio include 
well-secured jumbo mortgages and branch-originated first lien 
home equity loans to borrowers with high credit quality. 

Credit Card Total credit card loans increased $3.8 billion 
(16.9 percent) at December 31, 2022, compared with 
December 31, 2021, primarily driven by higher spend volumes, 
account growth and lower payment rates. Average credit card 
balances increased $1.8 billion (8.5 percent) in 2022, compared 
with 2021. 

TABLE 11  Credit Card Loans by Geography 

At December 31 (Dollars in Millions) 

Other Retail Total other retail loans, which include retail leasing, 
home equity and second mortgages and other retail loans, 
decreased $7.1 billion (11.4 percent) at December 31, 2022, 
compared with December 31, 2021, reflecting decreases in auto 
loans, installment loans and retail leasing balances, partially offset 
by increases in home equity loans and revolving credit balances. 
The decrease in auto loans was primarily driven by the sale of 
approximately $4 billion of indirect auto loans as part of balance 
sheet repositioning and capital management actions taken in the 
fourth quarter of 2022 in connection with the acquisition of MUB. 
Average other retail loans increased $1.4 billion (2.4 percent) in 
2022, compared with 2021. Tables 10, 11 and 12 provide a 
geographic summary of residential mortgages, credit card loans 
and other retail loans outstanding, respectively, as of 
December 31, 2022 and 2021.

The Company generally retains portfolio loans through 

maturity; however, the Company’s intent may change over time 
based upon various factors such as ongoing asset/liability 
management activities, assessment of product profitability, credit 
risk, liquidity needs, and capital implications. If the Company’s 
intent or ability to hold an existing portfolio loan changes, it is 
transferred to loans held for sale. 

Loans Held for Sale Loans held for sale, consisting primarily of 
residential mortgages to be sold in the secondary market, were 

TABLE 13  Investment Securities 

$2.2 billion at December 31, 2022, compared with $7.8 billion at 
December 31, 2021. The decrease in loans held for sale was 
principally due to a lower level of mortgage loan closings in late 
2022, compared with the same period of 2021. Almost all of the 
residential mortgage loans the Company originates or purchases 
for sale follow guidelines that allow the loans to be sold into 
existing, highly liquid secondary markets, in particular in 
government agency transactions and to government sponsored 
enterprises (“GSEs”).

(a)  Information related to asset and mortgage-backed securities included above is presented based upon weighted-average maturities that take into account anticipated future prepayments. 
(b)  Information related to obligations of state and political subdivisions is presented based upon yield to first optional call date if the security is purchased at a premium, and yield to maturity if the 

security is purchased at par or a discount. 

(c)  Maturity calculations for obligations of state and political subdivisions are based on the first optional call date for securities with a fair value above par and the contractual maturity date for 

securities with a fair value equal to or below par. 

(d)  Weighted-average yields for obligations of state and political subdivisions are presented on a fully-taxable equivalent basis based on a federal income tax rate of 21 percent. Yields on 
investment securities are computed based on amortized cost balances, excluding any premiums or discounts recorded related to the transfer of investment securities at fair value from 
available-for-sale to held-to-maturity.

Investment Securities The Company uses its investment 
securities portfolio to manage interest rate risk, provide liquidity 
(including the ability to meet regulatory requirements), generate 
interest and dividend income, and as collateral for public deposits 
and wholesale funding sources. While the Company intends to 
hold its investment securities indefinitely, it may sell 
available-for-sale investment securities in response to structural 
changes in the balance sheet and related interest rate risk and to 
meet liquidity requirements, among other factors. 

Investment securities totaled $161.7 billion at December 31, 
2022, compared with $174.8 billion at December 31, 2021. The 
$13.2 billion (7.5 percent) decrease was primarily due to 
$25.4 billion of net investment sales, including the sale of certain 
investment securities acquired as part of the MUB acquisition, 
and a $13.3 billion unfavorable change in net unrealized gains 
(losses) on available-for-sale investment securities, partially offset 
by $22.7 billion of acquired investment securities and $3.4 billion 
of senior notes the Company received as part of the sale of 
approximately $4 billion of indirect auto loans to third-party 
securitization vehicles during 2022. During 2022, the Company 
transferred $45.1 billion amortized cost ($40.7 billion fair value) of 
available-for-sale investment securities to the held-to-maturity 
category to reflect its new intent for these securities. Average 
investment securities were $169.4 billion in 2022, compared with 
$154.7 billion in 2021. Investment securities by type are shown in 
Table 13. 

The Company’s available-for-sale investment securities are 
carried at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in other 
comprehensive income (loss) unless a portion of a security’s 
unrealized loss is related to credit and an allowance for credit 
losses is necessary. At December 31, 2022, the Company’s net 
unrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities were 
$8.5 billion, compared with net unrealized gains of $722 million at 
December 31, 2021. The unfavorable change in net unrealized 
gains (losses) was primarily due to decreases in the fair value of 
mortgage-backed, U.S. Treasury and state and political securities 
as a result of changes in interest rates, partially offset by the 
impact of the transfer of available-for-sale investment securities to 
the held-to-maturity category. Gross unrealized losses on 
available-for-sale investment securities totaled $8.6 billion at 
December 31, 2022, compared with $812 million at 
December 31, 2021. When evaluating credit losses, the 
Company considers various factors such as the nature of the 
investment security, the credit ratings or financial condition of the 
issuer, the extent of the unrealized loss, expected cash flows of 
the underlying collateral, the existence of any government or 
agency guarantees, and market conditions. At December 31, 
2022, the Company had no plans to sell securities with unrealized 
losses, and believes it is more likely than not that it would not be

Deposits Total deposits were $525.0 billion at December 31, 
2022, including $82.0 billion of deposits related to the MUB 
acquisition, compared with $456.1 billion at December 31, 2021. 
The $68.9 billion (15.1 percent) increase in total deposits 
reflected increases in total savings deposits, time deposits and 
noninterest-bearing deposits. Average total deposits in 2022 
increased $28.1 billion (6.5 percent) over 2021. 

Interest-bearing savings deposits increased $55.8 billion 

(18.7 percent) at December 31, 2022, compared with 
December 31, 2021. The increase was related to higher money 
market, interest checking and savings account deposit balances, 
including those balances related to the MUB acquisition. Money 
market deposit balances increased $30.4 billion (25.8 percent), 
primarily due to higher Wealth Management and Investment 
Services, Corporate and Commercial Banking, and Consumer 
and Business Banking balances. Interest checking balances 
increased $19.4 billion (16.8 percent) primarily due to higher 
Corporate and Commercial Banking, and Consumer and 
Business Banking balances. Savings account balances increased 
$6.0 billion (9.1 percent), driven by higher Consumer and 
Business Banking balances, partially offset by lower Wealth 
Management and Investment Services balances. Average 
interest-bearing savings deposits increased $28.8 billion (10.2 
percent) in 2022, compared with 2021, reflecting higher 
Corporate and Commercial Banking, and Consumer and 
Business Banking balances, partially offset by lower Wealth 
Management and Investment Services balances. 

Interest-bearing time deposits at December 31, 2022, 

increased $10.3 billion (45.4 percent), compared with 
December 31, 2021. Average time deposits increased $6.1 billion 
(24.8 percent) in 2022, compared with 2021. Changes in time 
deposits are primarily related to those deposits managed as an 
alternative to other funding sources, based largely on relative 
pricing and liquidity characteristics. 

Noninterest-bearing deposits at December 31, 2022, 

increased $2.8 billion (2.1 percent) from December 31, 2021. The 
increase was driven by higher Consumer and Business Banking 
balances, primarily related to the MUB acquisition, partially offset 
by lower Wealth Management and Investment Services, and 
Corporate and Commercial Banking balances. Average 
noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $6.8 billion (5.4 percent) 
in 2022, compared with 2021.

Borrowings The Company utilizes both short-term and long-
term borrowings as part of its asset/liability management and 
funding strategies. Short-term borrowings, which include federal 
funds purchased, commercial paper, repurchase agreements, 
borrowings secured by high-grade assets and other short-term 
borrowings, were $31.2 billion at December 31, 2022, compared 
with $11.8 billion at December 31, 2021. The $19.4 billion 
increase in short-term borrowings at December 31, 2022, 
compared with December 31, 2021, reflected higher short-term 
Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances and commercial 
paper balances, including assumed short-term borrowing 
balances as a result of the MUB acquisition. 

Long-term debt was $39.8 billion at December 31, 2022, 

compared with $32.1 billion at December 31, 2021. The 
$7.7 billion (24.0 percent) increase was primarily due to 
$6.9 billion of medium-term note and $1.3 billion of subordinated 
note issuances, along with a $1.6 billion increase in FHLB 
advances including those balances assumed as a result of the 
MUB acquisition. In addition, long-term debt increased as a result 
of the $3.5 billion obligation to repay Mitsubishi UFJ Financial 
Group, Inc., which was incurred as part of the acquisition. These 
increases were partially offset by $3.2 billion of bank note 
repayments and maturities, $1.3 billion of subordinated note 
repayments and $1.0 billion of medium-term note repayments. 
Refer to Notes 13 and 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements for additional information regarding short-term borrowings 
and long-term debt, and the “Liquidity Risk Management” section for 
discussion of liquidity management of the Company. 

Corporate Risk Profile 
Overview Managing risks is an essential part of successfully 
operating a financial services company. The Company’s Board of 
Directors has approved a risk management framework which 
establishes governance and risk management requirements for all 
risk-taking activities. This framework includes Company and 
business line risk appetite statements which set boundaries for 
the types and amount of risk that may be undertaken in pursuing 
business objectives and initiatives. The Board of Directors, 
primarily through its Risk Management Committee, oversees 
performance relative to the risk management framework, risk 
appetite statements, and other policy requirements. 

The Executive Risk Committee (“ERC”), which is chaired by 
the Chief Risk Officer and includes the Chief Executive Officer and 
other members of the executive management team, oversees 
execution against the risk management framework and risk 
appetite statements. The ERC focuses on current and emerging 
risks, including strategic and reputation risks, by directing timely 
and comprehensive actions. Senior operating committees have 
also been established, each responsible for overseeing a 
specified category of risk. 

Upon closing of the MUB acquisition, the Company’s risk 
management framework applies to the legal entities acquired 
from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc., including MUB. Prior to 
closing, the Company evaluated the frameworks, policies and 
procedures of the acquired entities as necessary. Updates were 
made to align the acquired entities with the Company’s risk 

35 

appetite and connect the elements of their respective risk 
governance and reporting into the Company’s existing risk 
management framework. Connecting the existing MUB risk 
governance and reporting framework into the Company’s existing 
risk management framework allows separate risk profiles, 
governance, and reporting for the Company and the acquired 
entities, during the period from acquisition through bank merger, 
while also providing the ability to consolidate reporting for the 
Company. Upon completing the merger of MUB into USBNA, 
which is expected to occur in connection with the conversion of 
MUB customers and systems to the USBNA platform over 
Memorial Day weekend in 2023, the MUB risk governance and 
reporting framework will no longer be applicable. 

The Company’s most prominent risk exposures are credit, 
interest rate, market, liquidity, operational, compliance, strategic, 
and reputation. Credit risk is the risk of loss associated with a 
change in the credit profile or the failure of a borrower or 
counterparty to meet its contractual obligations. Interest rate risk 
is the current or prospective risk to earnings and capital, or 
market valuations, arising from the impact of changes in interest 
rates. Market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign 
exchange rates, and security prices that may result in changes in 
the values of financial instruments, such as trading and 
available-for-sale securities, mortgage loans held for sale 
(“MLHFS”), MSRs and derivatives that are accounted for on a fair 
value basis. Liquidity risk is the risk that financial condition or 
overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by the 
Company’s inability, or perceived inability, to meet its cash flow 
obligations in a timely and complete manner in either normal or 
stressed conditions. Operational risk is the risk to current or 
projected financial condition and resilience arising from 
inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, people 
(including human errors or misconduct), or adverse external 
events, including the risk of loss resulting from breaches in data 
security. Operational risk can also include the risk of loss due to 
failures by third parties with which the Company does business. 
Compliance risk is the risk that the Company may suffer legal or 
regulatory sanctions, financial losses, and reputational damage if 
it fails to adhere to compliance requirements and the Company’s 
compliance policies. Strategic risk is the risk to current or 
projected financial condition and resilience arising from adverse 
business decisions, poor implementation of business decisions, 
or lack of responsiveness to changes in the banking industry and 
operating environment. Reputation risk is the risk to current or 
anticipated earnings, capital, or franchise or enterprise value 
arising from negative public opinion. This risk may impair the 
Company’s competitiveness by affecting its ability to establish 
new relationships or services, or continue serving existing 
relationships. In addition to the risks identified above, other risk 
factors exist that may impact the Company. Refer to “Risk 
Factors” beginning on page 140, for a detailed discussion of 
these factors. 

The Company’s Board and management-level governance 
committees are supported by a “three lines of defense” model for 
establishing effective checks and balances. The first line of 

defense, the business lines, manages risks in conformity with 
established limits and policy requirements. In turn, business line 
leaders and their risk officers establish programs to ensure 
conformity with these limits and policy requirements. The second 
line of defense, which includes the Chief Risk Officer’s 
organization as well as policy and oversight activities of corporate 
support functions, translates risk appetite and strategy into 
actionable risk limits and policies. The second line of defense 
monitors first line of defense conformity with limits and policies, 
and provides reporting and escalation of emerging risks and 
other concerns to senior management and the Risk Management 
Committee of the Board of Directors. The third line of defense, 
internal audit, is responsible for providing the Audit Committee of 
the Board of Directors and senior management with independent 
assessment and assurance regarding the effectiveness of the 
Company’s governance, risk management and control 
processes. 

Management regularly provides reports to the Risk 

Management Committee of the Board of Directors. The Risk 
Management Committee discusses with management the 
Company’s risk management performance, and provides a 
summary of key risks to the entire Board of Directors, covering 
the status of existing matters, areas of potential future concern 
and specific information on certain types of loss events. The Risk 
Management Committee considers quarterly reports by 
management assessing the Company’s performance relative to 
the risk appetite statements and the associated risk limits, 
including: 

– Macroeconomic environment and other qualitative 

considerations, such as regulatory and compliance changes, 
litigation developments, geopolitical events, and technology and 
cybersecurity; 

– Credit measures, including adversely rated and nonperforming 

loans, leveraged transactions, credit concentrations and lending 
limits; 

– Interest rate and market risk, including market value and net 
income simulation, and trading-related Value at Risk (“VaR”); 

– Liquidity risk, including funding projections under various 

stressed scenarios; 

– Operational and compliance risk, including losses stemming 

from events such as fraud, processing errors, control breaches, 
breaches in data security or adverse business decisions, as well 
as reporting on technology performance, and various legal and 
regulatory compliance measures; 

– Capital ratios and projections, including regulatory measures 

and stressed scenarios; and 

– Strategic and reputation risk considerations, impacts and 

responses. 

Credit Risk Management The Company’s strategy for credit 
risk management includes well-defined, centralized credit 
policies, uniform underwriting criteria, and ongoing risk monitoring 
and review processes for all commercial and consumer credit 
exposures. The strategy also emphasizes diversification on a 

36 

geographic, industry and customer level, regular credit 
examinations and management reviews of loans exhibiting 
deterioration of credit quality. The Risk Management Committee 
oversees the Company’s credit risk management process. 

In addition, credit quality ratings, as defined by the Company, 

are an important part of the Company’s overall credit risk 
management and evaluation of its allowance for credit losses. 
Loans with a pass rating represent those loans not classified on 
the Company’s rating scale for problem credits, as minimal credit 
risk has been identified. Loans with a special mention or classified 
rating, including consumer lending and small business loans that 
are 90 days or more past due and still accruing, nonaccrual 
loans, those loans considered troubled debt restructurings 
(“TDRs”), and loans in a junior lien position that are current but are 
behind a first lien position on nonaccrual, encompass all loans 
held by the Company that it considers to have a potential or well-
defined weakness that may put full collection of contractual cash 
flows at risk. The Company’s internal credit quality ratings for 
consumer loans are primarily based on delinquency and 
nonperforming status, except for a limited population of larger 
loans within those portfolios that are individually evaluated. For 
this limited population, the determination of the internal credit 
quality rating may also consider collateral value and customer 
cash flows. Refer to Notes 1 and 6 in the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s loan 
portfolios including internal credit quality ratings. 

The Company categorizes its loan portfolio into two 

segments, which is the level at which it develops and documents 
a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit 
losses. The Company’s two loan portfolio segments are 
commercial lending and consumer lending. 

The commercial lending segment includes loans and leases 

made to small business, middle market, large corporate, 
commercial real estate, financial institution, non-profit and public 
sector customers. Key risk characteristics relevant to commercial 
lending segment loans include the industry and geography of the 
borrower’s business, purpose of the loan, repayment source, 
borrower’s debt capacity and financial flexibility, loan covenants, 
and nature of pledged collateral, if any, as well as 
macroeconomic factors such as unemployment rates, gross 
domestic product levels, corporate bond spreads and long-term 
interest rates. These risk characteristics, among others, are 
considered in determining estimates about the likelihood of 
default by the borrowers and the severity of loss in the event of 
default. The Company considers these risk characteristics in 
assigning internal risk ratings to, or forecasting losses on, these 
loans, which are the significant factors in determining the 
allowance for credit losses for loans in the commercial lending 
segment. 

The consumer lending segment represents loans and leases 
made to consumer customers, including residential mortgages, 
credit card loans, and other retail loans such as revolving 
consumer lines, auto loans and leases, home equity loans and 
lines, and student loans, a run-off portfolio. Home equity or 

second mortgage loans are junior lien closed-end accounts fully 
disbursed at origination. These loans typically are fixed rate loans, 
secured by residential real estate, with a 10- or 15-year fixed 
payment amortization schedule. Home equity lines are revolving 
accounts giving the borrower the ability to draw and repay 
balances repeatedly, up to a maximum commitment, and are 
secured by residential real estate. These include accounts in 
either a first or junior lien position. Typical terms on home equity 
lines in the portfolio are variable rates benchmarked to the prime 
rate, with a 10- or 15-year draw period during which a minimum 
payment is equivalent to the monthly interest, followed by a 20-
or 10-year amortization period, respectively. At December 31, 
2022, substantially all of the Company’s home equity lines were 
in the draw period. Key risk characteristics relevant to consumer 
lending segment loans primarily relate to the borrowers’ capacity 
and willingness to repay and include unemployment rates, 
consumer bankruptcy filings and other macroeconomic factors, 
customer payment history and credit scores, and in some cases, 
updated loan-to-value (“LTV”) information reflecting current 
market conditions on real estate-based loans. These and other 
risk characteristics are reflected in forecasts of delinquency levels, 
bankruptcies and losses which are the primary factors in 
determining the allowance for credit losses for the consumer 
lending segment. 

The Company further disaggregates its loan portfolio 
segments into various classes based on their underlying risk 
characteristics. The two classes within the commercial lending 
segment are commercial loans and commercial real estate loans. 
The three classes within the consumer lending segment are 
residential mortgages, credit card loans and other retail loans. 

Because business processes and credit risks associated with 

unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as for 
loans, the Company utilizes similar processes to estimate its 
liability for unfunded credit commitments. The Company also 
engages in non-lending activities that may give rise to credit risk, 
including derivative transactions for balance sheet hedging 
purposes, foreign exchange transactions, deposit overdrafts and 
interest rate contracts for customers, investments in securities 
and other financial assets, and settlement risk, including 
Automated Clearing House transactions and the processing of 
credit card transactions for merchants. These activities are 
subject to credit review, analysis and approval processes. 

Economic and Other Factors In evaluating its credit risk, the 
Company considers changes, if any, in underwriting activities, the 
loan portfolio composition (including product mix and geographic, 
industry or customer-specific concentrations), collateral values, 
trends in loan performance and macroeconomic factors, such as 
changes in unemployment rates, gross domestic product levels, 
inflation, interest rates and consumer bankruptcy filings. 

During 2021, factors affecting economic conditions, including 

the further enactment of government stimulus programs and 
declining impacts from the pandemic in the United States, 
contributed to economic improvement. During 2022, economic 

37 

uncertainty and recession risk increased due to ongoing supply 
chain challenges, rising interest rates and inflationary concerns, 
market volatility, rising energy prices resulting from the Russia-
Ukraine conflict and related pressure on corporate earnings. In 
addition to these broad economic factors, expected loss 
estimates consider various factors including customer specific 
information impacting changes in risk ratings, projected 
delinquencies, potential effects of inflationary pressures and the 
impact of rising interest rates on selected borrowers’ liquidity and 
ability to repay. 

Credit Diversification The Company manages its credit risk, in 
part, through diversification of its loan portfolio which is achieved 
through limit setting by product type criteria, such as industry, 
and identification of credit concentrations. As part of its normal 
business activities, the Company offers a broad array of 
traditional commercial lending products and specialized products 
such as asset-based lending, commercial lease financing, 
agricultural credit, warehouse mortgage lending, small business 
lending, commercial real estate lending, health care lending and 
correspondent banking financing. The Company also offers an 
array of consumer lending products, including residential 
mortgages, credit card loans, auto loans, retail leases, home 
equity loans and lines, revolving credit arrangements and other 
consumer loans. These consumer lending products are primarily 
offered through the branch office network, home mortgage and 
loan production offices, mobile and on-line banking, and indirect 
distribution channels, such as auto and recreational vehicle 
dealers. The Company monitors and manages the portfolio 
diversification by industry, customer and geography. Table 6 
provides information with respect to the overall product 
diversification and changes in the mix during 2022. 

The commercial loan class is diversified among various 
industries with higher concentrations in real estate and financial 
institutions. Additionally, the commercial loan class is diversified 
across the Company’s geographical markets, with a higher 
concentration in California. Table 8 provides a summary of 
significant industry groups and geographical locations of 
commercial loans outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
The commercial real estate loan class reflects the Company’s 
focus on serving business owners within its local network, as well 
as regional and national investment-based real estate owners and 
developers. Within the commercial real estate loan class, different 
property types have varying degrees of credit risk. Table 9 
provides a summary of the significant property types and 
geographical locations of commercial real estate loans 
outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021. Commercial real 
estate loans are diversified among various property types with 
higher concentrations in business owner-occupied, multi-family 
and office properties. 

The Company’s consumer lending segment utilizes several 
distinct business processes and channels to originate consumer 
credit, including traditional branch lending, mobile and on-line 
banking, indirect lending, alliance partnerships and 
correspondent banks. Each distinct underwriting and origination 

38 

activity manages unique credit risk characteristics and prices its 
loan production commensurate with the differing risk profiles. 
Residential mortgage originations are generally limited to 
prime borrowers and are performed through the Company’s 
branches, loan production offices, mobile and on-line services, 
and a wholesale network of originators. The Company may retain 
residential mortgage loans it originates on its balance sheet or sell 
the loans into the secondary market while retaining the servicing 
rights and customer relationships. Utilizing the secondary markets 
enables the Company to effectively reduce its credit and other 
asset/liability risks. For residential mortgages that are retained in 
the Company’s portfolio and for home equity and second 
mortgages, credit risk is managed by adherence to LTV and 
borrower credit criteria during the underwriting process. 

The Company estimates updated LTV information on its 
outstanding residential mortgages quarterly, based on a method 
that combines automated valuation model updates and relevant 
home price indices. LTV is the ratio of the loan’s outstanding 
principal balance to the current estimate of property value. For 
home equity and second mortgages, combined loan-to-value 
(“CLTV”) is the combination of the first mortgage original principal 
balance and the second lien outstanding principal balance, 
relative to the current estimate of property value. Certain loans do 
not have an LTV or CLTV, primarily due to lack of availability of 
relevant automated valuation model and/or home price indices 
values, or lack of necessary valuation data on acquired loans.

mortgages and home equity and second mortgages by LTV at

card portfolio is achieved with broad customer relationship 
distribution through the Company’s and financial institution 
partners’ branches, retail and affinity partners, and digital 
channels. 

Tables 10, 11 and 12 provide a geographical summary of the 
residential mortgage, credit card and other retail loan portfolios, 
respectively. 

The following table provides a summary of the Company’s 
credit card loan balances disaggregated based upon updated

(a)  Credit score distribution excludes loans serviced by others. 

Home equity and second mortgages were $12.9 billion at 

December 31, 2022, compared with $10.4 billion at 
December 31, 2021, and included $2.9 billion of home equity 
lines in a first lien position and $10.0 billion of home equity and 
second mortgage loans and lines in a junior lien position. Loans 
and lines in a junior lien position at December 31, 2022, included 
approximately $3.3 billion of loans and lines for which the 
Company also serviced the related first lien loan, and 
approximately $6.7 billion where the Company did not service the 
related first lien loan. The Company was able to determine the 
status of the related first liens using information the Company has 
as the servicer of the first lien or information reported on 
customer credit bureau files. The Company also evaluates other 
indicators of credit risk for these junior lien loans and lines, 
including delinquency, estimated average CLTV ratios and 
updated weighted-average credit scores in making its 
assessment of credit risk, related loss estimates and determining 
the allowance for credit losses.

(a)  Delinquent loan ratios exclude $2.2 billion and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, of loans purchased and loans that could be purchased from GNMA mortgage pools 
under delinquent loan repurchase options whose repayments are primarily insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. 
Including these loans, the ratio of residential mortgages 90 days or more past due and nonperforming to total residential mortgages was 2.28 percent and 2.43 percent at December 31, 2022 
and 2021, respectively. 

Loan Delinquencies Trends in delinquency ratios are an 
indicator, among other considerations, of credit risk within the 
Company’s loan portfolios. The entire balance of a loan account 
is considered delinquent if the minimum payment contractually 
required to be made is not received by the date specified on the 
billing statement. Delinquent loans purchased and loans that 
could be purchased from GNMA mortgage pools under 
delinquent loan repurchase options whose repayments are 
primarily insured by the Federal Housing Administration or 
guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, 
are excluded from delinquency statistics. In addition, in certain 
situations, a consumer lending customer’s account may be 
re-aged to remove it from delinquent status. Generally, the 
purpose of re-aging accounts is to assist customers who have 
recently overcome temporary financial difficulties and have 
demonstrated both the ability and willingness to resume regular 
payments. In addition, the Company may re-age the consumer 
lending account of a customer who has experienced longer-term 

financial difficulties and apply modified, concessionary terms and 
conditions to the account. Commercial lending loans are 
generally not subject to re-aging policies. 

Accruing loans 90 days or more past due totaled $491 million 

at December 31, 2022, and included $22 million of accruing 
loans 90 days or more past due acquired as part of the MUB 
acquisition, compared with $472 million at December 31, 2021. 
Accruing loans 90 days or more past due are not included in 
nonperforming assets and continue to accrue interest because 
they are adequately secured by collateral, are in the process of 
collection and are reasonably expected to result in repayment or 
restoration to current status, or are managed in homogeneous 
portfolios with specified charge-off timeframes adhering to 
regulatory guidelines. The ratio of accruing loans 90 days or more 
past due to total loans was 0.13 percent at December 31, 2022, 
compared with 0.15 percent at December 31, 2021.

(a)  Excludes $647 million of loans 30-89 days past due and $2.2 billion of loans 90 days or 
more past due at December 31, 2022, purchased and that could be purchased from 
GNMA mortgage pools under delinquent loan repurchase options that continue to accrue 
interest, compared with $791 million and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2021. 

(b)  Includes revolving credit, installment and automobile loans. 

Restructured Loans In certain circumstances, the Company 
may modify the terms of a loan to maximize the collection of 
amounts due when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties 
or is expected to experience difficulties in the near-term. In most 
cases the modification is either a concessionary reduction in 
interest rate, extension of the maturity date or reduction in the 
principal balance that would otherwise not be considered. 

Troubled Debt Restructurings Concessionary modifications are 
classified as TDRs unless the modification results in only an 
insignificant delay in the payments to be received. TDRs accrue 

interest if the borrower complies with the revised terms and 
conditions and has demonstrated repayment performance at a 
level commensurate with the modified terms over several 
payment cycles, which is generally six months or greater. At 
December 31, 2022, performing TDRs were $3.3 billion, 
compared with $3.1 billion at December 31, 2021. 

The Company continues to work with customers to modify 
loans for borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties. 
Many of the Company’s TDRs are determined on a case-by-case 
basis in connection with ongoing loan collection processes. The 
modifications vary within each of the Company’s loan classes. 
Commercial lending segment TDRs generally include extensions 
of the maturity date and may be accompanied by an increase or 
decrease to the interest rate. The Company may also work with 
the borrower to make other changes to the loan to mitigate 
losses, such as obtaining additional collateral and/or guarantees 
to support the loan. 

The Company has also implemented certain residential 
mortgage loan restructuring programs that may result in TDRs. 
The Company modifies residential mortgage loans under Federal 
Housing Administration, United States Department of Veterans 
Affairs, and its own internal programs. Under these programs, the 
Company offers qualifying homeowners the opportunity to 
permanently modify their loan and achieve more affordable 
monthly payments by providing loan concessions. These 
concessions may include adjustments to interest rates, 
conversion of adjustable rates to fixed rates, extensions of 
maturity dates or deferrals of payments, capitalization of accrued 
interest and/or outstanding advances, or in limited situations, 
partial forgiveness of loan principal. In most instances, 
participation in residential mortgage loan restructuring programs 
requires the customer to complete a short-term trial period. A 
permanent loan modification is contingent on the customer 
successfully completing the trial period arrangement, and the loan 
documents are not modified until that time. The Company reports 
loans in a trial period arrangement as TDRs and continues to 
report them as TDRs after the trial period. 

Credit card and other retail loan TDRs are generally part of 
distinct restructuring programs providing customers modification 
solutions over a specified time period, generally up to 60 months. 

In accordance with regulatory guidance, the Company 

considers secured consumer loans that have had debt 
discharged through bankruptcy where the borrower has not 
reaffirmed the debt to be TDRs. If the loan amount exceeds the 
collateral value, the loan is charged down to collateral value and 
the remaining amount is reported as nonperforming.

business credit cards with a modified rate equal to 0 percent.

(c)  Primarily represents loans with a modified rate equal to 0 percent. 
(d)  Includes $205 million of residential mortgage loans to borrowers that have had debt discharged through bankruptcy and $18 million in trial period arrangements or previously placed in trial 

period arrangements but not successfully completed. 

(e)  Includes $52 million of other retail loans to borrowers that have had debt discharged through bankruptcy and $13 million in trial period arrangements or previously placed in trial period 

(f)

Includes $155 million of Federal Housing Administration and United States Department of Veterans Affairs residential mortgage loans to borrowers that have had debt discharged through 
bankruptcy and $105 million in trial period arrangements or previously placed in trial period arrangements but not successfully completed. 

(g)  Approximately 6.8 percent and 32.4 percent of the total TDR loans purchased from GNMA mortgage pools are 30-89 days past due and 90 days or more past due, respectively, but are not 

classified as delinquent as their repayments are insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. 

Short-term and Other Loan Modifications The Company 
makes short-term and other modifications that it does not 
consider to be TDRs, in limited circumstances, to assist 
borrowers experiencing temporary hardships, including previously 
offering payment relief to borrowers that experienced financial 
hardship resulting directly from the effects of the COVID-19 
pandemic. Short-term consumer lending modification programs 
include payment reductions, deferrals of up to three past due 
payments, and the ability to return to current status if the 
borrower makes required payments. The Company may also 
make short-term modifications to commercial lending loans, with 
the most common modification being an extension of the maturity 
date of three months or less. Such extensions generally are used 
when the maturity date is imminent and the borrower is 
experiencing some level of financial stress, but the Company 
believes the borrower will pay all contractual amounts owed. 

Nonperforming Assets The level of nonperforming assets 
represents another indicator of the potential for future credit 
losses. Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, 
restructured loans not performing in accordance with modified 
terms and not accruing interest, restructured loans that have not 
met the performance period required to return to accrual status, 
other real estate owned (“OREO”) and other nonperforming 

assets owned by the Company. Interest payments collected from 
assets on nonaccrual status are generally applied against the 
principal balance and not recorded as income. However, interest 
income may be recognized for interest payments if the remaining 
carrying amount of the loan is believed to be collectible. 

At December 31, 2022, total nonperforming assets were 
$1.0 billion, and included $329 million of nonperforming loans 
related to the MUB acquisition, compared with $878 million at 
December 31, 2021. The $138 million (15.7 percent) increase in 
nonperforming assets, from December 31, 2021 to 
December 31, 2022, was driven by acquired balances partially 
offset by decreases in legacy portfolio nonperforming loans 
across all loan classes. The ratio of total nonperforming assets to 
total loans and other real estate was 0.26 percent at 
December 31, 2022, compared with 0.28 percent at 
December 31, 2021. 

OREO was $23 million at December 31, 2022, compared with 
$22 million at December 31, 2021, and was related to foreclosed 
properties that previously secured loan balances. These balances 
exclude foreclosed GNMA loans whose repayments are primarily 
insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by 
the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.

Analysis of Loan Net Charge-offs Total loan net charge-offs 

were $1.1 billion in 2022, compared with $682 million in 2021. 
The $381 million (55.9 percent) increase in total net charge-offs in 
2022, compared with 2021, reflected $179 million of uncollectible 
MUB acquired loans, of which the majority of this balance related 
to loans that were previously charged-off by MUB, as well as 
$189 million of net charge-offs related to balance sheet 
repositioning and capital management actions taken during the 
fourth quarter of 2022 in connection with the acquisition. These 
increases in net charge-offs were partially offset by lower credit 
card net charge-offs in the legacy portfolio. The ratio of total loan 
net charge-offs to average loans outstanding, including the 
impacts of the acquisition, was 0.32 percent in 2022, compared 
with 0.23 percent in 2021. 

Commercial and commercial real estate loan net charge-offs 

for 2022 were $264 million (0.16 percent of average loans 
outstanding), compared with $105 million (0.07 percent of 
average loans outstanding) in 2021. The increase in net charge-
offs in 2022, compared with 2021, were driven primarily by MUB 
purchase accounting related net charge-offs of $143 million. 

Residential mortgage loan net charge-offs for 2022 reflected a 

net recovery of $23 million (0.03 percent of average loans 
outstanding), compared with a net recovery of $32 million 
(0.04 percent of average loans outstanding) in 2021. Credit card 
loan net charge-offs in 2022 were $524 million (2.23 percent of 
average loans outstanding), compared with $512 million 
(2.37 percent of average loans outstanding) in 2021. Other retail 
loan net charge-offs for 2022 were $298 million (0.49 percent of 
average loans outstanding), compared with $97 million 
(0.16 percent of average loans outstanding) in 2021. The increase 
in total residential mortgage, credit card and other retail loan net 
charge-offs in 2022, compared with 2021, was driven by charge-
offs related to the balance sheet repositioning and capital 
management actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2022, along 

with MUB purchase accounting related net charge-offs, partially 
offset by lower net charge-offs in the legacy portfolio. 

Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Credit 
Losses The allowance for credit losses is established for current 
expected credit losses on the Company’s loan and lease 
portfolio, including unfunded credit commitments. The allowance 
considers expected losses for the remaining lives of the 
applicable assets, inclusive of expected recoveries. The 
allowance for credit losses is increased through provisions 
charged to earnings and reduced by net charge-offs. 

Management evaluates the appropriateness of the allowance 
for credit losses on a quarterly basis. Multiple economic scenarios 
are considered over a three-year reasonable and supportable 
forecast period, which includes increasing consideration of 
historical loss experience over years two and three. These 
economic scenarios are constructed with interrelated projections 
of multiple economic variables, and loss estimates are produced 
that consider the historical correlation of those economic 
variables with credit losses. After the forecast period, the 
Company fully reverts to long-term historical loss experience, 
adjusted for prepayments and characteristics of the current loan 
and lease portfolio, to estimate losses over the remaining life of 
the portfolio. The economic scenarios are updated at least 
quarterly and are designed to provide a range of reasonable 
estimates from better to worse than current expectations. 
Scenarios are weighted based on the Company’s expectation of 
economic conditions for the foreseeable future and reflect 
significant judgment and consideration of economic forecast 
uncertainty. Final loss estimates also consider factors affecting 
credit losses not reflected in the scenarios, due to the unique 
aspects of current conditions and expectations. These factors 
may include, but are not limited to, loan servicing practices, 
regulatory guidance, and/or fiscal and monetary policy actions. 

44 

Because business processes and credit risks associated with 

unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as for 
loans, the Company utilizes similar processes to estimate its 
liability for unfunded credit commitments, which is included in 
other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Both the 
allowance for loan losses and the liability for unfunded credit 
commitments are included in the Company’s analysis of credit 
losses and reported reserve ratios. 

The allowance recorded for credit losses utilizes forward-
looking expected loss models to consider a variety of factors 
affecting lifetime credit losses. These factors include, but are not 
limited to, macroeconomic variables such as unemployment 
rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels, inflation, 
interest rates, and corporate bond spreads, as well as loan and 
borrower characteristics, such as internal risk ratings on 
commercial loans and consumer credit scores, delinquency 
status, collateral type and available valuation information, 
consideration of end-of-term losses on lease residuals, and the 
remaining term of the loan, adjusted for expected prepayments. 
For each loan portfolio, model estimates are adjusted as 
necessary to consider any relevant changes in portfolio 
composition, lending policies, underwriting standards, risk 
management practices, economic conditions or other factors that 
may affect the accuracy of the model. Expected credit loss 
estimates also include consideration of expected cash recoveries 
on loans previously charged-off or expected recoveries on 
collateral-dependent loans where recovery is expected through 
sale of the collateral. Where loans do not exhibit similar risk 
characteristics, an individual analysis is performed to consider 
expected credit losses. 

The allowance recorded for individually evaluated loans 
greater than $5 million in the commercial lending segment is 
based on an analysis utilizing expected cash flows discounted 
using the original effective interest rate, the observable market 
price of the loan, or the fair value of the collateral, less selling 
costs, for collateral-dependent loans as appropriate. For 
commercial TDRs individually evaluated for impairment, attributes 
of the borrower are the primary factors in determining the 
allowance for credit losses. For smaller commercial loans 
collectively evaluated for impairment, historical loss experience is 
also incorporated into the allowance methodology applied to this 
category of loans. 

The allowance recorded for TDR loans in the consumer 
lending segment is determined on a homogenous pool basis 
utilizing expected cash flows discounted using the original 
effective interest rate of the pool. The expected cash flows on 
TDR loans consider subsequent payment defaults since 
modification, the borrower’s ability to pay under the restructured 
terms, and the timing and amount of payments. The allowance 
for collateral-dependent loans in the consumer lending segment 
is determined based on the current fair value of the collateral less 
costs to sell. 

When evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for 
credit losses for any loans and lines in a junior lien position, the 
Company considers the delinquency and modification status of 

the first lien. At December 31, 2022, the Company serviced the 
first lien on 33 percent of the home equity loans and lines in a 
junior lien position. The Company also considers the status of first 
lien mortgage accounts reported on customer credit bureau files 
when the first lien is not serviced by the Company. Regardless of 
whether the Company services the first lien, an assessment is 
made of economic conditions, problem loans, recent loss 
experience and other factors in determining the allowance for 
credit losses. Based on the available information, the Company 
estimated $195 million or 1.5 percent of its total home equity 
portfolio at December 31, 2022, represented non-delinquent 
junior liens where the first lien was delinquent or modified. 

When a loan portfolio is purchased, the acquired loans are 

divided into those considered purchased with more than 
insignificant credit deterioration (“PCD”) and those not considered 
PCD. An allowance is established for each population and 
considers product mix, risk characteristics of the portfolio and 
delinquency status and refreshed LTV ratios when possible. PCD 
loans also consider whether the loan has experienced a 
charge-off, bankruptcy or significant deterioration since 
origination. The allowance established for purchased loans not 
considered PCD is recognized through provision expense upon 
acquisition, whereas the allowance established for loans 
considered PCD at acquisition is offset by an increase in the 
basis of the acquired loans. Any subsequent increases and 
decreases in the allowance related to purchased loans, 
regardless of PCD status, are recognized through provision 
expense, with charge-offs charged to the allowance. The 
Company had a total unpaid principal balance of $5.1 billion of 
PCD loans, primarily related to the MUB acquisition, included in 
its loan portfolio at December 31, 2022. 

The Company’s methodology for determining the appropriate 

allowance for credit losses also considers the imprecision 
inherent in the methodologies used and allocated to the various 
loan portfolios. As a result, amounts determined under the 
methodologies described above are adjusted by management to 
consider the potential impact of other qualitative factors not 
captured in quantitative model adjustments which include, but are 
not limited to, the following: model imprecision, imprecision in 
economic scenario assumptions, and emerging risks related to 
either changes in the economic environment that are affecting 
specific portfolios, or changes in portfolio concentrations over 
time that may affect model performance. The consideration of 
these items results in adjustments to allowance amounts included 
in the Company’s allowance for credit losses for each loan 
portfolio. 

The results of the analysis are evaluated quarterly to confirm 

the estimates are appropriate for each loan portfolio. Table 19 
shows the amount of the allowance for credit losses by loan class 
and underlying portfolio category. 

Although the Company determined the amount of each element 

of the allowance separately and considers this process to be an 
important credit management tool, the entire allowance for credit 
losses is available for the entire loan portfolio. The actual amount of 
losses can vary significantly from the estimated amounts. 

45 

At December 31, 2022, the allowance for credit losses was 

$7.4 billion, compared with an allowance of $6.2 billion at 
December 31, 2021. The increase in the allowance for credit 
losses of $1.2 billion (20.3 percent) at December 31, 2022, 
compared with December 31, 2021, included $336 million of 
initial allowance recorded through purchase accounting as well as 
the provision for credit losses of $662 million related to acquired 
loans from MUB, along with loan growth in the legacy portfolio 
and increased economic uncertainty. 

The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period-end loans 

was 1.91 percent at December 31, 2022, compared with 
1.97 percent at December 31, 2021. The ratio of the allowance 
for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 762 percent at 
December 31, 2022, compared with 738 percent at 

December 31, 2021. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses 
to annual loan net charge-offs at December 31, 2022, was 
697 percent, compared with 902 percent at December 31, 2021. 
Management determined the allowance for credit losses was 
appropriate on December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

Economic conditions considered in estimating the allowance 

for credit losses at December 31, 2022 included changes in 
projected gross domestic product and unemployment levels. 
These factors are evaluated through a combination of quantitative 
calculations using multiple economic scenarios and additional 
qualitative assessments that consider the high degree of 
economic uncertainty in the current environment. The projected 
unemployment rates for 2023 considered in the estimate range 
from 3.5 percent to 8.4 percent. 

The following table summarizes the baseline forecast for key economic variables the Company used in its estimate of the allowance for 
credit losses at December 31, 2022 and 2021:

December 31, 2022, due to the impacts of the MUB acquisition, 
loan growth and economic uncertainty, along with the effects of 
higher interest rates on the life of the residential mortgage 
portfolios and normalizing credit trends in the unsecured 
portfolios.

Residual Value Risk Management The Company manages its 
risk to changes in the residual value of leased vehicles, office and 
business equipment, and other assets through disciplined 
residual valuation at the inception of a lease, diversification of its 
leased assets, regular residual asset valuation reviews and 
monitoring of residual value gains or losses upon the disposition 
of assets. Lease originations are subject to the same well-defined 
underwriting standards referred to in the “Credit Risk 
Management” section, which includes an evaluation of the 
residual value risk. Retail lease residual value risk is mitigated 
further by effective end-of-term marketing of off-lease vehicles. 
Included in the retail leasing portfolio was approximately 
$4.4 billion of retail leasing residuals at December 31, 2022, 
compared with $5.6 billion at December 31, 2021. The Company 
monitors concentrations of leases by manufacturer and vehicle 
type. As of December 31, 2022, vehicle lease residuals related to 
sport utility vehicles were 49.9 percent of the portfolio, while truck 
and crossover utility vehicle classes represented approximately 
29.2 percent and 14.7 percent of the portfolio, respectively. At 
year-end 2022, the individual vehicle model with the largest 
residual value outstanding represented 19.8 percent of the 
aggregate residual value of all vehicles in the portfolio. At 
December 31, 2022, the weighted-average origination term of the 
portfolio was 42 months, compared with 41 months at 
December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2022, the commercial 
leasing portfolio had $500 million of residuals, compared with 
$515 million at December 31, 2021. At year-end 2022, lease 
residuals related to trucks and other transportation equipment 
represented 36.1 percent of the total residual portfolio, while 
business and office equipment represented 29.3 percent. 

Operational Risk Management. The Company operates in 
many different businesses in diverse markets and relies on the 
ability of its employees and systems to process a high number of 
transactions. Operational risk is inherent in all business activities, 

and the management of this risk is important to the achievement 
of the Company’s objectives. Business lines have direct and 
primary responsibility and accountability for identifying, 
controlling, and monitoring operational risks embedded in their 
business activities, including those additional or increased risks 
created by economic and financial disruptions. The Company 
maintains a system of controls with the objective of providing 
proper transaction authorization and execution, proper system 
operations, proper oversight of third parties with whom it does 
business, safeguarding of assets from misuse or theft, and 
ensuring the reliability and security of financial and other data. 

Business continuation and disaster recovery planning is also 
critical to effectively managing operational risks. Each business 
unit of the Company is required to develop, maintain and test 
these plans at least annually to ensure that recovery activities, if 
needed, can support mission critical functions, including 
technology, networks and data centers supporting customer 
applications and business operations. 

While the Company believes it has designed effective 
processes to minimize operational risks, there is no absolute 
assurance that business disruption or operational losses would 
not occur from an external event or internal control breakdown. 
On an ongoing basis, management makes process changes and 
investments to enhance its systems of internal controls and 
business continuity and disaster recovery plans. 

In the past, the Company has experienced attack attempts on 
its computer systems, including various denial-of-service attacks 
on customer-facing websites. The Company has not experienced 
any material losses relating to these attempts, as a result of its 
controls, processes and systems to protect its networks, 
computers, software and data from attack, damage or 
unauthorized access but future attacks could be more disruptive 
or damaging. Attack attempts on the Company’s computer 
systems are evolving and increasing, and the Company continues 

48 

to develop and enhance its controls and processes to protect 
against these attempts. 

Compliance Risk Management The Company may suffer legal 
or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, or damage to its 
reputation through failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, 
standards of good practice, and codes of conduct, including 
those related to compliance with Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money 
laundering requirements, sanctions compliance requirements as 
administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, consumer 
protection and other requirements. The Company has controls 
and processes in place for the assessment, identification, 
monitoring, management and reporting of compliance risks and 
issues, including those created or increased by economic and 
financial disruptions. Refer to “Supervision and Regulation” in the 
Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended 
December 31, 2022, for further discussion of the regulatory 
framework applicable to bank holding companies and their 
subsidiaries. 

Interest Rate Risk Management In the banking industry, 
changes in interest rates are a significant risk that can impact 
earnings and the safety and soundness of an entity. The Company 
manages its exposure to changes in interest rates through asset 
and liability management activities within guidelines established by 
its Asset Liability Management Committee (“ALCO”) and approved 
by the Board of Directors. The ALCO has the responsibility for 
approving and overseeing compliance with the ALCO 
management policies, including interest rate risk exposure. One 
way the Company measures and analyzes its interest rate risk is 
through net interest income simulation analysis. 

Simulation analysis incorporates substantially all of the 

Company’s assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet 
instruments, together with forecasted changes in the balance 
sheet and assumptions that reflect the current interest rate 
environment. Through this simulation, management estimates the 
impact on net interest income of various interest rate changes 
that differ in the direction, amount and speed of change over 
time, as well as the shape of the yield curve. This simulation 
includes assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to be 
affected by changes in loan and deposit growth. Assumptions are 
made to project interest rates for new loans and deposits based 
on historical analysis, management’s outlook and re-pricing 
strategies. These assumptions are reviewed and validated on a 
periodic basis with sensitivity analysis being provided for key 
variables of the simulation. The results are reviewed monthly by 
the ALCO and are used to guide asset/liability management 
strategies. 

TABLE 20  Sensitivity of Net Interest Income 

The Company manages its interest rate risk position by 

holding assets with desired interest rate risk characteristics on its 
balance sheet, implementing certain pricing strategies for loans 
and deposits and selecting derivatives and various funding and 
investment portfolio strategies. 

Table 20 summarizes the projected impact to net interest 
income over the next 12 months of various potential interest rate 
changes. The sensitivity of the projected impact to net interest 
income over the next 12 months is dependent on balance sheet 
growth, product mix, deposit behavior, pricing and funding 
decisions. While the Company utilizes models and assumptions 
based on historical information and expected behaviors, actual 
outcomes could vary significantly. Net interest income sensitivities 
reflect the impact of current market expectations for interest rates, 
driving an increase in baseline projected net interest income. As 
market expectations are reflected in projected results, incremental 
interest rate sensitivity declines on a percentage basis. 

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and Other Risks 
To manage the sensitivity of earnings and capital to interest rate, 
prepayment, credit, price and foreign currency fluctuations (asset 
and liability management positions), the Company enters into 
derivative transactions. The Company uses derivatives for asset 
and liability management purposes primarily in the following ways: 

– To convert fixed-rate debt and available-for-sale investment 

securities from fixed-rate payments to floating-rate payments; 

– To convert floating-rate loans and debt from floating-rate 

payments to fixed-rate payments; 

– To mitigate changes in value of the Company’s unfunded 
mortgage loan commitments, funded MLHFS and MSRs; 

– To mitigate remeasurement volatility of foreign currency 

denominated balances; and 

– To mitigate the volatility of the Company’s net investment in 
foreign operations driven by fluctuations in foreign currency 
exchange rates. 

In addition, the Company enters into interest rate and foreign 

exchange derivative contracts to support the business 
requirements of its customers (customer-related positions). The 
Company minimizes the market and liquidity risks of customer-
related positions by either entering into similar offsetting positions 
with broker-dealers, or on a portfolio basis by entering into other 
derivative or non-derivative financial instruments that partially or 
fully offset the exposure from these customer-related positions. 
The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are either 
exchange-traded, centrally cleared through clearinghouses or 
over-the-counter. The Company does not utilize derivatives for 
speculative purposes.

The Company does not designate all of the derivatives that it 
enters into for risk management purposes as accounting hedges 
because of the inefficiency of applying the accounting 
requirements and may instead elect fair value accounting for the 
related hedged items. In particular, the Company enters into 
interest rate swaps, swaptions, forward commitments to buy 
to-be-announced securities (“TBAs”), U.S. Treasury and 
Eurodollar futures and options on U.S. Treasury futures to 
mitigate fluctuations in the value of its MSRs, but does not 
designate those derivatives as accounting hedges. Refer to 
Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for 
additional information regarding MSRs, including management of 
the changes in fair value. 

Additionally, the Company uses forward commitments to sell 
TBAs and other commitments to sell residential mortgage loans 
at specified prices to economically hedge the interest rate risk in 
its residential mortgage loan production activities. The forward 
commitments to sell and the unfunded mortgage loan 
commitments on loans intended to be sold are considered 
derivatives under the accounting guidance related to accounting 
for derivative instruments and hedging activities. The Company 
has elected the fair value option for the MLHFS. 

Derivatives are subject to credit risk associated with 
counterparties to the contracts. Credit risk associated with 
derivatives is measured by the Company based on the probability 
of counterparty default. The Company manages the credit risk of 
its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various 
counterparties, by entering into master netting arrangements, 
and, where possible, by requiring collateral arrangements. The 
Company may also transfer counterparty credit risk related to 
interest rate swaps to third parties through the use of risk 
participation agreements. In addition, certain interest rate swaps, 
interest rate forwards and credit contracts are required to be 
centrally cleared through clearinghouses to further mitigate 
counterparty credit risk. The Company may mitigate credit risk on 
loans or lending portfolios through the use of credit contracts. 
For additional information on derivatives and hedging 

activities, refer to Notes 20 and 21 in the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements. 

LIBOR Transition In July 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial 
Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) announced that it would no longer 
require banks to submit rates for the London InterBank Offered 
Rate (“LIBOR”) after 2021. In March 2021, the FCA and the 
administrator of LIBOR announced that, with respect to the most 
commonly used tenors of United States Dollar LIBOR, LIBOR will 
no longer be published on a representative basis after 
June 30, 2023. The publication of all other tenors of United 
States Dollar LIBOR, as well as all non-United States Dollar 
LIBOR tenors, ceased to be provided or ceased to be 
representative after December 31, 2021. The Company holds 
financial instruments impacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR, 
including certain loans, investment securities, derivatives, 
borrowings and other financial instruments that use LIBOR as the 
benchmark rate. The Company also provides various services to 

customers in its capacities as trustee, servicer, and asset 
manager, which involve financial instruments that will be similarly 
impacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR. 

In order to facilitate the transition process, the Company has 

instituted a LIBOR Transition Office and commenced an 
enterprise-wide project to (1) identify, assess, monitor and 
mitigate risks associated with the expected discontinuance or 
unavailability of LIBOR, (2) actively engage with industry working 
groups and regulators, (3) develop and implement training and 
education materials with respect to LIBOR and its discontinuance 
for the Company and for customers, (4) achieve operational 
readiness for the use of alternative reference rates (“ARRs”) in 
new financial instruments and transition existing LIBOR financial 
instruments to ARRs, (5) develop and implement customer 
notification programs across the Company and engage impacted 
customers to remediate and transition impacted instruments, and 
(6) develop reporting on remediation of LIBOR instruments across 
the Company for both internal and external stakeholders. The 
Company has also invested in updating its systems, models, 
procedures and internal infrastructure as part of the transition 
program. 

The Company transitioned its financial instruments associated 

to LIBOR currencies and tenors that ceased or became 
nonrepresentative on December 31, 2021, to ARRs, with limited 
exceptions. Additionally, in alignment with guidance from United 
States banking agencies and the FCA, the Company has ceased 
the use of LIBOR as a reference rate in new contracts, with 
limited exceptions, and continues to increase the usage of ARRs 
such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). The 
Company also anticipates that additional financial instruments 
associated with the remaining United States Dollar LIBOR tenors 
will require transition to a new reference rate by June 30, 2023. 
The Company has been undergoing an enterprise-wide effort to 
proactively reprice LIBOR loans and derivatives that mature after 
June 30, 2023, with customers to an ARR. The Company has 
also adopted industry best practice guidelines for fallback 
language for new transactions, converted its cleared interest rate 
swaps discounting to SOFR discounting, and distributed 
communications related to the transition to certain impacted 
parties, both inside and outside the Company. 

The Company’s MUB acquisition impacts the execution of the 
Company’s LIBOR transition strategies and execution plans. The 
Company is currently assessing MUB’s LIBOR transition 
program, remediation strategies, and preparedness to execute 
on remediation strategies. In certain instances, the Company and 
MUB have different remediation strategies. As a result, the 
Company is updating its LIBOR transition plans to ensure that the 
Company can execute remediation plans across all products and 
business units, including with respect to MUB. 

The Company is currently assessing the applicability and 
scope of the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the “LIBOR 
Act”), which was enacted on March 15, 2022, and the 
Regulations Implementing the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) 
Act (Regulation ZZ) (the “Final Rules”), which were implemented 

50 

on December 16, 2022. The LIBOR Act and Final Rules establish 
a process for replacing LIBOR in existing LIBOR contracts that do 
not provide for the use of a clearly defined or practicable 
replacement benchmark rate by providing that a benchmark 
replacement identified by the Federal Reserve Board that is 
based on SOFR will replace LIBOR as the benchmark for those 
contracts as a matter of law, without the need to be amended by 
the parties. The Company is currently assessing its outstanding 
LIBOR portfolio to determine the eligibility of certain financial 
instruments for the LIBOR Act and will incorporate the LIBOR Act 
as a remediation strategy where prudent. Refer to “Risk Factors” 
beginning on page 140, for further discussion on potential risks 
that could adversely affect the Company’s financial results as a 
result of the LIBOR transition. 

Market Risk Management In addition to interest rate risk, the 
Company is exposed to other forms of market risk, principally 
related to trading activities which support customers’ strategies 
to manage their own foreign currency, interest rate risk and 
funding activities. For purposes of its internal capital adequacy 
assessment process, the Company considers risk arising from its 
trading activities, as well as the remeasurement volatility of foreign 
currency denominated balances included on its Consolidated 
Balance Sheet (collectively, “Covered Positions”), employing 
methodologies consistent with the requirements of regulatory 
rules for market risk. The Company’s Market Risk Committee 
(“MRC”), within the framework of the ALCO, oversees market risk 
management. The MRC monitors and reviews the Company’s 
Covered Positions and establishes policies for market risk 
management, including exposure limits for each portfolio. The 
Company uses a VaR approach to measure general market risk. 
Theoretically, VaR represents the statistical risk of loss the 
Company has to adverse market movements over a one-day time 
horizon. The Company uses the Historical Simulation method to 
calculate VaR for its Covered Positions measured at the ninety-
ninth percentile using a one-year look-back period for 
distributions derived from past market data. The market factors 
used in the calculations include those pertinent to market risks 
inherent in the underlying trading portfolios, principally those that 
affect the Company’s corporate bond trading business, foreign 
currency transaction business, client derivatives business, loan 
trading business and municipal securities business, as well as 
those inherent in the Company’s foreign denominated balances 
and the derivatives used to mitigate the related measurement 
volatility. On average, the Company expects the one-day VaR to 
be exceeded by actual losses two to three times per year related 
to these positions. The Company monitors the accuracy of 
internal VaR models and modeling processes by back-testing 
model performance, regularly updating the historical data used by 
the VaR models and regular model validations to assess the 
accuracy of the models’ input, processing, and reporting 
components. All models are required to be independently 
reviewed and approved prior to being placed in use. If the 
Company were to experience market losses in excess of the 
estimated VaR more often than expected, the VaR models and 
associated assumptions would be analyzed and adjusted. VaR 

amounts reflect MUB beginning December 1, 2022, the day the 
acquisition transaction closed. 

The average, high, low and period-end one-day VaR amounts for 
the Company’s Covered Positions were as follows:

The Company did not experience any actual losses for its 
combined Covered Positions that exceeded VaR during the years 
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company stress tests 
its market risk measurements to provide management with 
perspectives on market events that may not be captured by its 
VaR models, including worst case historical market movement 
combinations that have not necessarily occurred on the same 
date. 

The Company calculates Stressed VaR using the same 
underlying methodology and model as VaR, except that a 
historical continuous one-year look-back period is utilized that 
reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate to the 
Company’s Covered Positions. The period selected by the 
Company includes the significant market volatility of the last four 
months of 2008.

Valuations of positions in client derivatives and foreign 
currency activities are based on discounted cash flow or other 
valuation techniques using market-based assumptions. These 
valuations are compared to third-party quotes or other market 
prices to determine if there are significant variances. Significant 
variances are approved by senior management in the Company’s 
corporate functions. Valuation of positions in the corporate bond 
trading, loan trading and municipal securities businesses are 
based on trader marks. These trader marks are evaluated against 
third-party prices, with significant variances approved by senior 
management in the Company’s corporate functions. 

The Company also measures the market risk of its hedging 

activities related to residential MLHFS and MSRs using the 
Historical Simulation method. The VaRs are measured at the 
ninety-ninth percentile and employ factors pertinent to the market 
risks inherent in the valuation of the assets and hedges. A 
one-year look-back period is used to obtain past market data for 
the models.

Liquidity Risk Management The Company’s liquidity risk 
management process is designed to identify, measure, and 
manage the Company’s funding and liquidity risk to meet its daily 
funding needs and to address expected and unexpected 
changes in its funding requirements. The Company engages in 
various activities to manage its liquidity risk. These activities 
include diversifying its funding sources, stress testing, and 
holding readily-marketable assets which can be used as a source 
of liquidity if needed. In addition, the Company’s profitable 
operations, sound credit quality and strong capital position have 
enabled it to develop a large and reliable base of core deposit 
funding within its market areas and in domestic and global capital 
markets. 

The Company’s Board of Directors approves the Company’s 

liquidity policy. The Risk Management Committee of the 
Company’s Board of Directors oversees the Company’s liquidity 
risk management process and approves a contingency funding 
plan. The ALCO reviews the Company’s liquidity policy and limits, 
and regularly assesses the Company’s ability to meet funding 
requirements arising from adverse company-specific or market 
events. 

The Company’s liquidity policy requires it to maintain 

diversified wholesale funding sources to avoid maturity, entity and 
market concentrations. The Company operates a Cayman 
Islands branch for issuing Eurodollar time deposits. In addition, 
the Company has relationships with dealers to issue national 
market retail and institutional savings certificates and short-term 
and medium-term notes. The Company also maintains a 
significant correspondent banking network and relationships. 
Accordingly, the Company has access to national federal funds, 
funding through repurchase agreements and sources of stable 
certificates of deposit and commercial paper. 

The Company regularly projects its funding needs under 
various stress scenarios and maintains a contingency funding 
plan consistent with the Company’s access to diversified sources 
of contingent funding. The Company maintains a substantial level 
of total available liquidity in the form of on-balance sheet and 
off-balance sheet funding sources. These liquidity sources include 
cash at the Federal Reserve Bank and certain European central 
banks, unencumbered liquid assets, and capacity to borrow from 
the FHLB and at the Federal Reserve Bank’s Discount Window. 
Unencumbered liquid assets in the Company’s investment 
securities portfolio provides asset liquidity through the Company’s 
ability to sell the securities or pledge and borrow against them. At 
December 31, 2022, the fair value of unencumbered investment 
securities totaled $135.5 billion, compared with $144.0 billion at 
December 31, 2021. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements and “Balance Sheet Analysis” 
for further information on investment securities maturities and 
trends. Asset liquidity is further enhanced by the Company’s 
practice of pledging loans to access secured borrowing facilities 
through the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank. At December 31, 
2022, the Company could have borrowed a total of an additional 
$114.8 billion from the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank based 
on collateral available for additional borrowings. 

The Company’s diversified deposit base provides a sizeable 
source of relatively stable and low-cost funding, while reducing 
the Company’s reliance on the wholesale markets. Total deposits 
were $525.0 billion at December 31, 2022, compared with 
$456.1 billion at December 31, 2021. Refer to Note 12 of the 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and “Balance Sheet 
Analysis” for further information on the maturities, terms and 
trends of the Company’s deposits. 

Additional funding is provided by long-term debt and short-

term borrowings. Long-term debt was $39.8 billion at 
December 31, 2022, and is an important funding source because 
of its multi-year borrowing structure. Refer to Note 14 of the 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on 
the terms and maturities of the Company’s long-term debt 
issuances and “Balance Sheet Analysis” for discussion on long-
term debt trends. Short-term borrowings were $31.2 billion at 
December 31, 2022, and supplement the Company’s other 
funding sources. Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements and “Balance Sheet Analysis” for further 
information on the terms and trends of the Company’s short-term 
borrowings. 

The Company’s ability to raise negotiated funding at 

competitive prices is influenced by rating agencies’ views of the 
Company’s credit quality, liquidity, capital and earnings. Table 21 
details the rating agencies’ most recent assessments.

In addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis, 
the Company monitors the parent company’s liquidity. The parent 
company’s routine funding requirements consist primarily of 
operating expenses, dividends paid to shareholders, debt 
service, repurchases of common stock and funds used for 
acquisitions. During 2022, the Company used approximately 
$5.5 billion of parent company cash to acquire MUB. The parent 
company obtains funding to meet its obligations from dividends 
collected from its subsidiaries and the issuance of debt and 
capital securities. The Company establishes limits for the minimal 
number of months into the future where the parent company can 
meet existing and forecasted obligations with cash and securities 
held that can be readily monetized. The Company measures and 
manages this limit in both normal and adverse conditions. The 
Company maintains sufficient funding to meet expected capital 
and debt service obligations for 24 months without the support of 
dividends from subsidiaries and assuming access to the 
wholesale markets is maintained. The Company maintains 
sufficient liquidity to meet its capital and debt service obligations 
for 12 months under adverse conditions without the support of 
dividends from subsidiaries or access to the wholesale markets. 
The parent company is currently in excess of required liquidity 
minimums. 

Under United States Securities and Exchange Commission 

rules, the parent company is classified as a “well-known 
seasoned issuer,” which allows it to file a registration statement 
that does not have a limit on issuance capacity. “Well-known 
seasoned issuers” generally include those companies with 
outstanding common securities with a market value of at least 
$700 million held by non-affiliated parties or those companies 
that have issued at least $1 billion in aggregate principal amount 
of non-convertible securities, other than common equity, in the 
last three years. However, the parent company’s ability to issue 

debt and other securities under a registration statement filed with 
the United States Securities and Exchange Commission under 
these rules is limited by the debt issuance authority granted by 
the Company’s Board of Directors and/or the ALCO policy. 
At December 31, 2022, parent company long-term debt 
outstanding was $27.0 billion, compared with $18.9 billion at 
December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to 
$6.9 billion of medium-term note and $1.3 billion of subordinated 
note issuances, along with an increase related to the $3.5 billion 
of additional capital received as part of the MUB acquisition. 
These increases were partially offset by $1.3 billion of 
subordinated note and $1.0 billion of medium-term note 
repayments. As of December 31, 2022, there was no parent 
company debt scheduled to mature in 2023. Future debt 
maturities may be met through medium-term note and capital 
security issuances and dividends from subsidiaries, as well as 
from parent company cash and cash equivalents. 

Dividend payments to the Company by its subsidiary banks 
are subject to regulatory review and statutory limitations and, in 
some instances, regulatory approval. In general, dividends to the 
parent company from its banking subsidiaries are limited by rules 
which compare dividends to net income for regulatorily-defined 
periods. For further information, see Note 25 of the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Company is subject to a regulatory Liquidity Coverage 
Ratio (“LCR”) requirement which requires banks to maintain an 
adequate level of unencumbered high quality liquid assets to 
meet estimated liquidity needs over a 30-day stressed period. At 
December 31, 2022, the Company was compliant with this 
requirement. 

The Company is also subject to a regulatory Net Stable 
Funding Ratio (“NSFR”) requirement which requires banks to 
maintain a minimum level of stable funding based on the liquidity 

53 

characteristics of their assets, commitments, and derivative 
exposures over a one-year time horizon. At December 31, 2022, 
the Company was compliant with this requirement. 

European Exposures The Company provides merchant 
processing and corporate trust services in Europe either directly 
or through banking affiliations in Europe. Revenue generated from 
sources in Europe represented approximately 2 percent of the 
Company’s total net revenue for 2022. Operating cash for these 
businesses is deposited on a short-term basis typically with 
certain European central banks. For deposits placed at other 
European banks, exposure is mitigated by the Company placing 
deposits at multiple banks and managing the amounts on deposit 
at any bank based on institution-specific deposit limits. At 
December 31, 2022, the Company had an aggregate amount on 
deposit with European banks of approximately $7.7 billion, 
predominately with the Central Bank of Ireland and Bank of 
England. 

In addition, the Company provides financing to domestic 
multinational corporations that generate revenue from customers 
in European countries, transacts with various European banks as 
counterparties to certain derivative-related activities, and through 
a subsidiary, manages money market funds that hold certain 
investments in European sovereign debt. Any deterioration in 
economic conditions in Europe, including the impacts resulting 
from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, is not expected to have a 
significant effect on the Company related to these activities. 

Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Other Contractual 
Obligations The Company participates in many different 
contractual arrangements which may or may not be recorded on 
its balance sheet, with unrelated or consolidated entities, under 
which the Company has an obligation to pay certain amounts, 
provide credit or liquidity enhancements or provide market risk 
support. These arrangements also include any obligation related 
to a variable interest held in an unconsolidated entity that 
provides financing, liquidity, credit enhancement or market risk 
support. 

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into 
contractual obligations that may require future cash payments, 
including funding for customer loan requests, customer deposit 
maturities and withdrawals, debt service, leases for premises and 
equipment, and other cash commitments. Refer to Notes 7, 12, 
14, 17 and 23 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
for information on the Company’s operating lease obligations, 
deposits, long-term debt, benefit obligations and guarantees and 
other commitments, respectively. 

Commitments to extend credit are legally binding and 

generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. 
Many of the Company’s commitments to extend credit expire 
without being drawn and, therefore, total commitment amounts 
do not necessarily represent future liquidity requirements or the 
Company’s exposure to credit loss. Commitments to extend 
credit also include consumer credit lines that are cancelable upon 
notification to the consumer. Total contractual amounts of 
commitments to extend credit at December 31, 2022 were 

$387.4 billion. The Company also issues and confirms various 
types of letters of credit, including standby and commercial. Total 
contractual amounts of letters of credit at December 31, 2022 
were $11.4 billion. For more information on the Company’s 
commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, refer to 
Note 23 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
The Company’s off-balance sheet arrangements with 
unconsolidated entities primarily consist of private investment 
funds or partnerships that make equity investments, provide debt 
financing or support community-based investments in 
tax-advantaged projects. In addition to providing investment 
returns, these arrangements in many cases assist the Company 
in complying with requirements of the Community Reinvestment 
Act. The investments in these entities generate a return primarily 
through the realization of federal and state income tax credits and 
other tax benefits, such as tax deductions from operating losses 
of the investments, over specified time periods. The entities in 
which the Company invests are generally considered variable 
interest entities (“VIEs”). The Company’s recorded investment in 
these entities, net of contractual equity investment commitments 
of $2.4 billion, was $3.0 billion at December 31, 2022. 

The Company also has non-controlling financial investments in 
private funds and partnerships considered VIEs. The Company’s 
recorded investment in these entities was approximately 
$177 million at December 31, 2022, and the Company had 
unfunded commitments to invest an additional $133 million. For 
more information on the Company’s interests in unconsolidated 
VIEs, refer to Note 8 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements. 

Guarantees are contingent commitments issued by the 
Company to customers or other third parties requiring the 
Company to perform if certain conditions exist or upon the 
occurrence or nonoccurrence of a specified event, such as a 
scheduled payment to be made under contract. The Company’s 
primary guarantees include commitments from securities lending 
activities in which indemnifications are provided to customers; 
indemnification or buy-back provisions related to sales of loans 
and tax credit investments; and merchant charge-back 
guarantees through the Company’s involvement in providing 
merchant processing services. For certain guarantees, the 
Company may have access to collateral to support the 
guarantee, or through the exercise of other recourse provisions, 
be able to offset some or all of any payments made under these 
guarantees. 

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries, along with other 

Visa U.S.A. Inc. member banks, have a contingent guarantee 
obligation to indemnify Visa Inc. for potential losses arising from 
antitrust lawsuits challenging the practices of Visa U.S.A. Inc. and 
MasterCard International. The indemnification by the Company 
and other Visa U.S.A. Inc. member banks has no maximum 
amount. Refer to Note 23 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements for further details regarding guarantees, other 
commitments, and contingent liabilities, including maximum 
potential future payments and current carrying amounts. 

54 

Capital Management The Company is committed to managing 
capital to maintain strong protection for depositors and creditors 
and for maximum shareholder benefit. The Company also 
manages its capital to exceed regulatory capital requirements for 
banking organizations. To achieve its capital goals, the Company 
employs a variety of capital management tools, including 
dividends, common share repurchases, and the issuance of 
subordinated debt, non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, 
common stock and other capital instruments. 

The Company announced on December 22, 2020 that its 
Board of Directors had approved an authorization to repurchase 
$3.0 billion of its common stock beginning January 1, 2021, and 
repurchased $1.5 billion of its common stock during the first six 
months of 2021 under this program. The Company suspended all 
common stock repurchases at the beginning of the third quarter 
of 2021, except for those done exclusively in connection with its 
stock-based compensation programs, due to its acquisition of 
MUB. The Company does not expect to commence repurchasing 
its common stock until after its common equity tier 1 capital ratio 
approximates 9.0 percent at which time the Company will assess 
its capital position relative to existing and proposed regulatory 
capital requirements. 

The Company announced on September 13, 2022 that its 
Board of Directors had approved a regular quarterly dividend of 
$0.48 per common share. This represented a 4.3 percent 
increase over the previous dividend rate per common share of 
$0.46 per quarter. 

The Company will continue to monitor its capital position and 

may adjust its capital distributions based on economic 
conditions, existing and proposed regulatory capital requirements 
and its financial performance. Capital distributions, including 
dividends and stock repurchases, are subject to the approval of 
the Company’s Board of Directors and compliance with 
regulatory requirements. For a more complete analysis of 
activities impacting shareholders’ equity and capital management 
programs, refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements. 

Total U.S. Bancorp shareholders’ equity was $50.8 billion at 

December 31, 2022, compared with $54.9 billion at 
December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily the result of 
changes in unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale 
investment securities included in other comprehensive income 
(loss) and dividends paid, partially offset by corporate earnings, 
the issuance of additional common shares related to the 
acquisition of MUB and the issuance of preferred stock. 

The regulatory capital requirements effective for the Company 
follow Basel III, with the Company being subject to calculating its 

capital adequacy as a percentage of risk-weighted assets under 
the standardized approach. Under Basel III, banking regulators 
define minimum capital requirements for banks and financial 
services holding companies. These requirements are expressed 
in the form of a minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio, tier 1 
capital ratio, total risk-based capital ratio, tier 1 leverage ratio and 
a tier 1 total leverage exposure, or supplementary leverage, ratio. 
The Company’s minimum required level for these ratios at 
December 31, 2022, which include a stress capital buffer of 
2.5 percent for the common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital and 
total capital ratios, was 7.0 percent, 8.5 percent, 10.5 percent, 
4.0 percent, and 3.0 percent, respectively. The Company targets 
its regulatory capital levels, at both the bank and bank holding 
company level, to exceed the “well-capitalized” threshold for 
these ratios under the FDIC Improvement Act prompt corrective 
action provisions that are applicable to all banks. At 
December 31, 2022, the minimum “well-capitalized” thresholds 
under the prompt corrective action framework for the common 
equity tier 1 capital ratio, tier 1 capital ratio, total risk-based 
capital ratio, tier 1 leverage ratio, and tier 1 total leverage 
exposure ratio was 6.5 percent, 8.0 percent, 10.0 percent, 
5.0 percent, and 3.0 percent, respectively. Beginning in 2022, the 
Company began to phase into its regulatory capital requirements 
the cumulative deferred impact of its 2020 adoption of the 
accounting guidance related to the impairment of financial 
instruments based on the current expected credit losses 
(“CECL”) methodology plus 25 percent of its quarterly credit 
reserve increases over the past two years. This cumulative 
deferred impact will be phased into the Company’s regulatory 
capital over the next three years, culminating with a fully phased 
in regulatory capital calculation beginning in 2025. As of 
December 31, 2022, the Company’s bank subsidiaries met all 
regulatory capital ratios to be considered “well-capitalized”. There 
are no conditions or events since December 31, 2022 that 
management believes have changed the risk-based category of 
its covered subsidiary banks. 

As an approved mortgage seller and servicer, the Company’s 

banking subsidiaries, through their mortgage banking divisions, 
are required to maintain various levels of shareholder’s equity, as 
specified by various agencies, including the United States 
Department of Housing and Urban Development, Government 
National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage 
Corporation and the Federal National Mortgage Association. At 
December 31, 2022, the Company’s banking subsidiaries met 
these requirements.

Table 22 provides a summary of statutory regulatory capital 
ratios in effect for the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
All regulatory ratios exceeded regulatory “well-capitalized” 
requirements. 

The Company believes certain other capital ratios are useful in 

evaluating its capital adequacy. The Company’s tangible 
common equity, as a percent of tangible assets and as a percent 
of risk-weighted assets determined in accordance with 
transitional regulatory capital requirements related to the CECL 
methodology under the standardized approach, was 4.5 percent 
and 6.0 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2022, compared 
with 6.8 percent and 9.2 percent at December 31, 2021, 
respectively. In addition, the Company’s common equity tier 1 
capital to risk-weighted assets ratio, reflecting the full 
implementation of the CECL methodology was 8.1 percent at 
December 31, 2022, compared with 9.6 percent at 
December 31, 2021. Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” 
beginning on page 59 for further information on these other 
capital ratios. 

Line of Business Financial Review 
The Company’s major lines of business are Corporate and 
Commercial Banking, Consumer and Business Banking, Wealth 
Management and Investment Services, Payment Services, and 
Treasury and Corporate Support. These operating segments are 
components of the Company about which financial information is 
prepared and is evaluated regularly by management in deciding 
how to allocate resources and assess performance. 

Basis for Financial Presentation Business line results are 
derived from the Company’s business unit profitability reporting 
systems by specifically attributing managed balance sheet assets, 
deposits and other liabilities and their related income or expense. 
Refer to Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements for further information on the business lines’ basis for 
financial presentation. 

Designations, assignments and allocations change from time 

to time as management systems are enhanced, methods of 
evaluating performance or product lines change or business 
segments are realigned to better respond to the Company’s 
diverse customer base. During 2022, certain organization and 
methodology changes were made and, accordingly, 2021 results 
were restated and presented on a comparable basis. Effective 
with the close of the MUB acquisition, MUB related business 
activities were integrated into the applicable line of business 
results. 

Corporate and Commercial Banking Corporate and 
Commercial Banking offers lending, equipment finance and small-
ticket leasing, depository services, treasury management, capital 
markets services, international trade services and other financial 
services to middle market, large corporate, commercial real 
estate, financial institution, non-profit and public sector clients. 
Corporate and Commercial Banking contributed $1.8 billion of 
the Company’s net income in 2022, or an increase of 
$277 million (17.7 percent), compared with 2021. 

Net revenue increased $584 million (15.0 percent) in 2022, 

compared with 2021. Net interest income, on a taxable-

56 

equivalent basis, increased $615 million (21.6 percent) in 2022, 
compared with 2021, primarily due to higher loan and interest-
bearing deposit balances, including those balances related to 
MUB, and the impact of higher rates on the margin benefit from 
deposits, partially offset by lower spreads on loans and lower 
noninterest-bearing deposits. Noninterest income decreased 
$31 million (3.0 percent) in 2022, compared with 2021, primarily 
due to lower commercial products revenue due to lower capital 
markets revenue, partially offset by higher trading revenue. 

Noninterest expense increased $131 million (7.5 percent) in 
2022, compared with 2021, primarily due to higher FDIC insurance 
expense, higher net shared services expense driven by investment 
in support of business growth and the impacts of the MUB 
acquisition, as well as higher compensation and employee benefits 
expense primarily due to merit increases and hiring to support 
business growth, partially offset by lower performance-based 
incentives related to capital markets activity. The provision for credit 
losses increased $84 million in 2022, compared with 2021, primarily 
due to loan loss provisions supporting growth in loan balances. 
Consumer and Business Banking Consumer and Business 
Banking comprises consumer banking, small business banking 
and consumer lending. Products and services are delivered 
through banking offices, telephone servicing and sales, on-line 
services, direct mail, ATM processing, mobile devices, distributed 
mortgage loan officers, and intermediary relationships including 
auto dealerships, mortgage banks, and strategic business 
partners. Consumer and Business Banking contributed 
$1.8 billion of the Company’s net income in 2022, or a decrease 
of $551 million (23.4 percent), compared with 2021. 

Net revenue decreased $121 million (1.4 percent) in 2022, 
compared with 2021. Noninterest income decreased $940 million 
(37.7 percent) in 2022, compared with 2021, primarily due to 
lower mortgage banking revenue reflecting lower application 
volume, lower related gain on sale margins and lower performing 
loan sales, partially offset by an increase in the fair value of MSRs, 
net of hedging activities. Net interest income, on a taxable-
equivalent basis, increased $819 million (13.5 percent) in 2022, 
compared with 2021, reflecting the favorable impact of higher 
rates on the margin benefit of deposits, partially offset by lower 
spreads on loans and lower loan fees. 

Noninterest expense increased $249 million (4.5 percent) in 

2022, compared with 2021, primarily due to increases in net 
shared services expense due to investments in digital capabilities 
and the impact of the MUB acquisition, as well as lower 
capitalized loan costs driven by lower mortgage production, 
partially offset by lower compensation and employee benefits 
expense and related loan expenses due to lower mortgage 
production. The provision for credit losses increased $364 million 
in 2022, compared with 2021, due to the impacts of balance 
sheet repositioning and capital management actions taken in the 
fourth quarter of 2022 in connection with the acquisition, along 
with loan balance growth and more favorable credit trends in 
2021. 
Wealth Management and Investment Services Wealth 
Management and Investment Services provides private banking, 

financial advisory services, investment management, retail 
brokerage services, insurance, trust, custody and fund servicing 
through four businesses: Wealth Management, Global Corporate 
Trust & Custody, U.S. Bancorp Asset Management and 
Fund Services. Wealth Management and Investment Services 
contributed $1.3 billion of the Company’s net income in 2022, or 
an increase of $471 million (55.9 percent), compared with 2021. 
Net revenue increased $953 million (29.6 percent) in 2022, 
compared with 2021. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent 
basis, increased $622 million (62.1 percent) in 2022, compared 
with 2021, primarily due to the favorable impact of higher rates on 
the margin benefit from deposits. Noninterest income increased 
$331 million (14.9 percent) in 2022, compared with 2021, primarily 
driven by higher trust and investment management fees reflecting 
lower money market fund fee waivers, the impact of the PFM 
acquisition and core business growth, partially offset by the impact 
of unfavorable market conditions. 

Noninterest expense increased $323 million (15.4 percent) in 
2022, compared with 2021, reflecting higher compensation and 
employee benefits expense as a result of merit increases, the 
PFM acquisition, core business growth and performance-based 
incentives, as well as higher net shared services expense driven 
by investment in support of business growth and the impact of 
the MUB acquisition. 

Payment Services Payment Services includes consumer and 
business credit cards, stored-value cards, debit cards, corporate, 
government and purchasing card services and merchant 
processing. Payment Services contributed $1.3 billion of the 
Company’s net income in 2022, or a decrease of $380 million 
(22.3 percent), compared with 2021. 

Net revenue increased $290 million (4.8 percent) in 2022, 

compared with 2021. Net interest income, on a taxable-
equivalent basis, increased $41 million (1.7 percent) in 2022, 
compared with 2021, primarily due to higher loan balances, 
higher loan fees and higher loan yields driven by higher interest 
rates, partially offset by higher funding costs. Noninterest income 
increased $249 million (7.0 percent) in 2022, compared with 
2021, mainly due to continued strengthening of consumer and 
business spending across most sectors. As a result, there was 
strong growth in corporate payment products revenue driven by 
improving business spending across all product groups. In 
addition, merchant processing services revenue increased due to 
higher sales volume and higher merchant fees, partially offset by 
the impact of foreign currency rate changes in Europe. 

Noninterest expense increased $165 million (4.9 percent) in 
2022, compared with 2021, reflecting higher net shared services 
expense driven by investment in infrastructure and technology 
development, in addition to higher compensation and employee 
benefits expense as a result of merit increases and core business 
growth. The provision for credit losses increased $631 million in 
2022, compared with 2021, primarily due to the impacts of 
increasing delinquency rates, along with stronger growth in loan 
balances.

Treasury and Corporate Support Treasury and Corporate 
Support includes the Company’s investment portfolios, funding, 
capital management, interest rate risk management, income 
taxes not allocated to the business lines, including most 
investments in tax-advantaged projects, and the residual 
aggregate of those expenses associated with corporate activities 
that are managed on a consolidated basis. Treasury and 
Corporate Support recorded a net loss of $459 million in 2022, 
compared with net income of $1.5 billion in 2021. 

Net revenue decreased $231 million (20.6 percent) in 2022, 
compared with 2021. Noninterest income decreased $380 million 
(41.3 percent) in 2022, compared with 2021, primarily due to the 
impacts of balance sheet repositioning and capital management 
actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2022 associated with the 
acquisition of MUB, partially offset by higher tax-advantaged 
investment syndication revenue. Net interest income, on a 
taxable-equivalent basis, increased $149 million (73.4 percent) in 
2022, compared with 2021, primarily due to higher yields on the 
investment securities portfolio and interest-bearing deposits with 
banks, mostly offset by higher funding costs. 

Noninterest expense increased $310 million (33.3 percent) in 

2022, compared with 2021, primarily due to merger and 
integration charges associated with the acquisition of MUB, other 
accruals and higher compensation and employee benefits 
expense reflecting merit increases and hiring to support business 
growth, partially offset by lower net shared services expense. The 
provision for credit losses was $2.1 billion higher in 2022, 
compared with 2021, primarily due to the initial provision for 
credit losses recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022 related to the 
MUB acquisition and additional impacts to the allowance for 
credit losses related to increasing economic uncertainty in the 
current year, compared to improving economic conditions in the 
prior year. 

Income taxes are assessed to each line of business at a 
managerial tax rate of 25.0 percent with the residual tax expense 
or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included 
in Treasury and Corporate Support. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
In addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the 
Company considers various other measures when evaluating 
capital utilization and adequacy, including: 
– Tangible common equity to tangible assets, 
– Tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets, and 
– Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, reflecting 

the full implementation of the CECL methodology. 

These capital measures are viewed by management as useful 
additional methods of evaluating the Company’s utilization of its 
capital held and the level of capital available to withstand 
unexpected negative market or economic conditions. 
Additionally, presentation of these measures allows investors, 
analysts and banking regulators to assess the Company’s capital 
position relative to other financial services companies. These 
capital measures are not defined in generally accepted 
accounting principles (“GAAP”), or are not currently effective or 
defined in banking regulations. In addition, certain of these 
measures differ from currently effective capital ratios defined by 
banking regulations principally in that the currently effective ratios, 
which are subject to certain transitional provisions, temporarily 
exclude the impact of the 2020 adoption of accounting guidance 
related to impairment of financial instruments based on the CECL 
methodology. As a result, these capital measures disclosed by 
the Company may be considered non-GAAP financial measures. 
Management believes this information helps investors assess 
trends in the Company’s capital adequacy. 

The Company also discloses net interest income and related 
ratios and analysis on a taxable-equivalent basis, which may also 
be considered non-GAAP financial measures. The Company 
believes this presentation to be the preferred industry 
measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant 
comparison of net interest income arising from taxable and 
tax-exempt sources. In addition, certain performance measures, 
including the efficiency ratio and net interest margin utilize net 
interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis. 

There may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to 

investors. As a result, the Company encourages readers to 
consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial 
information contained in this report in their entirety, and not to rely 
on any single financial measure.
