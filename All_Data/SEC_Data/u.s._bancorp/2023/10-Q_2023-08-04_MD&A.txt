Management’s Discussion and Analysis
OVERVIEW
Earnings Summary U.S. Bancorp and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) reported net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp of $1.4 billion for the second quarter of
2023, or $0.84 per diluted common share, compared with $1.5 billion, or $0.99 per diluted common share, for the second quarter of 2022. Return on average
assets and return on average common equity were 0.81 percent and 10.9 percent, respectively, for the second quarter of 2023, compared with 1.06 percent and
13.9 percent, respectively, for the second quarter of 2022. The results for the second quarter of 2023 included the impact of $310 million of merger and
integration-related charges associated with the acquisition of MUFG Union Bank, N.A. (“MUB”), $243 million of provision for credit losses and an additional
$22 million of losses related to balance sheet repositioning and capital management actions. Combined, these items decreased diluted earnings per common
share by $0.28.
Total net revenue for the second quarter of 2023 was $1.2 billion (19.3 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2022, reflecting a 28.5 percent increase
in net interest income (28.4 percent on a taxable-equivalent basis) and a 7.0 percent increase in noninterest income. The increase in net interest income from the
second quarter of 2022 was due to the impacts of rising interest rates on earning assets and the MUB acquisition. The increase in noninterest income reflected
higher commercial products revenue, payment services revenue and trust and investment management fees.
Noninterest expense in the second quarter of 2023 was $845 million (22.7 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2022, reflecting merger and
integration charges and operating expenses related to the MUB acquisition, including core deposit intangible amortization expense, as well as increases in
compensation and employee benefits expense to support business growth.
The provision for credit losses for the second quarter of 2023 of $821 million was $510 million higher than the second quarter of 2022, driven by the
impacts of balance sheet repositioning and capital management actions, the acquisition of MUB, normalizing credit losses and continued economic uncertainty.
Net charge-offs in the second quarter of 2023 were $649 million, compared with $161 million in the second quarter of 2022. Refer to “Corporate Risk Profile”
for further information on the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs, nonperforming assets and other factors considered by the Company in assessing the
credit quality of the loan portfolio and establishing the allowance for credit losses.
Net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp for the first six months of 2023 was $3.1 billion, or $1.87 per diluted common share, compared with $3.1 billion,
or $1.97 per diluted common share, for the first six months of 2022. Return on average assets and return on average common equity were 0.92 percent and
12.5 percent, respectively, for the first six months of 2023, compared with 1.08 percent and 13.3 percent, respectively, for the first six months of 2022. The
results for the first six months of 2023 included the impact of $554 million of merger and integration-related charges, $243 million of provision for credit losses
and an additional $22 million of losses related to balance sheet repositioning and capital management actions. Combined, these items decreased diluted earnings
per common share by $0.40.
Total net revenue for the first six months of 2023 was $2.7 billion (23.6 percent) higher than the first six months of 2022, reflecting a 36.9 percent
increase in net interest income (36.8 percent on a taxable-equivalent basis) and a 5.8 percent increase in noninterest income. The increase in net interest income
from the first six months of 2022 was due to the impacts of rising interest rates on earning assets and the MUB acquisition. The increase in noninterest income
reflected higher trust and investment management fees, commercial products revenue and payment services revenue, partially offset by lower mortgage banking
revenue and losses on securities.
Noninterest expense in the first six months of 2023 was $1.9 billion (26.3 percent) higher than the first six months of 2022, reflecting merger and
integration charges and operating expenses related to the MUB acquisition, including core deposit intangible amortization expense, as well as increases in
compensation and employee benefits expense to support business growth.
The provision for credit losses for the first six months of 2023 of $1.2 billion was $825 million higher than the first six months of 2022, driven by the
impacts of balance sheet repositioning and capital management actions, the acquisition of MUB, normalizing credit losses and continued economic uncertainty.
Net charge-offs in the first six months of 2023 were $1.0 billion, compared

with $323 million in the first six months of 2022. Refer to “Corporate Risk Profile” for further information on the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs,
nonperforming assets and other factors considered by the Company in assessing the credit quality of the loan portfolio and establishing the allowance for credit
losses.
MUFG Union Bank Acquisition On December 1, 2022, the Company acquired MUB’s core regional banking franchise from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc.
(“MUFG”). Pursuant to the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of MUB
for a purchase price consisting of $5.5 billion in cash and approximately 44 million shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company also received
additional MUB cash of $3.5 billion upon completion of the acquisition, which is required to be repaid to MUFG on or prior to the fifth anniversary date of the
completion of the purchase. On August 3, 2023, the Company completed a debt/equity conversion with MUFG. As a result, the Company repaid $936 million of
its debt obligation from the proceeds of the issuance of 24 million shares of common stock of the Company to an affiliate of MUFG (the “Debt/Equity
Conversion”). After the Debt/Equity Conversion, the Company had a remaining repayment obligation of $2.6 billion. On May 26, 2023, the Company merged
MUB into U.S. Bank National Association (“USBNA”), the Company’s primary banking subsidiary. The Company’s results for the second quarter and first six
months of 2023 reflect the full financial results of the acquired business.
STATEMENT OF INCOME ANALYSIS
Net Interest Income Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, was $4.4 billion in the second quarter and $9.1 billion in the first six months of 2023,
representing increases of $985 million (28.4 percent) and $2.5 billion (36.8 percent), respectively, compared with the same periods of 2022. The increases were
primarily due to the impact of rising interest rates on earning assets and the acquisition of MUB. Average earning assets for the second quarter and first six
months of 2023 were $77.1 billion (14.4 percent) and $77.4 billion (14.5 percent) higher, respectively, than the same periods of 2022, reflecting increases in
loans and interest-bearing deposits with banks, partially offset by a decrease in investment securities. The net interest margin, on a taxable-equivalent basis, in
the second quarter and first six months of 2023 was 2.90 percent and 3.00 percent, respectively, compared with 2.59 percent and 2.51 percent in the second
quarter and first six months of 2022, respectively. The increase in net interest margin from the prior year was primarily due to the impact of higher rates on
earning assets and the acquisition of MUB. Refer to the “Consolidated Daily Average Balance Sheet and Related Yields and Rates” table for further information
on net interest income.
Average total loans in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 were $64.6 billion (19.9 percent) and $69.2 billion (21.7 percent) higher,
respectively, than the same periods of 2022. The increases were driven by growth in the Company’s legacy loan portfolio as well as balances from the MUB
acquisition. Increases in residential mortgages, commercial loans, commercial real estate loans and credit card loans were partially offset by lower other retail
loans. The increase in residential mortgages was driven by the impact related to the MUB acquisition, along with on-balance sheet loan activities and slower
refinancing activity. The increase in commercial loans was due to higher utilization driven by working capital needs of corporate customers, slower payoffs
given higher volatility in the capital markets, as well as core growth and the impact related to the MUB acquisition. The increase in commercial real estate loans
was driven by the impact of the MUB acquisition, while the increase in credit cards loans was primarily driven by higher spend volumes, account growth and
lower payment rates. The decrease in other retail loans was driven by lower auto loans primarily due to balance sheet repositioning and capital management
actions, along with lower installment loans and lower retail leasing balances, partially offset by higher home equity and second mortgages.
Average investment securities in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 were $11.5 billion (6.7 percent) and $10.1 billion (5.8 percent) lower,
respectively, than the same periods of 2022, driven by balance sheet repositioning and liquidity management in connection with the acquisition of MUB. The
decrease from the prior year reflected sales of investments securities, partially offset by the impact of acquired MUB investment securities.
Average total deposits for the second quarter and first six months of 2023 were $40.7 billion (8.9 percent) and $48.4 billion (10.6 percent) higher,
respectively, than the same periods of 2022. Average total savings deposits for the second quarter and first six months of 2023 were $31.1 billion (10.1 percent)
and $37.3 billion (12.2 percent) higher, respectively, than the same periods of 2022, driven by increases in Corporate and Commercial Banking, and Consumer
and Business Banking balances, including the impact of the MUB acquisition. Average time deposits for the second quarter and first six months of 2023 were
$16.7 billion (62.2 percent) and $13.8 billion (53.6 percent) higher, respectively, than the same periods

of the prior year, mainly due to the acquisition of MUB and increases in Consumer and Business Banking, and Wealth Management and Investment Services
balances. Changes in time deposits are primarily related to those deposits managed as an alternative to other funding sources, based largely on relative pricing
and liquidity characteristics. Average noninterest-bearing deposits for the second quarter and first six months of 2023 were $7.1 billion (5.9 percent) and
$2.7 billion (2.1 percent) lower, respectively, than the same periods of 2022, driven by decreases in Corporate and Commercial Banking, and Wealth
Management and Investment Services balances, partially offset by the impact of the MUB acquisition.
Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses was $821 million in the second quarter and $1.2 billion in the first six months of 2023, representing
increases of $510 million and $825 million, respectively, from the same periods of 2022. The increases were driven by the impact of balance sheet repositioning
and capital management actions taken in the second quarter of 2023, the acquisition of MUB, normalizing credit losses and continued economic uncertainty. Net
charge-offs increased $488 million in the second quarter and $699 million in the first six months of 2023, compared with the same periods of 2022, reflecting
charge-offs related to balance sheet repositioning and capital management actions, as well as higher charge-offs in most loan categories consistent with
normalizing credit conditions. In addition, net charge-offs were higher in the first six months of 2023, compared with the first six months of the prior year, due
to charge-offs in the first quarter of 2023 related to the uncollectible amount of acquired loans, which were considered purchased credit deteriorated as of the
date of the MUB acquisition. Refer to “Corporate Risk Profile” for further information on the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs, nonperforming
assets and other factors considered by the Company in assessing the credit quality of the loan portfolio and establishing the allowance for credit losses.
Noninterest Income Noninterest income was $2.7 billion in the second quarter and $5.2 billion in the first six months of 2023, representing increases of
$178 million (7.0 percent) and $289 million (5.8 percent), respectively, compared with the same periods of 2022. The increases over the prior year reflected
stronger commercial products revenue, trust and investment management fees and payment services revenue, partially offset by losses on the sale of securities.
Commercial products revenue increased due to higher trading revenue, corporate bond fees, commercial loan fees and the acquisition of MUB. Trust and
investment management fees increased primarily due to the acquisition of MUB and core business growth. Payment services revenue increased due to higher
card revenue and merchant processing services revenue driven by higher sales volume, as well as higher corporate payment products revenue due to increased
spending. Mortgage banking revenue decreased in the first six months of 2023, compared with the first six months of 2022, primarily due to lower application
volume, given declining refinancing activities experienced in the mortgage industry, and losses related to balance sheet repositioning and capital management
actions taken in the second quarter of 2023.
Noninterest Expense Noninterest expense was $4.6 billion in the second quarter and $9.1 billion in the first six months of 2023, representing increases of
$845 million (22.7 percent) and $1.9 billion (26.3 percent), respectively, over the same periods of 2022. The increases from the prior year reflected the impact of
merger and integration charges, as well as operating expenses related to the MUB acquisition, higher compensation and employee benefits expense, higher other
intangibles expense and higher other noninterest expense. Compensation and employee benefits expense

increased primarily due to MUB expense as well as merit increases and hiring to support business growth. Other intangibles expense increased primarily due to
the core deposit intangible created as a result of the MUB acquisition. Other noninterest expense increased primarily due to higher Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance expense driven by an increase in the assessment base and rate, and MUB expense. The increase in other noninterest expense in
the second quarter of 2023, compared with the second quarter of 2022, was partially offset by lower accruals related to future delivery exposures for merchant
and airline processing and other liabilities.
On May 11, 2023, the FDIC released a proposed rule that would impose special assessments to recover the losses to the deposit insurance fund resulting
from the recent failures of other banking institutions. The Company expects the special assessments would be tax deductible. Although the proposal could
change and the timing of accounting recognition is still under consideration, if the final rule is issued as proposed, the Company estimates it would recognize
additional noninterest expense of approximately $650 million ($500 million net-of-tax), representing a potential 10 basis point reduction in the Company’s
common equity tier 1 capital ratio, upon finalization of the rule.
Income Tax Expense The provision for income taxes was $382 million (an effective rate of 21.8 percent) for the second quarter and $837 million (an effective
rate of 21.4 percent) for the first six months of 2023, compared with $414 million (an effective rate of 21.3 percent) and $811 million (an effective rate of 20.8
percent) for the same periods of 2022, respectively. For further information on income taxes, refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS
Loans The Company’s loan portfolio was $379.4 billion at June 30, 2023, compared with $388.2 billion at December 31, 2022, a decrease of $8.8 billion
(2.3 percent). The decrease was driven by lower other retail loans, residential mortgages and commercial real estate loans, partially offset by higher commercial
loans and credit card loans.
Other retail loans decreased $7.7 billion (14.0 percent) at June 30, 2023, compared with December 31, 2022, primarily due to decreases in auto loans and
retail leasing balances. The decrease in auto loans was primarily driven by a sale of indirect auto loans as part of balance sheet repositioning and capital
management actions taken in the second quarter of 2023.
Residential mortgages held in the loan portfolio decreased $1.4 billion (1.2 percent) at June 30, 2023, compared with December 31, 2022, driven by a sale
of residential mortgages as part of balance sheet repositioning and capital management actions, partially offset by originations. Residential mortgages originated
and placed in the Company’s loan portfolio include jumbo mortgages and branch-originated first lien home equity loans to borrowers with high credit quality.
Commercial real estate loans decreased $1.1 billion (2.0 percent) at June 30, 2023, compared with December 31, 2022, due to payoffs exceeding a
reduced level of new originations.
Commercial loans increased $1.1 billion (0.8 percent) at June 30, 2023, compared with December 31, 2022, due to higher utilization driven by corporate
customers and slower payoffs given higher volatility in the capital markets, as well as core growth.
Credit card loans increased $331 million (1.3 percent) at June 30, 2023, compared with December 31, 2022, primarily driven by higher spend volumes
and account growth.

The Company generally retains portfolio loans through maturity; however, the Company’s intent may change over time based upon various factors such
as ongoing asset/liability management activities, assessment of product profitability, credit risk, liquidity needs, and capital implications. If the Company’s intent
or ability to hold an existing portfolio loan changes, it is transferred to loans held for sale.
Loans Held for Sale Loans held for sale, consisting primarily of residential mortgages to be sold in the secondary market, were $2.4 billion at June 30, 2023,
compared with $2.2 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase in loans held for sale was principally due to a higher level of mortgage loan closings in the
second quarter of 2023, compared with the fourth quarter of 2022. Almost all of the residential mortgage loans the Company originates or purchases for sale
follow guidelines that allow the loans to be sold into existing, highly liquid secondary markets, in particular in government agency transactions and to
government-sponsored enterprises (“GSEs”).
Investment Securities Investment securities totaled $156.2 billion at June 30, 2023, compared with $161.7 billion at December 31, 2022. The $5.5 billion
(3.4 percent) decrease was primarily due to $6.5 billion of net investment sales and maturities, partially offset by a $873 million favorable change in net
unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale investment securities.
The Company’s available-for-sale investment securities are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in other comprehensive income (loss)
unless a portion of a security’s unrealized loss is related to credit and an allowance for credit losses is necessary. At June 30, 2023, the Company’s net unrealized
losses on available-for-sale investment securities were $7.7 billion ($5.7 billion net-of-tax), compared with $8.5 billion ($6.4 billion net-of-tax) at December 31,
2022. The favorable change in net unrealized gains (losses) was primarily due to increases in the fair value of mortgage-backed, U.S. Treasury and state and
political securities as a result of changes in interest rates. Gross unrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities totaled $7.7 billion at June 30, 2023,
compared with $8.6 billion at December 31, 2022. When evaluating credit losses, the Company considers various factors such as the nature of the investment
security, the credit ratings or financial condition of the issuer, the extent of the unrealized loss, expected cash flows of the underlying collateral, the existence of
any government or agency guarantees, and market conditions. At June 30, 2023, the Company had no plans to sell securities with

Deposits Total deposits were $521.6 billion at June 30, 2023, compared with $525.0 billion at December 31, 2022. The $3.4 billion (0.6 percent) decrease in
total deposits reflected a decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by increases in time deposits and total savings deposits. Noninterest-bearing
deposits decreased $32.7 billion (23.8 percent) at June 30, 2023, compared with December 31, 2022, primarily due to lower Consumer and Business Banking,
and Corporate and Commercial Banking balances. The decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits was driven by a product change for certain MUB retail checking
accounts at conversion to create a better customer experience and due to pricing pressures from rising interest rates. Time deposits increased $19.0 billion (57.7
percent) at June 30, 2023, compared with December 31, 2022, driven by higher Consumer and Business Banking balances, partially offset by lower Corporate
and Commercial Banking balances. Changes in time deposits are primarily related to those deposits managed as an alternative to other funding sources, based
largely on relative pricing and liquidity characteristics. Money market deposit balances increased $26.1 billion (17.7 percent), primarily due to higher Corporate
and Commercial Banking, Consumer and Business Banking, and Wealth Management and Investment Services balances. Interest checking balances increased
$2.2 billion (1.6 percent), primarily due to higher Consumer and Business Banking, and Corporate and Commercial Banking balances, partially offset by lower
Wealth Management and Investment Services balances. Savings account balances decreased $18.0 billion (25.1 percent), driven by lower Consumer and
Business Banking, and Wealth Management and Investment Services balances.
The Company maintains a diverse and stable funding base that includes a mix of both consumer and operational wholesale deposits and continues to
actively manage the composition in the current environment. Consumer deposits account for more than 50 percent of total deposits, and a significant portion of
the operational wholesale deposits are contractual or relationship based, not yield-seeking. At June 30, 2023, approximately 50 percent of deposits were insured
through the FDIC insurance fund. Of the uninsured deposits, approximately 80 percent of these deposits were retail customers or operational in nature, which
are generally more stable. In addition, at June 30, 2023 the Company had total available liquidity representing 120 percent of uninsured deposit balances. Refer
to the “Liquidity Risk Management” section for further information on the Company’s liquidity management.
Borrowings The Company utilizes both short-term and long-term borrowings as part of its asset/liability management and funding strategies. Short-term
borrowings, which include federal funds purchased, commercial paper, repurchase agreements, borrowings secured by high-grade assets and other short-term
borrowings, were $32.3 billion at June 30, 2023, compared with $31.2 billion at December 31, 2022. The $1.1 billion (3.6 percent) increase in short-term
borrowings was primarily due to an increase in repurchase agreement balances. Long-term debt was $45.3 billion at June 30, 2023, compared with $39.8 billion
at December 31, 2022. The $5.5 billion (13.7 percent) increase was primarily due to $7.2 billion of medium-term note issuances, partially offset by $1.6 billion
of bank note repayments and maturities. Refer to the “Liquidity Risk Management” section for discussion of liquidity management of the Company.
CORPORATE RISK PROFILE
Overview Managing risks is an essential part of successfully operating a financial services company. The Company’s Board of Directors has approved a risk
management framework which establishes governance and risk management requirements for all risk-taking activities. This framework includes Company and
business line risk appetite statements which set boundaries for the types and amount of risk that may be undertaken in pursuing business objectives and
initiatives. The Board of Directors, primarily through its Risk Management Committee, oversees performance relative to the risk management framework, risk
appetite statements, and other policy requirements.
The Executive Risk Committee (“ERC”), which is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer and includes the Chief Executive Officer and other members of the
executive management team, oversees execution against the risk management framework and risk appetite statements. The ERC focuses on current and
emerging risks, including strategic and reputation risks, by directing timely and comprehensive actions. Senior operating committees have also been established,
each responsible for overseeing a specified category of risk.
Upon closing of the MUB acquisition, the Company’s risk management framework applied to the legal entities acquired from MUFG, including MUB, up
U.S. Bancorp 9
Table of Contents
until its merger into USBNA. Updates were made to align the acquired entities with the Company’s risk appetite and connect the elements of their respective
risk governance and reporting into the Company’s existing risk management framework. Upon completing the merger of MUB into USBNA, which occurred on
May 26, 2023, the MUB risk governance and reporting framework is no longer applicable.
The Company’s most prominent risk exposures are credit, interest rate, market, liquidity, operational, compliance, strategic, and reputation. Credit risk is
the risk of loss associated with a change in the credit profile or the failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its contractual obligations. Interest rate risk is
the current or prospective risk to earnings and capital, or market valuations, arising from the impact of changes in interest rates. Market risk arises from
fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and security prices that may result in changes in the values of financial instruments, such as trading and
available-for-sale securities, mortgage loans held for sale (“MLHFS”), mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) and derivatives that are accounted for on a fair value
basis. Liquidity risk is the risk that financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by the Company’s inability, or perceived inability, to
meet its cash flow obligations in a timely and complete manner in either normal or stressed conditions. Operational risk is the risk to current or projected
financial condition and resilience arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, people (including human errors or misconduct), or adverse
external events, including the risk of loss resulting from breaches in data security. Operational risk can also include the risk of loss due to failures by third parties
with which the Company does business. Compliance risk is the risk that the Company may suffer legal or regulatory sanctions, financial losses, and reputational
damage if it fails to adhere to compliance requirements and the Company’s compliance policies. Strategic risk is the risk to current or projected financial
condition and resilience arising from adverse business decisions, poor implementation of business decisions, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the banking
industry and operating environment. Reputation risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, or franchise or enterprise value arising from negative
public opinion. This risk may impair the Company’s competitiveness by affecting its ability to establish new relationships or services, or continue serving
existing relationships. In addition to the risks identified above, other risk factors exist that may impact the Company. Refer to “Risk Factors” in the Company’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, for a detailed discussion of these factors.
The Company’s Board and management-level governance committees are supported by a “three lines of defense” model for establishing effective checks
and balances. The first line of defense, the business lines, manages risks in conformity with established limits and policy requirements. In turn, business line
leaders and their risk officers establish programs to ensure conformity with these limits and policy requirements. The second line of defense, which includes the
Chief Risk Officer’s organization as well as policy and oversight activities of corporate support functions, translates risk appetite and strategy into actionable
risk limits and policies. The second line of defense monitors first line of defense conformity with limits and policies and provides reporting and escalation of
emerging risks and other concerns to senior management and the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors. The third line of defense, internal
audit, is responsible for providing the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and senior management with independent assessment and assurance regarding
the effectiveness of the Company’s governance, risk management and control processes.
Management regularly provides reports to the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors. The Risk Management Committee discusses with
management the Company’s risk management performance and provides a summary of key risks to the entire Board of Directors, covering the status of existing
matters, areas of potential future concern and specific information on certain types of loss events. The Risk Management Committee considers quarterly reports
by management assessing the Company’s performance relative to the risk appetite statements and the associated risk limits, including:
• Macroeconomic environment and other qualitative considerations, such as regulatory and compliance changes, litigation developments, geopolitical events,
and technology and cybersecurity;
• Credit measures, including adversely rated and nonperforming loans, leveraged transactions, credit concentrations and lending limits;
• Interest rate and market risk, including market value and net income simulation, and trading-related Value at Risk (“VaR”);
• Liquidity risk, including funding projections under various stressed scenarios;
• Operational and compliance risk, including losses stemming from events such as fraud, processing errors, control breaches, breaches in data security or
adverse business decisions, as well as reporting on technology performance, and various legal and regulatory compliance measures;

• Capital ratios and projections, including regulatory measures and stressed scenarios; and
• Strategic and reputation risk considerations, impacts and responses.
Credit Risk Management The Company’s strategy for credit risk management includes well-defined, centralized credit policies, uniform underwriting criteria,
and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all commercial and consumer credit exposures. The strategy also emphasizes diversification on a
geographic, industry and customer level, regular credit examinations and management reviews of loans exhibiting deterioration of credit quality. In evaluating
its credit risk, the Company considers changes, if any, in underwriting activities, the loan portfolio composition (including product mix and geographic, industry
or customer-specific concentrations), collateral values, trends in loan performance and macroeconomic factors, such as changes in unemployment rates, gross
domestic product levels, inflation, interest rates and consumer bankruptcy filings. The Risk Management Committee oversees the Company’s credit risk
management process.
In addition, credit quality ratings, as defined by the Company, are an important part of the Company’s overall credit risk management and evaluation of its
allowance for credit losses. Loans with a pass rating represent those loans not classified on the Company’s rating scale for problem credits, as minimal credit
risk has been identified. Loans with a special mention or classified rating, including consumer lending and small business loans that are 90 days or more past
due and still accruing, nonaccrual loans and loans in a junior lien position that are current but are behind a first lien position on nonaccrual, encompass all loans
held by the Company that it considers to have a potential or well-defined weakness that may put full collection of contractual cash flows at risk. The Company’s
internal credit quality ratings for consumer loans are primarily based on delinquency and nonperforming status, except for a limited population of larger loans
within those portfolios that are individually evaluated. For this limited population, the determination of the internal credit quality rating may also consider
collateral value and customer cash flows. Refer to Note 5 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s loan
portfolios including internal credit quality ratings. In addition, refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Credit Risk Management” in the Company’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, for a more detailed discussion on credit risk management processes.
The Company manages its credit risk, in part, through diversification of its loan portfolio which is achieved through limit setting by product type criteria,
such as industry, and identification of credit concentrations. The Company categorizes its loan portfolio into two segments, which is the level at which it
develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The Company’s two loan portfolio segments are commercial
lending and consumer lending.
The commercial lending segment includes loans and leases made to small business, middle market, large corporate, commercial real estate, financial
institution, non-profit and public sector customers. Key risk characteristics relevant to commercial lending segment loans include the industry and geography of
the borrower’s business, purpose of the loan, repayment source, borrower’s debt capacity and financial flexibility, loan covenants, and nature of pledged
collateral, if any, as well as macroeconomic factors such as unemployment rates, gross domestic product levels, corporate bond spreads and long-term interest
rates. These risk characteristics, among others, are considered in determining estimates about the likelihood of default by the borrowers and the severity of loss
in the event of default. The Company considers these risk characteristics in assigning internal risk ratings to, or forecasting losses on, these loans, which are the
significant factors in determining the allowance for credit losses for loans in the commercial lending segment.
The consumer lending segment represents loans and leases made to consumer customers, including residential mortgages, credit card loans, and other
retail loans such as revolving consumer lines, auto loans and leases, home equity loans and lines, and student loans, a run-off portfolio. Home equity or second
mortgage loans are junior lien closed-end accounts fully disbursed at origination. These loans typically are fixed rate loans, secured by residential real estate,
with a 10- or 15-year fixed payment amortization schedule. Home equity lines are revolving accounts giving the borrower the ability to draw and repay balances
repeatedly, up to a maximum commitment, and are secured by residential real estate. These include accounts in either a first or junior lien position. Typical terms
on home equity lines in the portfolio are variable rates benchmarked to the prime rate, with a 10-year draw period during which a minimum payment is
equivalent to the monthly interest, followed by a 20-year amortization period, respectively. At June 30, 2023, substantially all of the Company’s home equity
lines were in the draw period. Key risk characteristics relevant to consumer lending segment
U.S. Bancorp 11
Table of Contents
loans primarily relate to the borrowers’ capacity and willingness to repay and include unemployment rates, consumer bankruptcy filings and other
macroeconomic factors, customer payment history and credit scores, and in some cases, updated loan-to-value (“LTV”) information reflecting current market
conditions on real estate-based loans. These and other risk characteristics are reflected in forecasts of delinquency levels, bankruptcies and losses which are the
primary factors in determining the allowance for credit losses for the consumer lending segment.
The Company further disaggregates its loan portfolio segments into various classes based on their underlying risk characteristics. The two classes within
the commercial lending segment are commercial loans and commercial real estate loans. The three classes within the consumer lending segment are residential
mortgages, credit card loans and other retail loans.
The Company’s consumer lending segment utilizes several distinct business processes and channels to originate consumer credit, including traditional
branch lending, mobile and on-line banking, indirect lending, alliance partnerships and correspondent banks. Each distinct underwriting and origination activity
manages unique credit risk characteristics and prices its loan production commensurate with the differing risk profiles.
Residential mortgage originations are generally limited to prime borrowers and are performed through the Company’s branches, loan production offices,
mobile and on-line services, and a wholesale network of originators. The Company may retain residential mortgage loans it originates on its balance sheet or sell
the loans into the secondary market while retaining the servicing rights and customer relationships. Utilizing the secondary markets enables the Company to
effectively reduce its credit and other asset/liability risks. For residential mortgages that are retained in the Company’s portfolio and for home equity and second
mortgages, credit risk is managed by adherence to LTV and borrower credit criteria during the underwriting process.
The Company estimates updated LTV information on its outstanding residential mortgages quarterly, based on a method that combines automated
valuation model updates and relevant home price indices. LTV is the ratio of the loan’s outstanding principal balance to the current estimate of property value.
For home equity and second mortgages, combined loan-to-value (“CLTV”) is the combination of the first mortgage original principal balance and the second
lien outstanding principal balance, relative to the current estimate of property value. Certain loans do not have an LTV or CLTV, primarily due to lack of
availability of relevant automated valuation model and/or home price indices values, or lack of necessary valuation data on acquired loans.

Home equity and second mortgages were $12.8 billion at June 30, 2023, compared with $12.9 billion at December 31, 2022, and included $2.8 billion of
home equity lines in a first lien position and $10.0 billion of home equity and second mortgage loans and lines in a junior lien position. Loans and lines in a
junior lien position at June 30, 2023, included approximately $3.0 billion of loans and lines for which the Company also serviced the related first lien loan, and
approximately $7.0 billion where the Company did not service the related first lien loan. The Company was able to determine the status of the related first liens
using information the Company has as the servicer of the first lien or information reported on customer credit bureau files. The Company also evaluates other
indicators of credit risk for these junior lien loans and lines including delinquency, estimated average CLTV ratios and updated weighted-average credit scores in
making its assessment of credit risk, related loss estimates and determining the allowance for credit losses.

Loan Delinquencies Trends in delinquency ratios are an indicator, among other considerations, of credit risk within the Company’s loan portfolios. The entire
balance of a loan account is considered delinquent if the minimum payment contractually required to be made is not received by the date specified on the billing
statement. Delinquent loans purchased and loans that could be purchased from GNMA mortgage pools under delinquent loan repurchase options, whose
repayments are primarily insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, are excluded from
delinquency statistics.
Accruing loans 90 days or more past due totaled $474 million at June 30, 2023, compared with $491 million at December 31, 2022. Accruing loans 90
days or more past due are not included in nonperforming assets and continue to accrue interest because they are adequately secured by collateral, are in the
process of collection and are reasonably expected to result in repayment or restoration to current status, or are managed in homogeneous portfolios with
specified charge-off timeframes adhering to regulatory guidelines. The ratio of accruing loans 90 days or more past due to total loans was 0.12 percent at
June 30, 2023, compared with 0.13 percent at December 31, 2022.

Modified Loans In certain circumstances, the Company may modify the terms of a loan to maximize the collection of amounts due when a borrower is
experiencing financial difficulties or is expected to experience difficulties in the near-term. In most cases the modification is either a concessionary reduction in
interest rate, extension of the maturity date or reduction in the principal balance that would otherwise not be considered.
Modified loans accrue interest if the borrower complies with the revised terms and conditions and has demonstrated repayment performance at a level
commensurate with the modified terms over several payment cycles, which is generally six months or greater.
The Company continues to work with customers to modify loans for borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties. Many of the Company’s loan
modifications are determined on a case-by-case basis in connection with ongoing loan collection processes. The modifications vary within each of the
Company’s loan classes. Commercial lending segment modifications generally include extensions of the maturity date and may be accompanied by an increase
or decrease to the interest rate. The Company may also work with the borrower to make other changes to the loan to mitigate losses, such as obtaining additional
collateral and/or guarantees to support the loan.
The Company has also implemented certain residential mortgage loan modification programs. The Company modifies residential mortgage loans under
Federal Housing Administration, United States Department of Veterans Affairs, and its own internal programs. Under these programs, the Company offers
qualifying homeowners the opportunity to permanently modify their loan and achieve more affordable monthly payments. These modifications may include
adjustments to interest rates, conversion of adjustable rates to fixed rates, extensions of maturity dates or deferrals of payments, capitalization of accrued interest
and/or outstanding advances, or in limited situations, partial forgiveness of loan principal. In most instances, participation in residential mortgage loan
modification programs requires the customer to complete a short-term trial period. A permanent loan modification is contingent on the customer successfully
completing the trial period arrangement, and the loan documents are not modified until that time.
Credit card and other retail loan modifications are generally part of distinct modification programs providing customers modification solutions over a
specified time period, generally up to 60 months.
The Company also makes short-term modifications, in limited circumstances, to assist borrowers experiencing temporary hardships, including previously
offering payment relief to borrowers that experienced financial hardship resulting directly from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Short-term consumer
lending modification programs include payment reductions, deferrals of up to three past due payments, and the ability to return to current status if the borrower
makes required payments. The Company may also make short-term modifications to commercial lending loans, with the most common modification being an
extension of the maturity date of three months or less. Such extensions generally are used when the maturity date is imminent and the borrower is experiencing
some level of financial stress, but the Company believes the borrower will pay all contractual amounts owed.
Nonperforming Assets The level of nonperforming assets represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses. Nonperforming assets include
nonaccrual loans, modified loans not performing in accordance with modified terms and not accruing interest, modified loans that have not met the performance
period required to return to accrual status, other real estate owned (“OREO”) and other nonperforming assets owned by the Company. Interest payments
collected from assets on nonaccrual status are generally applied against the principal balance and not recorded as income. However, interest income may be
recognized for interest payments if the remaining carrying amount of the loan is believed to be collectible.
At June 30, 2023, total nonperforming assets were $1.1 billion, compared to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2022. The $69 million (6.8 percent) increase in
nonperforming assets was primarily due to higher nonperforming commercial real estate loans, partially offset by a decrease in nonperforming residential
mortgages. The ratio of total nonperforming assets to total loans and other real estate was 0.29 percent at June 30, 2023, compared with 0.26 percent at
December 31, 2022.
OREO was $25 million at June 30, 2023, compared with $23 million at December 31, 2022, and was related to foreclosed properties that previously
secured loan balances. These balances exclude foreclosed GNMA loans whose repayments are primarily insured by the Federal Housing Administration or
guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.

Analysis of Loan Net Charge-offs Total loan net charge-offs were $649 million for the second quarter and $1.0 billion for the first six months of 2023, compared
with $161 million and $323 million, respectively, for the same periods of 2022. The year-over-year increases in net charge-offs reflected charge-offs related to
balance sheet repositioning and capital management actions taken in the second quarter of 2023, as well as higher charge-offs in most loan categories consistent
with normalizing credit conditions. In addition, net charge-offs were higher in the first six months of 2023, compared with the first six months of the prior year,
due to charge-offs in the first quarter of 2023 related to the uncollectible amount of acquired loans, which were considered purchased credit deteriorated as of
the date of the MUB acquisition. The ratio of total loan net charge-offs to average loans outstanding on an annualized basis for the second quarter and first six
months of 2023 was 0.67 percent and 0.53 percent, respectively, compared with 0.20 percent for both the second quarter and first six months of 2022. Excluding
the impact of charge-offs related to the MUB acquisition and balance sheet repositioning and capital management actions, the ratio of total loan net charge-offs
to average loans outstanding on an annualized basis for the second quarter and first six months of 2023 was 0.35 percent and 0.32 percent, respectively.
Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses is established for current expected credit losses on the Company’s
loan and
U.S. Bancorp 17
Table of Contents
lease portfolio, including unfunded credit commitments. The allowance considers expected losses for the remaining lives of the applicable assets, inclusive of
expected recoveries. The allowance for credit losses is increased through provisions charged to earnings and reduced by net charge-offs.
Management evaluates the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis. Multiple economic scenarios are considered over a
three-year reasonable and supportable forecast period, which includes increasing consideration of historical loss experience over years two and three. These
economic scenarios are constructed with interrelated projections of multiple economic variables, and loss estimates are produced that consider the historical
correlation of those economic variables with credit losses. After the forecast period, the Company fully reverts to long-term historical loss experience, adjusted
for prepayments and characteristics of the current loan and lease portfolio, to estimate losses over the remaining life of the portfolio. The economic scenarios are
updated at least quarterly and are designed to provide a range of reasonable estimates from better to worse than current expectations. Scenarios are weighted
based on the Company’s expectation of economic conditions for the foreseeable future and reflect significant judgment and consideration of economic forecast
uncertainty. Final loss estimates also consider factors affecting credit losses not reflected in the scenarios, due to the unique aspects of current conditions and
expectations. These factors may include, but are not limited to, loan servicing practices, regulatory guidance, and/or fiscal and monetary policy actions.
Because business processes and credit risks associated with unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as for loans, the Company utilizes
similar processes to estimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments, which is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Both the
allowance for loan losses and the liability for unfunded credit commitments are included in the Company’s analysis of credit losses and reported reserve ratios.
The allowance recorded for credit losses utilizes forward-looking expected loss models to consider a variety of factors affecting lifetime credit losses.
These factors include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic variables such as unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels, inflation,
interest rates, and corporate bond spreads, as well as loan and borrower characteristics, such as internal risk ratings on commercial loans and consumer credit
scores, delinquency status, collateral type and available valuation information, consideration of end-of-term losses on lease residuals, and the remaining term of
the loan, adjusted for expected prepayments. For each loan portfolio, including those loans modified under various loan modification programs, model estimates
are adjusted as necessary to consider any relevant changes in portfolio composition, lending policies, underwriting standards, risk management practices,
economic conditions or other factors that may affect the accuracy of the model. Expected credit loss estimates also include consideration of expected cash
recoveries on loans previously charged-off or expected recoveries on collateral-dependent loans where recovery is expected through sale of the collateral at fair
value less selling costs. Where loans do not exhibit similar risk characteristics, an individual analysis is performed to consider expected credit losses.
The allowance recorded for individually evaluated loans greater than $5 million in the commercial lending segment is based on an analysis utilizing
expected cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate, the observable market price of the loan, or the fair value of the collateral, less selling
costs, for collateral-dependent loans as appropriate.
When evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses for any loans and lines in a junior lien position, the Company considers the
delinquency and modification status of the first lien. At June 30, 2023, the Company serviced the first lien on 30 percent of the home equity loans and lines in a
junior lien position. The Company also considers the status of first lien mortgage accounts reported on customer credit bureau files when the first lien is not
serviced by the Company. Regardless of whether the Company services the first lien, an assessment is made of economic conditions, problem loans, recent loss
experience and other factors in determining the allowance for credit losses. Based on the available information, the Company estimated $225 million or
1.8 percent of its total home equity portfolio at June 30, 2023, represented non-delinquent junior liens where the first lien was delinquent or modified.
When a loan portfolio is purchased, the acquired loans are divided into those considered purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration
(“PCD”) and those not considered PCD. An allowance is established for each population and considers product mix, risk characteristics of the portfolio and
delinquency status and refreshed LTV ratios when possible. PCD loans also consider whether the loan has experienced a charge-off, bankruptcy or significant
deterioration since origination. The allowance established for purchased loans not considered PCD is recognized through provision expense upon acquisition,
whereas the allowance established for loans considered PCD at acquisition is offset by an increase in the basis of the acquired loans. Any subsequent increases
and decreases in the allowance related to purchased loans, regardless of PCD status, are recognized through provision expense,
18 U.S. Bancorp
Table of Contents
with charge-offs charged to the allowance. The Company had a total unpaid principal balance of $3.8 billion of PCD loans, primarily related to the MUB
acquisition, included in its loan portfolio at June 30, 2023.
The Company’s methodology for determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses also considers the imprecision inherent in the methodologies
used and allocated to the various loan portfolios. As a result, amounts determined under the methodologies described above are adjusted by management to
consider the potential impact of other qualitative factors not captured in quantitative model adjustments which include, but are not limited to, the following:
model imprecision, imprecision in economic scenario assumptions, and emerging risks related to either changes in the economic environment that are affecting
specific portfolios, or changes in portfolio concentrations over time that may affect model performance. The consideration of these items results in adjustments
to allowance amounts included in the Company’s allowance for credit losses for each loan portfolio.
Although the Company determined the amount of each element of the allowance separately and considers this process to be an important credit
management tool, the entire allowance for credit losses is available for the entire loan portfolio. The actual amount of losses can vary significantly from the
estimated amounts.
At June 30, 2023, the allowance for credit losses was $7.7 billion (2.03 percent of period-end loans), compared with an allowance of $7.4 billion
(1.91 percent of period-end loans) at December 31, 2022. The allowance for credit losses at June 30, 2023 included a $62 million decrease due to a change in
accounting principle related to discontinuing the separate recognition and measurement of troubled debt restructurings. The increase in the allowance for credit
losses at June 30, 2023, compared with December 31, 2022, was primarily driven by increasing economic uncertainty and normalizing credit losses as well as
adjustments made to the purchase accounting estimate for PCD loans. Economic uncertainty and recession risk have been increasing due to rising interest rates,
inflationary concerns, market volatility and pressure on corporate earnings related to these factors. In addition to these broad economic factors, expected loss
estimates consider various factors including customer specific information impacting changes in risk ratings, projected delinquencies and the impact of
economic deterioration on selected borrowers’ liquidity and ability to repay.
The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 739 percent at June 30, 2023, compared with 762 percent at December 31, 2022.
The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to annualized loan net charge-offs was 296 percent at June 30, 2023, compared with 697 percent of full year 2022 net
charge- offs at December 31, 2022.
Economic conditions considered in estimating the allowance for credit losses at June 30, 2023 included changes in projected gross domestic product and
unemployment levels. These factors are evaluated through a combination of quantitative calculations using multiple economic scenarios and additional
qualitative assessments that consider the high degree of economic uncertainty in the current environment. The projected unemployment rates for 2023
considered in the estimate range from 3.0 percent to 6.9 percent.
The following table summarizes the baseline forecast for key economic variables the Company used in its estimate of the allowance for credit losses at June 30,
2023 and December 31, 2022:

The allowance for credit losses related to commercial lending segment loans increased $194 million during the first six months of 2023, reflecting the
impact of increasing economic uncertainty, normalizing credit conditions and select commercial real estate loan deterioration.
The allowance for credit losses related to consumer lending segment loans increased $97 million during the first six months of 2023, due to the impact of
economic uncertainty, normalizing credit performance and the effects of higher interest rates on the life of the residential mortgage portfolios, partially offset by
a decrease related to a change in accounting principle.

Residual Value Risk Management The Company manages its risk to changes in the residual value of leased vehicles, office and business equipment, and other
assets through disciplined residual valuation at the inception of a lease, diversification of its leased assets, regular residual asset valuation reviews and
monitoring of residual value gains or losses upon the disposition of assets. As of June 30, 2023, no significant change in the amount of residual values or
concentration of the portfolios had occurred since December 31, 2022. Refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Residual Value Risk Management”
in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, for further discussion on residual value risk management.
Operational Risk Management The Company operates in many different businesses in diverse markets and relies on the ability of its employees and systems to
process a high number of transactions. Operational risk is inherent in all business activities, and the management of this risk is important to the achievement of
the Company’s objectives. Business lines have direct and primary responsibility and accountability for identifying, controlling, and monitoring operational risks
embedded in their business activities, including those additional or increased risks created by economic and financial disruptions. The Company maintains a
system of controls with the objective of providing proper transaction authorization and execution, proper system operations, proper oversight of third parties
with whom it does business, safeguarding of assets from misuse or theft, and ensuring the reliability and security of financial and other data. Refer to
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Operational Risk Management” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2022, for further discussion on operational risk management.
Compliance Risk Management The Company may suffer legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, or damage to its reputation through failure to
comply with laws, regulations, rules, standards of good practice, and codes of conduct, including those related to compliance with Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money
laundering requirements, sanctions compliance requirements as administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, consumer protection and other
requirements. The Company has controls and processes in place for the assessment, identification, monitoring, management and reporting of compliance risks
and issues, including those created or increased by economic and financial disruptions. Refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Compliance Risk
Management” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, for further discussion on compliance risk management.
Interest Rate Risk Management In the banking industry, changes in interest rates are a significant risk that can impact earnings and the safety and soundness of
an entity. The Company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates through asset and liability management activities within guidelines established by its
Asset Liability Management Committee (“ALCO”) and approved by the Board of Directors. The ALCO has the responsibility for approving and overseeing
compliance with the ALCO management policies, including interest rate risk exposure. One way the Company measures and analyzes its interest rate risk is
through net interest income simulation analysis.
Simulation analysis incorporates substantially all of the Company’s assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, together with forecasted
changes in the balance sheet and assumptions that reflect the current interest rate environment. Through this simulation, management estimates the impact on net
interest income of various interest rate changes that differ in the direction, amount and speed of change over time, as well as the shape of the yield curve. This
simulation includes assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to be affected by changes in loan and deposit growth. Assumptions are made to project
interest rates for new loans and deposits based on historical analysis, management’s outlook and re-pricing strategies. These assumptions are reviewed and
validated on a periodic basis with sensitivity analysis being provided for key variables of the simulation. The results are reviewed monthly by the ALCO and are
used to guide asset/liability management strategies.
The Company manages its interest rate risk position by holding assets with desired interest rate risk characteristics on its balance sheet, implementing
certain pricing strategies for loans and deposits and selecting derivatives and various funding and investment portfolio strategies. The Company also manages
interest rate sensitivity by utilizing market value of equity modeling, which measures the degree to which the market values of the Company’s assets and
liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments will change given a change in interest rates. Management measures the impact of changes in market values due to
interest rates under a number of scenarios, including immediate and sustained parallel shifts, and flattening or steepening of the yield curve.
Table 9 summarizes the projected impact to net interest income over the next 12 months of various potential interest rate changes. The sensitivity of the
projected impact to net interest income over the next

12 months is dependent on balance sheet growth, product mix, deposit behavior, pricing and funding decisions. While the Company utilizes models and
assumptions based on historical information and expected behaviors, actual outcomes could vary significantly. Net interest income sensitivities reflect the
impact of current market expectations for interest rates, driving an increase in baseline projected net interest income. As market expectations are reflected in
projected results, incremental interest rate sensitivity declines on a percentage basis.
Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and Other Risks To manage the sensitivity of earnings and capital to interest rate, prepayment, credit, price and
foreign currency fluctuations (asset and liability management positions), the Company enters into derivative transactions. The Company uses derivatives for
asset and liability management purposes primarily in the following ways:
• To convert fixed-rate debt and available-for-sale investment securities from fixed-rate payments to floating-rate payments;
• To convert floating-rate loans and debt from floating-rate payments to fixed-rate payments;
• To mitigate changes in value of the Company’s unfunded mortgage loan commitments, funded MLHFS and MSRs;
• To mitigate remeasurement volatility of foreign currency denominated balances; and
• To mitigate the volatility of the Company’s net investment in foreign operations driven by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
In addition, the Company enters into interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity derivative contracts to support the business requirements of its
customers (customer-related positions). The Company minimizes the market and liquidity risks of customer-related positions by either entering into similar
offsetting positions with broker-dealers, or on a portfolio basis by entering into other derivative or non-derivative financial instruments that partially or fully
offset the exposure from these customer-related positions. The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are either exchange-traded, centrally cleared
through clearinghouses or over-the-counter. The Company does not utilize derivatives for speculative purposes.
The Company does not designate all of the derivatives that it enters into for risk management purposes as accounting hedges because of the inefficiency
of applying the accounting requirements and may instead elect fair value accounting for the related hedged items. In particular, the Company enters into interest
rate swaps, swaptions, forward commitments to buy to-be-announced securities (“TBAs”), U.S. Treasury and Eurodollar futures and options on U.S. Treasury
futures to mitigate fluctuations in the value of its MSRs, but does not designate those derivatives as accounting hedges. Additionally, the Company uses forward
commitments to sell TBAs and other commitments to sell residential mortgage loans at specified prices to economically hedge the interest rate risk in its
residential mortgage loan production activities. The forward commitments to sell and the unfunded mortgage loan commitments on loans intended to be sold are
considered derivatives under the accounting guidance related to accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities. The Company has elected the fair
value option for the MLHFS.
Derivatives are subject to credit risk associated with counterparties to the contracts. Credit risk associated with derivatives is measured by the Company
based on the probability of counterparty default. The Company manages the credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various
counterparties, by entering into master netting arrangements, and, where possible, by requiring collateral arrangements. The Company may also transfer
counterparty credit risk related to interest rate swaps to third parties through the use of risk participation agreements. In addition, certain interest rate swaps,
interest rate forwards and credit contracts are required to be centrally cleared through clearinghouses to further mitigate counterparty credit risk. The Company
may mitigate credit risk on loans or lending portfolios through the use of credit contracts.
For additional information on derivatives and hedging activities, refer to Notes 13 and 14 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
LIBOR Transition In July 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) announced that it would no longer require banks to submit rates
for
22 U.S. Bancorp
Table of Contents
the London InterBank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) after 2021. As of July 3, 2023, all tenors of LIBOR have ceased to be published or representative. The Company
holds financial instruments impacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR, including certain loans, investment securities, derivatives, borrowings and other financial
instruments that use LIBOR as the benchmark rate. The Company also provides various services to customers in its capacities as trustee, servicer, and asset
manager, which involve financial instruments that are similarly impacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR.
The Company has implemented its remediation strategy for its financial instruments associated with all LIBOR currencies and tenors and has established
processes and procedures to address inquiries from customers and other third-parties regarding the LIBOR transition. The Company has applied the Adjustable
Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the “LIBOR Act”) and the Regulations Implementing the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (Regulation ZZ) (the “Final Rules”)
to substantially all financial instruments that are eligible. The LIBOR Act and Final Rules established a process for replacing LIBOR in existing LIBOR
contracts that did not provide for the use of a clearly defined or practicable replacement benchmark rate by providing that a benchmark replacement identified
by the Federal Reserve Board that is based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) replaces LIBOR as the benchmark for those contracts as a matter
of law, without the need to be amended by the parties.
Because financial instruments will transition to an alternative reference rate (“ARR”) at the first reset date LIBOR is unavailable, many products will
continue to accrue interest on LIBOR for a period of time after cessation, but these financial instruments all have a transition plan in place as of the cessation of
LIBOR.
Refer to “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, for further discussion on potential risks
that could adversely affect the Company’s financial results as a result of the LIBOR transition.
Market Risk Management In addition to interest rate risk, the Company is exposed to other forms of market risk, principally related to trading activities which
support customers’strategies to manage their own foreign currency, interest rate risk, commodities risk and funding activities. For purposes of its internal capital
adequacy assessment process, the Company considers risk arising from its trading activities, as well as the remeasurement volatility of foreign currency
denominated balances included on its Consolidated Balance Sheet (collectively, “Covered Positions”), employing methodologies consistent with the
requirements of regulatory rules for market risk. The Company’s Market Risk Committee (“MRC”), within the framework of the ALCO, oversees market risk
management. The MRC monitors and reviews the Company’s Covered Positions and establishes policies for market risk management, including exposure limits
for each portfolio. The Company uses a VaR approach to measure general market risk. Theoretically, VaR represents the statistical risk of loss the Company has
to adverse market movements over a one-day time horizon. The Company uses the Historical Simulation method to calculate VaR for its Covered Positions
measured at the ninety-ninth percentile using a one-year look-back period for distributions derived from past market data. The market factors used in the
calculations include those pertinent to market risks inherent in the underlying trading portfolios, principally those that affect the Company’s corporate bond
trading business, foreign currency transaction business, client derivatives business, loan trading business and municipal securities business, as well as those
inherent in the Company’s foreign denominated balances and the derivatives used to mitigate the related measurement volatility. On average, the Company
expects the one-day VaR to be exceeded by actual losses two to three times per year related to these positions. The Company monitors the accuracy of internal
VaR models and modeling processes by back-testing model performance, regularly updating the historical data used by the VaR models and regular model
validations to assess the accuracy of the models’ input, processing, and reporting components. All models are required to be independently reviewed and
approved prior to being placed in use. If the Company were to experience market losses in excess of the estimated VaR more often than expected, the VaR
models and associated assumptions would be analyzed and adjusted. VaR amounts reflect MUB beginning December 1, 2022, the day the acquisition transaction
closed.
The average, high, low and period-end one-day VaR amounts for the Company’s Covered Positions were as follows:

events that may not be captured by its VaR models, including worst case historical market movement combinations that have not necessarily occurred on the
same date.
The Company calculates Stressed VaR using the same underlying methodology and model as VaR, except that a historical continuous one-year look-back
period is utilized that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate to the Company’s Covered Positions. The period selected by the Company
includes the significant market volatility of the last four months of 2008.
The average, high, low and period-end one-day Stressed VaR amounts for the Company’s Covered Positions were as follows:

Valuations of positions in client derivatives and foreign currency activities are based on discounted cash flow or other valuation techniques using marketbased assumptions. These valuations are compared to third-party quotes or other market prices to determine if there are significant variances. Significant
variances are approved by senior management in the Company’s corporate functions. Valuation of positions in the corporate bond trading, loan trading and
municipal securities businesses are based on trader marks. These trader marks are evaluated against third-party prices, with significant variances approved by
senior management in the Company’s corporate functions.
The Company also measures the market risk of its hedging activities related to residential MLHFS and MSRs using the Historical Simulation method. The
VaRs are measured at the ninety-ninth percentile and employ factors pertinent to the market risks inherent in the valuation of the assets and hedges. A one-year
look-back period is used to obtain past market data for the models.
The average, high and low VaR amounts for the residential MLHFS and related hedges and the MSRs and related hedges were as follows:

Liquidity Risk Management The Company’s liquidity risk management process is designed to identify, measure, and manage the Company’s funding and
liquidity risk to meet its daily funding needs and to address expected and unexpected changes in its funding requirements. The Company engages in various
activities to manage its liquidity risk. These activities include diversifying its funding sources, stress testing, and holding readily-marketable assets which can be
used as a source of liquidity if needed. In addition, the Company’s profitable operations, sound credit quality and strong credit ratings and capital position have
enabled it to develop a large and reliable base of core deposit funding within its market areas and in domestic and global capital markets.
The Company’s Board of Directors approves the Company’s liquidity policy. The Risk Management Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors
oversees the Company’s liquidity risk management process and approves a contingency funding plan. The ALCO reviews the Company’s liquidity policy and
limits, and regularly assesses the Company’s ability to meet funding requirements arising from adverse company-specific or market events.
The Company regularly projects its funding needs under various stress scenarios and maintains a contingency funding plan consistent with the Company’s
access to diversified sources of contingent funding. The Company maintains a substantial level of total available liquidity in the form of on-balance sheet and
off-balance sheet funding sources. These liquidity sources include cash at the Federal Reserve Bank and certain European central banks, unencumbered liquid
assets, and capacity to borrow from the FHLB and at the Federal Reserve Bank’s Discount Window and new Bank Term Funding Program, created in 2023.
Unencumbered liquid assets in the Company’s investment securities portfolio provides asset liquidity through the Company’s ability to sell the securities or
pledge and borrow against them. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and “Balance Sheet Analysis” for further information on
investment securities maturities and trends. Asset liquidity is further enhanced by the Company’s practice of pledging loans to access secured borrowing
facilities through the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank.

The Company’s diversified deposit base provides a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funding, while reducing the Company’s reliance on
the wholesale markets. Total deposits were $521.6 billion at June 30, 2023, compared with $525.0 billion at December 31, 2022. Refer to “Balance Sheet
Analysis” for further information on the Company’s deposits.
Additional funding is provided by long-term debt and short-term borrowings. Long-term debt was $45.3 billion at June 30, 2023, and is an important
funding source because of its multi-year borrowing structure. Short-term borrowings were $32.3 billion at June 30, 2023, and supplement the Company’s other
funding sources. Refer to “Balance Sheet Analysis” for further information on the Company’s long-term debt and short-term borrowings.
In addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis, the Company monitors the parent company’s liquidity. The parent company’s routine
funding requirements consist primarily of operating expenses, dividends paid to shareholders, debt service, repurchases of common stock and funds used for
acquisitions. The parent company obtains funding to meet its obligations from dividends collected from its subsidiaries and the issuance of debt and capital
securities. The Company establishes limits for the minimal number of months into the future where the parent company can meet existing and forecasted
obligations with cash and securities held that can be readily monetized. The Company measures and manages this limit in both normal and adverse conditions.
The Company maintains sufficient funding to meet expected capital and debt service obligations for 24 months without the support of dividends from
subsidiaries and assuming access to the wholesale markets is maintained. The Company maintains sufficient liquidity to meet its capital and debt service
obligations for 12 months under adverse conditions without the support of dividends from subsidiaries or access to the wholesale markets. The parent company
is currently in excess of required liquidity minimums.
At June 30, 2023, parent company long-term debt outstanding was $34.0 billion, compared with $27.0 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase was
primarily due to $7.2 billion of medium-term note issuances. As of June 30, 2023, there was no parent company debt scheduled to mature in the remainder of
2023. Future debt maturities may be met through medium-term note and capital security issuances and dividends from subsidiaries, as well as from parent
company cash and cash equivalents.
The Company is subject to a regulatory Liquidity Coverage Ratio (“LCR”) requirement which requires banks to maintain an adequate level of
unencumbered high quality liquid assets to meet estimated liquidity needs over a 30-day stressed period. At June 30, 2023, the Company was compliant with
this requirement.
The Company is also subject to a regulatory Net Stable Funding Ratio (“NSFR”) requirement which requires banks to maintain a minimum level of stable
funding based on the liquidity characteristics of their assets, commitments, and derivative exposures over a one-year time horizon. At June 30, 2023, the
Company was compliant with this requirement.
Refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Liquidity Risk Management” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2022, for further discussion on liquidity risk management.
European Exposures The Company provides merchant processing and corporate trust services in Europe either directly or through banking affiliations in
Europe. Revenue generated from sources in Europe represented approximately 2 percent of the Company’s total net revenue for both the three and six months
ended June 30, 2023. Operating cash for these businesses is deposited on a short-term basis typically with certain European central banks. For deposits placed at
other European banks, exposure is mitigated by the Company placing deposits at multiple banks and managing the amounts on deposit at any bank based on
institution-specific deposit limits. At June 30, 2023, the Company had an aggregate amount on deposit with European banks of approximately $7.0 billion,
predominately with the Central Bank of Ireland and Bank of England.
In addition, the Company provides financing to domestic multinational corporations that generate revenue from customers in European countries,
transacts with various European banks as counterparties to certain derivative-related activities, and through a subsidiary, manages money market funds that hold
certain investments in European sovereign debt. Any deterioration in economic conditions in Europe, including the impacts resulting from the Russia-Ukraine
conflict, is not expected to have a significant effect on the Company related to these activities.

Total risk-based capital as a percent of risk-weighted assets 12.7 11.9
Tier 1 capital as a percent of adjusted quarterly average assets (leverage ratio) 7.5 7.9
Tier 1 capital as a percent of total on- and off-balance sheet leverage exposure (total leverage exposure ratio) 6.2 6.4
(a) The Company’s common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio, reflecting the full implementation of the CECL methodology, was 8.9 percent at June 30, 2023, compared with 8.1 percent at
December 31, 2022.
Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Other Contractual Obligations The Company participates in many different contractual arrangements which may or
may not be recorded on its balance sheet, with unrelated or consolidated entities, under which the Company has an obligation to pay certain amounts, provide
credit or liquidity enhancements or provide market risk support. These arrangements include commitments to extend credit, letters of credit and various forms of
guarantees. Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on guarantees and contingent liabilities. These
arrangements also include any obligation related to a variable interest held in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, credit enhancement or
market risk support. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Company’s interests in variable
interest entities.
Capital Management The Company is committed to managing capital to maintain strong protection for depositors and creditors and for maximum shareholder
benefit. The Company also manages its capital to exceed regulatory capital requirements for banking organizations. To achieve its capital goals, the Company
employs a variety of capital management tools, including dividends, common share repurchases, and the issuance of subordinated debt, non-cumulative
perpetual preferred stock, common stock and other capital instruments. The regulatory capital requirements effective for the Company follow Basel III, with the
Company being subject to calculating its capital adequacy as a percentage of risk-weighted assets under the standardized approach. Beginning in 2022, the
Company began to phase into its regulatory capital requirements the cumulative deferred impact of its 2020 adoption of the accounting guidance related to the
impairment of financial instruments based on the current expected credit losses (“CECL”) methodology plus 25 percent of its quarterly credit reserve increases
during 2020 and 2021. This cumulative deferred impact will continue to be phased into the Company’s regulatory capital over the next two years, culminating
with a fully phased in regulatory capital calculation beginning in 2025. Table 10 provides a summary of statutory regulatory capital ratios in effect for the
Company at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. All regulatory ratios exceeded regulatory “well-capitalized” requirements.
In connection with the Company’s acquisition of MUB, the Company committed to meet the requirements applicable to Category II institutions by
December 31, 2024, if the Federal Reserve notifies the Company by January 1, 2024, that the Company must comply with such rules.
In July 2023, the U.S. federal bank regulatory authorities proposed a rule implementing the Basel Committee’s finalization of the post-crisis regulatory
capital reforms. The proposal provides for a July 1, 2025 effective date, subject to a three-year transition period. The proposal includes the Fundamental Review
of the Trading Book, which replaces the market risk rule, and introduces new standardized approaches for credit risk, operational risk and credit valuation
adjustment (CVA) risk, which would replace the current models-based approaches. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the proposed rule and
expects that any final rule would result in the Company being required to maintain increased levels of regulatory capital.
The Company believes certain other capital ratios are useful in evaluating its capital adequacy. The Company’s tangible common equity, as a percent of
tangible assets and as a percent of risk-weighted assets determined in accordance with transitional regulatory capital requirements related to the CECL
methodology under the standardized approach, was 4.8 percent and 6.8 percent, respectively, at June 30, 2023, compared with 4.5 percent and 6.0 percent,
respectively, at December 31, 2022. In addition, the Company’s common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio, reflecting the full implementation of
the CECL methodology was 8.9 percent at June 30, 2023, compared with 8.1 percent at December 31, 2022. Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”
beginning on page 32 for further information on these other capital ratios.

Table of Contents
Total U.S. Bancorp shareholders’ equity was $53.0 billion at June 30, 2023, compared with $50.8 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase was
primarily the result of corporate earnings and changes in unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investment securities included in other comprehensive
income (loss), partially offset by dividends paid.
The Company announced on December 22, 2020 that its Board of Directors had approved an authorization to repurchase $3.0 billion of its common stock
beginning January 1, 2021. The Company suspended all common stock repurchases at the beginning of the third quarter of 2021, except for those done
exclusively in connection with its stock-based compensation programs, due to its acquisition of MUB. The Company will evaluate potential repurchases in
connection with the potential capital requirements given the regulatory landscape. Capital distributions, including dividends and stock repurchases, are subject to
the approval of the Company’s Board of Directors and compliance with regulatory requirements. On August 3, 2023, the Company issued 24 million shares of
common stock of the Company to an affiliate of MUFG for a purchase price of $936 million. The proceeds of the issuance were used to repay a portion of the
Company’s $3.5 billion debt obligation to MUFG. As a result, the Company’s common equity tier 1 capital ratio will increase by approximately 20 basis points.
See “MUFG Union Bank Acquisition” on page 5 of this Report for further information.

LINE OF BUSINESS FINANCIAL REVIEW
The Company’s major lines of business are Corporate and Commercial Banking, Consumer and Business Banking, Wealth Management and Investment
Services, Payment Services, and Treasury and Corporate Support. These operating segments are components of the Company about which financial information
is prepared and is evaluated regularly by management in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance.
Basis for Financial Presentation Business line results are derived from the Company’s business unit profitability reporting systems by specifically attributing
managed balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related income or expense. Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information on the business lines’ basis for financial presentation.
Designations, assignments and allocations change from time to time as management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating performance or product
lines change or business segments are realigned to better respond to the Company’s diverse customer base. During 2023, certain organization and methodology
changes were made and, accordingly, 2022 results were restated and presented on a comparable basis.
Corporate and Commercial Banking Corporate and Commercial Banking offers lending, equipment finance and small-ticket leasing, depository services,
treasury management, capital markets services, international trade services and other financial services to middle market, large corporate, commercial real estate,
financial institution, non-profit and public sector clients. Corporate and Commercial Banking contributed $435 million of the Company’s net income in the
second quarter and $1.0 billion in the first six months of 2023, or increases of $59 million (15.7 percent) and $258 million (32.9 percent), respectively, compared
with the same periods of 2022.
Net revenue increased $295 million (27.5 percent) in the second quarter and $700 million (33.9 percent) in the first six months of 2023, compared with
the same periods of 2022. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, increased $220 million (27.5 percent) in the second quarter and $553 million (35.8
percent) in the first six months of 2023, compared with the same periods of 2022. The increases were primarily due to the impact of
U.S. Bancorp 27
Table of Contents
higher rates on the margin benefit from deposits and the acquisition of MUB. Noninterest income increased $75 million (27.6 percent) in the second quarter and
$147 million (28.3 percent) in the first six months of 2023, compared with the same periods of 2022, primarily due to the MUB acquisition and higher
commercial products revenue mainly due to higher trading revenue.
Noninterest expense increased $165 million (35.0 percent) in the second quarter and $334 million (36.5 percent) in the first six months of 2023, compared
with the same periods of 2022, primarily due to higher FDIC insurance expense driven by an increase in the assessment base and rate along with the inclusion of
MUB in the current year, higher net shared services expense driven by investment in support of business growth and the impact of the MUB acquisition,
including intangible amortization driven by the core deposit intangible. The provision for credit losses increased $52 million (53.1 percent) in the second quarter
and $22 million (21.2 percent) in the first six months of 2023, compared with the same periods of 2022, primarily due to credit downgrades in commercial real
estate and select commercial portfolios in the current year.
Consumer and Business Banking Consumer and Business Banking comprises consumer banking, small business banking and consumer lending. Products and
services are delivered through banking offices, telephone servicing and sales, on-line services, direct mail, ATM processing, mobile devices, distributed
mortgage loan officers, and intermediary relationships including auto dealerships, mortgage banks, and strategic business partners. Consumer and Business
Banking contributed $598 million of the Company’s net income in the second quarter and $1.3 billion in the first six months of 2023, or increases of

Net revenue increased $652 million (33.1 percent) in the second quarter and $1.4 million (35.7 percent) in the first six months of 2023, compared with the
same periods of 2022. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, increased $616 million (39.0 percent) in the second quarter and $1.4 billion (46.3
percent) in the first six months of 2023, compared with the same periods of 2022, due to the favorable impact of higher rates on the margin benefit from deposits
and the acquisition of MUB. Noninterest income increased $36 million (9.2 percent) in the second quarter of 2023, compared with the second quarter of 2022,
primarily due to the acquisition of MUB. Noninterest income decreased $21 million (2.5 percent) in the first six months of 2023, compared with the first six
months of 2022, primarily due to lower mortgage banking revenue reflecting lower application volume, given declining refinancing activities experienced in the
mortgage industry, partially offset by the impact of the MUB acquisition.
Noninterest expense increased $400 million (28.6 percent) in the second quarter and $761 million (27.1 percent) in the first six months of 2023, compared
with the same periods of 2022, primarily due to increases in net shared services expense due to investments in digital capabilities and the impact of the MUB
acquisition, including intangible amortization driven by the core deposit intangible. The provision for credit losses increased $98 million in the second quarter
and $57 million in the first six months of 2023, compared with the same periods of 2022, due to normalizing credit conditions.
Wealth Management and Investment Services Wealth Management and Investment Services provides private banking, financial advisory services, investment
management, retail brokerage services, insurance, trust, custody and fund servicing through four businesses: Wealth Management, Global Corporate Trust &
Custody, U.S. Bancorp Asset Management and Fund Services. Wealth Management and Investment Services contributed $403 million of the Company’s net

the same periods of 2022. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, increased $112 million (30.3 percent) in the second quarter and $337 million (50.9
percent) in the first six months of 2023, compared with the same periods of 2022, primarily due to the favorable impact of higher rates on the margin benefit
from deposits and the acquisition of MUB. Noninterest income increased $76 million (11.7 percent) in the second quarter and $182 million (14.6 percent) in the
first six months of 2023, compared with the same periods of 2022, primarily due to higher trust and investment management fees driven by the acquisition of
MUB and core business growth.
Noninterest expense increased $131 million (24.3 percent) in the second quarter and $243 million (22.3 percent) in the first six months of 2023, compared
with the same periods of 2022, reflecting higher compensation and employee benefits expense as a result of merit increases and core business growth, higher net
shared services expense driven by investment in support

of business growth and the impact of the MUB acquisition. The provision for credit losses increased $7 million in the second quarter and decreased $4 million in
the first six months of 2023, compared with the same periods of 2022. The changes from the prior year were driven by ending loan balance growth in the current
year compared to the prior year.
Payment Services Payment Services includes consumer and business credit cards, stored-value cards, debit cards, corporate, government and purchasing card
services and merchant processing. Payment Services contributed $350 million of the Company’s net income in the second quarter and $693 million in the first
six months of 2023, or decreases of $44 million (11.2 percent) and $78 million (10.1 percent), respectively, compared with the same periods of 2022.
Net revenue increased $84 million (5.2 percent) in the second quarter and $196 million (6.3 percent) in the first six months of 2023, compared with the
same periods of 2022. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, increased $26 million (4.2 percent) in the second quarter and $58 million (4.7 percent)
in the first six months of 2023, compared with the same periods of 2022, primarily due to higher loan yields driven by higher interest rates and customer revolve
rates, higher loan balances and higher loan fees, mostly offset by higher funding costs. Noninterest income increased $58 million (5.8 percent) in the second
quarter and $138 million (7.5 percent) in the first six months of 2023, compared with the same periods of 2022, mainly due to continued strengthening of
consumer and business spending across most sectors. As a result, there was strong growth in card revenue and merchant processing services revenue driven by
higher sales volume, as well as higher corporate payment products revenue due to increased spending.
Noninterest expense increased $50 million (5.8 percent) in the second quarter and $117 million (6.8 percent) in the first six months of 2023, compared
with the same periods of 2022, reflecting higher net shared services expense driven by investment in infrastructure and technology development, in addition to
higher compensation and employee benefits expense due to merit increases and core business growth. The provision for credit losses increased $93 million (42.1
percent) in the second quarter and $183 million (52.1 percent) in the first six months of 2023, compared with the same periods of 2022, primarily due to
normalizing credit conditions exhibited through increasing delinquency rates and lower consumer liquidity.
Treasury and Corporate Support Treasury and Corporate Support includes the Company’s investment portfolios, funding, capital management, interest rate risk
management, income taxes not allocated to the business lines, including most investments in tax-advantaged projects, and the residual aggregate of those
expenses associated with corporate activities that are managed on a consolidated basis. Treasury and Corporate Support recorded net losses of $425 million in
the second quarter and $774 million in the first six months of 2023, compared with a net loss of $87 million and net income of $78 million in the same periods
of 2022, respectively.
Net revenue decreased $56 million (16.6 percent) in the second quarter and $69 million (10.8 percent) in the first six months of 2023, compared with the
same periods of 2022. Noninterest income decreased $67 million (27.8 percent) in the second quarter and $157 million (32.4 percent) in the first six months of
2023, compared with the same periods of 2022, primarily due to lower securities gains and commercial products revenue, along with the impact of balance sheet
repositioning and capital management actions. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, increased $11 million (11.5 percent) in the second quarter and
$88 million (57.9 percent) in the first six months of 2023, compared with the same periods of 2022, primarily due to the acquisition of MUB, partially offset by
higher funding costs.
Noninterest expense increased $99 million (22.1 percent) in the second quarter and $443 million (63.2 percent) in the first six months of 2023, compared
with the same periods of 2022, primarily due to merger and integration charges and operating expenses related to the acquisition of MUB, higher compensation
and employee benefits expense reflecting merit increases and hiring to support business growth, partially offset by lower net shared services expense. The
provision for credit losses increased $260 million in the second quarter and $567 million in the first six months of 2023, compared with the same periods of
2022, primarily due to balance sheet repositioning and capital management actions and increased economic uncertainty.
Income taxes are assessed to each line of business at a managerial tax rate of 25.0 percent with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the
consolidated effective tax rate included in Treasury and Corporate Support.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
In addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the Company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy,
including:
• Tangible common equity to tangible assets,
• Tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets, and
• Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, reflecting the full implementation of the CECL methodology.
These capital measures are viewed by management as useful additional methods of evaluating the Company’s utilization of its capital held and the level of
capital available to withstand unexpected negative market or economic conditions. Additionally, presentation of these measures allows investors, analysts and
banking regulators to assess the Company’s capital position relative to other financial services companies. These capital measures are not defined in generally
accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), or are not currently effective or defined in banking regulations. In addition, certain of these measures differ from
currently effective capital ratios defined by banking regulations principally in that the currently effective ratios, which are subject to certain transitional
provisions, temporarily exclude the impact of the 2020 adoption of accounting guidance related to impairment of financial instruments based on the CECL
methodology. As a result, these capital measures disclosed by the Company may be considered non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes this
information helps investors assess trends in the Company’s capital adequacy.
The Company also discloses net interest income and related ratios and analysis on a taxable-equivalent basis, which may also be considered non-GAAP
financial measures. The Company believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison
of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. In addition, certain performance measures, including the efficiency ratio and net interest
margin utilize net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis.
There may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, the Company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial
statements and other financial information contained in this report in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure.
The following table shows the Company’s calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures:

CRITICALACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accounting and reporting policies of the Company comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and conform to general
practices within the banking industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions. The Company’s financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions, which are integral to understanding
the Company’s financial statements. Critical accounting policies are those policies management believes are the most important to the portrayal of the
Company’s financial condition and results, and require management to make estimates that are difficult, subjective or complex. Most accounting policies are not
considered by management to be critical accounting policies. Management has discussed the development and the selection of critical accounting policies with
the Company’s Audit Committee. Those policies considered to be critical accounting policies relate to the allowance for credit losses, fair value estimates,
MSRs, and income taxes. These accounting policies are discussed in detail in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Critical Accounting Policies” and the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the
Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)). Based upon this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer have
concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
During the most recently completed fiscal quarter, the Company completed the conversion of MUB into its overall internal control over financial
reporting processes. There were no other changes made in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
