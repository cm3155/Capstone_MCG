 Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

&#160;

OVERVIEW 

Earnings Summary

U.S. Bancorp and its subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) reported net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp of $1.6 billion for the third quarter of 2020, or $0.99 per diluted common share, compared with $1.9 billion, or $1.15 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2019. Return on average assets and return on average common equity were 1.17 percent and 12.8 percent, respectively, for the third quarter of 2020, compared with 1.57 percent and 15.3 percent, respectively, for the third quarter of 2019. During a challenging period adversely impacted by the COVID-19

pandemic, the Company&#8217;s diversified business generated growth in net revenue and supported a provision for credit losses of $635 million including a $120 million increase in the allowance for credit losses primarily to recognize the expected credit losses of an acquired credit card portfolio in the third quarter of 2020.

Total net revenue for the third quarter of 2020 was $44 million (0.7 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2019, reflecting a 3.7 percent increase in noninterest income, partially offset by a 1.6 percent decrease in net interest income. The decrease in net interest income from the third quarter of 2019 was primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates from a year ago, partially offset by changes in deposit and funding mix, and loan growth. The noninterest income increase was driven by significant growth in mortgage banking revenue due to refinancing production and strong growth in commercial products revenue due to capital markets activities. Growth in these fee categories was partially offset by a decline in payment services revenue and deposit service charges related to lower consumer and commercial spending. Additionally, other noninterest income declined from the third quarter of 2019 due to lower equity investment income, lower tax-advantaged

investment syndication revenue and certain asset impairments as a result of expected branch closures.

Noninterest expense in the third quarter of 2020 was $227 million (7.2 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2019, reflecting costs related to COVID-19

and an increase in revenue-related production expenses in the third quarter of 2020. Additionally, noninterest expense reflected an increase in personnel costs and technology and communications expense related to developing digital capabilities and related business investment, as well as an increase in other noninterest expense, partially offset by lower marketing and business development expense and lower professional services expense.

The provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2020 of $635 million was $268 million (73.0 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2019, reflecting an increase in the allowance for credit losses during the third quarter of 2020 primarily to recognize the expected losses within the acquired State Farm Bank credit card portfolio. Net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2020 were $515 million, compared with $352 million in the third quarter of 2019. Refer to &#8220;Corporate Risk Profile&#8221; for further information on the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs, nonperforming assets and other factors considered by the Company in assessing the credit quality of the loan portfolio and establishing the allowance for credit losses. 

Net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp for the first nine months of 2020 was $3.4 billion, or $2.11 per diluted common share, compared with $5.4 billion, or $3.25 per diluted common share, for the first nine months of 2019. Return on average assets and return on average common equity were 0.87 percent and 9.3 percent, respectively, for the first nine months of 2020, compared with 1.54 percent and 14.9 percent, respectively, for the first nine months of 2019. 

Total net revenue for the first nine months of 2020 was $255 million (1.5 percent) higher than the first nine months of 2019, reflecting a 6.2 percent increase in noninterest income, partially offset by a 2.0 percent decrease in net interest income. The decrease in net interest income from the first nine months of 2019 was primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates, partially offset by changes in deposit and funding mix, and loan growth. The noninterest income increase was driven by significant growth in mortgage banking revenue and commercial products revenue, as well as increases in trust and investment management fees and gains on the sale of investment securities. Growth in these fee categories was partially offset by a decline in payment services revenue and deposit service charges related to lower consumer and commercial spending. Additionally, other noninterest income declined from the prior year due to lower equity investment income, lower tax-advantaged

investment syndication revenue and certain asset impairments, partially offset by gains on sale of certain businesses in the first nine months of 2020.

Noninterest expense in the first nine months of 2020 was $621 million (6.6 percent) higher than the first nine months of 2019, reflecting costs related to COVID-19

and an increase in revenue-related production expenses in the first nine months of 2020. Additionally, noninterest expense

&#160;

U.S. Bancorp &#160; 3

reflected an increase in personnel costs and technology and communications expense related to developing digital capabilities and related business investment, as well as an increase in other noninterest expense, partially offset by lower marketing and business development expense and lower professional services expense. 

The provision for credit losses for the first nine months of 2020 of $3.4 billion was $2.3 billion higher than the first nine months of 2019, reflecting an increase in the allowance for credit losses during the first nine months of 2020 due to deteriorating economic conditions driven by the impact of COVID-19

on the domestic and global economies. Net charge-offs in the first nine months of 2020 were $1.3 billion, compared with $1.1 billion in the first nine months of 2019. Refer to &#8220;Corporate Risk Profile&#8221; for further information on the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs, nonperforming assets and other factors considered by the Company in assessing the credit quality of the loan portfolio and establishing the allowance for credit losses.

STATEMENT OF INCOME ANALYSIS 

Net Interest Income

Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, was $3.3 billion in the third quarter and $9.7 billion in the first nine months of 2020, representing decreases of $54 million (1.6 percent) and $201 million (2.0 percent), respectively, compared with the same periods of 2019. The decreases were principally driven by the impact of lower interest rates from the prior year, partially offset by changes in deposit and funding mix, and loan growth. The Company expects net interest income to be relatively flat or decline slightly in the fourth quarter of 2020, as compared with the third quarter of 2020, reflecting the expected continued low interest rate environment and its impact on the rates earned on reinvested securities, as well as higher premium amortization, within the investment securities portfolio. Average earning assets were $50.4 billion (11.6 percent) higher in the third quarter and $48.6 billion (11.4 percent) higher in the first nine months of 2020, compared with the same periods of 2019, reflecting increases in loans, investment securities and other earning assets primarily representing cash balances. The net interest margin, on a taxable-equivalent basis, in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 was 2.67 percent and 2.73 percent, respectively, compared with 3.02 percent and 3.10 percent in the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively. The decrease in net interest margin from the prior year was primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates, changes in the yield curve, a decision to maintain higher cash balances for liquidity and higher premium amortization within the investment portfolio, partially offset by the net benefit of changes in loan mix and deposit and funding mix. The Company expects downward pressure on its net interest margin in the fourth quarter of 2020 due to its expectation to maintain higher liquidity levels resulting from the acquisition of approximately $10 billion of deposit balances from State Farm Bank in early October 2020. Refer to the &#8220;Consolidated Daily Average Balance Sheet and Related Yields and Rates&#8221; tables for further information on net interest income.

Average total loans in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 were $18.6 billion (6.4 percent) and $19.7 billion (6.8 percent) higher, respectively, than the same periods of 2019. The increases were primarily due to higher commercial loans, reflecting the utilization of bank credit facilities by customers to support liquidity requirements as well as the impact of loans made under the Small Business Administration&#8217;s (&#8220;SBA&#8221;) Paycheck Protection Program, along with growth in residential mortgages given the lower interest rate environment and higher Government National Mortgage Association (&#8220;GNMA&#8221;) buybacks, and higher commercial real estate loans. These increases were partially offset by lower credit card loans reflecting the net impact of lower consumer spending during the first nine months of 2020 partially offset by the acquisition of the credit card portfolio in the third quarter of 2020, as well as lower other retail loans. 

Average investment securities in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 were $11.4 billion (9.7 percent) and $7.8 billion (6.8 percent) higher, respectively, than the same periods of 2019, primarily due to purchases of mortgage-backed, U.S. Treasury and state and political securities, net of prepayments and maturities. 

Average total deposits for the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 were $55.6 billion (15.9 percent) and $47.0 billion (13.7 percent) higher, respectively, than the same periods of 2019. Average total savings deposits for the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 were $29.3 billion (12.6 percent) and $33.1 billion (14.7 percent) higher, respectively, than the same periods of the prior year, driven by increases in Consumer and Business Banking, and Corporate and Commercial Banking balances. The increase in average total savings deposits for the first nine months of 2020, compared with the first nine months of 2019, was also due to higher Wealth Management and Investment Services balances. Average noninterest-bearing deposits for the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 were $34.8 billion (46.6 percent) and $19.2 billion (26.1 percent) higher, respectively, than the same periods of 2019, primarily due to increases in Corporate and Commercial Banking, Consumer and Business Banking, and Wealth Management and Investment Services balances. The growth in average total savings and noninterest-bearing deposits was primarily a result of the actions by the federal government to increase liquidity in the financial system, customers maintaining balance sheet liquidity by utilizing existing credit facilities and government stimulus programs. Average time deposits for the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 were $8.5 billion (19.9 percent) and $5.3 billion (11.8 percent) lower, respectively, than the same periods of the prior year, primarily driven by decreases in those deposits managed as an alternative to other funding sources, based largely on relative pricing and liquidity characteristics.

Provision for Credit Losses

The provision for credit losses was $635 million for the third quarter and $3.4 billion for the first nine months of 2020, representing increases of $268 million (73.0 percent) and $2.3 billion, respectively, from the same periods of 2019. In March 2020 economic conditions began to deteriorate, and continued to worsen in the second quarter of 2020, due to the impact of the COVID-19

health crisis. During the third quarter of 2020, economic conditions began to moderate as economic projections for both the gross domestic product and unemployment levels improved from the second quarter. The Company recognized an increase of $2.0 billion in the allowance for credit losses during the first nine months of 2020 due to the deteriorating and ongoing effects of these adverse economic conditions. The Company recognized an increase of $120 million in the allowance for credit losses during the third quarter of 2020, primarily reflecting the expected losses within the State Farm Bank credit card portfolio acquired during the period. Net charge-offs increased $163 million (46.3 percent) and $276 million (25.8 percent) in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively, compared with the same periods of the prior year, primarily due to higher commercial loan, commercial real estate loan and retail leasing net charge-offs, partially offset by a decrease in other retail loan net charge-offs. Refer to &#8220;Corporate Risk Profile&#8221; for further information on the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs, nonperforming assets and other factors considered by the Company in assessing the credit quality of the loan portfolio and establishing the allowance for credit losses. 

Noninterest Income

Noninterest income was $2.7 billion in the third quarter and $7.9 billion in the first nine months of 2020, representing increases of $98 million (3.7 percent) and $456 million (6.2 percent), respectively, compared with the same periods of 2019. The increases from a year ago reflected higher mortgage banking revenue, commercial products revenue and trust and investment management fees, partially offset by lower payment services revenue, deposit service charges and other noninterest income. The increase in noninterest income in the first nine months of 2020, compared with the first nine months of 2019, was also due to higher gains on sales of investment securities. Mortgage banking revenue increased due to higher mortgage loan production and stronger gain on sale margins, partially offset by declines in mortgage servicing rights (&#8220;MSRs&#8221;) valuations, net of hedging activities. The Company expects mortgage banking revenue to decline in the fourth quarter of 2020, as compared with the third quarter of 2020, reflecting slower refinancing activity for the industry and seasonality of home sales. Commercial products revenue increased primarily due to higher corporate bond issuance fees and trading revenue. Trust and investment management fees were higher due to business growth and favorable market conditions over the past year. Payment services fee revenue decreased reflecting lower merchant processing services revenue and corporate payment products revenue, driven by lower sales volume due to the worldwide impact of the COVID-19

pandemic on consumer and business spending. Credit and debit card revenue was higher in the third quarter of 2020, compared with the third quarter of 2019, reflecting significantly higher prepaid card fees related to the delayed impact of government stimulus programs adopted in the second quarter of 2020. Payment services revenue is likely to continue to be adversely affected through the remainder of 2020 due to reduced consumer and business spending activity, as well as lower expected prepaid card volume in the fourth quarter of 2020, as compared with the third quarter of 2020. Deposit service charges decreased primarily due to lower volume. Other noninterest income decreased due to lower equity investment income, lower tax-advantaged

investment syndication revenue, and certain asset impairments as a result of expected branch closures. Other noninterest income further decreased in the

first nine months of 2020, compared with the first nine months of 2019, due to asset impairments as a result of property damage from civil unrest in the second quarter of 2020, partially offset by gains on sale of certain businesses in the first quarter of 2020. 

Noninterest Expense

Noninterest expense was $3.4 billion in the third quarter and $10.0 billion in the first nine months of 2020, representing increases of $227 million (7.2 percent) and $621 million (6.6 percent), respectively, over the same periods of 2019. The increases from a year ago were driven by expenses of $157 million in the third quarter and $456 million in the first nine months of 2020, representing incremental costs related to the prepaid card business, expenses related to COVID-19,

and revenue-related expenses due to higher mortgage production and capital markets activities. In addition, the increases were also driven by business investments, including those related to increased digital capabilities. The categories of expense impacted primarily include higher personnel expense, technology and communications expense, and other noninterest expense, partially offset by lower marketing and business development expense. Compensation expense increased due to the impacts of merit increases and higher variable compensation related to business production within the mortgage banking and fixed income capital markets businesses. Employee benefits expense increased primarily due to higher pension expense. Technology and communications expense increased primarily due to capital expenditures supporting business growth and the impact of increased call center volume related to prepaid cards. Other noninterest expense increased, reflecting $49 million and $228 million of expenses in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively, related to COVID-19,

higher FDIC insurance expense driven by an increase in the assessment base, and higher state franchise taxes. The increase in other noninterest expense in the first nine months of 2020, compared with the first nine months of 2019, was partially offset by lower costs related to tax-advantaged

projects in 2020. Incremental costs related to COVID-19

include increased liabilities driven by the Company&#8217;s exposure as a credit card processor to charge-back risk on undelivered goods and services, including prepaid airline tickets, as well as expenses related to paying premium compensation to front-line workers and providing a safe working environment for employees. Professional services expense decreased primarily due to business initiatives completed in 2019, while marketing and business development expense decreased due to the timing of marketing campaigns and a reduction in travel as a result of COVID-19.

The Company expects its noninterest expenses to be relatively stable for the fourth quarter of 2020, as compared with the third quarter of 2020. 

Income Tax Expense

The provision for income taxes was $347 million (an effective rate of 18.0 percent) for the third quarter and $671 million (an effective rate of 16.2 percent) for the first nine months of 2020, compared with $467 million (an effective rate of 19.6 percent) and $1.3 billion (an effective rate of 19.2 percent) for the same periods of 2019. The reduced tax rates for 2020 were primarily a result of reduced pretax income being impacted by current economic conditions, including the higher provision for credit losses. For further information on income taxes, refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS 

Loans

The Company&#8217;s loan portfolio was $307.0 billion at September 30, 2020, compared with $296.1 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $10.9 billion (3.7 percent). The increase was driven by higher commercial loans, residential mortgages, commercial real estate loans and other retail loans, partially offset by lower credit card loans. 

Commercial loans increased $6.9 billion (6.6 percent) at September 30, 2020, compared with December 31, 2019, reflecting the impact of loans made under the SBA&#8217;s Paycheck Protection Program.

&#160;

Residential mortgages held in the loan portfolio increased $6.2 billion (8.8 percent) at September 30, 2020, compared with December 31, 2019, due to higher mortgage loan production given the lower interest rate environment, and higher GNMA buybacks during the first nine months of 2020. Residential mortgages originated and placed in the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio include well-secured jumbo mortgages and branch-originated first lien home equity loans to borrowers with high credit quality. 

Commercial real estate loans increased $634 million (1.6 percent) at September 30, 2020, compared with December 31, 2019, primarily the result of new originations, partially offset by customers paying down balances. 

Other retail loans increased $36 million (0.1 percent) at September 30, 2020, compared with December 31, 2019, due to an increase in installment loans, partially offset by decreases in home equity loans, auto loans, revolving credit balances and retail leasing balances. 

Credit card loans decreased $2.9 billion (11.7 percent) at September 30, 2020, compared with December 31, 2019, reflecting reduced consumer spending in 2020 driven by the impact of COVID-19,

partially offset by the acquisition of the State Farm Bank credit card portfolio in the third quarter of 2020.

The Company generally retains portfolio loans through maturity; however, the Company&#8217;s intent may change over time based upon various factors such as ongoing asset/liability management activities, assessment of product profitability, credit risk, liquidity needs, and capital implications. If the Company&#8217;s intent or ability to hold an existing portfolio loan changes, it is transferred to loans held for sale. 

Loans Held for Sale

Loans held for sale, consisting primarily of residential mortgages to be sold in the secondary market, were $7.6 billion at September 30, 2020, compared with $5.6 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in loans held for sale was principally due to a higher level of mortgage loan closings in the third quarter of 2020 given the lower interest rate environment, compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. Almost all of the residential mortgage loans the Company originates or purchases for sale follow guidelines that allow the loans to be sold into existing, highly liquid secondary markets; in particular in government agency transactions and to government-sponsored enterprises (&#8220;GSEs&#8221;). 

Investment Securities

Available-for-sale

investment securities totaled $134.0 billion at September 30, 2020, compared with $122.6 billion at December 31, 2019. The $11.4 billion (9.3 percent) increase was primarily due to $8.6 billion of net investment purchases and a $2.8 billion favorable change in net unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale

investment securities. The Company had no outstanding investment securities classified as held-to-maturity

at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. 

The Company&#8217;s available-for-sale

investment securities are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in other comprehensive income (loss) unless a portion of a security&#8217;s unrealized loss is related to credit and an allowance for credit losses is necessary. At September 30, 2020, the Company&#8217;s net unrealized gains on available-for-sale

investment securities were $3.3 billion, compared with $496 million at December 31, 2019. The favorable change in net unrealized gains was primarily due to increases in the fair value of mortgage-backed, U.S. Treasury, and state and political securities as a result of changes in interest rates. Gross unrealized losses on available-for-sale

investment securities totaled $34 million at September 30, 2020, compared with $448 million at December 31, 2019. At

&#160;

U.S. Bancorp &#160; 7

September 30, 2020, the Company had no plans to sell securities with unrealized losses, and believes it is more likely than not that it would not be required to sell such securities before recovery of their amortized cost. 

Refer to Notes 3 and 14 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on investment securities. 

Deposits

Total deposits were $413.2 billion at September 30, 2020, compared with $361.9 billion at December 31, 2019. The $51.3 billion (14.2 percent) increase in total deposits reflected increases in noninterest-bearing and total savings deposits, partially offset by a decrease in time deposits. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased $39.0 billion (51.6 percent) at September 30, 2020, compared with December 31, 2019, primarily due to higher Corporate and Commercial Banking, Consumer and Business Banking, and Wealth Management and Investment Services balances. Interest checking balances increased $9.7 billion (12.7 percent), while savings account balances increased $7.0 billion (14.9 percent), both driven by higher Consumer and Business Banking balances. Money market deposit balances increased $5.9 billion (4.9 percent) at September 30, 2020, compared with December 31, 2019, primarily due to higher Corporate and Commercial Banking, and Consumer and Business Banking balances, partially offset by a decrease in Wealth Management and Investment Services balances. The growth in noninterest-bearing and total savings deposits was primarily a result of the economic impact of the COVID-19

pandemic on the world economy resulting in actions by the federal government to increase liquidity in the financial system, customers maintaining balance sheet liquidity by utilizing existing credit facilities and government stimulus programs. Time deposits decreased $10.3 billion (24.0 percent) at September 30, 2020, compared with December 31, 2019, driven by a decrease in those deposits managed as an alternative to other funding sources, based largely on relative pricing and liquidity characteristics, along with a decrease in Consumer and Business Banking balances. 

Borrowings

The Company utilizes both short-term and long-term borrowings as part of its asset/liability management and funding strategies. Short-term borrowings, which include federal funds purchased, commercial paper, repurchase agreements, borrowings secured by high-grade assets and other short-term borrowings, were $13.7 billion at September 30, 2020, compared with $23.7 billion at December 31, 2019. The $10.0 billion (42.2 percent) decrease in short-term borrowings was primarily due to a decrease in short-term Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) advances and other short-term borrowings balances, partially offset by higher repurchase agreement balances. Long-term debt was $42.4 billion at September 30, 2020, compared with $40.2 billion at December 31, 2019. The $2.3 billion (5.7 percent) increase was primarily due to $3.3 billion of bank note and $2.8 billion of medium-term note issuances, partially offset by $4.5 billion of bank note repayments and maturities. Refer to the &#8220;Liquidity Risk Management&#8221; section for discussion of liquidity management of the Company. 

CORPORATE RISK PROFILE 

Overview

Managing risks is an essential part of successfully operating a financial services company. The Company&#8217;s Board of Directors has approved a risk management framework which establishes governance and risk management requirements for all risk-taking activities. This framework includes Company and business line risk appetite statements which set boundaries for the types and amount of risk that may be undertaken in pursuing business objectives and initiatives. The Board of Directors, primarily through its Risk Management Committee, oversees performance relative to the risk management framework, risk appetite statements, and other policy requirements. 

The Executive Risk Committee (&#8220;ERC&#8221;), which is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer and includes the Chief Executive Officer and other members of the executive management team, oversees execution against the risk management framework and risk appetite statements. The ERC focuses on current and emerging risks, including strategic and reputation risks, by directing timely and comprehensive actions. Senior operating committees have also been established, each responsible for overseeing a specified category of risk. 

The Company&#8217;s most prominent risk exposures are credit, interest rate, market, liquidity, operational, compliance, strategic, and reputation. Leveraging the Company&#8217;s risk management framework, the specific impacts of COVID-19

and related risks are identified for each of the most prominent exposures. Oversight and governance is managed through a centralized command center which escalates through the ERC. The Board of Directors also oversees the Company&#8217;s responsiveness to the COVID-19

pandemic. Credit risk is the risk of not collecting the interest and/or the principal balance of a loan, investment or derivative contract when it is due. Interest rate risk is the potential reduction of net interest income or market valuations as a result of changes in interest rates. Market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and security prices that may result in changes in the values of financial

&#160;

&#160; U.S. Bancorp 

instruments, such as trading and available-for-sale

securities, mortgage loans held for sale (&#8220;MLHFS&#8221;), MSRs and derivatives that are accounted for on a fair value basis. Liquidity risk is the possible inability to fund obligations or new business at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. Operational risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, people, or adverse external events, including the risk of loss resulting from breaches in data security. Operational risk can also include the risk of loss due to failures by third parties with which the Company does business. Compliance risk is the risk that the Company may suffer legal or regulatory sanctions, financial losses, and reputational damage if it fails to adhere to compliance requirements. Strategic risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition arising from adverse business decisions, poor implementation of business decisions, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the banking industry and operating environment. Reputation risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, or franchise or enterprise value arising from negative public opinion. This risk may impair the Company&#8217;s competitiveness by affecting its ability to establish new relationships or services, offer new services or continue serving existing relationships. In addition to the risks identified above, other risk factors exist that may impact the Company. Refer to &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in this report and in the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2019, for a detailed discussion of these factors.

The Company&#8217;s Board and management-level governance committees are supported by a &#8220;three lines of defense&#8221; model for establishing effective checks and balances. The first line of defense, the business lines, manages risks in conformity with established limits and policy requirements. In turn, business line leaders and their risk officers establish programs to ensure conformity with these limits and policy requirements. The second line of defense, which includes the Chief Risk Officer&#8217;s organization as well as policy and oversight activities of corporate support functions, translates risk appetite and strategy into actionable risk limits and policies. The second line of defense monitors first line of defense conformity with limits and policies, and provides reporting and escalation of emerging risks and other concerns to senior management and the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors. The third line of defense, internal audit, is responsible for providing the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and senior management with independent assessment and assurance regarding the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s governance, risk management and control processes. 

Management regularly provides reports to the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors. The Risk Management Committee discusses with management the Company&#8217;s risk management performance, and provides a summary of key risks to the entire Board of Directors, covering the status of existing matters, areas of potential future concern and specific information on certain types of loss events. The Risk Management Committee considers quarterly reports by management assessing the Company&#8217;s performance relative to the risk appetite statements and the associated risk limits, including: 

&#8226; &#160; Macroeconomic environment and other qualitative considerations, such as regulatory and compliance changes, litigation developments, and technology and cybersecurity; 

&#8226; &#160; Credit measures, including adversely rated and nonperforming loans, leveraged transactions, credit concentrations and lending limits; 

&#8226; &#160; Interest rate and market risk, including market value and net income simulation, and trading-related Value at Risk (&#8220;VaR&#8221;); 

&#8226; &#160; Liquidity risk, including funding projections under various stressed scenarios; 

&#8226; &#160; Operational and compliance risk, including losses stemming from events such as fraud, processing errors, control breaches, breaches in data security or adverse business decisions, as well as reporting on technology performance, and various legal and regulatory compliance measures; 

&#8226; &#160; Capital ratios and projections, including regulatory measures and stressed scenarios; and 

&#8226; &#160; Strategic and reputation risk considerations, impacts and responses. 

Credit Risk Management

The Company&#8217;s strategy for credit risk management includes well-defined, centralized credit policies, uniform underwriting criteria, and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all commercial and consumer credit exposures. In evaluating its credit risk, the Company considers changes, if any, in underwriting activities, the loan portfolio composition (including product mix and geographic, industry or customer-specific concentrations), collateral values, trends in loan performance and macroeconomic factors, such as changes in unemployment rates, gross domestic product levels and consumer bankruptcy filings, as well as the potential impact on customers and the domestic economy resulting from new tariffs or increases in existing tariffs, and the COVID-19

pandemic. The Risk Management Committee oversees the Company&#8217;s credit risk management process.

&#160;

U.S. Bancorp &#160; 9

In addition, credit quality ratings as defined by the Company, are an important part of the Company&#8217;s overall credit risk management and evaluation of its allowance for credit losses. Loans with a pass rating represent those loans not classified on the Company&#8217;s rating scale for problem credits, as minimal risk has been identified. Loans with a special mention or classified rating, including loans that are 90 days or more past due and still accruing, nonaccrual loans, those loans considered troubled debt restructurings (&#8220;TDRs&#8221;), and loans in a junior lien position that are current but are behind a modified or delinquent loan in a first lien position, encompass all loans held by the Company that it considers to have a potential or well-defined weakness that may put full collection of contractual cash flows at risk. The Company&#8217;s internal credit quality ratings for consumer loans are primarily based on delinquency and nonperforming status, except for a limited population of larger loans within those portfolios that are individually evaluated. For this limited population, the determination of the internal credit quality rating may also consider collateral value and customer cash flows. Refer to Note 4 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolios including internal credit quality ratings. In addition, refer to &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis &#8212; Credit Risk Management&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2019, for a more detailed discussion on credit risk management processes.

The Company manages its credit risk, in part, through diversification of its loan portfolio which is achieved through limit setting by product type criteria, such as industry, and identification of credit concentrations. As part of its normal business activities, the Company offers a broad array of lending products. The Company categorizes its loan portfolio into two segments, which is the level at which it develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The Company&#8217;s two loan portfolio segments are commercial lending and consumer lending. 

The commercial lending segment includes loans and leases made to small business, middle market, large corporate, commercial real estate, financial institution, non-profit

and public sector customers. Key risk characteristics relevant to commercial lending segment loans include the industry and geography of the borrower&#8217;s business, purpose of the loan, repayment source, borrower&#8217;s debt capacity and financial flexibility, loan covenants, and nature of pledged collateral, if any, as well as macroeconomic factors such as unemployment rates, gross domestic product levels, corporate bond spreads and long-term interest rates, all of which have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. These risk characteristics, among others, are considered in determining estimates about the likelihood of default by the borrowers and the severity of loss in the event of default. The Company considers these risk characteristics in assigning internal risk ratings to, or forecasting losses on, these loans, which are the significant factors in determining the allowance for credit losses for loans in the commercial lending segment.

The consumer lending segment represents loans and leases made to consumer customers, including residential mortgages, credit card loans, and other retail loans such as revolving consumer lines, auto loans and leases, home equity loans and lines, and student loans, a run-off

portfolio. Home equity or second mortgage loans are junior lien closed-end

accounts fully disbursed at origination. These loans typically are fixed rate loans, secured by residential real estate, with a 10-

or 15-year

fixed payment amortization schedule. Home equity lines are revolving accounts giving the borrower the ability to draw and repay balances repeatedly, up to a maximum commitment, and are secured by residential real estate. These include accounts in either a first or junior lien position. Typical terms on home equity lines in the portfolio are variable rates benchmarked to the prime rate, with a 10-

or 15-year

draw period during which a minimum payment is equivalent to the monthly interest, followed by a 20-

or 10-year

amortization period, respectively. At September 30, 2020, substantially all of the Company&#8217;s home equity lines were in the draw period. Approximately $1.4 billion, or 12 percent, of the outstanding home equity line balances at September 30, 2020, will enter the amortization period within the next 36 months. Key risk characteristics relevant to consumer lending segment loans primarily relate to the borrowers&#8217; capacity and willingness to repay and include unemployment rates, consumer bankruptcy filings and other macroeconomic factors, customer payment history and credit scores, and in some cases, updated loan-to-value

(&#8220;LTV&#8221;) information reflecting current market conditions on real estate-based loans. These and other risk characteristics, including elevated risk resulting from the COVID-19

pandemic, are reflected in forecasts of delinquency levels, bankruptcies and losses which are the primary factors in determining the allowance for credit losses for the consumer lending segment.

The Company further disaggregates its loan portfolio segments into various classes based on their underlying risk characteristics. The two classes within the commercial lending segment are commercial loans and commercial real estate loans. The three classes within the consumer lending segment are residential mortgages, credit card loans and other retail loans. 

&#160;

&#160; U.S. Bancorp 

The Company&#8217;s consumer lending segment utilizes several distinct business processes and channels to originate consumer credit, including traditional branch lending, mobile and on-line

banking, indirect lending, correspondent banks and loan brokers. Each distinct underwriting and origination activity manages unique credit risk characteristics and prices its loan production commensurate with the differing risk profiles.

Residential mortgage originations are generally limited to prime borrowers and are performed through the Company&#8217;s branches, loan production offices, mobile and on-line

services and a wholesale network of originators. The Company may retain residential mortgage loans it originates on its balance sheet or sell the loans into the secondary market while retaining the servicing rights and customer relationships. Utilizing the secondary markets enables the Company to effectively reduce its credit and other asset/liability risks. For residential mortgages that are retained in the Company&#8217;s portfolio and for home equity and second mortgages, credit risk is also diversified by geography and managed by adherence to LTV and borrower credit criteria during the underwriting process.

The Company estimates updated LTV information on its outstanding residential mortgages quarterly, based on a method that combines automated valuation model updates and relevant home price indices. LTV is the ratio of the loan&#8217;s outstanding principal balance to the current estimate of property value. For home equity and second mortgages, combined loan-to-value

(&#8220;CLTV&#8221;) is the combination of the first mortgage original principal balance and the second lien outstanding principal balance, relative to the current estimate of property value. Certain loans do not have an LTV or CLTV, primarily due to lack of availability of relevant automated valuation model and/or home price indices values, or lack of necessary valuation data on acquired loans.

The following tables provide summary information of residential mortgages and home equity and second mortgages by LTV at September 30, 2020:

At September 30, 2020, approximately $54 million of home equity and second mortgage balances were considered sub-prime. 

Home equity and second mortgages were $13.2 billion at September 30, 2020, compared with $15.0 billion at December 31, 2019, and included $3.5 billion of home equity lines in a first lien position and $9.7 billion of home equity and second mortgage loans and lines in a junior lien position. Loans and lines in a junior lien position at September 30, 2020, included approximately $3.8 billion of loans and lines for which the Company also serviced the related first lien loan, and approximately $5.9 billion where the Company did not service the related first lien loan. The Company was able to determine the status of the related first liens using information the Company has as the servicer of the first lien or information reported on customer credit bureau files. The Company also evaluates other indicators of credit risk for these junior lien loans and lines including delinquency, estimated average CLTV ratios and updated weighted-average credit scores in making its assessment of credit risk, related loss estimates and determining the allowance for credit losses.

Loan Delinquencies

Trends in delinquency ratios are an indicator, among other considerations, of credit risk within the Company&#8217;s loan portfolios. The Company measures delinquencies, both including and excluding nonperforming loans, to enable comparability with other companies. Accruing loans 90 days or more past due totaled $461 million at September 30, 2020, compared with $605 million at December 31, 2019. These balances exclude loans purchased from GNMA mortgage pools whose repayments are primarily insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Accruing loans 90 days or more past due are not included in nonperforming assets and continue to accrue interest because they are adequately secured by collateral, are in the process of collection and are reasonably expected to result in repayment or restoration to current status, or are managed in homogeneous portfolios with specified charge-off

timeframes adhering to regulatory guidelines. The ratio of accruing loans 90 days or more past due to total loans was 0.15 percent at September 30, 2020, compared with 0.20 percent at December 31, 2019.

&#160;

Restructured Loans

In certain circumstances, the Company may modify the terms of a loan to maximize the collection of amounts due when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties or is expected to experience difficulties in the near-term. In most cases the modification is either a concessionary reduction in interest rate, extension of the maturity date or reduction in the principal balance that would otherwise not be considered. 

Troubled Debt Restructurings

Concessionary modifications are classified as TDRs unless the modification results in only an insignificant delay in the payments to be received. TDRs accrue interest if the borrower complies with the revised terms and conditions and has demonstrated repayment performance at a level commensurate with the modified terms over several payment cycles, which is generally six months or greater. At September 30, 2020, performing TDRs were $3.4 billion, compared with $3.8 billion at December 31, 2019. 

The Company continues to work with customers to modify loans for borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties. Many of the Company&#8217;s TDRs are determined on a case-by-case

basis in connection with ongoing loan collection processes. The modifications vary within each of the Company&#8217;s loan classes. Commercial lending segment TDRs generally include extensions of the maturity date and may be accompanied by an increase or decrease to the interest rate. The Company may also work with the borrower to make other changes to the loan to mitigate losses, such as obtaining additional collateral and/or guarantees to support the loan.

The Company has also implemented certain residential mortgage loan restructuring programs that may result in TDRs. The Company modifies residential mortgage loans under Federal Housing Administration, United States Department of Veterans Affairs, and its own internal programs. Under these programs, the Company offers qualifying homeowners the opportunity to permanently modify their loan and achieve more affordable monthly payments by providing loan concessions. These concessions may include adjustments to interest rates, conversion of adjustable rates to fixed rates, extensions of maturity dates or deferrals of payments, capitalization of accrued interest and/or outstanding advances, or in limited situations, partial forgiveness of loan principal. In most instances, 

&#160;

U.S. Bancorp &#160; 13

participation in residential mortgage loan restructuring programs requires the customer to complete a short-term trial period. A permanent loan modification is contingent on the customer successfully completing the trial period arrangement, and the loan documents are not modified until that time. The Company reports loans in a trial period arrangement as TDRs and continues to report them as TDRs after the trial period. 

Credit card and other retail loan TDRs are generally part of distinct restructuring programs providing customers modification solutions over a specified time period, generally up to 60 months. 

In accordance with regulatory guidance, the Company considers secured consumer loans that have had debt discharged through bankruptcy where the borrower has not reaffirmed the debt to be TDRs. If the loan amount exceeds the collateral value, the loan is charged down to collateral value and the remaining amount is reported as nonperforming. 

Loan modifications or concessions granted to customers resulting directly from the effects of the COVID-19

pandemic, who were otherwise in current payment status, are not considered to be TDRs.

Short-term and Other Loan Modifications

The Company makes short-term and other modifications that it does not consider to be TDRs, in limited circumstances, to assist borrowers experiencing temporary hardships. Short-term consumer lending modification programs include payment reductions, deferrals of up to three past due payments, and the ability to return to current status if the borrower makes required payments. The Company may also make short-term modifications to commercial lending loans, with the most common modification being an extension of the maturity date of three months or less. Such extensions generally are used when the maturity date is imminent and the borrower is experiencing some level of financial stress, but the Company believes the borrower will pay all contractual amounts owed. 

COVID-19

Payment Relief

The Company has offered payment relief, including forbearance, payment deferrals and other customer accommodations, to assist borrowers that have experienced financial hardship resulting from the effects of the COVID-19

pandemic. The majority of these borrowers were not delinquent on payments at the time they received the payment relief. From March 2020 through September 30, 2020, the Company had approved approximately 329,000 loan modifications for these borrowers, representing approximately $26.9 billion. The loans modified consisted primarily of payment forbearance or deferrals of 90 days or less. A portion of the borrowers who received account modifications are no longer participating in these payment relief programs, as the programs are generally short-term; and at September 30, 2020, approximately 91,000 accounts, representing approximately $12.1 billion, were currently in an active payment relief program. The recognition of delinquent or nonaccrual loans and loan net charge-offs may be delayed for those customers enrolled in these payment relief programs who would have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual status, as these customer accounts do not continue to age during the period the payment delay is provided.

&#160;

The following table summarizes borrowers enrolled in payment relief programs as a result of the COVID-19

pandemic at September 30, 2020, as a percentage of the Company&#8217;s loans and loan balances:

Excludes loans purchased from GNMA mortgage pools, whose repayments are primarily insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. At September 30, 2020, 58.76 percent of the total number of accounts and 64.13 percent of the total loan balances of loans purchased from GNMA mortgage pools were to borrowers enrolled in payment relief programs as a result of the COVID-19

pandemic. Including these loans, 14.52 percent of the total number of accounts and 13.16 percent of the total balances of residential mortgages were to borrowers enrolled in payment relief programs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Including these loans, .71 percent of the total number of accounts and 3.96 percent of the total balances of all loans were to borrowers enrolled in payment relief programs as result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

&#160;

U.S. Bancorp &#160; 15

Nonperforming Assets

The level of nonperforming assets represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses. Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, restructured loans not performing in accordance with modified terms and not accruing interest, restructured loans that have not met the performance period required to return to accrual status, other real estate owned (&#8220;OREO&#8221;) and other nonperforming assets owned by the Company. Interest payments collected from assets on nonaccrual status are generally applied against the principal balance and not recorded as income. However, interest income may be recognized for interest payments if the remaining carrying amount of the loan is believed to be collectible. 

At September 30, 2020, total nonperforming assets were $1.3 billion, compared to $829 million at December 31, 2019. The $441 million (53.2 percent) increase in nonperforming assets was driven by increases in nonperforming commercial and commercial real estate loans. The ratio of total nonperforming assets to total loans and other real estate was 0.41 percent at September 30, 2020, compared with 0.28 percent at December 31, 2019. The Company expects nonperforming assets to increase given current economic conditions. 

OREO was $35 million at September 30, 2020, compared with $78 million at December 31, 2019, and was related to foreclosed properties that previously secured loan balances.

Analysis of Loan Net Charge-Offs

Total loan net charge-offs were $515 million for the third quarter and $1.3 billion for the first nine months of 2020, compared with $352 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, for the same periods of 2019. The ratio of total loan net charge-offs to average loans outstanding on an annualized basis for the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 was 0.66 percent and 0.58 percent, respectively, compared with 0.48 percent and 0.49 percent, respectively, for the same periods of 2019. The year-over-year increases in net charge-offs reflected higher commercial loan, commercial real estate loan and retail leasing net charge-offs, partially offset by a decrease in other retail loan net charge-offs. The increase in retail leasing charge-offs reflected the inclusion of end of term losses on residual lease values as of January 1, 2020. The Company expects net charge-offs to increase given current economic conditions. 

Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Credit Losses

Prior to January 1, 2020, the allowance for credit losses was established to reserve for probable and estimable losses incurred in the Company&#8217;s loan and lease portfolio, including unfunded credit commitments. Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted new accounting guidance which changed previous impairment recognition to a model that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. The allowance for credit losses is increased through provisions charged to earnings and reduced by net charge-offs. Management evaluates the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis. The allowance considers expected losses for the remaining lives of the applicable assets, inclusive of expected recoveries. Remaining lives of the applicable assets are adjusted for prepayments. Multiple economic scenarios are considered over a three-year reasonable and supportable forecast period, which incorporates historical loss experience in years two and three. These economic scenarios are constructed with interrelated projections of multiple economic variables, and loss estimates are produced that consider the historical correlation of those economic variables with credit losses. After the forecast period, the Company fully reverts to long-term historical loss experience, adjusted for prepayments and characteristics of the current loan and lease portfolio, to estimate losses over the remaining lives. The economic scenarios are updated at least quarterly, and are designed to provide a range of reasonable estimates, which are both better and worse than current expectations. Scenarios are weighted based on the Company&#8217;s expectation of future conditions. Final loss estimates also consider factors affecting credit losses not reflected in the scenarios, due to the unique aspects of current conditions and expectations. These factors may include, but are not limited to, loan servicing practices, regulatory guidance, and/or fiscal and monetary policy actions. Because business processes and credit risks associated with unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as for loans, the Company utilizes similar processes to estimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments, which is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Both the allowance for loan losses and the liability for unfunded credit commitments are included in the Company&#8217;s analysis of credit losses and reported reserve ratios.

The allowance recorded for credit losses utilizes forward-looking expected loss models to consider a variety of factors affecting lifetime credit losses. These factors include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic variables such as unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels, corporate bonds spreads and long-term interest rate forecasts, as well as loan and borrower characteristics, such as internal risk ratings on 

&#160;

&#160; U.S. Bancorp 

commercial loans and consumer credit scores, delinquency status, collateral type and available valuation information, consideration of end-of-term

losses on lease residuals, and the remaining term of the loan, adjusted for expected prepayments. Where loans do not exhibit similar risk characteristics, an individual analysis is performed to consider expected credit losses. For each loan portfolio, model estimates are adjusted as necessary to consider any relevant changes in portfolio composition, lending policies, underwriting standards, risk management practices, economic conditions or other factors that would affect the accuracy of the model. Expected credit loss estimates also include consideration of expected cash recoveries on loans previously charged-off,

or expected recoveries on collateral-dependent loans where recovery is expected through sale of the collateral.

The allowance recorded for individually evaluated loans greater than $5 million in the commercial lending segment is based on an analysis utilizing expected cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate, the observable market price of the loan, or the fair value of the collateral, less selling costs, for collateral-dependent loans. For commercial TDRs individually evaluated for impairment, attributes of the borrower are the primary factors in determining the allowance for credit losses. However, historical loss experience is also incorporated into the allowance methodology applied to this category of loans. Commercial lending segment TDR loans may be collectively evaluated for impairment where observed performance history, including defaults, is a primary driver of the loss allocation. 

The allowance recorded for TDR loans in the consumer lending segment is determined on a homogenous pool basis utilizing expected cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate of the pool. The expected cash flows on TDR loans consider subsequent payment defaults since modification, the borrower&#8217;s ability to pay under the restructured terms, and the timing and amount of payments. The allowance for collateral-dependent loans in the consumer lending segment is determined based on the current fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. 

When evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses for any loans and lines in a junior lien position, the Company considers the delinquency and modification status of the first lien. At September 30, 2020, the Company serviced the first lien on 39 percent of the home equity loans and lines in a junior lien position. The Company also considers the status of first lien mortgage accounts reported on customer credit bureau files when the first lien is not serviced by the Company. Regardless of whether the Company services the first lien, an assessment is made of economic conditions, problem loans, recent loss experience and other factors in determining the allowance for credit losses. Based on the available information, the Company estimated $221 million or 1.7 percent of its total home equity portfolio at September 30, 2020, represented non-delinquent

junior liens where the first lien was delinquent or modified, excluding loans in COVID-related forbearance programs.

The Company considers historical loss experience on the loans and lines in a junior lien position to establish loss estimates for junior lien loans and lines the Company services that are current, but the first lien is delinquent or modified. Historically, the number of junior lien defaults has been a small percentage of the total portfolio (approximately 1 percent annually), while the long-term average loss rate on loans that default has been approximately 80 percent. In addition, the Company obtains updated credit scores on its home equity portfolio each quarter, and in some cases more frequently, and uses this information in its loss estimation methods. In its evaluation of the allowance for credit losses, the Company also considers the increased risk of loss associated with home equity lines that are contractually scheduled to convert from a revolving status to a fully amortizing payment. 

Beginning January 1, 2020, when a loan portfolio is purchased, the acquired loans are divided into those considered purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration (&#8220;PCD&#8221;) and those not considered purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration. An allowance is established for each population and considers product mix, risk characteristics of the portfolio, bankruptcy experience, delinquency status, refreshed LTV ratios when possible, and portfolio growth. The allowance established for purchased loans not considered PCD is recognized through provision expense upon acquisition, whereas the allowance established for loans considered PCD at acquisition is offset by an increase in the basis of the acquired loans. Any subsequent increases and decreases in the allowance related to purchased loans are recognized through provision expense, with future charge-offs charged to the allowance. The Company did not have a material amount of PCD loans included in its loan portfolio at September 30, 2020. 

The Company&#8217;s methodology for determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses for each loan portfolio also considers the imprecision inherent in the methodologies used. As a result, amounts determined 

&#160;

U.S. Bancorp &#160; 19

under the methodologies described above are adjusted by management to consider the potential impact of other qualitative factors not captured in quantitative model adjustments which include, but are not limited to, the following: model imprecision, imprecision in economic scenario assumptions, and emerging risks related to either changes in the economic environment that are affecting specific portfolios, or changes in portfolio concentrations over time that may affect model performance. The consideration of these items results in adjustments to allowance amounts included in the Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses for each portfolio class. 

The results of the analysis are evaluated quarterly to confirm the estimates are appropriate for each loan portfolio. 

Although the Company determined the amount of each element of the allowance separately and considers this process to be an important credit management tool, the entire allowance for credit losses is available for the entire loan portfolio. The actual amount of losses can vary significantly from the estimated amounts. 

At September 30, 2020, the allowance for credit losses was $8.0 billion (2.61 percent of period-end

loans), compared with an allowance of $4.5 billion (1.52 percent of period-end

loans) at December 31, 2019. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 678 percent at September 30, 2020, compared with 649 percent at December 31, 2019. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to annualized loan net charge-offs was 391 percent at September 30, 2020, compared with 309 percent of full year 2019 net charge-offs at December 31, 2019.

The increase in the allowance for credit losses of $3.5 billion (78.4 percent) at September 30, 2020, compared with December 31, 2019, reflected the $1.5 billion impact of the January 1, 2020 adoption of new accounting guidance, along with an additional $2.0 billion increase during the first nine months of 2020 to recognize the expected losses resulting from the deteriorating and ongoing effects of adverse economic conditions driven by the impact of COVID-19

on the domestic and global economies, as well as new loan production and acquired loans. Expected loss estimates consider various factors including the changing economic activity, estimated mitigating effects of government stimulus, estimated duration and severity of the health crisis, customer specific information impacting changes in risk ratings, projected delinquencies and the impact of industrywide loan modification efforts designed to limit long-term effects of the COVID-19

pandemic, among other factors.

Changes in economic conditions as of September 30, 2020 included significant reductions in economic activity related to actions taken by governmental authorities to slow the spread of COVID-19.

High levels of unemployment, and lower gross domestic product estimates for 2020, as well as a slower pace of recovery in manufacturing activity and oil prices, were all observable changes in conditions that increased expected credit losses. At the same time, record economic stimulus measures were also enacted, and additional measures are being considered, with the intent to support businesses and consumers through what is expected to be a period of reduced economic activity. To balance these offsetting factors, economic scenarios updated through the end of the third quarter of 2020 that produced higher quantitative loss estimates consistent with the expected deterioration in reported economic statistics were evaluated in conjunction with management&#8217;s expectation that current and potential future stimulus efforts, as well as industrywide availability of short-term payment deferral programs, would mitigate losses estimated from models based on historical data from periods when mitigation efforts were not as extensive. Overall, loss expectations are consistent with prior economic downturn experience, but the severity of the deterioration in current economic conditions is not expected to persist over the life of the loan portfolio, as some indicators of economic activity have begun to improve directionally.

The allowance for credit losses related to commercial lending segment loans increased $1.4 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, as increased loan volume and credit downgrades during the period reflected the impact of COVID-19

on certain industry sectors, including the retail and restaurants, energy, media and entertainment, lodging and airline industries that were severely impacted by virus containment measures.

The following table summarizes the Company&#8217;s commercial lending segment credit exposure to customers within the industry sectors most impacted by COVID-19,

as a percentage of total loans and legal commitments outstanding at September 30, 2020:

&#160; &#160; .5 &#160; &#160; &#160; .6 &#160; The allowance for credit losses related to consumer lending segment loans increased $623 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, as higher economic risks, including those due to increased unemployment, and increases in expected losses related to acquired portfolios were partially mitigated by strong underlying credit quality that supports expectations of long-term repayment, and the decline in funded loan balances.

Residual Value Risk Management

The Company manages its risk to changes in the residual value of leased vehicles, office and business equipment, and other assets through disciplined residual valuation setting at the inception of a lease, diversification of its leased assets, regular residual asset valuation reviews and monitoring of residual value gains or losses upon the disposition of assets. As of September 30, 2020, no significant change in the amount of residual values or concentration of the portfolios had occurred since December 31, 2019. Refer to &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis &#8212; Residual Value Risk Management&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2019, for further discussion on residual value risk management. 

Operational Risk Management

Operational risk is inherent in all business activities, and the management of this risk is important to the achievement of the Company&#8217;s objectives. Business lines have direct and primary responsibility and accountability for identifying, controlling, and monitoring operational risks embedded in their business activities, including those additional or increased risks created by the economic and financial disruptions, and the Company&#8217;s alternative working arrangements resulting from the COVID-19

pandemic. The Company maintains a system of controls with the objective of providing proper transaction authorization and execution, proper system operations, proper oversight of third parties with whom it does business, safeguarding of assets from misuse or theft, and ensuring the reliability and security of financial and other data. Refer to &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis &#8212; Operational Risk Management&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2019, for further discussion on operational risk management. 

Compliance Risk Management

The Company may suffer legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, or damage to its reputation through failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, standards of good practice, and codes of conduct, including those related to compliance with Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering requirements, sanctions compliance requirements as administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, consumer protection and other requirements. The Company has controls and processes in place for the assessment, identification, monitoring, management and reporting of compliance risks and issues including those created or increased by the economic and financial disruptions caused by the COVID-19

pandemic. Refer to &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis &#8212; Compliance Risk Management&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2019, for further discussion on compliance risk management. 

Interest Rate Risk Management

In the banking industry, changes in interest rates are a significant risk that can impact earnings and the safety and soundness of an entity. The Company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates through asset and liability management activities within guidelines established by its Asset Liability Management Committee (&#8220;ALCO&#8221;) and approved by the Board of Directors. The ALCO has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with the ALCO management policies, including interest rate risk exposure. One way the Company measures and analyzes its interest rate risk is through net interest income simulation analysis. 

Simulation analysis incorporates substantially all of the Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities and off-balance

sheet instruments, together with forecasted changes in the balance sheet and assumptions that reflect the current interest rate environment. Through this simulation, management estimates the impact on net interest income of various interest rate changes that differ in the direction, amount and speed of change over time, as well as the shape of the yield curve. This simulation includes assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to be affected by changes in loan and deposit growth. Assumptions are made to project interest rates for new loans and deposits based on historical analysis, management&#8217;s outlook and re-pricing

strategies. These assumptions are reviewed and validated on a periodic basis with sensitivity analysis being provided for key variables of the simulation. The results are reviewed monthly by the ALCO and are used to guide asset/liability management strategies.

The Company manages its interest rate risk position by holding assets with desired interest rate risk characteristics on its balance sheet, implementing certain pricing strategies for loans and deposits and selecting derivatives and various funding and investment portfolio strategies. 

Table 9 summarizes the projected impact to net interest income over the next 12 months of various potential interest rate changes. The sensitivity of the projected impact to net interest income over the next 12 months is dependent on balance sheet growth, product mix, deposit behavior, pricing and funding decisions. While the Company utilizes models and assumptions based on historical information and expected behaviors, actual outcomes could vary significantly.

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and Other Risks

To manage the sensitivity of earnings and capital to interest rate, prepayment, credit, price and foreign currency fluctuations (asset and liability management positions), the Company enters into derivative transactions. The Company uses derivatives for asset and liability management purposes primarily in the following ways: 

&#8226; &#160; To convert fixed-rate debt from fixed-rate payments to floating-rate payments; 

&#8226; &#160; To convert the cash flows associated with floating-rate debt from floating-rate payments to fixed-rate payments; 

&#8226; &#160; To mitigate changes in value of the Company&#8217;s unfunded mortgage loan commitments, funded MLHFS and MSRs; 

&#8226; &#160; To mitigate remeasurement volatility of foreign currency denominated balances; and 

&#8226; &#160; To mitigate the volatility of the Company&#8217;s net investment in foreign operations driven by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 

In addition, the Company enters into interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts to support the business requirements of its customers (customer-related positions). The Company minimizes the market and liquidity risks of customer-related positions by either entering into similar offsetting positions with broker-dealers, or on a portfolio basis by entering into other derivative or non-derivative

financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure from these customer-related positions. The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are either exchange-traded, centrally cleared through clearinghouses or over-the-counter.

The Company does not utilize derivatives for speculative purposes.

The Company does not designate all of the derivatives that it enters into for risk management purposes as accounting hedges because of the inefficiency of applying the accounting requirements and may instead elect fair value accounting for the related hedged items. In particular, the Company enters into interest rate swaps, swaptions, forward commitments to buy to-be-announced

securities (&#8220;TBAs&#8221;), U.S. Treasury and Eurodollar futures and options on U.S. Treasury futures to mitigate fluctuations in the value of its MSRs, but does not designate those derivatives as accounting hedges.

Additionally, the Company uses forward commitments to sell TBAs and other commitments to sell residential mortgage loans at specified prices to economically hedge the interest rate risk in its residential mortgage loan production activities. At September 30, 2020, the Company had $14.9 billion of forward commitments to sell, hedging $5.8 billion of MLHFS and $13.3 billion of unfunded mortgage loan commitments. The forward commitments to sell and the unfunded mortgage loan commitments on loans intended to be sold are considered derivatives under the accounting guidance related to accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities. The Company has elected the fair value option for the MLHFS. 

Derivatives are subject to credit risk associated with counterparties to the contracts. Credit risk associated with derivatives is measured by the Company based on the probability of counterparty default, including consideration of the COVID-19

pandemic. The Company manages the credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various counterparties, by entering into master netting arrangements, and, where possible, by requiring collateral arrangements. The Company may also transfer counterparty credit risk related to interest rate swaps to third parties through the use of risk participation agreements. In addition, certain interest rate swaps, interest rate forwards and credit contracts are required to be centrally cleared through clearinghouses to further mitigate counterparty credit risk.

For additional information on derivatives and hedging activities, refer to Notes 12 and 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

LIBOR Transition

In July 2017, the United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it would no longer require banks to submit rates for the London InterBank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;) after 2021. The Company holds financial instruments that will be impacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR, including certain loans, investment securities, derivatives, borrowings and other financial instruments that use LIBOR as the benchmark rate. The Company also provides various services to customers in its capacity as trustee, which involve financial instruments that will be similarly impacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR. The Company anticipates these financial instruments will 

&#160;

U.S. Bancorp &#160; 23

require transition to a new reference rate. This transition will occur over time as many of these arrangements do not have an alternative rate referenced in their contracts or a clear path for the parties to agree upon an alternative reference rate. In order to facilitate the transition process, the Company has instituted a LIBOR Transition Office and commenced an enterprise-wide project to identify, assess and monitor risks associated with the expected discontinuance or unavailability of LIBOR, actively engage with industry working groups and regulators, achieve operational readiness and engage impacted customers. It is currently unclear what impact COVID-19

may have on the LIBOR transition or on the timing thereof. Refer to &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2019, for further discussion on potential risks that could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s financial results as a result of the LIBOR transition.

Market Risk Management

In addition to interest rate risk, the Company is exposed to other forms of market risk, principally related to trading activities which support customers&#8217; strategies to manage their own foreign currency, interest rate risk and funding activities. For purposes of its internal capital adequacy assessment process, the Company considers risk arising from its trading activities, as well as the remeasurement volatility of foreign currency denominated balances included on its Consolidated Balance Sheet (collectively, &#8220;Covered Positions&#8221;), employing methodologies consistent with the requirements of regulatory rules for market risk. The Company&#8217;s Market Risk Committee (&#8220;MRC&#8221;), within the framework of the ALCO, oversees market risk management. The MRC monitors and reviews the Company&#8217;s Covered Positions and establishes policies for market risk management, including exposure limits for each portfolio. The Company uses a VaR approach to measure general market risk. Theoretically, VaR represents the statistical risk of loss the Company has to adverse market movements over a one-day

time horizon. The Company uses the Historical Simulation method to calculate VaR for its Covered Positions measured at the ninety-ninth percentile using a one-year

look-back period for distributions derived from past market data. The market factors used in the calculations include those pertinent to market risks inherent in the underlying trading portfolios, principally those that affect the Company&#8217;s corporate bond trading business, foreign currency transaction business, client derivatives business, loan trading business and municipal securities business, as well as those inherent in the Company&#8217;s foreign denominated balances and the derivatives used to mitigate the related measurement volatility. On average, the Company expects the one-day

VaR to be exceeded by actual losses two to three times per year related to these positions. The Company monitors the accuracy of internal VaR models and modeling processes by back-testing model performance, regularly updating the historical data used by the VaR models and regular model validations to assess the accuracy of the models&#8217; input, processing, and reporting components. All models are required to be independently reviewed and approved prior to being placed in use. If the Company were to experience market losses in excess of the estimated VaR more often than expected, the VaR models and associated assumptions would be analyzed and adjusted.

&#160; &#160; 2 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; Given the market volatility in the first quarter of 2020 resulting from effects of the COVID-19

pandemic, the Company experienced actual losses for its combined Covered Positions that exceeded VaR five times during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The Company did not experience any actual losses for its combined Covered Positions that exceeded VaR during the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The Company stress tests its market risk measurements to provide management with perspectives on market events that may not be captured by its VaR models, including worst case historical market movement combinations that have not necessarily occurred on the same date.

The Company calculates Stressed VaR using the same underlying methodology and model as VaR, except that a historical continuous one-year

look-back period is utilized that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate to the Company&#8217;s Covered Positions. The period selected by the Company includes the significant market volatility of the last four months of 2008.

Valuations of positions in client derivatives and foreign currency activities are based on discounted cash flow or other valuation techniques using market-based assumptions. These valuations are compared to third party quotes or other market prices to determine if there are significant variances. Significant variances are approved by senior management in the Company&#8217;s corporate functions. Valuation of positions in the corporate bond trading, loan trading and municipal securities businesses are based on trader marks. These trader marks are evaluated against third party prices, with significant variances approved by senior management in the Company&#8217;s corporate functions. 

The Company also measures the market risk of its hedging activities related to residential MLHFS and MSRs using the Historical Simulation method. The VaRs are measured at the ninety-ninth percentile and employ factors pertinent to the market risks inherent in the valuation of the assets and hedges. A one-year

look-back period is used to obtain past market data for the models.

&#160; &#160; 6 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4 &#160; Liquidity Risk Management

The Company&#8217;s liquidity risk management process is designed to identify, measure, and manage the Company&#8217;s funding and liquidity risk to meet its daily funding needs and to address expected and unexpected changes in its funding requirements. The Company engages in various activities to manage its liquidity risk. These activities include diversifying its funding sources, stress testing, and holding readily-marketable assets which can be used as a source of liquidity if needed. In addition, the Company&#8217;s profitable operations, sound credit quality and strong capital position have enabled it to develop a large and reliable base of core deposit funding within its market areas and in domestic and global capital markets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the Company effectively managed its liquidity position while funding significant loan growth during the period.

The Company&#8217;s Board of Directors approves the Company&#8217;s liquidity policy. The Risk Management Committee of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors oversees the Company&#8217;s liquidity risk management process and approves a contingency funding plan. The ALCO reviews the Company&#8217;s liquidity policy and limits, and regularly assesses the Company&#8217;s ability to meet funding requirements arising from adverse company-specific or market events. 

The Company regularly projects its funding needs under various stress scenarios and maintains a contingency funding plan consistent with the Company&#8217;s access to diversified sources of contingent funding. The Company maintains a substantial level of total available liquidity in the form of on-balance

sheet and off-balance

sheet funding sources. These liquidity sources include cash at the Federal Reserve Bank and certain European central banks, unencumbered liquid assets, and capacity to borrow from the FHLB and at Federal Reserve Bank&#8217;s Discount Window. At September 30, 2020, the fair value of unencumbered investment securities totaled $123.6 billion, compared with $114.2 billion at December 31, 2019. Refer to Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and &#8220;Balance Sheet Analysis&#8221; for further information on investment securities maturities and trends. Asset liquidity is further enhanced by the Company&#8217;s practice of pledging loans to access secured borrowing facilities through the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank. At September 30, 2020, the Company could have borrowed a total of an additional $97.0 billion from the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank based on collateral available for additional borrowings.

The Company&#8217;s diversified deposit base provides a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost

funding, while reducing the Company&#8217;s reliance on the wholesale markets. Total deposits were $413.2 billion at September 30, 2020, compared with $361.9 billion at December 31, 2019. Refer to &#8220;Balance Sheet Analysis&#8221; for further information on the Company&#8217;s deposits.

Additional funding is provided by long-term debt and short-term borrowings. Long-term debt was $42.4 billion at September 30, 2020, and is an important funding source because of its multi-year borrowing structure. Short-term borrowings were $13.7 billion at September 30, 2020, and supplement the Company&#8217;s other funding sources. Refer to &#8220;Balance Sheet Analysis&#8221; for further information on the Company&#8217;s long-term debt and short-term borrowings. 

In addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis, the Company monitors the parent company&#8217;s liquidity. The Company establishes limits for the minimal number of months into the future where the parent company can meet existing and forecasted obligations with cash and securities held that can be readily monetized. The Company measures and manages this limit in both normal and adverse conditions. The 

&#160;

U.S. Bancorp &#160; 25

Company maintains sufficient funding to meet expected capital and debt service obligations for 24 months without the support of dividends from subsidiaries and assuming access to the wholesale markets is maintained. The Company maintains sufficient liquidity to meet its capital and debt service obligations for 12 months under adverse conditions without the support of dividends from subsidiaries or access to the wholesale markets. The parent company is currently well in excess of required liquidity minimums. 

At September 30, 2020, parent company long-term debt outstanding was $22.1 billion, compared with $18.6 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to $2.8 billion of medium-term note issuances. As of September 30, 2020, there was no parent company debt scheduled to mature in the remainder of 2020. 

The Company is subject to a regulatory Liquidity Coverage Ratio (&#8220;LCR&#8221;) requirement which requires banks to maintain an adequate level of unencumbered high quality liquid assets to meet estimated liquidity needs over a 30-day

stressed period. At September 30, 2020, the Company was compliant with this requirement.

Refer to &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis &#8212; Liquidity Risk Management&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2019, for further discussion on liquidity risk management.

European Exposures 

The Company provides merchant processing and corporate trust services in Europe either directly or through banking affiliations in Europe. Revenue generated from sources in Europe represented approximately 2 percent of the Company&#8217;s total net revenue for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020. Operating cash for these businesses is deposited on a short-term basis typically with certain European central banks. For deposits placed at other European banks, exposure is mitigated by the Company placing deposits at multiple banks and managing the amounts on deposit at any bank based on institution-specific deposit limits. At September 30, 2020, the Company had an aggregate amount on deposit with European banks of approximately $9.2 billion, predominately with the Central Bank of Ireland and Bank of England. 

In addition, the Company provides financing to domestic multinational corporations that generate revenue from customers in European countries, transacts with various European banks as counterparties to certain derivative-related activities, and through a subsidiary, manages money market funds that hold certain investments in European sovereign debt. Any further deterioration in economic conditions in Europe, including the potential negative impact of the United Kingdom&#8217;s withdrawal from the European Union (&#8220;Brexit&#8221;), is not expected to have a significant effect on the Company related to these activities. The Company is focused on providing continuity of services, with minimal disruption resulting from Brexit, to customers with activities in European countries. The Company has made certain structural changes to its legal entities and operations in the United Kingdom and European Union, where needed, and migrated certain business activities to the appropriate jurisdictions to continue to provide such services and generate revenue. 

Off-Balance

Sheet Arrangements

Off-balance

sheet arrangements include any contractual arrangements to which an unconsolidated entity is a party, under which the Company has an obligation to provide credit or liquidity enhancements or market risk support. In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into an array of commitments to extend credit, letters of credit and various forms of guarantees that may be considered off-balance

sheet arrangements. Refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these arrangements. The Company does not utilize private label asset securitizations as a source of funding. Off-balance

sheet arrangements also include any obligation related to a variable interest held in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, credit enhancement or market risk support. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Company&#8217;s interests in variable interest entities. 

Capital Management

The Company is committed to managing capital to maintain strong protection for depositors and creditors and for maximum shareholder benefit. The Company also manages its capital to exceed regulatory capital requirements for banking organizations. The regulatory capital requirements effective for the Company follow Basel III, with the Company being subject to calculating its capital adequacy as a percentage of risk-weighted assets under the standardized approach. During 2020, the Company elected to adopt a rule issued in March 2020 by its regulators which permits banking organizations who adopt accounting guidance related to the impairment of financial instruments based on the current expected credit losses (&#8220;CECL&#8221;) methodology during 2020, the option to defer the impact of the effect of that guidance at adoption plus 25 percent of its quarterly credit reserve increases over the next two years on its regulatory capital requirements, followed by a three-year transition period

to phase in the cumulative deferred impact. Table 10 provides a summary of statutory regulatory capital ratios in effect for the Company at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. All regulatory ratios exceeded regulatory &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; requirements. 

The Company believes certain other capital ratios are useful in evaluating its capital adequacy. At September 30, 2020, the Company&#8217;s tangible common equity, as a percent of tangible assets and as a percent of risk-weighted assets determined in accordance with transitional regulatory capital requirements related to the CECL methodology under the standardized approach, was 7.0 percent and 9.3 percent, respectively. This compares to the Company&#8217;s tangible common equity, as a percent of tangible assets and as a percent of risk-weighted assets under the standardized approach, of 7.5 percent and 9.3 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2019. In addition, the Company&#8217;s common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio, reflecting the full implementation of the CECL methodology was 9.0 percent at September 30, 2020. Refer to &#8220;Non-GAAP

Financial Measures&#8221; beginning on page 32 for further information on these other capital ratios.

Total U.S. Bancorp shareholders&#8217; equity was $52.6 billion at September 30, 2020, compared with $51.9 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily the result of corporate earnings and changes in unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale

investment securities included in other comprehensive income (loss), partially offset by a reduction to retained earnings due to the January 1, 2020 adoption of accounting guidance related to the impairment of financial instruments, dividends and common share repurchases.

Beginning in March 2020, the Company suspended all common stock repurchases except for those done exclusively in connection with its stock-based compensation programs. This action was initially taken by the Company to maintain strong capital levels given the impact and uncertainties of COVID-19

on the economy and global markets. Due to continued economic uncertainty, the Federal Reserve Board has implemented measures for the third and fourth quarters of 2020, prohibiting all large bank holding companies, including the Company, from making common stock repurchases, as well as capping dividends at existing rates, which may not be in excess of the average of the last four quarters&#8217; earnings. The Company will continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19

and will adjust its capital distributions as circumstances warrant. Additional capital distributions are subject to the approval of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors, and will be consistent with regulatory requirements.

LINE OF BUSINESS FINANCIAL REVIEW 

The Company&#8217;s major lines of business are Corporate and Commercial Banking, Consumer and Business Banking, Wealth Management and Investment Services, Payment Services, and Treasury and Corporate Support. These operating segments are components of the Company about which financial information is prepared and is evaluated regularly by management in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. 

Basis for Financial Presentation

Business line results are derived from the Company&#8217;s business unit profitability reporting systems by specifically attributing managed balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related income or expense. Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the business lines&#8217; basis for financial presentation. 

Designations, assignments and allocations change from time to time as management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating performance or product lines change or business segments are realigned to better respond to the Company&#8217;s diverse customer base. During 2020, certain organization and methodology changes were made and, accordingly, 2019 results were restated and presented on a comparable basis. 

Corporate and Commercial Banking

Corporate and Commercial Banking offers lending, equipment finance and small-ticket leasing, depository services, treasury management, capital markets services, international trade services and other financial services to middle market, large corporate, commercial real estate, financial institution, non-profit

and public sector clients. Corporate and Commercial Banking contributed $421 million of the Company&#8217;s net income in the third quarter and $1.2 billion in the first nine months of 2020, or an increase of $15 million (3.7 percent) and a decrease of $114 million (8.9 percent), respectively, compared with the same periods of 2019. 

Net revenue increased $89 million (9.1 percent) in the third quarter and $387 million (13.0 percent) in the first nine months of 2020, compared with the same periods of 2019. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, increased $41 million (5.3 percent) in the third quarter and $180 million (7.8 percent) in the first nine months of 2020, compared with the same periods of 2019. The increases were primarily due to strong loan growth, and higher noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by the impact on net interest margin of changes in loan mix and lower spreads on loans, reflecting changing interest rates given the current economic environment. Noninterest income increased $48 million (22.6 percent) in the third quarter and $207 million (31.2 percent) in the first nine months of 2020, compared with the same periods of 2019, primarily due to higher corporate bond issuance fees and trading revenue as corporate customers accessed the fixed income capital markets for bond issuances. 

Noninterest expense increased $18 million (4.5 percent) in the third quarter and $50 million (4.1 percent) in the first nine months of 2020, compared with the same periods of 2019, primarily driven by higher compensation expense due to merit increases and variable compensation related to fixed income capital markets business production, and higher FDIC insurance expense, partially offset by lower net shared services expense and lower other noninterest expense due to a reduction in travel as a result of COVID-19.

The provision for credit losses increased $51 million in the third quarter of 2020, compared with the third quarter of 2019, primarily due to higher net charge-offs, partially offset by a favorable change in the reserve allocation driven by payoffs of funded exposures net of the impact of credit risk rating downgrades. The provision for credit losses increased $490 million in the first nine months of 2020, compared with the first nine months of 2019, primarily due to an unfavorable change in the reserve allocation based on economic risks related to COVID-19

in the portfolio, along with higher net charge-offs.

Consumer and Business Banking

Consumer and Business Banking delivers products and services through banking offices, telephone servicing and sales, on-line

services, direct mail, ATM processing and mobile devices. It encompasses community banking, metropolitan banking and indirect lending, as well as mortgage banking. Consumer and Business Banking contributed $758 million of the Company&#8217;s net income in the third quarter and $2.1 billion in the first nine months of 2020, or increases of $103 million (15.7 percent) and $241 million (13.3 percent), respectively, compared with the same periods of 2019. 

Net revenue increased $226 million (10.0 percent) in the third quarter and $650 million (9.9 percent) in the first nine months of 2020, compared with the same periods of 2019. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, was essentially flat in the third quarter and decreased $151 million (3.2 percent) in the first nine months of 2020, compared with the same periods of 2019, reflecting the impact of declining interest rates on the margin benefit from deposits, offset by higher noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposit balances and loan growth driven in part by loans made under the SBA&#8217;s Paycheck Protection Program and higher GNMA buybacks. Noninterest income increased $225 million 

&#160;

&#160; U.S. Bancorp 

(33.8 percent) in the third quarter and $801 million (45.3 percent) in the first nine months of 2020, compared with the same periods of 2019, primarily due to higher mortgage banking revenue driven by mortgage production and gain on sale margins, partially offset by declines in the valuation of MSRs, net of hedging activities. Other noninterest income increased primarily due to higher than expected retail leasing end of term residual gains. The increases in noninterest income were partially offset by lower deposit service charges due to lower volume. 

Noninterest expense increased $84 million (6.3 percent) in the third quarter and $238 million (6.1 percent) in the first nine months of 2020, compared with the same periods of 2019, primarily due to higher net shared services expense reflecting the impact of investment in infrastructure supporting business growth and higher variable compensation related to strong mortgage banking origination activities, partially offset by lower other noninterest expense due to a reduction in travel as a result of COVID-19.

The provision for credit losses increased $4 million (5.8 percent) in the third quarter of 2020, compared with the third quarter of 2019, due to an unfavorable change in the reserve allocation, mostly offset by lower net charge-offs reflecting stability in credit quality and a reduction in outstanding loan balances. The provision for credit losses increased $88 million (40.4 percent) in the first nine months of 2020, compared with the first nine months of 2019, due to an unfavorable change in the reserve allocation and higher net charge-offs reflecting deterioration in credit quality as compared with the prior year.

Wealth Management and Investment Services

Wealth Management and Investment Services provides private banking, financial advisory services, investment management, retail brokerage services, insurance, trust, custody and fund servicing through four businesses: Wealth Management, Global Corporate Trust &#38; Custody, U.S. Bancorp Asset Management and Fund Services. Wealth Management and Investment Services contributed $168 million of the Company&#8217;s net income in the third quarter and $567 million in the first nine months of 2020, or decreases of $61 million (26.6 percent) and $113 million (16.6 percent), respectively, compared with the same periods of 2019. 

Net revenue decreased $40 million (5.3 percent) in the third quarter and $46 million (2.1 percent) in the first nine months of 2020, compared with the same periods of 2019. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, decreased $55 million (18.6 percent) in the third quarter and $115 million (12.9 percent) in the first nine months of 2020, compared with the same periods of 2019, primarily due to the impact of declining interest rates on the margin benefit from deposits, partially offset by higher noninterest-bearing deposit balances, and changes in deposit mix. The decrease in net interest income in the first nine months of 2020, compared with the first nine months of 2019, was further offset by higher interest-bearing deposit balances. Noninterest income increased $15 million (3.3 percent) in the third quarter and $69 million (5.2 percent) in the first nine months of 2020, compared with the same periods of 2019, primarily due to the impact of favorable market conditions and business growth on trust and investment management fees, partially offset by higher fee waivers related to the money market funds. 

Noninterest expense increased $31 million (7.0 percent) in the third quarter and $72 million (5.5 percent) in the first nine months of 2020, compared with the same periods of 2019, reflecting increased net shared services expense due to technology development and higher compensation expense due to the impact of merit increases. In addition, other noninterest expense was higher due to the allocation to the business line of legal costs previously reserved for, partially offset by a reduction in travel as a result of COVID-19.

The provision for credit losses increased $11 million in the third quarter and $33 million in the first nine months of 2020, compared with the same periods of 2019, reflecting unfavorable changes in the reserve allocation driven by downgrades within the loan portfolio.

Payment Services

Payment Services includes consumer and business credit cards, stored-value cards, debit cards, corporate, government and purchasing card services, consumer lines of credit and merchant processing. Payment Services contributed $313 million of the Company&#8217;s net income in the third quarter and $988 million in the first nine months of 2020, or decreases of $85 million (21.4 percent) and $82 million (7.7 percent), respectively, compared with the same periods of 2019. 

Net revenue decreased $85 million (5.4 percent) in the third quarter and $389 million (8.5 percent) in the first nine months of 2020, compared with the same periods of 2019. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, increased $5 million (0.8 percent) in the third quarter and $53 million (2.9 percent) in the first nine months of 2020, compared with the same periods of 2019, primarily due to favorable margin benefit from deposits and higher deposit balances as a result of state unemployment programs utilizing prepaid cards, partially offset by lower loan volume, loan spreads and balance transfer loan fees. Noninterest income decreased

$90 million (9.4 percent) in the third quarter and $442 million (16.0 percent) in the first nine months of 2020, compared with the same periods of 2019, mainly due to the impacts of COVID-19

on consumer and business spending volume in all payments businesses including merchant processing services, corporate payment products, and credit and debit card revenue. The decrease in credit and debit card revenue due to lower spending volume was offset by higher prepaid card fees as a result of state unemployment programs.

Noninterest expense increased $42 million (5.3 percent) in the third quarter and $83 million (3.6 percent) in the first nine months of 2020, compared with the same periods of 2019, reflecting incremental costs related to the prepaid card business and higher software expense due to capital expenditures and acquisitions, partially offset by lower marketing and business development expense due to the timing of marketing campaigns. The provision for credit losses decreased $14 million (5.4 percent) in the third quarter and $364 million (43.3 percent) in the first nine months of 2020, compared with the same periods of 2019, reflecting favorable changes in the reserve allocation driven by lower outstanding loan balances and lower delinquency rates, partially offset by the impact on the allowance for credit losses to recognize the expected losses within the acquired State Farm Bank credit card portfolio. The decrease in the provision for credit losses in the third quarter of 2020, compared with the third quarter of 2019, was also due to lower net charge-offs. 

Treasury and Corporate Support

Treasury and Corporate Support includes the Company&#8217;s investment portfolios, funding, capital management, interest rate risk management, income taxes not allocated to the business lines, including most investments in tax-advantaged

projects, and the residual aggregate of those expenses associated with corporate activities that are managed on a consolidated basis. Treasury and Corporate Support recorded net losses of $80 million in the third quarter and $1.3 billion in the first nine months of 2020, compared with net income of $220 million and $590 million, respectively, in the same periods of 2019. 

Net revenue decreased $146 million (43.2 percent) in the third quarter and $347 million (35.8 percent) in the first nine months of 2020, compared with the same periods of 2019. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, decreased $46 million in the third quarter and $168 million in the first nine months of 2020, compared with the same periods of 2019, primarily due to higher prepayment amortization and lower reinvestment yields within the investment portfolio compared with the prior year. Noninterest income decreased $100 million (30.8 percent) in the third quarter and $179 million (20.5 percent) in the first nine months of 2020, compared with the same periods of 2019, primarily due to lower equity investment income, lower tax-advantaged

investment syndication revenue and certain asset impairments as a result of expected branch closures. The decrease in noninterest income in the first nine months of 2020, compared with the first nine months of 2019, was also due to asset impairments as a result of property damage from civil unrest in the second quarter of 2020, partially offset by gains on the sale of certain businesses in the first quarter of 2020 and higher investment securities gains.

Noninterest expense increased $52 million (28.4 percent) in the third quarter and $178 million (30.1 percent) in the first nine months of 2020, compared with the same periods of 2019, primarily due to the recognition of liabilities related to airline exposure and COVID-related expenses, higher compensation expense reflecting merit increases and stock-based compensation, and higher implementation costs of capital investments to support business growth. These increases were partially offset by lower net shared services expense and lower costs related to tax-advantaged

projects. The provision for credit losses increased $216 million in the third quarter and $2.0 billion in the first nine months of 2020, compared with the same periods of 2019, reflecting the residual impact of changes in the allowance for credit losses being impacted by adverse economic conditions and the expected impact to credit losses within the Company&#8217;s loan portfolios due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Income taxes are assessed to each line of business at a managerial tax rate of 25.0 percent with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included in Treasury and Corporate Support.

FINANCIAL MEASURES 

In addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the Company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including: 

&#8226; &#160; Tangible common equity to tangible assets, 

&#8226; &#160; Tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets, and 

&#8226; &#160; Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, reflecting the full implementation of the CECL methodology. 

These capital measures are viewed by management as useful additional methods of evaluating the Company&#8217;s utilization of its capital held and the level of capital available to withstand unexpected negative market or economic conditions. Additionally, 

&#160;

&#160; U.S. Bancorp 

presentation of these measures allows investors, analysts and banking regulators to assess the Company&#8217;s capital position relative to other financial services companies. These capital measures are not defined in generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;), or are not currently effective or defined in banking regulations. In addition, certain of these measures differ from currently effective capital ratios defined by banking regulations principally in that the currently effective ratios, which are subject to certain transitional provisions, temporarily exclude the impact of the 2020 adoption of accounting guidance related to impairment of financial instruments based on the CECL methodology. As a result, these capital measures disclosed by the Company may be considered non-GAAP

financial measures. Management believes this information helps investors assess trends in the Company&#8217;s capital adequacy.

The Company also discloses net interest income and related ratios and analysis on a taxable-equivalent basis, which may also be considered non-GAAP

financial measures. The Company believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt

sources. In addition, certain performance measures, including the efficiency ratio and net interest margin utilize net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis.

There may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, the Company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this report in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The accounting and reporting policies of the Company comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and conform to general practices within the banking industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions. The Company&#8217;s financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions, which are integral to understanding the Company&#8217;s financial statements. Critical accounting policies are those policies management believes are the most important to the portrayal of the Company&#8217;s financial condition and results, and require management to make estimates that are difficult, subjective or complex. Most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies. Management has discussed the development and the selection of critical accounting policies with the Company&#8217;s Audit Committee. Those policies considered to be critical accounting policies relate to the allowance for credit losses, fair value estimates, MSRs, and income taxes. 

Allowance for Credit Losses

Management&#8217;s evaluation of the appropriate allowance for credit losses is often the most critical of all the accounting estimates for a banking institution. It is an inherently subjective process impacted by many factors as discussed throughout the Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis section of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

The methods utilized to estimate the allowance for credit losses, key assumptions and quantitative and qualitative information considered by management in determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2020 are discussed in the &#8220;Credit Risk Management&#8221; section. Although methodologies utilized to determine each element of the allowance reflect management&#8217;s assessment of credit risk as identified through assessments completed of individual credits and of homogenous pools affected by material credit events, degrees of imprecision exist in these measurement tools due in part to subjective judgments involved and an inherent lag in the data available to quantify current conditions and events that affect credit loss reserve estimates. As discussed in the &#8220;Analysis and Determination of Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; section, management considered the effect of changes in economic conditions, risk management practices, and other factors that contributed to imprecision of loss estimates in determining the allowance for credit losses. If not considered, expected losses in the credit portfolio related to imprecision and other subjective factors could have a dramatic adverse impact on the liquidity and financial viability of a banking institution. 

Given the many quantitative variables and subjective factors affecting the credit portfolio, changes in the allowance for credit losses may not directly coincide with changes in the risk ratings of the credit portfolio reflected in the risk rating process. This is in part due to the timing of the risk rating process in relation to changes in the business cycle, the exposure and mix of loans within risk rating categories, levels of nonperforming loans and the timing of charge-offs and expected recoveries. The allowance for credit losses on commercial lending segment loans measures the expected loss content on the remaining portfolio exposure, while nonperforming loans and net charge-offs are measures of specific impairment events that have already been confirmed. Therefore, the degree of change in the forward-looking expected loss in the commercial lending allowance may differ from the level of changes in nonperforming loans and net charge-offs. Management maintains an appropriate allowance for credit losses by updating allowance rates to reflect changes in expected losses, including expected changes in economic or business cycle conditions. 

Some factors considered in determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses are more readily quantifiable while other factors require extensive qualitative judgment. Management conducts an analysis with respect to the accuracy of risk ratings and the volatility of expected losses, and utilizes this analysis along with qualitative factors that can affect the precision of credit loss estimates, including economic conditions, such as changes in gross domestic product, unemployment or bankruptcy rates, and concentration risks, such as risks associated with specific industries, collateral valuations, and loans to highly leveraged enterprises, in determining the overall level of the allowance for credit losses. 

The Company considers a range of economic scenarios in its determination of the allowance for credit losses. These scenarios are constructed with interrelated projections of multiple economic variables, and loss estimates are produced that consider the historical correlation of those economic variables with credit losses, and also the expectation that conditions will eventually normalize over the longer run. Scenarios worse than the Company&#8217;s expected outcome at September 30, 2020 include risks that government stimulus in response to the COVID-19

pandemic is less broad or less effective than expected, or that a longer or more severe health crisis prolongs the downturn in economic activity, reducing the number of businesses that are ultimately able to resume operations after the crisis has passed.

&#160;

&#160; U.S. Bancorp 

The Company&#8217;s determination of the allowance for commercial lending segment loans is sensitive to the assigned credit risk ratings and expected loss rates at September 30, 2020. If 20 percent of period ending loan balances (including unfunded commitments) within each risk category of risk rated commercial lending loans experienced a downgrade to the next worse risk category, the allowance for credit losses would have increased by approximately $219 million at September 30, 2020. If quantitative loss estimates for commercial lending segment loans increased by 10 percent, the allowance for credit losses would have increased by approximately $343 million at September 30, 2020. The Company believes the allowance for credit losses appropriately considers the imprecision in estimating credit losses based on credit risk ratings and credit loss model estimates, but actual losses may differ from those estimates. 

The Company&#8217;s determination of the allowance for consumer lending segment loans is sensitive to changes in estimated loss rates and estimated impairments on restructured loans. In the event that estimated losses for this segment of the loan portfolio increased by 10 percent, the allowance for credit losses would have increased by approximately $313 million at September 30, 2020. 

Because several quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in determining the allowance for credit losses, these sensitivity analyses do not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the allowance for credit losses. They are intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes in risk rating and loss model estimates and do not imply any expectation of future deterioration in the risk rating or loss rates. Given current processes employed by the Company, management believes the risk ratings and loss model estimates currently assigned are appropriate. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions that could be significant to the Company&#8217;s financial statements. Refer to the &#8220;Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; section for further information. 

Accounting policies related to fair value estimates, MSRs, and income taxes are discussed in detail in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis &#8212; Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K
