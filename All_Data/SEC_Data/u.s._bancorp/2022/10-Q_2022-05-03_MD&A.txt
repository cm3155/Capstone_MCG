 Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

&#160;

OVERVIEW 

Earnings Summary

U.S. Bancorp and its subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) reported net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp of $1.6 billion for the first quarter of 2022, or $0.99 per diluted common share, compared with $2.3 billion, or $1.45 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2021. Return on average assets and return on average common equity were 1.09 percent and 12.7 percent, respectively, for the first quarter of 2022, compared with 1.69 percent and 19.0 percent, respectively, for the first quarter of 2021. 

Total net revenue for the first quarter of 2022 was $126 million (2.3 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2021, reflecting a 3.6 percent increase in net interest income and a 0.6 percent increase in noninterest income. The increase in net interest income from the first quarter of 2021 was primarily due to higher loan and investment securities balances and favorable deposit and funding mix due in part to higher noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by lower loan yields and changes in loan mix, as well as lower loan fees driven by the impact of loan forgiveness related to the Small Business Administration (&#8220;SBA&#8221;) Paycheck Protection Program in the first quarter of 2021. The noninterest income increase primarily reflected stronger payment services revenue, trust and investment management fees, deposit service charges and treasury management fees, mostly offset by lower mortgage banking revenue as refinancing activities decline, lower commercial products revenue related to capital markets activities and lower other noninterest income. 

Noninterest expense in the first quarter of 2022 was $123 million (3.6 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2021, reflecting increases in compensation expense, professional services expense and marketing and business development expense. 

The provision for credit losses for the first quarter of 2022 was $112 million, compared with a benefit of $827 million for the first quarter of 2021. The provision for credit losses in the first quarter of 2022 reflected the impact of improving credit quality, partially offset by loan growth and increasing economic uncertainty. The provision for credit losses for the first quarter of 2021 reflected a decrease in the allowance for credit losses as a result of improving economic conditions and credit quality. Net charge-offs in the first quarter of 2022 were $162 million, compared with $223 million in the first quarter of 2021. Refer to &#8220;Corporate Risk Profile&#8221; for further information on the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs, nonperforming assets and other factors considered by the Company in assessing the credit quality of the loan portfolio and establishing the allowance for credit losses. 

Pending Acquisition

In September 2021, the Company announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire MUFG Union Bank&#8217;s core regional banking franchise from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (&#8220;MUFG&#8221;), for an expected purchase price of approximately $8.0 billion, including $5.5 billion in cash and approximately 44 million shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock. The transaction excludes the purchase of MUFG Union Bank&#8217;s Global Corporate &#38; Investment Bank, certain middle and back office functions, and other assets. MUFG Union Bank currently has approximately 300 branches in California, Washington and Oregon and is expected to add approximately $105 billion in total assets, $58 billion of loans and $90 billion of deposits to the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet. Closing of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals which are not within the Company&#8217;s control. The Company expects to close the transaction approximately 45 days after being granted U.S. regulatory approvals. At this time, it is uncertain whether such approvals will be received in time to allow for closing to occur in the first half of 2022; however, the parties continue to make significant progress in planning for closing and integration while awaiting regulatory approvals.

STATEMENT OF INCOME ANALYSIS 

Net Interest Income

Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, was $3.2 billion in the first quarter of 2022, representing an increase of $111 million (3.6 percent) compared with the first quarter of 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher loan and investment securities balances and favorable deposit and funding mix due in part to higher noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by lower loan yields and changes in loan mix, as well as lower loan fees driven by the impact of loan forgiveness related to the SBA Paycheck Protection Program in the first quarter of 2021. Average earning assets were $32.1 billion (6.5 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2021, reflecting increases of $29.2 billion (20.1 percent) in investment securities and $19.0 billion (6.5 percent) in loans, partially offset by a decrease of $11.9 billion (28.6 percent) in interest-bearing deposits with banks. The net interest margin, on a taxable-equivalent basis, in the first quarter of 2022 was 2.44 percent, compared with 2.50 percent in the first quarter of 2021. The decrease in net interest margin from the first quarter of 2021 was primarily due to the mix of loans and lower loan spreads within fixed-rate portfolios, partially offset by favorable changes in funding mix and the yield curve. Refer to the &#8220;Consolidated Daily Average Balance Sheet and Related Yields and Rates&#8221; table for further information on net interest income.

&#160;

Average total loans in the first quarter of 2022 were $19.0 billion (6.5 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2021. The increase was primarily due to growth in commercial loans (11.4 percent), residential mortgages (3.0 percent) and other retail loans (8.8 percent). The increase in commercial loans was primarily due to higher utilization driven by working capital needs of corporate customers and slower payoffs given higher volatility in the capital markets, as well as core growth, partially offset by expected reductions related to the forgiveness of loans in the SBA Paycheck Protection Program. The increase in residential mortgages was driven by stronger on-balance

sheet loan activities and slower refinance activity. The increase in other retail loans was driven by auto and recreational vehicle lending during 2021, partially offset by lower home equity and second mortgages. 

Average investment securities in the first quarter of 2022 were $29.2 billion (20.1 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to purchases of mortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury securities, net of prepayments, sales and maturities. 

Average total deposits for the first quarter of 2022 were $27.8 billion (6.5 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2021. Average total savings deposits for the first quarter of 2022 were $20.6 billion (7.3 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2021, driven by increases in Consumer and Business Banking, and Corporate and Commercial Banking balances, partially offset by a decrease in Wealth Management and Investment Services balances. Average noninterest-bearing deposits were $9.6 billion (8.1 percent) higher than the prior year, primarily due to higher Corporate and Commercial Banking, and Wealth Management and Investment Services balances. Average time deposits were $2.4 billion (8.8 percent) lower than the prior year, primarily driven by decreases in Consumer and Business Banking, and Wealth Management and Investment Services balances, partially offset by an increase in Corporate and Commercial Banking balances. Changes in time deposits are primarily related to those deposits managed as an alternative to other funding sources, based largely on relative pricing and liquidity characteristics. 

Provision for Credit Losses

The provision for credit losses was $112 million for the first quarter of 2022, compared with a benefit of $827 million for the first quarter of 2021. The provision for credit losses in the first quarter of 2022 reflected the impact of improving credit quality, partially offset by loan growth and increasing economic uncertainty associated with rising inflation and geopolitical tensions. The provision for credit losses in the first quarter of 2021 reflected the enactment of additional government stimulus programs and widespread vaccine availability, contributing to economic improvement during the period, which resulted in a significant decrease in the allowance for credit losses. Net charge-offs decreased $61 million (27.4 percent) in the first quarter of 2022, compared with the first quarter of 2021, reflecting improvement across most loan categories, associated with strong asset values and borrower liquidity. Refer to &#8220;Corporate Risk Profile&#8221; for further information on the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs, nonperforming assets and other factors considered by the Company in assessing the credit quality of the loan portfolio and establishing the allowance for credit losses. 

Noninterest Income

Noninterest income was $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 2022, representing an increase of $15 million (0.6 percent) compared with the first quarter of 2021. The increase from a year ago reflected strong payment services revenue, growth in trust and investment management fees, improving deposit service charges and higher treasury management fees, mostly offset by lower commercial products revenue, mortgage banking revenue and other noninterest income. Payment services revenue increased $79 million (10.1 percent) as corporate payment products revenue increased $32 million (25.4 percent) primarily due to higher sales volume, while merchant processing services revenue increased $45 million

(14.2 percent) driven by higher sales volumes and merchant fees. Trust and investment management fees increased $56 million (12.6 percent) driven by business growth, favorable market conditions and activity related to the fourth quarter of 2021 acquisition of PFM Asset Management LLC (&#8220;PFM&#8221;), partially offset by higher fee waivers. Deposit service charges increased $16 million (9.9 percent) primarily due to higher customer spend activity, net of the impact of the elimination of certain consumer non-sufficient

funds fees in the first quarter of 2022. Treasury management fees increased $9 million (6.1 percent) primarily due to core growth given the continued recovery in the economy. Mortgage banking revenue decreased $99 million (33.1 percent) due to lower application volume, given declining refinance activities, and lower related gain on sale margins, partially offset by increases in mortgage servicing rights (&#8220;MSRs&#8221;) valuations, net of hedging activities, as well as higher performing loan sales. Commercial products revenue decreased $14 million (5.0 percent) primarily due to lower corporate bond fees and trading revenue within the capital markets business. Other noninterest income decreased $32 million (16.8 percent) driven by the impact of prior year asset sales and lower retail leasing end-of-term

residual gains in the first quarter of 2022. 

Noninterest Expense

Noninterest expense was $3.5 billion in the first quarter of 2022, representing an increase of $123 million (3.6 percent) over the first quarter of 2021. The increase from the prior year reflected higher compensation expense, professional services expense and marketing and business development expense. Compensation expense increased $50 million (2.8 percent) primarily due to merit increases and hiring to support business growth, partially offset by lower performance-based incentives. Professional services expense increased $16 million (16.3 percent) primarily due to an increase in business investment and related initiatives. Marketing and business development expense increased $32 million (66.7 percent) due to the timing of marketing campaigns as well as increased travel and entertainment. 

Income Tax Expense

The provision for income taxes was $397 million (an effective rate of 20.3 percent) for the first quarter of 2022, compared with $607 million (an effective rate of 21.0 percent) for the first quarter of 2021. For further information on income taxes, refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS 

Loans

The Company&#8217;s loan portfolio was $318.9 billion at March 31, 2022, compared with $312.0 billion at December 31, 2021, an increase of $6.9 billion (2.2 percent). The increase was driven by higher commercial loans and residential mortgages, partially offset by lower credit card loans and other retail loans. 

Commercial loans increased $5.4 billion (4.9 percent) at March 31, 2022, compared with December 31, 2021, due to higher utilization driven by working capital needs of corporate customers and slower payoffs given higher volatility in the capital markets, as well as core growth. 

Residential mortgages held in the loan portfolio increased $2.0 billion (2.6 percent) at March 31, 2022, compared with December 31, 2021, due to stronger on-balance

sheet loan activities and slower refinance activity. Residential mortgages originated and placed in the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio include jumbo mortgages and branch-originated first lien home equity loans to borrowers with high credit quality. 

Credit card loans decreased $337 million (1.5 percent) at March 31, 2022, compared with December 31, 2021, primarily the result of customers seasonally paying down balances.

&#160;

Other retail loans decreased $336 million (0.5 percent) at March 31, 2022, compared with December 31, 2021, due to decreases in retail leasing balances and auto loans, partially offset by an increase in installment loans. 

The Company generally retains portfolio loans through maturity; however, the Company&#8217;s intent may change over time based upon various factors such as ongoing asset/liability management activities, assessment of product profitability, credit risk, liquidity needs, and capital implications. If the Company&#8217;s intent or ability to hold an existing portfolio loan changes, it is transferred to loans held for sale. 

Loans Held for Sale

Loans held for sale, consisting primarily of residential mortgages to be sold in the secondary market, were $3.3 billion at March 31, 2022, compared with $7.8 billion at December 31, 2021. The decrease in loans held for sale was principally due to a lower level of mortgage loan closings in the first quarter of 2022, compared with the fourth quarter of 2021. Almost all of the residential mortgage loans the Company originates or purchases for sale follow guidelines that allow the loans to be sold into existing, highly liquid secondary markets, in particular in government agency transactions and to government-sponsored enterprises (&#8220;GSEs&#8221;). 

Investment Securities

Investment securities totaled $167.2 billion at March 31, 2022, compared with $174.8 billion at December 31, 2021. The $7.6 billion (4.3 percent) decrease was primarily due to a $6.8 billion unfavorable change in net unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale

investment securities. 

The Company&#8217;s available-for-sale

investment securities are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in other comprehensive income (loss) unless a portion of a security&#8217;s unrealized loss is related to credit and an allowance for credit losses is necessary. At March 31, 2022, the Company&#8217;s net unrealized losses on available-for-sale

investment securities were $6.0 billion, compared with $722 million of net unrealized gains at December 31, 2021. The unfavorable change in net unrealized gains (losses) was primarily due to decreases in the fair value of mortgage-backed, U.S. Treasury and state and political securities as a result of changes in interest rates. Gross unrealized losses on available-for-sale

investment securities totaled $6.3 billion at March 31, 2022, compared with $812 million at December 31, 2021. At March 31, 2022, the Company had no plans to sell securities with unrealized losses, and believes it is more likely than not that it would not be required to sell such securities before recovery of their amortized cost.

Deposits

Total deposits were $461.5 billion at March 31, 2022, compared with $456.1 billion at December 31, 2021. The $5.5 billion (1.2 percent) increase in total deposits reflected increases in total savings deposits and time deposits, partially offset by a decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits. Money market deposit balances increased $3.7 billion (3.2 percent) at March 31, 2022, compared with December 31, 2021, primarily due to higher Corporate and Commercial Banking, and Wealth Management and Investment Services balances. Savings account balances increased $2.6 billion (4.0 percent), driven by higher Consumer and Business Banking balances. Interest checking balances increased $2.6 billion (2.2 percent), primarily due to higher Corporate and Commercial Banking, and Consumer and Business Banking balances, partially offset by a decrease in Wealth Management and Investment Services balances. Time deposits increased $1.6 billion (7.2 percent) at March 31, 2022, compared with December 31, 2021, driven by higher Corporate and Commercial Banking balances, partially offset by lower Consumer and Business Banking balances. Changes in time deposits are primarily related to those deposits managed as an alternative to other funding sources, based largely on relative pricing and liquidity characteristics. Noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $5.1 billion (3.8 percent) at March 31, 2022, compared with December 31, 2021, primarily due to lower Wealth Management and Investment Services balances. 

Borrowings

The Company utilizes both short-term and long-term borrowings as part of its asset/liability management and funding strategies. Short-term borrowings, which include federal funds purchased, commercial paper, repurchase agreements, borrowings secured by high-grade assets and other short-term borrowings, were $21.0 billion at March 31, 2022, compared with $11.8 billion at December 31, 2021. The $9.2 billion (78.4 percent) increase in short-term borrowings was primarily due to an increase in short-term

Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) advances. Long-term debt was $32.9 billion at March 31, 2022, compared with $32.1 billion at December 31, 2021. The $806 million (2.5 percent) increase was primarily due to $2.1 billion of medium-term note issuances, partially offset by $1.0 billion of medium-term note repayments. Refer to the &#8220;Liquidity Risk Management&#8221; section for discussion of liquidity management of the Company.

The Company&#8217;s Board of Directors has approved a risk management framework which establishes governance and risk management requirements for all risk-taking activities. This framework includes Company and business line risk appetite statements which set boundaries for the types and amount of risk that may be undertaken in pursuing business objectives and initiatives. The Board of Directors, primarily through its Risk Management Committee, oversees performance relative to the risk management framework, risk appetite statements, and other policy requirements. 

The Executive Risk Committee (&#8220;ERC&#8221;), which is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer and includes the Chief Executive Officer and other members of the executive management team, oversees execution against the risk management framework and risk appetite statements. The ERC focuses on current and emerging risks, including strategic and reputation risks, by directing timely and comprehensive actions. Senior operating committees have also been established, each responsible for overseeing a specified category of risk. 

The Company&#8217;s most prominent risk exposures are credit, interest rate, market, liquidity, operational, compliance, strategic, and reputation. Credit risk is the risk of loss associated with a change in the credit profile or the failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its contractual obligations. Interest rate risk is the current or prospective risk to earnings and capital, or market valuations, arising from the impact of changes in interest rates. Market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and security prices that may result in changes in the values of financial instruments, such as trading and available-for-sale

securities, mortgage loans held for sale (&#8220;MLHFS&#8221;), MSRs and derivatives that are accounted for on a fair value basis. Liquidity risk is the risk that financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by the Company&#8217;s inability, or perceived inability, to meet its cash flow obligations in a timely and complete manner in either normal or stressed conditions. Operational risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, people (including human errors or misconduct), or adverse external events, including the risk of loss resulting from breaches in data security. Operational risk can also include the risk of loss due to failures by third parties with which the Company does business. Compliance risk is the risk that the Company may suffer legal or regulatory sanctions, financial losses, and reputational damage if it fails to adhere to compliance requirements and the Company&#8217;s compliance policies. Strategic risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from adverse business decisions, poor implementation of business decisions, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the banking industry and operating environment. Reputation risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, or franchise or enterprise value arising from negative public opinion. This risk may impair the Company&#8217;s competitiveness by affecting its ability to establish new relationships or services, or continue serving existing relationships. In addition to the risks identified above, other risk factors exist that may impact the Company. Refer to &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2021, for a detailed discussion of these factors. 

The Company&#8217;s Board and management-level governance committees are supported by a &#8220;three lines of defense&#8221; model for establishing effective checks and balances. The first line of defense, the business lines, manages risks in conformity with established limits and policy requirements. In turn, business line leaders and their risk officers establish programs to ensure conformity with these limits and policy requirements. The second line of defense, which includes the Chief Risk Officer&#8217;s organization as well as policy and oversight activities of corporate support functions, translates risk appetite and strategy into actionable risk limits and policies. The second line of defense monitors first line of defense conformity with limits and policies, and provides reporting and escalation of emerging risks and other concerns to senior management and the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors. The third line of defense, internal audit, is responsible for providing the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and senior management with independent assessment and assurance regarding the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s governance, risk management and control processes. 

Management regularly provides reports to the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors. The Risk Management Committee discusses with management the Company&#8217;s risk management performance, and provides a summary of key risks to the entire Board of Directors, covering the status of existing matters, areas of potential future concern and specific information on certain types of loss events. The Risk Management

Committee considers quarterly reports by management assessing the Company&#8217;s performance relative to the risk appetite statements and the associated risk limits, including: 

&#8226; &#160; Macroeconomic environment and other qualitative considerations, such as regulatory and compliance changes, litigation developments, geopolitical events, and technology and cybersecurity; 

&#8226; &#160; Credit measures, including adversely rated and nonperforming loans, leveraged transactions, credit concentrations and lending limits; 

&#8226; &#160; Interest rate and market risk, including market value and net income simulation, and trading-related Value at Risk (&#8220;VaR&#8221;); 

&#8226; &#160; Liquidity risk, including funding projections under various stressed scenarios; 

&#8226; &#160; Operational and compliance risk, including losses stemming from events such as fraud, processing errors, control breaches, breaches in data security or adverse business decisions, as well as reporting on technology performance, and various legal and regulatory compliance measures; 

&#8226; &#160; Capital ratios and projections, including regulatory measures and stressed scenarios; and 

&#8226; &#160; Strategic and reputation risk considerations, impacts and responses. 

Credit Risk Management

The Company&#8217;s strategy for credit risk management includes well-defined, centralized credit policies, uniform underwriting criteria, and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all commercial and consumer credit exposures. In evaluating its credit risk, the Company considers changes, if any, in underwriting activities, the loan portfolio composition (including product mix and geographic, industry or customer-specific concentrations), collateral values, trends in loan performance and macroeconomic factors, such as changes in unemployment rates, gross domestic product levels and consumer bankruptcy filings. The Risk Management Committee oversees the Company&#8217;s credit risk management process. 

In addition, credit quality ratings as defined by the Company are an important part of the Company&#8217;s overall credit risk management and evaluation of its allowance for credit losses. Loans with a pass rating represent those loans not classified on the Company&#8217;s rating scale for problem credits, as minimal credit risk has been identified. Loans with a special mention or classified rating, including consumer lending and small business loans that are 90 days or more past due and still accruing, nonaccrual loans, those loans considered troubled debt restructurings (&#8220;TDRs&#8221;), and loans in a junior lien position that are current but are behind a first lien position on nonaccrual, encompass all loans held by the Company that it considers to have a potential or well-defined weakness that may put full collection of contractual cash flows at risk. The Company&#8217;s internal credit quality ratings for consumer loans are primarily based on delinquency and nonperforming status, except for a limited population of larger loans within those portfolios that are individually evaluated. For this limited population, the determination of the internal credit quality rating may also consider collateral value and customer cash flows. Refer to Note 5 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolios including internal credit quality ratings. In addition, refer to &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis &#8212; Credit Risk Management&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2021, for a more detailed discussion on credit risk management processes. 

The Company manages its credit risk, in part, through diversification of its loan portfolio which is achieved through limit setting by product type criteria, such as industry, and identification of credit concentrations. As part of its normal business activities, the Company offers a broad array of lending products. The Company categorizes its loan portfolio into two segments, which is the level at which it develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The Company&#8217;s two loan portfolio segments are commercial lending and consumer lending. 

The commercial lending segment includes loans and leases made to small business, middle market, large corporate, commercial real estate, financial institution, non-profit

and public sector customers. Key risk characteristics relevant to commercial lending segment loans include the industry and geography of the borrower&#8217;s business, purpose of the loan, repayment source, borrower&#8217;s debt capacity and financial flexibility, loan covenants, and nature of pledged collateral, if any, as well as macroeconomic factors such as unemployment rates, gross domestic product levels, corporate bond spreads and long-term interest rates. These risk characteristics, among others, are considered in determining estimates about the likelihood of default by the borrowers and the severity of loss in the event of default. The Company considers these risk characteristics in assigning internal risk ratings to, or forecasting losses on, these loans, which are the significant factors in determining the allowance for credit losses for loans in the commercial lending segment. 

The consumer lending segment represents loans and leases made to consumer customers, including residential 

&#160;

&#160; U.S. Bancorp 

mortgages, credit card loans, and other retail loans such as revolving consumer lines, auto loans and leases, home equity loans and lines, and student loans, a run-off

portfolio. Home equity or second mortgage loans are junior lien closed-end

accounts fully disbursed at origination. These loans typically are fixed rate loans, secured by residential real estate, with a 10-

or 15-year

fixed payment amortization schedule. Home equity lines are revolving accounts giving the borrower the ability to draw and repay balances repeatedly, up to a maximum commitment, and are secured by residential real estate. These include accounts in either a first or junior lien position. Typical terms on home equity lines in the portfolio are variable rates benchmarked to the prime rate, with a 10-

or 15-year

draw period during which a minimum payment is equivalent to the monthly interest, followed by a 20-

or 10-year

amortization period, respectively. At March 31, 2022, substantially all of the Company&#8217;s home equity lines were in the draw period. Key risk characteristics relevant to consumer lending segment loans primarily relate to the borrowers&#8217; capacity and willingness to repay and include unemployment rates, consumer bankruptcy filings and other macroeconomic factors, customer payment history and credit scores, and in some cases, updated loan-to-value

(&#8220;LTV&#8221;) information reflecting current market conditions on real estate-based loans. These and other risk characteristics are reflected in forecasts of delinquency levels, bankruptcies and losses which are the primary factors in determining the allowance for credit losses for the consumer lending segment. 

The Company further disaggregates its loan portfolio segments into various classes based on their underlying risk characteristics. The two classes within the commercial lending segment are commercial loans and commercial real estate loans. The three classes within the consumer lending segment are residential mortgages, credit card loans and other retail loans. 

The Company&#8217;s consumer lending segment utilizes several distinct business processes and channels to originate consumer credit, including traditional branch lending, mobile and on-line

banking, indirect lending, alliance partnerships and correspondent banks. Each distinct underwriting and origination activity manages unique credit risk characteristics and prices its loan production commensurate with the differing risk profiles. 

Residential mortgage originations are generally limited to prime borrowers and are performed through the Company&#8217;s branches, loan production offices, mobile and on-line

services and a wholesale network of originators. The Company may retain residential mortgage loans it originates on its balance sheet or sell the loans into the secondary market while retaining the servicing rights and customer relationships. Utilizing the secondary markets enables the Company to effectively reduce its credit and other asset/liability risks. For residential mortgages that are retained in the Company&#8217;s portfolio and for home equity and second mortgages, credit risk is also diversified by geography and managed by adherence to LTV and borrower credit criteria during the underwriting process. 

The Company estimates updated LTV information on its outstanding residential mortgages quarterly, based on a method that combines automated valuation model updates and relevant home price indices. LTV is the ratio of the loan&#8217;s outstanding principal balance to the current estimate of property value. For home equity and second mortgages, combined loan-to-value

(&#8220;CLTV&#8221;) is the combination of the first mortgage original principal balance and the second lien outstanding principal balance, relative to the current estimate of property value. Certain loans do not have an LTV or CLTV, primarily due to lack of availability of relevant automated valuation model and/or home price indices values, or lack of necessary valuation data on acquired loans. 

The following tables provide summary information of residential mortgages and home equity and second mortgages by LTV at March 31, 2022:

Home equity and second mortgages were $10.5 billion at March 31, 2022, compared with $10.4 billion at December 31, 2021, and included $3.0 billion of home equity lines in a first lien position and $7.5 billion of home equity and second mortgage loans and lines in a junior lien position. Loans and lines in a junior lien position at March 31, 2022, included approximately $2.7 billion of loans and lines for which the Company also serviced the related first lien loan, and approximately $4.8 billion where the Company did not service the related first lien loan. The Company was able to determine the status of the related first liens using information the Company has as the servicer of the first lien or information reported on customer credit bureau files. The Company also evaluates other indicators of credit risk for these junior lien loans and lines including delinquency, estimated average CLTV ratios and updated weighted-average credit scores in making its assessment of credit risk, related loss estimates and determining the allowance for credit losses.

Loan Delinquencies

Trends in delinquency ratios are an indicator, among other considerations, of credit risk within the Company&#8217;s loan portfolios. Accruing loans 90 days or more past due totaled $450 million at March 31, 2022, compared with $472 million at December 31, 2021. These balances exclude loans purchased from GNMA mortgage pools whose repayments are primarily insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Accruing loans 90 days or more past due are not included in nonperforming assets and continue to accrue interest because they are adequately secured by collateral, are in the process of collection and are reasonably expected to result in repayment or restoration to current status, or are managed in homogeneous portfolios with specified charge-off

timeframes adhering to regulatory guidelines. The ratio of accruing loans 90 days or more past due to total loans was 0.14 percent at March 31, 2022 compared with 0.15 percent at December 31, 2021.

Restructured Loans

In certain circumstances, the Company may modify the terms of a loan to maximize the collection of amounts due when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties or is expected to experience difficulties in the near-term. In most cases the modification is either a concessionary reduction in interest rate, extension of the maturity date or reduction in the principal balance that would otherwise not be considered. 

Troubled Debt Restructurings

Concessionary modifications are classified as TDRs unless the modification results in only an insignificant delay in the payments to be received. TDRs accrue interest if the borrower complies with the revised terms and conditions and has demonstrated repayment performance at a level commensurate with the modified terms over several payment cycles, which is generally six months or greater. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, performing TDRs were $3.1 billion. 

The Company continues to work with customers to modify loans for borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties. Many of the Company&#8217;s TDRs are determined on a case-by-case

basis in connection with ongoing loan collection processes. The modifications vary within each of the Company&#8217;s loan classes. Commercial lending segment TDRs generally include extensions of the maturity date and may be accompanied by an increase or decrease to the interest rate. The Company may also work with the borrower to make other changes to the loan to mitigate losses, such as obtaining additional collateral and/or guarantees to support the loan. 

The Company has also implemented certain residential mortgage loan restructuring programs that may result in TDRs. The Company modifies residential mortgage loans under Federal Housing Administration, United States Department of Veterans Affairs, and its own internal programs. Under these programs, the Company offers qualifying homeowners the opportunity to permanently modify their loan and achieve more affordable monthly payments by providing loan concessions. These concessions may include adjustments to interest rates, conversion of adjustable rates to fixed rates, extensions of maturity dates or deferrals of payments, capitalization of accrued interest and/or outstanding advances, or in limited situations, partial forgiveness of loan principal. In most instances, participation in residential mortgage loan restructuring programs requires the customer to complete a short-term trial period. A permanent loan modification is contingent on the customer successfully completing the trial period arrangement, and the loan documents are not modified until that time. The Company reports loans in a trial period arrangement as TDRs and continues to report them as TDRs after the trial period. 

Credit card and other retail loan TDRs are generally part of distinct restructuring programs providing customers modification solutions over a specified time period, generally up to 60 months. 

In accordance with regulatory guidance, the Company considers secured consumer loans that have had debt discharged through bankruptcy where the borrower has not reaffirmed the debt to be TDRs. If the loan amount exceeds the collateral value, the loan is charged down to collateral value and the remaining amount is reported as nonperforming. 

&#160;

The following table provides a summary of TDRs by loan class, including the delinquency status for TDRs that continue to accrue interest and TDRs included in nonperforming assets:

Short-term and Other Loan Modifications

The Company makes short-term and other modifications that it does not consider to be TDRs, in limited circumstances, to assist borrowers experiencing temporary hardships, including previously offering payment relief to borrowers that have experienced financial hardship resulting directly from the effects of the COVID-19

pandemic. Short-term consumer lending modification programs include payment reductions, deferrals of up to three past due payments, and the ability to return to current status if the borrower makes required payments. The Company may also make short-term modifications to commercial lending loans, with the most common modification being an extension of the maturity date of three months or less. Such extensions generally are used when the maturity date is imminent and the borrower is experiencing some level of financial stress, but the Company believes the borrower will pay all contractual amounts owed. 

Nonperforming Assets

The level of nonperforming assets represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses. Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, restructured loans not performing in accordance with modified terms and not accruing interest, restructured loans that have not met the performance period required to return to accrual status, other real estate owned (&#8220;OREO&#8221;) and other nonperforming assets owned by the Company. Interest payments collected from assets on nonaccrual status are generally applied against the principal balance and not recorded as income. However, interest income may be recognized for interest payments if the remaining carrying amount of the loan is believed to be collectible. 

At March 31, 2022, total nonperforming assets were $811 million, compared to $878 million at December 31, 2021. The $67 million (7.6 percent) decrease in nonperforming assets was driven by a decrease in nonperforming commercial real estate loans. The ratio of total nonperforming assets to total loans and other real estate was 0.25 percent at March 31, 2022, compared with 0.28 percent at December 31, 2021. 

OREO was $23 million at March 31, 2022, compared with $22 million at December 31, 2021, and was related to foreclosed properties that previously secured loan balances. These balances exclude foreclosed GNMA loans whose repayments are primarily insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.

Analysis of Loan Net Charge-Offs

Total loan net charge-offs were $162 million for the first quarter of 2022, compared with $223 million for the first quarter of 2021. The $61 million (27.4 percent) decrease in net charge-offs reflected improvement across most loan categories, associated with borrower liquidity and strong asset prices in the market that support repayment and recovery on problem loans. The ratio of total loan net charge-offs to average loans outstanding on an annualized basis for the first quarter of 2022 was 0.21 percent, compared with 0.31 percent for the first quarter of 2021. 

Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Credit Losses

The allowance for credit losses is established for current expected credit losses on the Company&#8217;s loan and lease portfolio, including unfunded credit commitments. The allowance considers expected losses for the remaining lives of the applicable assets, inclusive of expected recoveries. The allowance for credit losses is increased through provisions charged to earnings and reduced by net charge-offs. 

Management evaluates the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis. Multiple economic scenarios are considered over a three-year reasonable and supportable forecast period, which includes increasing consideration of historical loss experience over years two and three. These economic scenarios are constructed with interrelated projections of multiple economic variables, and loss estimates are produced that consider the historical correlation of those economic variables with credit losses. After the forecast period, the Company fully reverts to long-term historical loss experience, adjusted for prepayments and characteristics of the current loan and lease portfolio, to estimate losses over the remaining life of the portfolio. The economic scenarios are updated at least quarterly and are designed to provide a range of reasonable estimates from better to worse than current expectations. Scenarios are weighted based on the Company&#8217;s expectation of economic conditions for the foreseeable future and reflect significant judgment and consideration of economic forecast uncertainty. Final loss estimates also consider factors affecting credit losses not reflected in the scenarios, due to the unique aspects of current conditions and expectations. These factors may include, but are not limited to, loan servicing practices, regulatory guidance, and/or fiscal and monetary policy actions. 

Because business processes and credit risks associated with unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as for loans, the Company utilizes similar processes to estimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments, which is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Both the allowance for loan losses and the liability for unfunded credit commitments are included in the Company&#8217;s analysis of credit losses and reported reserve ratios. 

The allowance recorded for credit losses utilizes forward-looking expected loss models to consider a variety of factors affecting lifetime credit losses. These factors include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic variables such as unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels and corporate bond spreads, as well as loan and borrower characteristics, such as internal risk ratings on commercial loans and consumer credit scores, delinquency status, collateral type and available valuation information, consideration of end-of-term

losses on lease residuals, and the remaining

term of the loan, adjusted for expected prepayments. For each loan portfolio, model estimates are adjusted as necessary to consider any relevant changes in portfolio composition, lending policies, underwriting standards, risk management practices, economic conditions or other factors that may affect the accuracy of the model. Expected credit loss estimates also include consideration of expected cash recoveries on loans previously charged-off

or expected recoveries on collateral-dependent loans where recovery is expected through sale of the collateral. Where loans do not exhibit similar risk characteristics, an individual analysis is performed to consider expected credit losses. 

The allowance recorded for individually evaluated loans greater than $5 million in the commercial lending segment is based on an analysis utilizing expected cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate, the observable market price of the loan, or the fair value of the collateral, less selling costs, for collateral-dependent loans as appropriate. For commercial TDRs individually evaluated for impairment, attributes of the borrower are the primary factors in determining the allowance for credit losses. For smaller commercial loans collectively evaluated for impairment, historical loss experience is also incorporated into the allowance methodology applied to this category of loans. 

The allowance recorded for TDR loans in the consumer lending segment is determined on a homogenous pool basis utilizing expected cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate of the pool. The expected cash flows on TDR loans consider subsequent payment defaults since modification, the borrower&#8217;s ability to pay under the restructured terms, and the timing and amount of payments. The allowance for collateral-dependent loans in the consumer lending segment is determined based on the current fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. 

When evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses for any loans and lines in a junior lien position, the Company considers the delinquency and modification status of the first lien. At March 31, 2022, the Company serviced the first lien on 35 percent of the home equity loans and lines in a junior lien position. The Company also considers the status of first lien mortgage accounts reported on customer credit bureau files when the first lien is not serviced by the Company. Regardless of whether the Company services the first lien, an assessment is made of economic conditions, problem loans, recent loss experience and other factors in determining the allowance for credit losses. Based on the available information, the Company estimated $205 million or 2.0 percent of its total home equity portfolio at March 31, 2022, represented non-delinquent

junior liens where the first lien was delinquent or modified. 

The Company considers historical loss experience on the loans and lines in a junior lien position to establish loss estimates for junior lien loans and lines the Company services that are current, but the first lien is delinquent or modified. The historical long-term average loss experience related to junior liens has been relatively limited (less than 1 percent of the total portfolio annually), and estimates are adjusted to consider current collateral support and portfolio risk characteristics. These include updated credit scores and collateral estimates obtained on the Company&#8217;s home equity portfolio each quarter. In its evaluation of the allowance for credit losses, the Company also considers the increased risk of loss associated with home equity lines that are contractually scheduled to convert from a revolving status to a fully amortizing payment. 

When a loan portfolio is purchased, the acquired loans are divided into those considered purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration (&#8220;PCD&#8221;) and those not considered purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration. An allowance is established for each population and considers product mix, risk characteristics of the portfolio, bankruptcy experience, delinquency status and refreshed LTV ratios when possible. The allowance established for purchased loans not considered PCD is recognized through provision expense upon acquisition, whereas the allowance established for loans considered PCD at acquisition is offset by an increase in the basis of the acquired loans. Any subsequent increases and decreases in the allowance related to purchased loans, regardless of PCD status, are recognized through provision expense, with charge-offs charged to the allowance. The Company did not have a material amount of PCD loans included in its loan portfolio at March 31, 2022. 

The Company&#8217;s methodology for determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses also considers the imprecision inherent in the methodologies used and allocated to the various loan portfolios. As a result, amounts determined under the methodologies described above are adjusted by management to consider the potential impact of other qualitative factors not captured in quantitative model adjustments which include, but are not limited to, the following: model imprecision, imprecision in economic scenario assumptions, and emerging risks related to either changes in the economic environment that are affecting specific portfolios, or changes in portfolio concentrations over time that may affect model performance. The consideration of these items results in adjustments to allowance amounts included in the Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses for each loan portfolio.

Although the Company determined the amount of each element of the allowance separately and considers this process to be an important credit management tool, the entire allowance for credit losses is available for the entire loan portfolio. The actual amount of losses can vary significantly from the estimated amounts. 

At March 31, 2022, the allowance for credit losses was $6.1 billion (1.91 percent of period-end

loans), compared with an allowance of $6.2 billion (1.97 percent of period-end

loans) at December 31, 2021. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 798 percent at March 31, 2022, compared with 738 percent at December 31, 2021. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to annualized loan net charge-offs was 929 percent at March 31, 2022, compared with 902 percent of full year 2021 net charge-offs at December 31, 2021. 

The decrease in the allowance for credit losses of $50 million (0.8 percent) at March 31, 2022, compared with December 31, 2021, was driven by continued strong credit quality, partially offset by loan growth and increasing economic uncertainty. Economic uncertainty remains high associated with supply chain and rising inflationary concerns, market volatility, rising oil prices resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and additional virus variants. In addition to these factors, expected loss estimates consider various factors including customer specific information impacting changes in risk ratings, projected delinquencies and the detrimental effects of inflationary pressures and rising interest rates which impact borrowers&#8217; liquidity and ability to repay. 

Economic conditions considered in estimating the allowance for credit losses at March 31, 2022 included changes in projected gross domestic product and unemployment levels. These factors are evaluated through a combination of quantitative calculations using economic scenarios and qualitative assessments that consider the high degree of economic uncertainty in the current environment. 

The following table summarizes the baseline forecast for key economic variables the Company used in its estimate of the allowance for credit losses at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021:

Baseline economic forecasts are used in combination with alternative scenarios and historical loss experience as is considered reasonable and supportable to inform the Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses. 

The allowance for credit losses related to commercial lending segment loans decreased $62 million during the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to portfolio credit quality that reflected further return of economic activity in certain industry sectors affected by the COVID-19

pandemic, partially offset by the impact of loan growth and rising economic uncertainty. 

The allowance for credit losses related to consumer lending segment loans increased $12 million during the first quarter of 2022, mainly due to loan growth and rising economic uncertainty.

Residual Value Risk Management

The Company manages its risk to changes in the residual value of leased vehicles, office and business equipment, and other assets through disciplined residual valuation at the inception of a lease, diversification of its leased assets, regular residual asset valuation reviews and monitoring of residual value gains or losses upon the disposition of assets. As of March 31, 2022, no significant change in the amount of residual values or concentration of the portfolios had occurred since December 31, 2021. Refer to &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis &#8212; Residual Value Risk Management&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2021, for further discussion on residual value risk management. 

Operational Risk Management

The Company operates in many different businesses in diverse markets and relies on the ability of its employees and systems to process a high number of transactions. Operational risk is inherent in all business activities, and the management of this risk is important to the achievement of the Company&#8217;s objectives. Business lines have direct and primary responsibility and accountability for identifying, controlling, and monitoring operational risks embedded in their business activities, including those additional or increased risks created by economic and financial disruptions. The Company maintains a system of controls with the objective of providing proper transaction authorization and execution, proper system operations, proper oversight of third parties with whom it does business, safeguarding of assets from misuse or theft, and ensuring the reliability and security of financial and other data. Refer to &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis &#8212; Operational Risk Management&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2021, for further discussion on operational risk management. 

Compliance Risk Management

The Company may suffer legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, or damage to its reputation through failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, standards of good practice, and codes of conduct, including those related to compliance with Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering requirements, sanctions compliance requirements as administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, consumer protection and other requirements. The Company has controls and processes in place for the assessment, identification, monitoring, management and reporting of compliance risks and issues including those created or increased by economic and financial disruptions. Refer to &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis &#8212; Compliance Risk Management&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2021, for further discussion on compliance risk management. 

Interest Rate Risk Management

In the banking industry, changes in interest rates are a significant risk that can impact earnings and the safety and soundness of an entity. The Company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates through asset and liability management activities within guidelines established by its Asset Liability Management Committee (&#8220;ALCO&#8221;) and approved by the Board of Directors. The ALCO has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with the ALCO management policies, including interest rate risk exposure. One way the Company measures and analyzes its interest rate risk is through net interest income simulation analysis. 

Simulation analysis incorporates substantially all of the Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities and off-balance

sheet instruments, together with forecasted changes in the balance sheet and assumptions that reflect the current interest rate environment. Through this simulation, management estimates the impact on net interest income of various interest rate changes that differ in the direction, amount and speed of change over time, as well as the shape of the yield curve. This simulation includes assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to be affected by changes in loan and deposit growth. Assumptions are made to project interest rates for new loans and deposits based on historical analysis, management&#8217;s outlook and re-pricing

strategies. These assumptions are reviewed and validated on a periodic basis with sensitivity analysis being provided for key variables of the simulation. The results are reviewed monthly by the ALCO and are used to guide asset/liability management strategies. 

The Company manages its interest rate risk position by holding assets with desired interest rate risk characteristics on its balance sheet, implementing certain pricing strategies for loans and deposits and selecting derivatives and various funding and investment portfolio strategies. 

Table 9 summarizes the projected impact to net interest income over the next 12 months of various potential interest rate changes. The sensitivity of the projected impact to net interest income over the next 12 months is dependent on balance sheet growth, product mix, deposit behavior, pricing and funding decisions. While the Company utilizes models and assumptions based on historical information and expected behaviors, actual outcomes could vary significantly. Net interest income sensitivities reflect the impact of current market expectations for interest rates,

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and Other Risks

To manage the sensitivity of earnings and capital to interest rate, prepayment, credit, price and foreign currency fluctuations (asset and liability management positions), the Company enters into derivative transactions. The Company uses derivatives for asset and liability management purposes primarily in the following ways: 

&#8226; &#160; To convert fixed-rate debt and available-for-sale

investment securities from fixed-rate payments to floating-rate payments; 

&#8226; &#160; To convert floating-rate debt from floating-rate payments to fixed-rate payments; 

&#8226; &#160; To mitigate changes in value of the Company&#8217;s unfunded mortgage loan commitments, funded MLHFS and MSRs; 

&#8226; &#160; To mitigate remeasurement volatility of foreign currency denominated balances; and 

&#8226; &#160; To mitigate the volatility of the Company&#8217;s net investment in foreign operations driven by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 

In addition, the Company enters into interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts to support the business requirements of its customers (customer-related positions). The Company minimizes the market and liquidity risks of customer-related positions by either entering into similar offsetting positions with broker-dealers, or on a portfolio basis by entering into other derivative or non-derivative

financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure from these customer-related positions. The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are either exchange-traded, centrally cleared through clearinghouses or over-the-counter.

The Company does not utilize derivatives for speculative purposes. 

The Company does not designate all of the derivatives that it enters into for risk management purposes as accounting hedges because of the inefficiency of applying the accounting requirements and may instead elect fair value accounting for the related hedged items. In particular, the Company enters into interest rate swaps, swaptions, forward commitments to buy to-be-announced

securities (&#8220;TBAs&#8221;), U.S. Treasury and Eurodollar futures and options on U.S. Treasury futures to mitigate fluctuations in the value of its MSRs, but does not designate those derivatives as accounting hedges. 

Additionally, the Company uses forward commitments to sell TBAs and other commitments to sell residential mortgage loans at specified prices to economically hedge the interest rate risk in its residential mortgage loan production activities. At March 31, 2022, the Company had $3.9 billion of forward commitments to sell, hedging $1.4 billion of MLHFS and $3.3 billion of unfunded mortgage loan commitments. The forward commitments to sell and the unfunded mortgage loan commitments on loans intended to be sold are considered derivatives under the accounting guidance related to accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities. The Company has elected the fair value option for the MLHFS. 

Derivatives are subject to credit risk associated with counterparties to the contracts. Credit risk associated with derivatives is measured by the Company based on the probability of counterparty default. The Company manages the credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various counterparties, by entering into master netting arrangements, and, where possible, by requiring collateral arrangements. The Company may also transfer counterparty credit risk related to interest rate swaps to third parties through the use of risk participation agreements. In addition, certain interest rate swaps, interest rate forwards and credit contracts are required to be centrally cleared through clearinghouses to further mitigate counterparty credit risk.

LIBOR Transition

In July 2017, the United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority (the &#8220;FCA&#8221;) announced that it would no longer require banks to submit rates for the London InterBank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;) after 2021. In March 2021, the FCA and the administrator of LIBOR announced that, with respect to the most commonly used tenors of United States Dollar LIBOR, LIBOR will no longer be published on a representative basis after June 30, 2023. The publication of all other tenors of United States Dollar LIBOR ceased to be

&#160;

&#160; U.S. Bancorp 

provided or ceased to be representative after December 31, 2021. The Company holds financial instruments impacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR, including certain loans, investment securities, derivatives, borrowings and other financial instruments that use LIBOR as the benchmark rate. The Company also provides various services to customers in its capacities as trustee and servicer, which involve financial instruments that will be similarly impacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR. 

The Company has transitioned financial instruments associated to LIBOR currencies and tenors that ceased or became nonrepresentative on December 31, 2021 to alternative reference rates, with limited exceptions. The Company also anticipates that additional financial instruments associated to the remaining United States Dollar LIBOR tenors will require transition to a new reference rate by June 30, 2023. The Company is currently assessing the applicability and scope of the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the &#8220;LIBOR Act&#8221;), which was enacted on March 15, 2022. The LIBOR Act establishes a process for replacing LIBOR on existing LIBOR contracts that do not provide for the use of a clearly defined or practicable replacement benchmark rate by providing that a benchmark replacement identified by the Federal Reserve Board that is based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;) will replace LIBOR as the benchmark for such contracts. The final implementation of the LIBOR Act currently remains uncertain, as the Federal Reserve has 180 days after its enactment to issue any regulations that are necessary for its administration. 

In order to facilitate the transition process, the Company has instituted a LIBOR Transition Office and commenced an enterprise-wide project to identify, assess, monitor and mitigate risks associated with the expected discontinuance or unavailability of LIBOR, actively engage with industry working groups and regulators, achieve operational readiness for the use of alternative reference rates and engage impacted customers to remediate and transition impacted instruments. The Company has also invested in updating its systems, models, procedures and internal infrastructure as part of the transition program. Additionally, in alignment with guidance from United States banking agencies and the FCA, the Company has ceased the use of LIBOR as a reference rate in new contracts, with limited exceptions, and continues to increase the usage of alternative reference rates such as SOFR. The Company has also adopted industry best practice guidelines for fallback language for new transactions, converted its cleared interest rate swaps discounting to SOFR discounting, and distributed communications related to the transition to certain impacted parties, both inside and outside the Company. Refer to &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2021, for further discussion on potential risks that could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s financial results as a result of the LIBOR transition. 

Market Risk Management

In addition to interest rate risk, the Company is exposed to other forms of market risk, principally related to trading activities which support customers&#8217; strategies to manage their own foreign currency, interest rate risk and funding activities. For purposes of its internal capital adequacy assessment process, the Company considers risk arising from its trading activities, as well as the remeasurement volatility of foreign currency denominated balances included on its Consolidated Balance Sheet (collectively, &#8220;Covered Positions&#8221;), employing methodologies consistent with the requirements of regulatory rules for market risk. The Company&#8217;s Market Risk Committee (&#8220;MRC&#8221;), within the framework of the ALCO, oversees market risk management. The MRC monitors and reviews the Company&#8217;s Covered Positions and establishes policies for market risk management, including exposure limits for each portfolio. The Company uses a VaR approach to measure general market risk. Theoretically, VaR represents the statistical risk of loss the Company has to adverse market movements over a one-day

time horizon. The Company uses the Historical Simulation method to calculate VaR for its Covered Positions measured at the ninety-ninth percentile using a one-year

look-back period for distributions derived from past market data. The market factors used in the calculations include those pertinent to market risks inherent in the underlying trading portfolios, principally those that affect the Company&#8217;s corporate bond trading business, foreign currency transaction business, client derivatives business, loan trading business and municipal securities business, as well as those inherent in the Company&#8217;s foreign denominated balances and the derivatives used to mitigate the related measurement volatility. On average, the Company expects the one-day

VaR to be exceeded by actual losses two to three times per year related to these positions. The Company monitors the accuracy of internal VaR models and modeling processes by back-testing model performance, regularly updating the historical data used by the VaR models and regular model validations to assess the accuracy of the models&#8217; input, processing, and reporting components. All models are required to be independently reviewed and approved prior to being placed in use. If the Company were to experience market losses in excess of the estimated VaR more often than expected, the VaR models and associated assumptions would be analyzed and adjusted.

The Company did not experience any actual losses for its combined Covered Positions that exceeded VaR during the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company stress tests its market risk measurements to provide management with perspectives on market events that may not be captured by its VaR models, including worst case historical market movement combinations that have not necessarily occurred on the same date. 

The Company calculates Stressed VaR using the same underlying methodology and model as VaR, except that a historical continuous one-year

look-back period is utilized that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate to the Company&#8217;s Covered Positions. The period selected by the Company includes the significant market volatility of the last four months of 2008.

Valuations of positions in client derivatives and foreign currency activities are based on discounted cash flow or other valuation techniques using market-based assumptions. These valuations are compared to third party quotes or other market prices to determine if there are significant variances. Significant variances are approved by senior management in the Company&#8217;s corporate functions. Valuation of positions in the corporate bond trading, loan trading and municipal securities businesses are based on trader marks. These trader marks are evaluated against third-party prices, with significant variances approved by senior management in the Company&#8217;s corporate functions. 

The Company also measures the market risk of its hedging activities related to residential MLHFS and MSRs using the Historical Simulation method. The VaRs are measured at the ninety-ninth percentile and employ factors pertinent to the market risks inherent in the valuation of the assets and hedges. A one-year

look-back period is used to obtain past market data for the models.

Liquidity Risk Management

The Company&#8217;s liquidity risk management process is designed to identify, measure, and manage the Company&#8217;s funding and liquidity risk to meet its daily funding needs and to address expected and unexpected changes in its funding requirements. The Company engages in various activities to manage its liquidity risk. These activities include diversifying its funding sources, stress testing, and holding readily-marketable assets which can be used as a source of liquidity if needed. In addition, the Company&#8217;s profitable operations, sound credit quality and strong capital position have enabled it to develop a large and reliable base of core deposit funding within its market areas and in domestic and global capital markets. 

The Company&#8217;s Board of Directors approves the Company&#8217;s liquidity policy. The Risk Management Committee of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors oversees the Company&#8217;s liquidity risk management process and approves a contingency funding plan. The ALCO reviews the Company&#8217;s liquidity policy and limits, and regularly assesses the Company&#8217;s ability to meet funding requirements arising from adverse company-specific or market events. 

The Company regularly projects its funding needs under various stress scenarios and maintains a contingency funding plan consistent with the Company&#8217;s access to diversified sources of contingent funding. The Company maintains a substantial level of total available liquidity in the form of on-balance

sheet and off-balance

sheet funding sources. These liquidity sources include cash at the Federal Reserve Bank and certain European central banks, unencumbered liquid assets, and capacity to borrow from the FHLB and at the Federal Reserve Bank&#8217;s Discount Window. At March 31, 2022, the fair value of unencumbered investment securities totaled $143.2 billion, compared with $144.0 billion at December 31, 2021. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and &#8220;Balance Sheet 

&#160;

&#160; U.S. Bancorp 

Analysis&#8221; for further information on investment securities maturities and trends. Asset liquidity is further enhanced by the Company&#8217;s practice of pledging loans to access secured borrowing facilities through the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank. At March 31, 2022, the Company could have borrowed a total of an additional $96.3 billion from the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank based on collateral available for additional borrowings. 

The Company&#8217;s diversified deposit base provides a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost

funding, while reducing the Company&#8217;s reliance on the wholesale markets. Total deposits were $461.5 billion at March 31, 2022, compared with $456.1 billion at December 31, 2021. Refer to &#8220;Balance Sheet Analysis&#8221; for further information on the Company&#8217;s deposits. 

Additional funding is provided by long-term debt and short-term borrowings. Long-term debt was $32.9 billion at March 31, 2022, and is an important funding source because of its multi-year borrowing structure. Short-term borrowings were $21.0 billion at March 31, 2022, and supplement the Company&#8217;s other funding sources. Refer to &#8220;Balance Sheet Analysis&#8221; for further information on the Company&#8217;s long-term debt and short-term borrowings. 

In addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis, the Company monitors the parent company&#8217;s liquidity. The Company establishes limits for the minimal number of months into the future where the parent company can meet existing and forecasted obligations with cash and securities held that can be readily monetized. The Company measures and manages this limit in both normal and adverse conditions. The Company maintains sufficient funding to meet expected capital and debt service obligations for 24 months without the support of dividends from subsidiaries and assuming access to the wholesale markets is maintained. The Company maintains sufficient liquidity to meet its capital and debt service obligations for 12 months under adverse conditions without the support of dividends from subsidiaries or access to the wholesale markets. The parent company is currently well in excess of required liquidity minimums. 

At March 31, 2022, parent company long-term debt outstanding was $19.8 billion, compared with $18.9 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to $2.1 billion of medium-term note issuances, partially offset by $1.0 billion of medium-term note repayments. As of March 31, 2022, there was $1.3 billion of parent company debt scheduled to mature in the remainder of 2022. 

The Company is subject to a regulatory Liquidity Coverage Ratio (&#8220;LCR&#8221;) requirement which requires banks to maintain an adequate level of unencumbered high quality liquid assets to meet estimated liquidity needs over a 30-day

stressed period. At March 31, 2022, the Company was compliant with this requirement. 

The Company is also subject to a regulatory Net Stable Funding Ratio (&#8220;NSFR&#8221;) requirement which requires banks to maintain a minimum level of stable funding based on the liquidity characteristics of their assets, commitments, and derivative exposures over a one-year

time horizon. At March 31, 2022, the Company was compliant with this requirement. 

Refer to &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis &#8212; Liquidity Risk Management&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2021, for further discussion on liquidity risk management. 

European Exposures

The Company provides merchant processing and corporate trust services in Europe either directly or through banking affiliations in Europe. Revenue generated from sources in Europe represented approximately 2 percent of the Company&#8217;s total net revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2022. Operating cash for these businesses is deposited on a short-term basis typically with certain European central banks. For deposits placed at other European banks, exposure is mitigated by the Company placing deposits at multiple banks and managing the amounts on deposit at any bank based on institution-specific deposit limits. At March 31, 2022, the Company had an aggregate amount on deposit with European banks of approximately $8.3 billion, predominately with the Central Bank of Ireland and Bank of England. 

In addition, the Company provides financing to domestic multinational corporations that generate revenue from customers in European countries, transacts with various European banks as counterparties to certain derivative-related activities, and through a subsidiary, manages money market funds that hold certain investments in European sovereign debt. Any deterioration in economic conditions in Europe, including the impacts resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, is not expected to have a significant effect on the Company related to these activities. 

Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Other Contractual Obligations

The Company participates in many different contractual arrangements which may or may not be recorded on its balance sheet, with unrelated or consolidated entities, under which the Company has an obligation to pay certain amounts, provide credit or liquidity enhancements or provide market risk support. These arrangements include commitments to extend credit, letters of credit and various forms of guarantees. Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on guarantees and contingent liabilities. These arrangements also include any obligation related to a variable interest held in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, credit enhancement or market risk support. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Company&#8217;s interests in variable interest entities.

Capital Management

The Company is committed to managing capital to maintain strong protection for depositors and creditors and for maximum shareholder benefit. The Company also manages its capital to exceed regulatory capital requirements for banking organizations. The regulatory capital requirements effective for the Company follow Basel III, with the Company being subject to calculating its capital adequacy as a percentage of risk-weighted assets under the standardized approach. Beginning in 2022, the Company began to phase into its regulatory capital requirements the cumulative deferred impact of its 2020 adoption of the accounting guidance related to the impairment of financial instruments based on the current expected credit losses (&#8220;CECL&#8221;) methodology plus 25 percent of its quarterly credit reserve increases over the past two years. This cumulative deferred impact will be phased into the Company&#8217;s regulatory capital over the next three years, culminating with a fully phased in regulatory capital calculation beginning in 2025. Table 10 provides a summary of statutory regulatory capital ratios in effect for the Company at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. All regulatory ratios exceeded regulatory &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; requirements. 

The Company believes certain other capital ratios are useful in evaluating its capital adequacy. The Company&#8217;s tangible common equity, as a percent of tangible assets and as a percent of risk-weighted assets determined in accordance with transitional regulatory capital requirements related to the CECL methodology under the standardized approach, was 6.0 percent and 8.0 percent, respectively, at March 31, 2022, compared with 6.8 percent and 9.2 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2021. In addition, the Company&#8217;s common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio, reflecting the full implementation of the CECL methodology was 9.5 percent at March 31, 2022, compared with 9.6 percent at December 31, 2021. Refer to &#8220;Non-GAAP

Financial Measures&#8221; beginning on page 30 for further information on these other capital ratios. 

Total U.S. Bancorp shareholders&#8217; equity was $51.2 billion at March 31, 2022, compared with $54.9 billion at December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily the result of changes in unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale

investment securities included in other comprehensive income (loss) and dividends, partially offset by corporate earnings and the issuance of preferred stock. 

The Company announced on December 22, 2020 that its Board of Directors had approved an authorization to repurchase $3.0 billion of its common stock beginning January 1, 2021, and repurchased $1.5 billion of its common stock during the first six months of 2021 under this program. The Company suspended all common stock repurchases at the beginning of the third quarter of 2021, except for those done exclusively in connection with its stock-based compensation programs, due to its pending acquisition of MUFG Union Bank&#8217;s core regional banking franchise. The Company expects to operate at a common equity tier 1 capital ratio between its target ratio of 8.5 percent and 9.0 percent after closing of the acquisition. The Company does not expect to commence repurchasing its common stock until after the acquisition closes and its common equity tier 1 capital ratio approximates 9.0 percent.

LINE OF BUSINESS FINANCIAL REVIEW 

The Company&#8217;s major lines of business are Corporate and Commercial Banking, Consumer and Business Banking, Wealth Management and Investment Services, Payment Services, and Treasury and Corporate Support. These operating segments are components of the Company about which financial information is prepared and is evaluated regularly by management in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. 

Basis for Financial Presentation

Business line results are derived from the Company&#8217;s business unit profitability reporting systems by specifically attributing managed balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related income or expense. Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the business lines&#8217; basis for financial presentation. 

Designations, assignments and allocations change from time to time as management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating performance or product lines change or business segments are realigned to better respond to the Company&#8217;s diverse customer base. During 2022, certain organization and methodology changes were made and, accordingly, 2021 results were restated and presented on a comparable basis. 

Corporate and Commercial Banking

Corporate and Commercial Banking offers lending, equipment finance and small-ticket leasing, depository services, treasury management, capital markets services, international trade services and other financial services to middle market, large corporate, commercial real estate, financial institution, non-profit

and public sector clients. Corporate and Commercial Banking contributed $418 million of the Company&#8217;s net income in the first quarter of 2022, or a decrease of $51 million (10.9 percent) compared with the first quarter of 2021. 

Net revenue decreased $7 million (0.7 percent) in the first quarter of 2022, compared with the first quarter of 2021. Noninterest income decreased $23 million (8.6 percent) in the first quarter of 2022, compared with the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to lower corporate bond fees and trading revenue within the capital markets business, partially offset by stronger treasury management fees due to core growth driven by the economic recovery. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, increased $16 million (2.2 percent) in the first quarter of 2022, compared with the first quarter of 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher loan and deposit balances, partially offset by the impact of loan mix and related yields as well as unfavorable changes in deposit rates. 

Noninterest expense increased $10 million (2.4 percent) in the first quarter of 2022, compared with the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to an increase in net shared services expense driven by investment in infrastructure and technology development as well as higher compensation expense primarily due to merit increases and hiring to support business growth, partially offset by lower performance-based incentives related to capital markets activity. The provision for credit losses increased $51 million in the first quarter of 2022, compared with the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to loan loss provisions supporting stronger growth in loan balances, partially offset by improving portfolio credit quality. 

Consumer and Business Banking

Consumer and Business Banking delivers products and services through banking offices, telephone servicing and sales, on-line

services, direct mail, ATM processing and mobile devices. It encompasses community banking, metropolitan banking and indirect lending, as well as mortgage banking. Consumer and Business Banking contributed $393 million of the Company&#8217;s net income in the first quarter of 2022, or a decrease of $182 million (31.7 percent) compared with the first quarter of 2021. 

Net revenue decreased $96 million (4.6 percent) in the first quarter of 2022, compared with the first quarter of 2021. Noninterest income decreased $108 million (19.0 percent) in the first quarter of 2022, compared with the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to lower mortgage banking revenue reflecting lower application volume, given declining refinance activities, and lower related gain on sale margins, partially offset by an increase in the fair value of MSRs, net of hedging activities, as well as higher performing loan sales. Noninterest income further decreased due to lower other noninterest income, driven by lower retail leasing end-of-term

residual gains. Offsetting these decreases, deposit service charges increased driven by higher customer spend activity, net of the impact of the elimination of certain consumer non-sufficient

funds fees in the first quarter of 2022. Net interest income, on a 

&#160;

U.S. Bancorp &#160; 27

taxable-equivalent basis, increased $12 million (0.8 percent) in the first quarter of 2022, compared with the first quarter of 2021, reflecting strong growth in interest-bearing deposit balances and favorable funding mix, partially offset by lower loan fees related to the SBA Paycheck Protection Program. 

Noninterest expense increased $61 million (4.5 percent) in the first quarter of 2022, compared with the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to increases in net shared services expense due to investments in digital capabilities and higher compensation expense related to merit increases and core business growth. The provision for credit losses increased $86 million in the first quarter of 2022, compared with the first quarter of 2021, reflecting higher ending loan balances, partially offset by credit quality improvement.

Wealth Management and Investment Services provides private banking, financial advisory services, investment management, retail brokerage services, insurance, trust, custody and fund servicing through four businesses: Wealth Management, Global Corporate Trust &#38; Custody, U.S. Bancorp Asset Management and Fund Services. Wealth Management and Investment Services contributed $206 million of the Company&#8217;s net income in the first quarter of 2022, or a decrease of $19 million (8.4 percent) compared with the first quarter of 2021. 

Net revenue increased $71 million (8.9 percent) in the first quarter of 2022, compared with the first quarter of 2021. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, increased $6 million (2.2 percent) in the first quarter of 2022, compared with the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to higher average noninterest-bearing deposit balances as well as higher average loan balances. Noninterest income increased $65 million (12.2 percent) in the first quarter of 2022, compared with the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to core business growth in trust and investment management fees and investment products fees, both driven by favorable market conditions, as well as the impact of the PFM acquisition on trust and investment management fees, partially offset by higher fee waivers related to money market funds. 

Noninterest expense increased $93 million (18.8 percent) in the first quarter of 2022, compared with the first quarter of 2021, reflecting the PFM acquisition, higher compensation expense as a result of merit increases and performance-based incentives, litigation settlements, fraud-related losses and core business growth. The provision for credit losses increased $3 million (60.0 percent) in the first quarter of 2022, compared with the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to stronger growth in ending loans. 

Payment Services

Payment Services includes consumer and business credit cards, stored-value cards, debit cards, corporate, government and purchasing card services, consumer lines of credit and merchant processing. Payment Services contributed $372 million of the Company&#8217;s net income in the first quarter of 2022, or a decrease of $115 million (23.6 percent) compared with the first quarter of 2021. 

Net revenue increased $66 million (4.7 percent) in the first quarter of 2022, compared with the first quarter of 2021. Noninterest income increased $73 million (9.3 percent) in the first quarter of 2022, compared with the first quarter of 2021, mainly due to continued strengthening of consumer and business spending across most sectors as local jurisdictions reduce pandemic related restrictions and consumer behaviors normalize. As a result, there was strong growth in merchant processing services revenue driven by higher sales volume and higher merchant fees, partially offset by higher rebates. There was also growth in corporate payment products revenue driven by improving business spending across nearly all product groups. Strong sales also drove an increase in credit and debit card revenue, mostly offset by declining prepaid processing fees as the beneficial impact of government stimulus programs continues to dissipate. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, decreased $7 million (1.1 percent) in the first quarter of 2022, compared with the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to lower loan yields driven by declining customer revolve rates, mostly offset by higher loan balances due to investment in customer acquisition. 

Noninterest expense increased $49 million (6.1 percent) in the first quarter of 2022, compared with the first quarter of 2021, reflecting higher net shared services expense driven by investment in infrastructure and technology development in addition to higher compensation expense as a result of merit increases, performance-based incentives and core business growth. The provision for credit losses increased $171 million in the first quarter of 2022, compared with the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to ending loan balance growth and relatively stable credit quality in the first quarter of 2022, compared with a decline in loan balances and delinquencies in the prior year.

Treasury and Corporate Support

Treasury and Corporate Support includes the Company&#8217;s investment portfolios, funding, capital management, interest rate risk management, income taxes not allocated to the business lines, including most investments in tax-advantaged

projects, and the residual aggregate of those expenses associated with corporate activities that are managed on a consolidated basis. Treasury and Corporate Support recorded net income of $168 million in the first quarter of 2022, compared with $524 million in the first quarter of 2021. 

Net revenue increased $92 million (46.9 percent) in the first quarter of 2022, compared with the first quarter of 2021. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, increased $84 million in the first quarter of 2022, compared with the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to higher investment securities portfolio balances. Noninterest income increased $8 million (3.5 percent) in the first quarter of 2022, compared with the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to the impact of COVID-related deposit service charges refunds in the first quarter of 2021. 

Noninterest expense decreased $90 million (27.5 percent) in the first quarter of 2022, compared with the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to lower performance-based incentives and lower costs related to tax-advantaged

investments, partially offset by higher costs of capital investments to support business growth and compensation expense as a result of merit increases. The provision for credit losses increased $628 million (89.0 percent) in the first quarter of 2022, compared with the first quarter of 2021, reflecting the residual impact of changes in the allowance for credit losses being impacted by rising economic uncertainty in the first quarter of 2022, compared to improving economic conditions in the first quarter of 2021. 

Income taxes are assessed to each line of business at a managerial tax rate of 25.0 percent with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included in Treasury and Corporate Support. 

NON-GAAP

FINANCIAL MEASURES 

In addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the Company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including: 

&#8226; &#160; Tangible common equity to tangible assets, 

&#8226; &#160; Tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets, and 

&#8226; &#160; Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, reflecting the full implementation of the CECL methodology. 

These capital measures are viewed by management as useful additional methods of evaluating the Company&#8217;s utilization of its capital held and the level of capital available to withstand unexpected negative market or economic conditions. Additionally, presentation of these measures allows investors, analysts and banking regulators to assess the Company&#8217;s capital position relative to other financial services companies. These capital measures are not defined in generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;), or are not currently effective or defined in banking regulations. In addition, certain of these measures differ from currently effective capital ratios defined by banking regulations principally in that the currently effective ratios, which are subject to certain transitional provisions, temporarily exclude the impact of the 2020 adoption of accounting guidance related to impairment of financial instruments based on the CECL methodology. As a result, these capital measures disclosed by the Company may be considered non-GAAP

financial measures. Management believes this information helps investors assess trends in the Company&#8217;s capital adequacy. 

The Company also discloses net interest income and related ratios and analysis on a taxable-equivalent basis, which may also be considered non-GAAP

financial measures. The Company believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt

sources. In addition, certain performance measures, including the efficiency ratio and net interest margin utilize net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis. 

There may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, the Company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this report in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The accounting and reporting policies of the Company comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and conform to general practices within the banking industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions. The Company&#8217;s financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions, which are integral to understanding the Company&#8217;s financial statements. Critical accounting policies are those policies management believes are the most important to the portrayal of the Company&#8217;s financial condition and results, and require management to make estimates that are difficult, subjective or complex. Most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies. Management has discussed the development and the selection of critical accounting policies with the Company&#8217;s Audit Committee. Those policies considered to be critical accounting policies relate to the allowance for credit losses, fair value estimates, MSRs, and income taxes. These accounting policies are discussed in detail in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis &#8212; Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2021.
