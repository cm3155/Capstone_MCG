Management’s Discussion and Analysis
OVERVIEW
Earnings Summary U.S. Bancorp and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) reported net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp of $1.8 billion for the third quarter of
2022, or $1.16 per diluted common share, compared with $2.0 billion, or $1.30 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2021. Return on average assets
and return on average common equity were 1.22 percent and 15.8 percent, respectively, for the third quarter of 2022, compared with 1.45 percent and
15.9 percent, respectively, for the third quarter of 2021. The results for the third quarter of 2022 included the impact of $42 million ($33 million net-of-tax) of
merger and integration-related charges associated with the planned acquisition of MUFG Union Bank’s core regional banking franchise from Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group, Inc. (“MUFG”), which decreased diluted earnings per common share by $0.02.
Total net revenue for the third quarter of 2022 was $436 million (7.4 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2021, reflecting a 20.7 percent increase in
net interest income (20.6 percent on a taxable-equivalent basis) and an 8.3 percent decrease in noninterest income. The increase in net interest income from the
third quarter of 2021 was due to the impact of rising interest rates on earning assets and strong growth in average loan and investment securities balances,
partially offset by deposit pricing, changes in funding mix and lower loan fees driven by the impact of loan forgiveness related to the Small Business
Administration (“SBA”) Paycheck Protection Program in the third quarter of 2021. The reduction in noninterest income reflected lower mortgage banking
revenue driven by a decline in refinancing activities, partially offset by higher trust and investment management fees and payment services revenue.
Noninterest expense in the third quarter of 2022 was $208 million (6.1 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2021, reflecting increases in compensation
expense, employee benefits expense, marketing and business development expense, net occupancy and equipment expense and other noninterest expense, as
well as the impact of merger and integration-related charges of $42 million.
The provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2022 was $362 million, compared with a benefit of $163 million for the third quarter of 2021. The
provision for credit losses in the third quarter of 2022 reflected the impact of strong loan growth and increasing economic uncertainty. The provision for credit
losses for the third quarter of 2021 reflected a decrease in the allowance for credit losses as a result of improving economic conditions and credit quality. Net
charge-offs in the third quarter of 2022 were $162 million, compared with $147 million in the third quarter of 2021. Refer to “Corporate Risk Profile” for further
information on the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs, nonperforming assets and other factors considered by the Company in assessing the credit quality
of the loan portfolio and establishing the allowance for credit losses.
Net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp for the first nine months of 2022 was $4.9 billion, or $3.13 per diluted common share, compared with
$6.3 billion, or $4.04 per diluted common share, for the first nine months of 2021. Return on average assets and return on average common equity were
1.13 percent and 14.1 percent, respectively, for the first nine months of 2022, compared with 1.53 percent and 17.0 percent, respectively, for the first nine
months of 2021. The results for the first nine months of 2022 included the impact of $239 million ($186 million net-of-tax) of merger and integration-related
charges, which decreased diluted earnings per common share by $0.12.
Total net revenue for the first nine months of 2022 was $791 million (4.6 percent) higher than the first nine months of 2021, reflecting an 11.4 percent
increase in net interest income (11.3 percent on a taxable-equivalent basis) and a 3.6 percent decrease in noninterest income. The increase in net interest income
from the first nine months of 2021 was due to the impact of rising interest rates on earning assets and strong growth in average loan and investment securities
balances, partially offset by deposit pricing, changes in funding mix and lower loan fees driven by the impact of loan forgiveness related to the SBA Paycheck
Protection Program in the first nine months of 2021. The reduction in noninterest income reflected lower mortgage banking revenue and other noninterest
income, partially offset by higher trust and investment management fees and payment services revenue.
Noninterest expense in the first nine months of 2022 was $668 million (6.6 percent) higher than the first nine months of 2021, reflecting increases in

compensation expense, employee benefits expense, marketing and business development expense, net occupancy and equipment expense and other noninterest
expense, as well as the impact of merger and integration-related charges of $239 million.
The provision for credit losses for the first nine months of 2022 was $785 million, compared with a benefit of $1.2 billion for the first nine months of
2021. The provision for credit losses for the first nine months of 2022 reflected the impact of strong loan growth and increasing economic uncertainty. The
provision for credit losses for the first nine months of 2021 reflected a decrease in the allowance for credit losses as a result of improving economic conditions
and credit quality. Net charge-offs in the first nine months of 2022 were $485 million, compared with $550 million in the first nine months of 2021. Refer to
“Corporate Risk Profile” for further information on the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs, nonperforming assets and other factors considered by the
Company in assessing the credit quality of the loan portfolio and establishing the allowance for credit losses.
Pending Acquisition In September 2021, the Company announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire MUFG Union Bank’s core regional
banking franchise, for an expected purchase price of approximately $8.0 billion, including $5.5 billion in cash and approximately 44 million shares of the
Company’s common stock. The transaction excludes the purchase of substantially all of MUFG Union Bank’s Global Corporate & Investment Bank (other than
certain deposits), certain middle and back office functions, and other assets. MUFG Union Bank has approximately 300 branches in California, Washington and
Oregon and is expected to add approximately $105 billion in total assets, $58 billion of loans and $90 billion of deposits to the Company’s consolidated balance
sheet. On October 19, 2022, the Company announced that all required regulatory approvals to complete the transaction have been received. The transaction is
expected to close on December 1, 2022, pending satisfaction of customary closing conditions.
STATEMENT OF INCOME ANALYSIS
Net Interest Income Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, was $3.9 billion in the third quarter and $10.5 billion in the first nine months of 2022,
representing increases of $660 million (20.6 percent) and $1.1 billion (11.3 percent), respectively, compared with the same periods of 2021. The increases were
primarily due to the impact of rising interest rates on earning assets and strong growth in loan and investment securities balances, partially offset by deposit
pricing, changes in funding mix, and lower loan fees driven by the impact of loan forgiveness related to the SBA Paycheck Protection Program in the first
nine months of 2021. Average earning assets for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 were $38.3 billion (7.6 percent) and $35.5 billion (7.1 percent)
higher, respectively, than the same periods of the prior year, reflecting increases in loans and investment securities, partially offset by decreases in interestbearing deposits with banks. The net interest margin, on a taxable-equivalent basis, in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 was 2.83 percent and
2.62 percent, respectively, compared with 2.53 percent and 2.52 percent in the third quarter and first nine months of 2021, respectively. The increase in net
interest margin from the prior year was primarily due to the impact of higher rates on earning assets, partially offset by deposit pricing and short-term borrowing
costs given the rise in short-term interest rates. Refer to the “Consolidated Daily Average Balance Sheet and Related Yields and Rates” table for further
information on net interest income.
Average total loans in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 were $40.0 billion (13.5 percent) and $29.7 billion (10.1 percent) higher,
respectively, than the same periods of 2021. The increases were primarily due to growth in commercial loans, residential mortgages and credit card loans. The
increase in commercial loans was primarily due to higher utilization driven by working capital needs of corporate customers, slower payoffs given higher
volatility in the capital markets, as well as core growth, partially offset by expected reductions related to the forgiveness of loans in the SBA Paycheck
Protection Program. The increase in residential mortgages was driven by stronger on-balance sheet loan activities and slower refinance activity, while the
increase in credit cards loans was primarily due to increased consumer spending and account growth. In addition, other retail loans increased in the first nine
months of 2022, compared with the first nine months of 2021, driven by higher auto and recreational vehicle loans, partially offset by lower retail leasing
balances.
Average investment securities in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 were $13.1 billion (8.6 percent) and $17.6 billion (11.5 percent) higher,
respectively, than the same periods of 2021, primarily due to purchases of mortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury securities, net of prepayments, sales and
maturities.
Average total deposits for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 were $25.3 billion (5.9 percent) and $26.8 billion (6.2 percent) higher,
respectively, than the same periods of 2021. Average total savings deposits for
U.S. Bancorp 5
Table of Contents
the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 were $27.6 billion (9.9 percent) and $26.0 billion (9.3 percent) higher, respectively, than the same periods of the
prior year, driven by increases in Corporate and Commercial Banking, and Consumer and Business Banking balances. The increase in total savings deposits for
the first nine months of 2022, compared with the first nine months of 2021, was partially offset by a decrease in Wealth Management and Investment Services
balances. Average time deposits for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 were $12.7 billion (54.0 percent) and $4.2 billion (16.8 percent) higher,
respectively, than the same periods of the prior year, primarily driven by increases in Corporate and Commercial Banking balances, partially offset by decreases
in Consumer and Business Banking balances. Changes in time deposits are primarily related to those deposits managed as an alternative to other funding
sources, based largely on relative pricing and liquidity characteristics. Average noninterest-bearing deposits for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022
were $15.0 billion (11.6 percent) and $3.4 billion (2.7 percent) lower, respectively, than the same periods of the prior year, driven by decreases in Corporate and
Commercial Banking, Consumer and Business Banking, and Payment Services balances. The decrease in average noninterest-bearing deposits in the first nine
months of 2022, compared with the first nine months of 2021, was partially offset by an increase in Wealth Management and Investment Services balances.
Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses was $362 million in the third quarter and $785 million in the first nine months of 2022, compared
with a benefit of $163 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, for the same periods of 2021. The provision for credit losses in the third quarter and first nine
months of 2022 reflected the impact of strong loan growth and increasing economic uncertainty. The provision for credit losses in the third quarter and first
nine months of 2021 reflected the enactment of additional government stimulus programs and widespread COVID-19 vaccine availability, contributing to
economic improvement during the period, which resulted in significant decreases in the allowance for credit losses. Net charge-offs increased $15 million (10.2
percent) in the third quarter of 2022, compared with the third quarter of 2021, reflecting higher commercial, credit card and other retail loan net charge-offs,
partially offset by a decrease in commercial real estate loan charge-offs. Net charge-offs decreased $65 million (11.8 percent) in the first nine months of 2022,
compared with the first nine months of 2021, primarily driven by lower credit card net charge-offs in the first nine months of 2022. Refer to “Corporate Risk
Profile” for further information on the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs, nonperforming assets and other factors considered by the Company in
assessing the credit quality of the loan portfolio and establishing the allowance for credit losses.
Noninterest Income Noninterest income was $2.5 billion in the third quarter and $7.4 billion in the first nine months of 2022, representing decreases of
$224 million (8.3 percent) and $280 million (3.6 percent), respectively, compared with the same periods of 2021. The decreases from the prior year reflected
lower mortgage banking revenue, lower deposit service charges and lower gains on the sale of securities, partially offset by higher trust and investment
management fees and payment services revenue. Mortgage banking revenue decreased primarily due to lower application volume, given declining refinance
activities experienced in the mortgage industry, lower related gain on sale margins and lower performing loan sales. The decrease in mortgage banking revenue
in the first nine months of 2022, compared with the first nine months of 2021, was partially offset by increases in mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”)
valuations, net of hedging activities. Deposit service charges decreased primarily due to the impact of the elimination of certain consumer non-sufficient funds
fees beginning in the first quarter of 2022. Trust and investment management fees increased primarily due to lower money market fee waivers, activity related to
the fourth quarter of 2021 acquisition of PFM Asset Management LLC (“PFM”) and core business growth, partially offset by unfavorable market conditions.
Payment services revenue increased as a result of higher corporate payment products revenue due to improving business spending across all product groups, as
well as increases in merchant processing services revenue driven by higher sales volume and merchant fees. The increases in merchant processing services
revenue were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency rate changes, as the U.S. dollar has strengthened considerably compared to European currencies
given recent uncertainties in Europe. Other noninterest income decreased in the first nine months of 2022, compared with the first nine months of 2021,
primarily due to lower retail leasing end-of-term residual gains.

$208 million (6.1 percent) and $668 million (6.6 percent), respectively, over the same periods of 2021. The increases from the prior year reflected higher
compensation expense, employee benefits expense, marketing and business development expense, net occupancy and equipment expense, other noninterest
expense and the impact of merger and integration-related charges associated with the planned acquisition of MUFG Union Bank. Compensation expense
increased primarily due to merit increases and hiring to support business growth, partially offset by lower performance-based incentives and variable
compensation. Employee benefits expense increased primarily driven by higher post-pandemic medical expenses. Marketing and business development expense
increased due to the timing of marketing campaigns as well as increased travel and entertainment, while net occupancy and equipment expense increased to
support business growth. Other noninterest expense increased due to accruals related to future delivery exposures for merchant and airline processing as
processing volumes recover, higher Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance expense driven by an increase in the assessment base and rate,
and higher other accruals, partially offset by lower other expenses related to the decline in mortgage production.
Income Tax Expense The provision for income taxes was $481 million (an effective rate of 20.9 percent) for the third quarter and $1.3 billion (an effective rate
of 20.8 percent) for the first nine months of 2022, compared with $564 million (an effective rate of 21.7 percent) and $1.7 billion (an effective rate of 21.4
percent) for the same periods of 2021, respectively. For further information on income taxes, refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS
Loans The Company’s loan portfolio was $342.7 billion at September 30, 2022, compared with $312.0 billion at December 31, 2021, an increase of
$30.7 billion (9.8 percent). The increase was driven by higher commercial loans, residential mortgages, credit card loans and commercial real estate loans,
partially offset by lower other retail loans.
Commercial loans increased $19.7 billion (17.6 percent) at September 30, 2022, compared with December 31, 2021, due to higher utilization driven by
working capital needs of corporate customers and slower payoffs given higher volatility in the capital markets, as well as core growth.
Residential mortgages held in the loan portfolio increased $9.8 billion (12.8 percent) at September 30, 2022, compared with December 31, 2021, due to
stronger on-balance sheet loan activities and slower refinance activity. Residential mortgages originated and placed in the Company’s loan portfolio include
jumbo mortgages and branch-originated first lien home equity loans to borrowers with high credit quality.
Credit card loans increased $2.0 billion (9.1 percent) at September 30, 2022, compared with December 31, 2021, reflecting increased consumer spending
and account growth.
Commercial real estate loans increased $1.3 billion (3.3 percent) at September 30, 2022, compared with December 31, 2021, primarily the result of new
originations.
Other retail loans decreased $2.1 billion (3.4 percent) at September 30, 2022, compared with December 31, 2021, due to decreases in auto loans and retail
leasing balances, partially offset by an increase in home equity loans.
The Company generally retains portfolio loans through maturity; however, the Company’s intent may change over time based upon various factors such
as ongoing asset/liability management activities, assessment of product profitability, credit risk, liquidity needs, and capital implications. If the Company’s intent
or ability to hold an existing portfolio loan changes, it is transferred to loans held for sale.
Loans Held for Sale Loans held for sale, consisting primarily of residential mortgages to be sold in the secondary market, were $3.6 billion at September 30,
2022, compared with $7.8 billion at December 31, 2021. The decrease in loans held for sale was principally due to a lower level of mortgage loan closings in the
third quarter of 2022, compared with the fourth quarter of 2021. Almost all of the residential mortgage loans the Company originates or purchases for sale
follow guidelines that allow the loans to be sold into existing, highly liquid secondary markets, in particular in government agency transactions and to
government-sponsored enterprises (“GSEs”).

Investment Securities Investment securities totaled $154.1 billion at September 30, 2022, compared with $174.8 billion at December 31, 2021. The $20.7 billion
(11.9 percent) decrease was primarily due to a $14.1 billion unfavorable change in net unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale investment securities and
$5.6 billion of net investment paydowns, maturities and sales. During the first nine months of 2022, the Company transferred $45.1 billion amortized cost
($40.7 billion fair value) of available-for-sale investment securities to the held-to-maturity category to reflect its new intent for these securities.
The Company’s available-for-sale investment securities are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in other comprehensive income (loss)
unless a portion of a security’s unrealized loss is related to credit and an allowance for credit losses is necessary. At September 30, 2022, the Company’s net
unrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities were $9.2 billion, compared with $722 million of net unrealized gains at December 31, 2021. The
unfavorable change in net unrealized gains (losses) was primarily due to decreases in the fair value of mortgage-backed, U.S. Treasury and state and political
securities as a result of changes in interest rates, partially offset by the impact of the transfer of available-for-sale investment securities to the held-to-maturity
category. Gross unrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities totaled $9.2 billion at September 30, 2022, compared with $812 million at
December 31, 2021. At September 30, 2022, the Company had no plans to sell securities with unrealized losses, and believed it is more likely than not that it
would not be required to sell such securities before recovery of their amortized cost.
Refer to Notes 4 and 15 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on investment securities.
Deposits Total deposits were $471.1 billion at September 30, 2022, compared with $456.1 billion at December 31, 2021. The $15.0 billion (3.3 percent) increase
in total deposits reflected increases in time deposits and total savings deposits, partially offset by a decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits. Time deposits
increased $19.8 billion (87.3 percent) at September 30, 2022, compared with December 31, 2021, driven by higher Corporate and Commercial Banking
balances, partially offset by lower Consumer and Business Banking balances. Changes in time deposits are primarily related to those deposits managed as an
alternative to other funding sources, based largely on relative pricing and liquidity characteristics. Money market deposit balances increased $11.6 billion
(9.9 percent) at September 30, 2022, compared with December 31, 2021, primarily due to higher Wealth Management and Investment Services, and Corporate
and Commercial Banking balances. Interest checking balances increased $2.1 billion (1.8 percent), primarily due to higher Corporate and Commercial Banking,
and Consumer and Business Banking balances, partially offset by lower Wealth Management and Investment Services balances. Savings account balances
increased $1.3 billion (1.9 percent), driven by higher Consumer and Business Banking balances. Noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $19.7 billion
(14.6 percent) at September 30, 2022, compared with December 31, 2021, primarily due to lower Corporate and Commercial Banking, and Wealth Management
and Investment Services balances.
Borrowings The Company utilizes both short-term and long-term borrowings as part of its asset/liability management and funding strategies. Short-term
borrowings, which include federal funds purchased, commercial paper, repurchase agreements, borrowings secured by high-grade assets and other short-term
borrowings, were $25.1 billion at September 30, 2022, compared with $11.8 billion at December 31, 2021. The $13.3 billion increase in short-term borrowings
was primarily due to increases in short-term Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances and commercial paper balances. Long-term debt was $32.2 billion at
September 30, 2022, compared with $32.1 billion at December 31, 2021. The $103 million (0.3 percent) increase was primarily due to $3.9 billion of mediumterm note, $1.3 billion of subordinated note and $324 million of bank note issuances, partially offset by $2.6 billion of bank note repayments and maturities,
$1.3 billion of subordinated note repayments and $1.0 billion of medium-term note repayments. Refer to the “Liquidity Risk Management” section for
discussion of liquidity management of the Company.
CORPORATE RISK PROFILE
Overview Managing risks is an essential part of successfully operating a financial services company. The Company’s Board of Directors has approved a risk
management framework which establishes governance and risk management requirements for all risk-taking activities. This framework includes Company and
business line risk appetite statements which set boundaries for the types and amount of risk that may be undertaken in pursuing business objectives and
initiatives. The Board of Directors, primarily through its Risk Management Committee, oversees performance relative to the risk management framework, risk
appetite statements, and other policy requirements.
U.S. Bancorp 9
Table of Contents
The Executive Risk Committee (“ERC”), which is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer and includes the Chief Executive Officer and other members of the
executive management team, oversees execution against the risk management framework and risk appetite statements. The ERC focuses on current and
emerging risks, including strategic and reputation risks, by directing timely and comprehensive actions. Senior operating committees have also been established,
each responsible for overseeing a specified category of risk.
The Company’s most prominent risk exposures are credit, interest rate, market, liquidity, operational, compliance, strategic, and reputation. Credit risk is
the risk of loss associated with a change in the credit profile or the failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its contractual obligations. Interest rate risk is
the current or prospective risk to earnings and capital, or market valuations, arising from the impact of changes in interest rates. Market risk arises from
fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and security prices that may result in changes in the values of financial instruments, such as trading and
available-for-sale securities, mortgage loans held for sale (“MLHFS”), MSRs and derivatives that are accounted for on a fair value basis. Liquidity risk is the
risk that financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by the Company’s inability, or perceived inability, to meet its cash flow
obligations in a timely and complete manner in either normal or stressed conditions. Operational risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and
resilience arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, people (including human errors or misconduct), or adverse external events, including
the risk of loss resulting from breaches in data security. Operational risk can also include the risk of loss due to failures by third parties with which the Company
does business. Compliance risk is the risk that the Company may suffer legal or regulatory sanctions, financial losses, and reputational damage if it fails to
adhere to compliance requirements and the Company’s compliance policies. Strategic risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience
arising from adverse business decisions, poor implementation of business decisions, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the banking industry and operating
environment. Reputation risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, or franchise or enterprise value arising from negative public opinion. This risk
may impair the Company’s competitiveness by affecting its ability to establish new relationships or services, or continue serving existing relationships. In
addition to the risks identified above, other risk factors exist that may impact the Company. Refer to “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, for a detailed discussion of these factors.
The Company’s Board and management-level governance committees are supported by a “three lines of defense” model for establishing effective checks
and balances. The first line of defense, the business lines, manages risks in conformity with established limits and policy requirements. In turn, business line
leaders and their risk officers establish programs to ensure conformity with these limits and policy requirements. The second line of defense, which includes the
Chief Risk Officer’s organization as well as policy and oversight activities of corporate support functions, translates risk appetite and strategy into actionable
risk limits and policies. The second line of defense monitors first line of defense conformity with limits and policies, and provides reporting and escalation of
emerging risks and other concerns to senior management and the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors. The third line of defense, internal
audit, is responsible for providing the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and senior management with independent assessment and assurance regarding
the effectiveness of the Company’s governance, risk management and control processes.
Management regularly provides reports to the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors. The Risk Management Committee discusses with
management the Company’s risk management performance, and provides a summary of key risks to the entire Board of Directors, covering the status of existing
matters, areas of potential future concern and specific information on certain types of loss events. The Risk Management Committee considers quarterly reports
by management assessing the Company’s performance relative to the risk appetite statements and the associated risk limits, including:
• Macroeconomic environment and other qualitative considerations, such as regulatory and compliance changes, litigation developments, geopolitical events,
and technology and cybersecurity;
• Credit measures, including adversely rated and nonperforming loans, leveraged transactions, credit concentrations and lending limits;
• Interest rate and market risk, including market value and net income simulation, and trading-related Value at Risk (“VaR”);
• Liquidity risk, including funding projections under various stressed scenarios;
• Operational and compliance risk, including losses stemming from events such as fraud, processing errors, control breaches, breaches in data security or
adverse business decisions, as well as reporting on technology performance, and various legal and regulatory compliance measures;

• Capital ratios and projections, including regulatory measures and stressed scenarios; and
• Strategic and reputation risk considerations, impacts and responses.
Credit Risk Management The Company’s strategy for credit risk management includes well-defined, centralized credit policies, uniform underwriting criteria,
and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all commercial and consumer credit exposures. In evaluating its credit risk, the Company considers
changes, if any, in underwriting activities, the loan portfolio composition (including product mix and geographic, industry or customer-specific concentrations),
collateral values, trends in loan performance and macroeconomic factors, such as changes in unemployment rates, gross domestic product levels, inflation,
interest rates and consumer bankruptcy filings. The Risk Management Committee oversees the Company’s credit risk management process.
In addition, credit quality ratings as defined by the Company are an important part of the Company’s overall credit risk management and evaluation of its
allowance for credit losses. Loans with a pass rating represent those loans not classified on the Company’s rating scale for problem credits, as minimal credit
risk has been identified. Loans with a special mention or classified rating, including consumer lending and small business loans that are 90 days or more past
due and still accruing, nonaccrual loans, those loans considered troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”), and loans in a junior lien position that are current but are
behind a first lien position on nonaccrual, encompass all loans held by the Company that it considers to have a potential or well-defined weakness that may put
full collection of contractual cash flows at risk. The Company’s internal credit quality ratings for consumer loans are primarily based on delinquency and
nonperforming status, except for a limited population of larger loans within those portfolios that are individually evaluated. For this limited population, the
determination of the internal credit quality rating may also consider collateral value and customer cash flows. Refer to Note 5 in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s loan portfolios including internal credit quality ratings. In addition, refer to “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis — Credit Risk Management” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, for a more
detailed discussion on credit risk management processes.
The Company manages its credit risk, in part, through diversification of its loan portfolio which is achieved through limit setting by product type criteria,
such as industry, and identification of credit concentrations. As part of its normal business activities, the Company offers a broad array of lending products. The
Company categorizes its loan portfolio into two segments, which is the level at which it develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine the
allowance for credit losses. The Company’s two loan portfolio segments are commercial lending and consumer lending.
The commercial lending segment includes loans and leases made to small business, middle market, large corporate, commercial real estate, financial
institution, non-profit and public sector customers. Key risk characteristics relevant to commercial lending segment loans include the industry and geography of
the borrower’s business, purpose of the loan, repayment source, borrower’s debt capacity and financial flexibility, loan covenants, and nature of pledged
collateral, if any, as well as macroeconomic factors such as unemployment rates, gross domestic product levels, corporate bond spreads and long-term interest
rates. These risk characteristics, among others, are considered in determining estimates about the likelihood of default by the borrowers and the severity of loss
in the event of default. The Company considers these risk characteristics in assigning internal risk ratings to, or forecasting losses on, these loans, which are the
significant factors in determining the allowance for credit losses for loans in the commercial lending segment.
The consumer lending segment represents loans and leases made to consumer customers, including residential mortgages, credit card loans, and other
retail loans such as revolving consumer lines, auto loans and leases, home equity loans and lines, and student loans, a run-off portfolio. Home equity or second
mortgage loans are junior lien closed-end accounts fully disbursed at origination. These loans typically are fixed rate loans, secured by residential real estate,
with a 10- or 15-year fixed payment amortization schedule. Home equity lines are revolving accounts giving the borrower the ability to draw and repay balances
repeatedly, up to a maximum commitment, and are secured by residential real estate. These include accounts in either a first or junior lien position. Typical terms
on home equity lines in the portfolio are variable rates benchmarked to the prime rate, with a 10- or 15-year draw period during which a minimum payment is
equivalent to the monthly interest, followed by a 20- or 10-year amortization period, respectively. At September 30, 2022, substantially all of the Company’s
home equity lines were in the draw period. Key risk characteristics relevant to consumer lending segment loans primarily relate to the borrowers’ capacity and
willingness to repay and include unemployment rates, consumer bankruptcy filings and other macroeconomic factors, customer payment history
U.S. Bancorp 11
Table of Contents
and credit scores, and in some cases, updated loan-to-value (“LTV”) information reflecting current market conditions on real estate-based loans. These and other
risk characteristics are reflected in forecasts of delinquency levels, bankruptcies and losses which are the primary factors in determining the allowance for credit
losses for the consumer lending segment.
The Company further disaggregates its loan portfolio segments into various classes based on their underlying risk characteristics. The two classes within
the commercial lending segment are commercial loans and commercial real estate loans. The three classes within the consumer lending segment are residential
mortgages, credit card loans and other retail loans.
The Company’s consumer lending segment utilizes several distinct business processes and channels to originate consumer credit, including traditional
branch lending, mobile and on-line banking, indirect lending, alliance partnerships and correspondent banks. Each distinct underwriting and origination activity
manages unique credit risk characteristics and prices its loan production commensurate with the differing risk profiles.
Residential mortgage originations are generally limited to prime borrowers and are performed through the Company’s branches, loan production offices,
mobile and on-line services and a wholesale network of originators. The Company may retain residential mortgage loans it originates on its balance sheet or sell
the loans into the secondary market while retaining the servicing rights and customer relationships. Utilizing the secondary markets enables the Company to
effectively reduce its credit and other asset/liability risks. For residential mortgages that are retained in the Company’s portfolio and for home equity and second
mortgages, credit risk is also diversified by geography and managed by adherence to LTV and borrower credit criteria during the underwriting process.
The Company estimates updated LTV information on its outstanding residential mortgages quarterly, based on a method that combines automated
valuation model updates and relevant home price indices. LTV is the ratio of the loan’s outstanding principal balance to the current estimate of property value.
For home equity and second mortgages, combined loan-to-value (“CLTV”) is the combination of the first mortgage original principal balance and the second
lien outstanding principal balance, relative to the current estimate of property value. Certain loans do not have an LTV or CLTV, primarily due to lack of
availability of relevant automated valuation model and/or home price indices values, or lack of necessary valuation data on acquired loans.

Home equity and second mortgages were $11.4 billion at September 30, 2022, compared with $10.4 billion at December 31, 2021, and included
$2.9 billion of home equity lines in a first lien position and $8.5 billion of home equity and second mortgage loans and lines in a junior lien position. Loans and
lines in a junior lien position at September 30, 2022, included approximately $2.8 billion of loans and lines for which the Company also serviced the related first
lien loan, and approximately $5.7 billion where the Company did not service the related first lien loan. The Company was able to determine the status of the
related first liens using information the Company has as the servicer of the first lien or information reported on customer credit bureau files. The Company also
evaluates other indicators of credit risk for these junior lien loans and lines including delinquency, estimated average CLTV ratios and updated weighted-average
credit scores in making its assessment of credit risk, related loss estimates and determining the allowance for credit losses.

Loan Delinquencies Trends in delinquency ratios are an indicator, among other considerations, of credit risk within the Company’s loan portfolios. Accruing
loans 90 days or more past due totaled $393 million at September 30, 2022, compared with $472 million at December 31, 2021. These balances exclude loans
purchased and loans that could be purchased from GNMA mortgage pools under delinquent loan repurchase options whose repayments are primarily insured by
the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Accruing loans 90 days or more past due are not
included in nonperforming assets and continue to accrue interest because they are adequately secured by collateral, are in the process of collection and are
reasonably expected to result in repayment or restoration to current status, or are managed in homogeneous portfolios with specified charge-off timeframes
adhering to regulatory guidelines. The ratio of accruing loans 90 days or more past due to total loans was 0.11 percent at September 30, 2022 compared with
0.15 percent at December 31, 2021.

Restructured Loans In certain circumstances, the Company may modify the terms of a loan to maximize the collection of amounts due when a borrower is
experiencing financial difficulties or is expected to experience difficulties in the near-term. In most cases the modification is either a concessionary reduction in
interest rate, extension of the maturity date or reduction in the principal balance that would otherwise not be considered.
Troubled Debt Restructurings Concessionary modifications are classified as TDRs unless the modification results in only an insignificant delay in the payments
to be received. TDRs accrue interest if the borrower complies with the revised terms and conditions and has demonstrated repayment performance at a level
commensurate with the modified terms over several payment cycles, which is generally six months or greater. At September 30, 2022, performing TDRs were
$3.2 billion, compared with $3.1 billion at December 31, 2021.
The Company continues to work with customers to modify loans for borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties. Many of the Company’s TDRs
are determined on a case-by-case basis in connection with ongoing loan collection processes. The modifications vary within each of the Company’s loan classes.
Commercial lending segment TDRs generally include extensions of the maturity date and may be accompanied by an increase or decrease to the interest rate.
The Company may also work with the borrower to make other changes to the loan to mitigate losses, such as obtaining additional collateral and/or guarantees to
support the loan.
The Company has also implemented certain residential mortgage loan restructuring programs that may result in TDRs. The Company modifies residential
mortgage loans under Federal Housing Administration, United States Department of Veterans Affairs, and its own internal programs. Under these programs, the
Company offers qualifying homeowners the opportunity to permanently modify their loan and achieve more affordable monthly payments by providing loan
concessions. These concessions may include adjustments to interest rates, conversion of adjustable rates to fixed rates, extensions of maturity dates or deferrals
of payments, capitalization of accrued interest and/or outstanding advances, or in limited situations, partial forgiveness of loan principal. In most instances,
participation in residential mortgage loan restructuring programs requires the customer to complete a short-term trial period. A permanent loan modification is
contingent on the customer successfully completing the trial period arrangement, and the loan documents are not modified until that time. The Company reports
loans in a trial period arrangement as TDRs and continues to report them as TDRs after the trial period.
Credit card and other retail loan TDRs are generally part of distinct restructuring programs providing customers modification solutions over a specified
time period, generally up to 60 months.
In accordance with regulatory guidance, the Company considers secured consumer loans that have had debt discharged through bankruptcy where the
borrower has not reaffirmed the debt to be TDRs. If the loan amount exceeds the collateral value, the loan is charged down to collateral value and the remaining
amount is reported as nonperforming.

Short-term and Other Loan Modifications The Company makes short-term and other modifications that it does not consider to be TDRs, in limited
circumstances, to assist borrowers experiencing temporary hardships, including previously offering payment relief to borrowers that experienced financial
hardship resulting directly from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Short-term consumer lending modification programs include payment reductions,
deferrals of up to three past due payments, and the ability to return to current status if the borrower makes required payments. The Company may also make
short-term modifications to commercial lending loans, with the most common modification being an extension of the maturity date of three months or less. Such
extensions generally are used when the maturity date is imminent and the borrower is experiencing some level of financial stress, but the Company believes the
borrower will pay all contractual amounts owed.
Nonperforming Assets The level of nonperforming assets represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses. Nonperforming assets include
nonaccrual loans, restructured loans not performing in accordance with modified terms and not accruing interest, restructured loans that have not met the
performance period required to return to accrual status, other real estate owned (“OREO”) and other nonperforming assets owned by the Company. Interest
payments collected from assets on nonaccrual status are generally applied against the principal balance and not recorded as income. However, interest income
may be recognized for interest payments if the remaining carrying amount of the loan is believed to be collectible.
At September 30, 2022, total nonperforming assets were $677 million, compared to $878 million at December 31, 2021. The $201 million (22.9 percent)
decrease in nonperforming assets was driven by a decrease in nonperforming commercial real estate and commercial loans. The ratio of total nonperforming
assets to total loans and other real estate was 0.20 percent at September 30, 2022, compared with 0.28 percent at December 31, 2021.
OREO was $24 million at September 30, 2022, compared with $22 million at December 31, 2021, and was related to foreclosed properties that previously
secured loan balances. These balances exclude foreclosed GNMA loans whose repayments are primarily insured by the Federal Housing Administration or
guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.

Analysis of Loan Net Charge-Offs Total loan net charge-offs were $162 million for the third quarter of 2022, compared with $147 million in the third quarter of
2021. The increase reflected higher commercial, credit card and other retail loan net charge-offs, partially offset by a decrease in commercial real estate loan
charge-offs. Total loan net charge-offs were $485 million for the first nine months of 2022, compared with $550 million in the first nine months of 2021. The
decrease was driven by lower credit card net charge-offs in the first nine months of 2022. The ratio of total loan net charge-offs to average loans outstanding on
an annualized basis for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 was 0.19 percent and 0.20 percent, respectively, compared with 0.20 percent and
0.25 percent, respectively, for the same periods of 2021.
Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses is established for current expected credit losses on the Company’s
loan and lease portfolio, including unfunded credit commitments. The allowance considers expected losses for the remaining lives of the applicable assets,
inclusive of expected recoveries. The allowance for credit losses is increased through provisions charged to earnings and reduced by net charge-offs.
Management evaluates the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis. Multiple economic scenarios are considered over a
three-year reasonable and supportable forecast period, which includes increasing consideration of historical loss experience over years two and three. These
economic scenarios are constructed with interrelated projections of
18 U.S. Bancorp
Table of Contents
multiple economic variables, and loss estimates are produced that consider the historical correlation of those economic variables with credit losses. After the
forecast period, the Company fully reverts to long-term historical loss experience, adjusted for prepayments and characteristics of the current loan and lease
portfolio, to estimate losses over the remaining life of the portfolio. The economic scenarios are updated at least quarterly and are designed to provide a range of
reasonable estimates from better to worse than current expectations. Scenarios are weighted based on the Company’s expectation of economic conditions for the
foreseeable future and reflect significant judgment and consideration of economic forecast uncertainty. Final loss estimates also consider factors affecting credit
losses not reflected in the scenarios, due to the unique aspects of current conditions and expectations. These factors may include, but are not limited to, loan
servicing practices, regulatory guidance, and/or fiscal and monetary policy actions.
Because business processes and credit risks associated with unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as for loans, the Company utilizes
similar processes to estimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments, which is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Both the
allowance for loan losses and the liability for unfunded credit commitments are included in the Company’s analysis of credit losses and reported reserve ratios.
The allowance recorded for credit losses utilizes forward-looking expected loss models to consider a variety of factors affecting lifetime credit losses.
These factors include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic variables such as unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels, inflation,
interest rates, and corporate bond spreads, as well as loan and borrower characteristics, such as internal risk ratings on commercial loans and consumer credit
scores, delinquency status, collateral type and available valuation information, consideration of end-of-term losses on lease residuals, and the remaining term of
the loan, adjusted for expected prepayments. For each loan portfolio, model estimates are adjusted as necessary to consider any relevant changes in portfolio
composition, lending policies, underwriting standards, risk management practices, economic conditions or other factors that may affect the accuracy of the
model. Expected credit loss estimates also include consideration of expected cash recoveries on loans previously charged-off or expected recoveries on
collateral-dependent loans where recovery is expected through sale of the collateral. Where loans do not exhibit similar risk characteristics, an individual
analysis is performed to consider expected credit losses.
The allowance recorded for individually evaluated loans greater than $5 million in the commercial lending segment is based on an analysis utilizing
expected cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate, the observable market price of the loan, or the fair value of the collateral, less selling
costs, for collateral-dependent loans as appropriate. For commercial TDRs individually evaluated for impairment, attributes of the borrower are the primary
factors in determining the allowance for credit losses. For smaller commercial loans collectively evaluated for impairment, historical loss experience is also
incorporated into the allowance methodology applied to this category of loans.
The allowance recorded for TDR loans in the consumer lending segment is determined on a homogenous pool basis utilizing expected cash flows
discounted using the original effective interest rate of the pool. The expected cash flows on TDR loans consider subsequent payment defaults since modification,
the borrower’s ability to pay under the restructured terms, and the timing and amount of payments. The allowance for collateral-dependent loans in the consumer
lending segment is determined based on the current fair value of the collateral less costs to sell.
When evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses for any loans and lines in a junior lien position, the Company considers the
delinquency and modification status of the first lien. At September 30, 2022, the Company serviced the first lien on 34 percent of the home equity loans and
lines in a junior lien position. The Company also considers the status of first lien mortgage accounts reported on customer credit bureau files when the first lien
is not serviced by the Company. Regardless of whether the Company services the first lien, an assessment is made of economic conditions, problem loans, recent
loss experience and other factors in determining the allowance for credit losses. Based on the available information, the Company estimated $187 million or
1.6 percent of its total home equity portfolio at September 30, 2022, represented non-delinquent junior liens where the first lien was delinquent or modified.
The Company considers historical loss experience on the loans and lines in a junior lien position to establish loss estimates for junior lien loans and lines
the Company services that are current, but the first lien is delinquent or modified. The historical long-term average loss experience related to junior liens has
been relatively limited (less than 1 percent of the total portfolio annually), and estimates are adjusted to consider current collateral support and portfolio risk
characteristics. These include updated credit scores and collateral estimates obtained on the Company’s home equity
U.S. Bancorp 19
Table of Contents
portfolio each quarter. In its evaluation of the allowance for credit losses, the Company also considers the increased risk of loss associated with home equity
lines that are contractually scheduled to convert from a revolving status to a fully amortizing payment.
When a loan portfolio is purchased, the acquired loans are divided into those considered purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration
(“PCD”) and those not considered PCD. An allowance is established for each population and considers product mix, risk characteristics of the portfolio,
bankruptcy experience, delinquency status and refreshed LTV ratios when possible. The allowance established for purchased loans not considered PCD is
recognized through provision expense upon acquisition, whereas the allowance established for loans considered PCD at acquisition is offset by an increase in the
basis of the acquired loans. Any subsequent increases and decreases in the allowance related to purchased loans, regardless of PCD status, are recognized
through provision expense, with charge-offs charged to the allowance. The Company did not have a material amount of PCD loans included in its loan portfolio
at September 30, 2022.
The Company’s methodology for determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses also considers the imprecision inherent in the methodologies
used and allocated to the various loan portfolios. As a result, amounts determined under the methodologies described above are adjusted by management to
consider the potential impact of other qualitative factors not captured in quantitative model adjustments which include, but are not limited to, the following:
model imprecision, imprecision in economic scenario assumptions, and emerging risks related to either changes in the economic environment that are affecting
specific portfolios, or changes in portfolio concentrations over time that may affect model performance. The consideration of these items results in adjustments
to allowance amounts included in the Company’s allowance for credit losses for each loan portfolio.
Although the Company determined the amount of each element of the allowance separately and considers this process to be an important credit
management tool, the entire allowance for credit losses is available for the entire loan portfolio. The actual amount of losses can vary significantly from the
estimated amounts.
At September 30, 2022, the allowance for credit losses was $6.5 billion (1.88 percent of period-end loans), compared with an allowance of $6.2 billion
(1.97 percent of period-end loans) at December 31, 2021. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 1,025 percent at September 30,
2022, compared with 738 percent at December 31, 2021. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to annualized loan net charge-offs was 1,004 percent at
September 30, 2022, compared with 902 percent of full year 2021 net charge-offs at December 31, 2021.
The increase in the allowance for credit losses of $300 million (4.9 percent) at September 30, 2022, compared with December 31, 2021, was driven by
strong loan growth and increased economic uncertainty. Economic uncertainty and recession risk has been increasing due to ongoing supply chain challenges,
rising interest rates and inflationary concerns, market volatility, rising energy prices resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and related pressure on corporate
earnings. In addition to these broad economic factors, expected loss estimates consider various factors including customer specific information impacting
changes in risk ratings, projected delinquencies, potential effects of inflationary pressures and the impact of rising interest rates on selected borrowers’ liquidity
and ability to repay.
Economic conditions considered in estimating the allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2022 included changes in projected gross domestic product
and unemployment levels. These factors are evaluated through a combination of quantitative calculations using economic scenarios and qualitative assessments
that consider the high degree of economic uncertainty in the current environment.
The following table summarizes the baseline forecast for key economic variables the Company used in its estimate of the allowance for credit losses at
September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021:

The allowance for credit losses related to commercial lending segment loans decreased $34 million during the first nine months of 2022, reflecting select
commercial portfolios continuing to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the impacts of loan growth and increasing economic
uncertainty.
The allowance for credit losses related to consumer lending segment loans increased $334 million during the first nine months of 2022, mainly due to loan
growth and increasing economic uncertainty, along with the effects of higher interest rates on the life of the residential mortgage portfolios.

Residual Value Risk Management The Company manages its risk to changes in the residual value of leased vehicles, office and business equipment, and other
assets through disciplined residual valuation at the inception of a lease, diversification of its leased assets, regular residual asset valuation reviews and
monitoring of residual value gains or losses upon the disposition of assets. As of September 30, 2022, no significant change in the amount of residual values or
concentration of the portfolios had occurred since December 31, 2021. Refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Residual Value Risk Management”
in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, for further discussion on residual value risk management.
Operational Risk Management The Company operates in many different businesses in diverse markets and relies on the ability of its employees and systems to
process a high number of transactions. Operational risk is inherent in all business activities, and the management of this risk is important to the achievement of
the Company’s objectives. Business lines have direct and primary responsibility and accountability for identifying, controlling, and monitoring operational risks
embedded in their business activities, including those additional or increased risks created by economic and financial disruptions. The Company maintains a
system of controls with the objective of providing proper transaction authorization and execution, proper system operations, proper oversight of third parties
with whom it does business, safeguarding of assets from misuse or theft, and ensuring the reliability and security of financial and other data. Refer to
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Operational Risk Management” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2021, for further discussion on operational risk management.
Compliance Risk Management The Company may suffer legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, or damage to its reputation through failure to
comply with laws, regulations, rules, standards of good practice, and codes of conduct, including those related to compliance with Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money
laundering requirements, sanctions compliance requirements as administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, consumer protection and other
requirements. The Company has controls and processes in place for the assessment, identification, monitoring, management and reporting of compliance risks
and issues including those created or increased by economic and financial disruptions. Refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Compliance Risk
Management” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, for further discussion on compliance risk management.
Interest Rate Risk Management In the banking industry, changes in interest rates are a significant risk that can impact earnings and the safety and soundness of
an entity. The Company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates through asset and liability management activities within guidelines established by its
Asset Liability Management Committee (“ALCO”) and approved by the Board of Directors. The ALCO has the responsibility for approving and overseeing
compliance with the ALCO management policies, including interest rate risk exposure. One way the Company measures and analyzes its interest rate risk is
through net interest income simulation analysis.
Simulation analysis incorporates substantially all of the Company’s assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, together with forecasted
changes in the balance sheet and assumptions that reflect the current interest rate environment. Through this simulation, management estimates the impact on net
interest income of various interest rate changes that differ in the direction, amount and speed of change over time, as well as the shape of the yield curve. This
simulation includes assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to be affected by changes in loan and deposit growth. Assumptions are made to project
interest rates for new loans and deposits based on historical analysis, management’s outlook and re-pricing strategies. These assumptions are reviewed and
validated on a periodic basis with sensitivity analysis being provided for key variables of the simulation. The results are reviewed monthly by the ALCO and are
used to guide asset/liability management strategies.
The Company manages its interest rate risk position by holding assets with desired interest rate risk characteristics on its balance sheet, implementing
certain pricing strategies for loans and deposits and selecting derivatives and various funding and investment portfolio strategies.
Table 9 summarizes the projected impact to net interest income over the next 12 months of various potential interest rate changes. The sensitivity of the
projected impact to net interest income over the next 12 months is dependent on balance sheet growth, product mix, deposit behavior, pricing and funding
decisions. While the Company utilizes models and assumptions based on historical information and expected behaviors, actual outcomes could vary
significantly. Net interest income sensitivities reflect the impact of current market expectations for interest rates, driving an increase in baseline projected net
interest income. As market expectations are reflected in projected results, incremental interest rate sensitivity declines on a percentage basis.

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and Other Risks To manage the sensitivity of earnings and capital to interest rate, prepayment, credit, price and
foreign currency fluctuations (asset and liability management positions), the Company enters into derivative transactions. The Company uses derivatives for
asset and liability management purposes primarily in the following ways:
• To convert fixed-rate debt and available-for-sale investment securities from fixed-rate payments to floating-rate payments;
• To convert floating-rate loans and debt from floating-rate payments to fixed-rate payments;
• To mitigate changes in value of the Company’s unfunded mortgage loan commitments, funded MLHFS and MSRs;
• To mitigate remeasurement volatility of foreign currency denominated balances; and
• To mitigate the volatility of the Company’s net investment in foreign operations driven by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
In addition, the Company enters into interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts to support the business requirements of its customers
(customer-related positions). The Company minimizes the market and liquidity risks of customer-related positions by either entering into similar offsetting
positions with broker-dealers, or on a portfolio basis by entering into other derivative or non-derivative financial instruments that partially or fully offset the
exposure from these customer-related positions. The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are either exchange-traded, centrally cleared through
clearinghouses or over-the-counter. The Company does not utilize derivatives for speculative purposes.
The Company does not designate all of the derivatives that it enters into for risk management purposes as accounting hedges because of the inefficiency
of applying the accounting requirements and may instead elect fair value accounting for the related hedged items. In particular, the Company enters into interest
rate swaps, swaptions, forward commitments to buy to-be-announced securities (“TBAs”), U.S. Treasury and Eurodollar futures and options on U.S. Treasury
futures to mitigate fluctuations in the value of its MSRs, but does not designate those derivatives as accounting hedges.
Additionally, the Company uses forward commitments to sell TBAs and other commitments to sell residential mortgage loans at specified prices to
economically hedge the interest rate risk in its residential mortgage loan production activities. At September 30, 2022, the Company had $5.3 billion of forward
commitments to sell, hedging $2.7 billion of MLHFS and $3.0 billion of unfunded mortgage loan commitments. The forward commitments to sell and the
unfunded mortgage loan commitments on loans intended to be sold are considered derivatives under the accounting guidance related to accounting for derivative
instruments and hedging activities. The Company has elected the fair value option for the MLHFS.
Derivatives are subject to credit risk associated with counterparties to the contracts. Credit risk associated with derivatives is measured by the Company
based on the probability of counterparty default. The Company manages the credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various
counterparties, by entering into master netting arrangements, and, where possible, by requiring collateral arrangements. The Company may also transfer
counterparty credit risk related to interest rate swaps to third parties through the use of risk participation agreements. In addition, certain interest rate swaps,
interest rate forwards and credit contracts are required to be centrally cleared through clearinghouses to further mitigate counterparty credit risk.
For additional information on derivatives and hedging activities, refer to Notes 13 and 14 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
LIBOR Transition In July 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) announced that it would no longer require banks to submit rates
for the London InterBank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) after 2021. In March 2021, the FCA and the administrator of LIBOR announced that, with respect to the
most commonly used tenors of United States Dollar LIBOR, LIBOR will no longer be published on a representative basis after June 30, 2023. The publication
of all other tenors of United States Dollar LIBOR ceased to be provided or ceased to be representative after December 31, 2021. The Company holds financial
instruments impacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR,
U.S. Bancorp 23
Table of Contents
including certain loans, investment securities, derivatives, borrowings and other financial instruments that use LIBOR as the benchmark rate. The Company also
provides various services to customers in its capacities as trustee and servicer, which involve financial instruments that will be similarly impacted by the
discontinuance of LIBOR.
The Company has transitioned financial instruments associated to LIBOR currencies and tenors that ceased or became nonrepresentative on December 31,
2021 to alternative reference rates, with limited exceptions. The Company also anticipates that additional financial instruments associated to the remaining
United States Dollar LIBOR tenors will require transition to a new reference rate by June 30, 2023. The Company is currently assessing the applicability and
scope of the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the “LIBOR Act”), which was enacted on March 15, 2022. The LIBOR Act establishes a process for
replacing LIBOR on existing LIBOR contracts that do not provide for the use of a clearly defined or practicable replacement benchmark rate by providing that a
benchmark replacement identified by the Federal Reserve Board that is based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) will replace LIBOR as the
benchmark for such contracts. The final implementation of the LIBOR Act currently remains uncertain, as the Federal Reserve has not yet issued final
regulations that are necessary for its administration.
In order to facilitate the transition process, the Company has instituted a LIBOR Transition Office and commenced an enterprise-wide project to identify,
assess, monitor and mitigate risks associated with the expected discontinuance or unavailability of LIBOR, actively engage with industry working groups and
regulators, achieve operational readiness for the use of alternative reference rates and engage impacted customers to remediate and transition impacted
instruments. The Company has also invested in updating its systems, models, procedures and internal infrastructure as part of the transition program.
Additionally, in alignment with guidance from United States banking agencies and the FCA, the Company has ceased the use of LIBOR as a reference rate in
new contracts, with limited exceptions, and continues to increase the usage of alternative reference rates such as SOFR. The Company has been undergoing an
enterprise-wide effort to proactively reprice LIBOR loans with customers to an alternative reference rate. The Company has also adopted industry best practice
guidelines for fallback language for new transactions, converted its cleared interest rate swaps discounting to SOFR discounting, and distributed
communications related to the transition to certain impacted parties, both inside and outside the Company. Refer to “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, for further discussion on potential risks that could adversely affect the Company’s financial results
as a result of the LIBOR transition.
Market Risk Management In addition to interest rate risk, the Company is exposed to other forms of market risk, principally related to trading activities which
support customers’strategies to manage their own foreign currency, interest rate risk and funding activities. For purposes of its internal capital adequacy
assessment process, the Company considers risk arising from its trading activities, as well as the remeasurement volatility of foreign currency denominated
balances included on its Consolidated Balance Sheet (collectively, “Covered Positions”), employing methodologies consistent with the requirements of
regulatory rules for market risk. The Company’s Market Risk Committee (“MRC”), within the framework of the ALCO, oversees market risk management. The
MRC monitors and reviews the Company’s Covered Positions and establishes policies for market risk management, including exposure limits for each portfolio.
The Company uses a VaR approach to measure general market risk. Theoretically, VaR represents the statistical risk of loss the Company has to adverse market
movements over a one-day time horizon. The Company uses the Historical Simulation method to calculate VaR for its Covered Positions measured at the ninetyninth percentile using a one-year look-back period for distributions derived from past market data. The market factors used in the calculations include those
pertinent to market risks inherent in the underlying trading portfolios, principally those that affect the Company’s corporate bond trading business, foreign
currency transaction business, client derivatives business, loan trading business and municipal securities business, as well as those inherent in the Company’s
foreign denominated balances and the derivatives used to mitigate the related measurement volatility. On average, the Company expects the one-day VaR to be
exceeded by actual losses two to three times per year related to these positions. The Company monitors the accuracy of internal VaR models and modeling
processes by back-testing model performance, regularly updating the historical data used by the VaR models and regular model validations to assess the
accuracy of the models’ input, processing, and reporting components. All models are required to be independently reviewed and approved prior to being placed
in use. If the Company were to experience market losses in excess of the estimated VaR more often than expected, the VaR models and associated assumptions
would be analyzed and adjusted.

The Company did not experience any actual losses for its combined Covered Positions that exceeded VaR during the nine months ended September 30,
2022 and 2021. The Company stress tests its market risk measurements to provide management with perspectives on market events that may not be captured by
its VaR models, including worst case historical market movement combinations that have not necessarily occurred on the same date.
The Company calculates Stressed VaR using the same underlying methodology and model as VaR, except that a historical continuous one-year look-back
period is utilized that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate to the Company’s Covered Positions. The period selected by the Company
includes the significant market volatility of the last four months of 2008.
The average, high, low and period-end one-day Stressed VaR amounts for the Company’s Covered Positions were as follows:

Valuations of positions in client derivatives and foreign currency activities are based on discounted cash flow or other valuation techniques using marketbased assumptions. These valuations are compared to third party quotes or other market prices to determine if there are significant variances. Significant
variances are approved by senior management in the Company’s corporate functions. Valuation of positions in the corporate bond trading, loan trading and
municipal securities businesses are based on trader marks. These trader marks are evaluated against third-party prices, with significant variances approved by
senior management in the Company’s corporate functions.
The Company also measures the market risk of its hedging activities related to residential MLHFS and MSRs using the Historical Simulation method. The
VaRs are measured at the ninety-ninth percentile and employ factors pertinent to the market risks inherent in the valuation of the assets and hedges. A one-year
look-back period is used to obtain past market data for the models.
The average, high and low VaR amounts for the residential MLHFS and related hedges and the MSRs and related hedges were as follows:

Liquidity Risk Management The Company’s liquidity risk management process is designed to identify, measure, and manage the Company’s funding and
liquidity risk to meet its daily funding needs and to address expected and unexpected changes in its funding requirements. The Company engages in various
activities to manage its liquidity risk. These activities include diversifying its funding sources, stress testing, and holding readily-marketable assets which can be
used as a source of liquidity if needed. In addition, the Company’s profitable operations, sound credit quality and strong capital position have enabled it to
develop a large and reliable base of core deposit funding within its market areas and in domestic and global capital markets.
The Company’s Board of Directors approves the Company’s liquidity policy. The Risk Management Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors
oversees the Company’s liquidity risk management process and approves a contingency funding plan. The ALCO reviews the Company’s liquidity policy and
limits, and regularly assesses the Company’s ability to meet funding requirements arising from adverse company-specific or market events.
The Company regularly projects its funding needs under various stress scenarios and maintains a contingency funding plan consistent with the Company’s
access to diversified sources of contingent funding. The Company maintains a substantial level of total available liquidity in the form of on-balance sheet and
off-balance sheet funding sources. These liquidity sources include cash at the Federal Reserve Bank and certain European central banks, unencumbered liquid
assets, and capacity to borrow from the FHLB and at the Federal Reserve Bank’s Discount Window. At September 30, 2022, the fair value of unencumbered
investment securities totaled $128.4 billion, compared with $144.0 billion at December 31, 2021. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements and “Balance Sheet Analysis” for further information on investment securities maturities and trends. Asset liquidity is further enhanced by the
Company’s practice of pledging loans to access secured borrowing facilities through the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank. At September 30, 2022, the
U.S. Bancorp 25
Table of Contents
Company could have borrowed a total of an additional $101.2 billion from the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank based on collateral available for additional
borrowings.
The Company’s diversified deposit base provides a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funding, while reducing the Company’s reliance on
the wholesale markets. Total deposits were $471.1 billion at September 30, 2022, compared with $456.1 billion at December 31, 2021. Refer to “Balance Sheet
Analysis” for further information on the Company’s deposits.
Additional funding is provided by long-term debt and short-term borrowings. Long-term debt was $32.2 billion at September 30, 2022, and is an
important funding source because of its multi-year borrowing structure. Short-term borrowings were $25.1 billion at September 30, 2022, and supplement the
Company’s other funding sources. Refer to “Balance Sheet Analysis” for further information on the Company’s long-term debt and short-term borrowings.
In addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis, the Company monitors the parent company’s liquidity. The Company establishes limits for
the minimal number of months into the future where the parent company can meet existing and forecasted obligations with cash and securities held that can be
readily monetized. The Company measures and manages this limit in both normal and adverse conditions. The Company maintains sufficient funding to meet
expected capital and debt service obligations for 24 months without the support of dividends from subsidiaries and assuming access to the wholesale markets is
maintained. The Company maintains sufficient liquidity to meet its capital and debt service obligations for 12 months under adverse conditions without the
support of dividends from subsidiaries or access to the wholesale markets. The parent company is currently well in excess of required liquidity minimums.
At September 30, 2022, parent company long-term debt outstanding was $20.9 billion, compared with $18.9 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase
was primarily due to $3.9 billion of medium-term note and $1.3 billion of subordinated note issuances, partially offset by $1.3 billion of subordinated note and
$1.0 billion of medium-term note repayments. As of September 30, 2022, there was no parent company debt scheduled to mature in the remainder of 2022.
The Company is subject to a regulatory Liquidity Coverage Ratio (“LCR”) requirement which requires banks to maintain an adequate level of
unencumbered high quality liquid assets to meet estimated liquidity needs over a 30-day stressed period. At September 30, 2022, the Company was compliant
with this requirement.
The Company is also subject to a regulatory Net Stable Funding Ratio (“NSFR”) requirement which requires banks to maintain a minimum level of stable
funding based on the liquidity characteristics of their assets, commitments, and derivative exposures over a one-year time horizon. At September 30, 2022, the
Company was compliant with this requirement.
Refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Liquidity Risk Management” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2021, for further discussion on liquidity risk management.
European Exposures The Company provides merchant processing and corporate trust services in Europe either directly or through banking affiliations in
Europe. Revenue generated from sources in Europe represented approximately 2 percent of the Company’s total net revenue for both the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2022. Operating cash for these businesses is deposited on a short-term basis typically with certain European central banks. For deposits
placed at other European banks, exposure is mitigated by the Company placing deposits at multiple banks and managing the amounts on deposit at any bank
based on institution-specific deposit limits. At September 30, 2022, the Company had an aggregate amount on deposit with European banks of approximately
$6.5 billion, predominately with the Central Bank of Ireland and Bank of England.
In addition, the Company provides financing to domestic multinational corporations that generate revenue from customers in European countries,
transacts with various European banks as counterparties to certain derivative-related activities, and through a subsidiary, manages money market funds that hold
certain investments in European sovereign debt. Any deterioration in economic conditions in Europe, including the impacts resulting from the Russia-Ukraine
conflict, is not expected to have a significant effect on the Company related to these activities.
Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Other Contractual Obligations The Company participates in many different contractual arrangements which may or
may not be recorded on its balance sheet, with unrelated or consolidated entities, under which the Company has an obligation to pay certain amounts, provide
credit or liquidity enhancements or provide market risk support. These arrangements include commitments to extend credit, letters of credit and various forms of
guarantees. Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on guarantees and contingent liabilities. These
arrangements also include any obligation related to a variable interest held in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, credit enhancement or
market risk support. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Company’s interests in variable
interest entities.

Capital Management The Company is committed to managing capital to maintain strong protection for depositors and creditors and for maximum shareholder
benefit. The Company also manages its capital to exceed regulatory capital requirements for banking organizations. The regulatory capital requirements
effective for the Company follow Basel III, with the Company being subject to calculating its capital adequacy as a percentage of risk-weighted assets under the
standardized approach. Beginning in 2022, the Company began to phase into its regulatory capital requirements the cumulative deferred impact of its 2020
adoption of the accounting guidance related to the impairment of financial instruments based on the current expected credit losses (“CECL”) methodology plus
25 percent of its quarterly credit reserve increases over the past two years. This cumulative deferred impact will be phased into the Company’s regulatory capital
over the next three years, culminating with a fully phased in regulatory capital calculation beginning in 2025. Table 10 provides a summary of statutory
regulatory capital ratios in effect for the Company at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. All regulatory ratios exceeded regulatory “well-capitalized”
requirements.
The Company believes certain other capital ratios are useful in evaluating its capital adequacy. The Company’s tangible common equity, as a percent of
tangible assets and as a percent of risk-weighted assets determined in accordance with transitional regulatory capital requirements related to the CECL
methodology under the standardized approach, was 5.2 percent and 6.7 percent, respectively, at September 30, 2022, compared with 6.8 percent and 9.2 percent,
respectively, at December 31, 2021. In addition, the Company’s common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio, reflecting the full implementation of
the CECL methodology was 9.4 percent at September 30, 2022, compared with 9.6 percent at December 31, 2021. Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”
beginning on page 32 for further information on these other capital ratios.
Total U.S. Bancorp shareholders’ equity was $47.5 billion at September 30, 2022, compared with $54.9 billion at December 31, 2021. The decrease was
primarily the result of changes in unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investment securities included in other comprehensive income (loss) and
dividends paid, partially offset by corporate earnings and the issuance of preferred stock.
The Company announced on December 22, 2020 that its Board of Directors had approved an authorization to repurchase $3.0 billion of its common stock
beginning January 1, 2021, and repurchased $1.5 billion of its common stock during the first six months of 2021 under this program. The Company suspended
all common stock repurchases at the beginning of the third quarter of 2021, except for those done exclusively in connection with its stock-based compensation
programs, due to its pending acquisition of MUFG Union Bank’s core regional banking franchise. The Company’s target common equity tier 1 capital ratio is
8.5 percent and it expects to operate at a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of approximately 8.3 percent at the time of closing the acquisition, given interest
rates at the time of the Company’s third quarter 2022 earnings release of October 13, 2022. The Company’s common equity tier 1 capital ratio is expected to
increase toward 9.0 percent subsequent to the acquisition as a result of corporate earnings, which will include the impact of accretion of the purchase accounting
valuation adjustments. The Company does not expect to commence repurchasing its common stock until after the acquisition closes and its common equity tier 1
capital ratio approximates 9.0 percent.

The Company will continue to monitor its capital position and may adjust its capital distributions based on economic conditions and its financial
performance. Capital distributions, including dividends and stock repurchases, are subject to the approval of the Company’s Board of Directors and compliance
with regulatory requirements.

LINE OF BUSINESS FINANCIAL REVIEW
The Company’s major lines of business are Corporate and Commercial Banking, Consumer and Business Banking, Wealth Management and Investment
Services, Payment Services, and Treasury and Corporate Support. These operating segments are components of the Company about which financial information
is prepared and is evaluated regularly by management in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance.
Basis for Financial Presentation Business line results are derived from the Company’s business unit profitability reporting systems by specifically attributing
managed balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related income or expense. Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information on the business lines’ basis for financial presentation.
Designations, assignments and allocations change from time to time as management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating performance or product
lines change or business segments are realigned to better respond to the Company’s diverse customer base. During 2022, certain organization and methodology
changes were made and, accordingly, 2021 results were restated and presented on a comparable basis.
Corporate and Commercial Banking Corporate and Commercial Banking offers lending, equipment finance and small-ticket leasing, depository services,
treasury management, capital markets services, international trade services and other financial services to middle market, large corporate, commercial real estate,
financial institution, non-profit and public sector clients. Corporate and Commercial Banking contributed $502 million of the Company’s net income in the third
quarter and $1.3 billion in the first nine months of 2022, or increases of $121 million (31.8 percent) and $39 million (3.1 percent), respectively, compared with
the same periods of 2021.
Net revenue increased $235 million (24.6 percent) in the third quarter and $303 million (10.3 percent) in the first nine months of 2022, compared with the
same periods of 2021. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, increased $233 million (33.2 percent) in the third quarter and $317 million (14.7
percent) in the first nine months of 2022, compared with the same periods of 2021. The increases were primarily due to higher loan and interest-bearing deposit
balances and the impact of higher rates on the margin benefit from deposits, partially offset by lower spreads on loans and lower noninterest-bearing deposits.
Noninterest income increased $2 million (0.8 percent) in the third quarter of 2022, compared with the third quarter of 2021, primarily due to stronger trust and
investment management fees driven by lower money market fee waivers and core growth, and higher commercial products revenue due to higher capital markets
revenue, partially offset by lower treasury management fees driven by the impact of rising interest rates on earnings credits. Noninterest income decreased
$14 million (1.8 percent) in the first nine months of 2022, compared with the first nine months of 2021, primarily due to lower corporate bond fees within the
capital markets business, partially offset by higher treasury management fees.
Noninterest expense increased $17 million (3.9 percent) in the third quarter and $47 million (3.6 percent) in the first nine months of 2022, compared with
the same periods of 2021, primarily due to higher FDIC insurance expense and higher compensation expense primarily due to merit increases and hiring to
support business growth. The increase in noninterest expense for the first nine months of 2022, compared with the first nine months of 2021, was partially offset
by lower performance-based incentives related to capital markets activity. The provision for credit losses increased $56 million in the third quarter and
$204 million in the first nine months of 2022, compared with the same periods of 2021, primarily due to loan loss provisions supporting growth in loan
balances.
Consumer and Business Banking Consumer and Business Banking comprises consumer banking, small business banking and consumer lending. Products and
services are delivered through banking offices, telephone servicing and sales, on-line services, direct mail, ATM processing, mobile devices, distributed
mortgage loan officers, and intermediary relationships including auto dealerships, mortgage banks, and strategic partners. Consumer and Business Banking
contributed $467 million of the Company’s net income in the third quarter and $1.3 billion in the first nine months of 2022, or decreases of $198 million
(29.8 percent) and $527 million (28.1 percent), respectively, compared with the same periods of 2021.

Net revenue decreased $210 million (9.2 percent) in the third quarter and $469 million (7.2 percent) in the first nine months of 2022, compared with the
same periods of 2021. Noninterest income decreased $378 million (52.9 percent) in the third quarter and $724 million (37.8 percent) in the first nine months of
2022, compared with the same periods of 2021, primarily due to lower mortgage banking revenue reflecting lower application volume, given declining refinance
activities experienced in the mortgage industry, lower related gain on sale margins and lower performing loan sales. The decrease in mortgage banking revenue
in the first nine months of 2022, compared with the first nine months of 2021, was partially offset by an increase in the fair value of MSRs, net of hedging
activities. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, increased $168 million (10.8 percent) in the third quarter and $255 million (5.6 percent) in the first
nine months of 2022, compared with the same periods of 2021, reflecting the favorable impact of higher rates on the margin benefit from deposits and higher
deposit balances, partially offset by lower spreads on loans and lower loan fees driven by the impact of loan forgiveness related to the SBA Paycheck Protection
Program.
Noninterest expense decreased $13 million (0.9 percent) in the third quarter of 2022, compared with the third quarter of 2021, due to lower compensation
expense reflecting lower revenue-related compensation due to mortgage production and lower mortgage related loan expense, partially offset by increases in net
shared services expense due to investments in digital capabilities. Noninterest expense increased $86 million (2.1 percent) in the first nine months of 2022,
compared with the first nine months of 2021, primarily due to increases in net shared services expense, partially offset by lower compensation expense and
mortgage related loan expense. The provision for credit losses increased $67 million in the third quarter and $148 million in the first nine months of 2022,
compared with the same periods of 2021, due to loan balance growth and more favorable credit trends in the prior year.
Wealth Management and Investment Services Wealth Management and Investment Services provides private banking, financial advisory services, investment
management, retail brokerage services, insurance, trust, custody and fund servicing through four businesses: Wealth Management, Global Corporate Trust &
Custody, U.S. Bancorp Asset Management and Fund Services. Wealth Management and Investment Services contributed $400 million of the Company’s net
income in the third quarter and $923 million in the first nine months of 2022, or increases of $196 million (96.1 percent) and $286 million (44.9 percent),
respectively, compared with the same periods of 2021.
Net revenue increased $335 million (42.2 percent) in the third quarter and $616 million (25.8 percent) in the first nine months of 2022, compared with the
same periods of 2021. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, increased $241 million in the third quarter and $355 million (47.2 percent) in the first
nine months of 2022, compared with the same periods of 2021, primarily due to the favorable impact of higher rates on the margin benefit from deposits.
Noninterest income increased $94 million (16.8 percent) in the third quarter and $261 million (15.9 percent) in the first nine months of 2022, compared with the
same periods of 2021, primarily driven by higher trust and investment management fees reflecting lower money market fund fee waivers, the impact of the PFM
acquisition and core business growth, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable market conditions.
Noninterest expense increased $72 million (13.8 percent) in the third quarter and $229 million (14.9 percent) in the first nine months of 2022, compared
with the same periods of 2021, reflecting higher compensation expense as a result of merit increases, the PFM acquisition, core business growth and
performance-based incentives, as well as higher net shared services expense driven by investment in support of business growth. The provision for credit losses
increased $1 million (50.0 percent) in the third quarter and $5 million in the first nine months of 2022, compared with the same periods of 2021.
Payment Services Payment Services includes consumer and business credit cards, stored-value cards, debit cards, corporate, government and purchasing card
services, consumer lines of credit and merchant processing. Payment Services contributed $330 million of the Company’s net income in the third quarter and
$1.1 billion in the first nine months of 2022, or decreases of $70 million (17.5 percent) and $245 million (18.4 percent), respectively, compared with the same
periods of 2021.
Net revenue increased $60 million (3.8 percent) in the third quarter and $231 million (5.2 percent) in the first nine months of 2022, compared with the
same periods of 2021. Noninterest income increased $49 million (5.2 percent) in the third quarter and $203 million (7.7 percent) in the first nine months of
2022, compared with the same periods of 2021, mainly due to continued strengthening of consumer and business spending across most sectors. As a result, there
was strong growth in corporate payment products revenue driven by improving business spending across all product

groups. In addition, merchant processing services revenue increased due to higher sales volume and higher merchant fees, partially offset by the impact of
foreign currency rate changes in Europe. Credit and debit card revenue was negatively impacted by declining prepaid processing fees as the beneficial impact of
government stimulus programs dissipated year-over-year, offset by strong sales. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, increased $11 million (1.8
percent) in the third quarter and $28 million (1.5 percent) in the first nine months of 2022, compared with the same periods of 2021, primarily due to higher loan
balances and loan fees, partially offset by higher funding costs. Net interest income further increased in the third quarter of 2022, compared with the third
quarter of 2021, due to higher loan yields driven by higher interest rates net of lower customer revolve rates.
Noninterest expense increased $35 million (4.1 percent) in the third quarter and $138 million (5.5 percent) in the first nine months of 2022, compared
with the same periods of 2021, reflecting higher net shared services expense driven by investment in infrastructure and technology development, in addition to
higher compensation expense as a result of merit increases, core business growth and variable compensation. The provision for credit losses increased
$119 million (71.7 percent) in the third quarter and $420 million in the first nine months of 2022, compared with the same periods of 2021, primarily due to the
impacts of increasing delinquency rates, along with stronger growth in loan balances.
Treasury and Corporate Support Treasury and Corporate Support includes the Company’s investment portfolios, funding, capital management, interest rate risk
management, income taxes not allocated to the business lines, including most investments in tax-advantaged projects, and the residual aggregate of those
expenses associated with corporate activities that are managed on a consolidated basis. Treasury and Corporate Support recorded net income of $113 million in
the third quarter and $246 million in the first nine months of 2022, compared with net income of $378 million and $1.2 billion in the same periods of 2021,
respectively.
Net revenue increased $16 million (5.2 percent) in the third quarter and $110 million (13.3 percent) in the first nine months of 2022, compared with the
same periods of 2021. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, increased $7 million (8.1 percent) in the third quarter and $116 million (96.7 percent)
in the first nine months of 2022, compared with the same periods of 2021, primarily due to higher yields on the investment securities portfolio and interestbearing deposits with banks, mostly offset by higher funding costs. Noninterest income increased $9 million (4.1 percent) in the third quarter of 2022, compared
with the third quarter of 2021, primarily due to higher tax-advantaged investment syndication revenue and gains on the sale of certain assets, partially offset by
lower securities gains. Noninterest income decreased $6 million (0.8 percent) in the first nine months of 2022, compared with the first nine months of 2021,
primarily due to lower securities gains, partially offset by higher tax-advantaged investment syndication revenue, gains on the sale of certain assets, and higher
commercial products revenue.
Noninterest expense increased $97 million (48.5 percent) in the third quarter and $168 million (22.9 percent) in the first nine months of 2022, compared
with the same periods of 2021, primarily due to merger and integration-related charges associated with the planned acquisition of MUFG Union Bank and higher
compensation expense reflecting merit increases, hiring to support business growth and core business growth net of lower variable compensation, partially offset
by lower net shared services expense. The provision for credit losses increased $282 million (89.2 percent) in the third quarter and $1.2 billion (96.5 percent) in
the first nine months of 2022, compared with the same periods of 2021, reflecting the increase in the allowance for credit losses due to increasing economic
uncertainty in the current year, compared to the reduction in the allowance for credit losses associated with improving economic conditions in the prior year.
Income taxes are assessed to each line of business at a managerial tax rate of 25.0 percent with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the
consolidated effective tax rate included in Treasury and Corporate Support.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
In addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the Company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy,
including:
• Tangible common equity to tangible assets,
• Tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets, and
• Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, reflecting the full implementation of the CECL methodology.
These capital measures are viewed by management as useful additional methods of evaluating the Company’s utilization of its capital held and the level of
capital available to withstand unexpected negative market or economic conditions. Additionally, presentation of these measures allows investors, analysts
32 U.S. Bancorp
Table of Contents
and banking regulators to assess the Company’s capital position relative to other financial services companies. These capital measures are not defined in
generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), or are not currently effective or defined in banking regulations. In addition, certain of these measures differ
from currently effective capital ratios defined by banking regulations principally in that the currently effective ratios, which are subject to certain transitional
provisions, temporarily exclude the impact of the 2020 adoption of accounting guidance related to impairment of financial instruments based on the CECL
methodology. As a result, these capital measures disclosed by the Company may be considered non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes this
information helps investors assess trends in the Company’s capital adequacy.
The Company also discloses net interest income and related ratios and analysis on a taxable-equivalent basis, which may also be considered non-GAAP
financial measures. The Company believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison
of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. In addition, certain performance measures, including the efficiency ratio and net interest
margin utilize net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis.
There may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, the Company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial
statements and other financial information contained in this report in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure.
The following table shows the Company’s calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures:

CRITICALACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accounting and reporting policies of the Company comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and conform to general
practices within the banking industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions. The Company’s financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions, which are integral to understanding
the Company’s financial statements. Critical accounting policies are those policies management believes are the most important to the portrayal of the
Company’s financial condition and results, and require management to make estimates that are difficult, subjective or complex. Most accounting policies are not
considered by management to be critical accounting policies. Management has discussed the development and the selection of critical accounting policies with
the Company’s Audit Committee. Those policies considered to be critical accounting policies relate to the allowance for credit losses, fair value estimates,
MSRs, and income taxes. These accounting policies are discussed in detail in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Critical Accounting Policies” and the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the
Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)). Based upon this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer have
concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
During the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there was no change made in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting.
