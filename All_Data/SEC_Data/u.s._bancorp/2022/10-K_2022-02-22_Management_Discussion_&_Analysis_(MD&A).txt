Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Overview

In 2021, U.S. Bancorp and its subsidiaries (the “Company”)
continued to demonstrate its financial strength and diversified
business model. In a year where the economy continued to
recover from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the
Company maintained its sound credit quality and strong capital
and liquidity position, while continuing to invest in digital
capabilities and key business initiatives to drive growth in the
future.

The Company earned $8.0 billion in 2021, an increase of
$3.0 billion (60.6 percent) from 2020, reflecting a decrease in the
provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower pre-provision
operating income. The decrease in the provision for credit losses
was driven by improvement in the global economy, as well as
strong credit and collateral performance. Net interest income
decreased due to lower loan spreads and declining average loan
balances driven by commercial loan payoffs by business
customers, partially offset by changes in deposit and funding mix
and higher loan fees. Noninterest income decreased due to lower
mortgage banking revenue, commercial products revenue and
securities gains, partially offset by improvements in payment
services revenue, trust and investment management fees, deposit
service charges, treasury management fees and investment
products fees. Noninterest expense was higher reflecting
increases in compensation expense, employee benefits expense,
technology and communications expense, professional services
expense, and marketing and business development expense,
partially offset by lower net occupancy and equipment expense
and other noninterest expense.

In 2021, the Company increased deposits significantly, while
average loan balances decreased. Average loan balances in 2021
decreased $10.3 billion (3.4 percent) from 2020 primarily due to
lower commercial loans driven by continued payoffs by business
customers, lower commercial real estate loans as a result of

customer payoffs and lower credit card loans driven by higher
customer payment rates. These decreases were partially offset by
higher other retail loans, driven by growth in installment loans due
to strong auto and recreational vehicle lending, partially offset by
lower home equity and second mortgages as more customers
chose to refinance their existing first lien residential mortgage
balances during the prior year due to the low interest rate
environment. In addition, residential mortgages were higher due to
increased loan portfolio production and slower payoffs in the
mortgage portfolio. Average deposit balances in 2021 increased
$35.7 billion (8.9 percent) over 2020 primarily due to higher
noninterest-bearing and total savings deposit balances, partially
offset by lower time deposit balances. The growth in average
noninterest-bearing and total savings deposits was primarily a
result of the actions taken by the federal government to increase
liquidity in the financial system and government stimulus
programs.

The Company’s common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted

assets ratio, using the Basel III standardized approach was
10.0 percent at December 31, 2021. Refer to Table 22 for a
summary of the statutory capital ratios in effect for the Company
at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Further, credit rating
organizations rate the Company’s debt among the highest of any
bank in the world. This comparative financial strength provides
the Company with favorable funding costs, strong liquidity and
the ability to attract new customers.

The Company’s financial strength, diversified business model
and strong credit quality position it well for 2022. The Company
looks to continue building momentum in each of the lines of
business, as the investments made in digital transformation and
payments ecosystem initiatives will continue to enable customer
and revenue growth, and the Company expects continued
momentum in customer spend activity and loan growth.

Earnings Summary The Company reported net income
attributable to U.S. Bancorp of $8.0 billion in 2021, or $5.10 per
diluted common share, compared with $5.0 billion, or $3.06 per
diluted common share, in 2020. Return on average assets and
return on average common equity were 1.43 percent and
16.0 percent, respectively, in 2021, compared with 0.93 percent
and 10.0 percent, respectively, in 2020.

Total net revenue for 2021 was $498 million (2.1 percent)
lower than 2020, reflecting a 2.6 percent decrease in net interest
income (2.5 percent on a taxable-equivalent basis) and a
1.7 percent decrease in noninterest income. The decrease in net
interest income from the prior year was due to lower loan spreads
and declining average loan balances driven by commercial loan
payoffs by business customers, partially offset by changes in
deposit and funding mix and higher loan fees. The decrease in
noninterest income was driven by lower mortgage banking
revenue, commercial products revenue and securities gains,
partially offset by improvements in payment services revenue,
trust and investment management fees, deposit service charges,
treasury management fees and investment products fees.

Noninterest expense in 2021 was $359 million (2.7 percent)
higher than 2020, reflecting increases in compensation expense,
employee benefits expense, technology and communications
expense, professional services expense, and marketing and
business development expense, partially offset by lower net
occupancy and equipment expense and other noninterest
expense.

Results for 2020 Compared With 2019 For discussion related
to changes in financial condition and results of operations for
2020 compared with 2019, refer to “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on February 23, 2021.

Pending Acquisition In September 2021, the Company
announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to
acquire MUFG Union Bank’s core regional banking franchise from
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (“MUFG”), for an expected
purchase price of approximately $8.0 billion, including $5.5 billion
in cash and approximately 44 million shares of U.S. Bancorp
common stock. The transaction excludes the purchase of MUFG
Union Bank’s Global Corporate & Investment Bank, certain
middle and back office functions, and other assets. MUFG Union
Bank currently has approximately 300 branches in California,
Washington and Oregon and is expected to add approximately
$105 billion in total assets, $58 billion of loans and $90 billion of
deposits to the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The
transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2022, subject to
customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.

Statement of Income Analysis

Net Interest Income Net interest income, on a taxable-
equivalent basis, was $12.6 billion in 2021, compared with
$12.9 billion in 2020. The $324 million (2.5 percent) decrease in
net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, in 2021
compared with 2020, was principally driven by lower loan
spreads and declining average loan balances driven by
commercial loan payoffs by corporate customers accessing the
capital markets and government supported loan programs,
partially offset by changes in deposit and funding mix and higher
loan fees driven by accelerated loan forgiveness from the Small
Business Administration (“SBA”) Paycheck Protection Program.
Average earning assets were $24.7 billion (5.1 percent) higher in
2021, compared with 2020, reflecting increases in investment
securities and other earning assets primarily representing cash
balances, while average loans decreased due to continued
payoffs by corporate customers. The net interest margin, on a
taxable-equivalent basis, in 2021 was 2.49 percent, compared
with 2.68 percent in 2020. The decrease in the net interest
margin in 2021, compared with 2020, was primarily due to the
mix of loans, lower loan spreads and higher investment securities
and cash balances, partially offset by changes in deposit and
funding mix and higher loan fees. Refer to the “Interest Rate Risk
Management” section for further information on the sensitivity of
the Company’s net interest income to changes in interest rates.
Average total loans were $297.0 billion in 2021, compared

with $307.3 billion in 2020. The $10.3 billion (3.4 percent)
decrease was primarily due to lower commercial loans,
commercial real estate loans and credit card loans, partially offset
by higher residential mortgages and other retail loans. Average
commercial loans decreased $11.1 billion (9.8 percent), driven by
continued payoffs by corporate customers that accessed the
capital markets and government supported loan programs.
Average commercial real estate loans decreased $1.8 billion (4.4
percent), the result of customer payoffs. Average credit card
loans decreased $687 million (3.1 percent), driven by higher
customer payment rates. Average residential mortgages
increased $962 million (1.3 percent) due to increased loan
portfolio production and slower payoffs in the mortgage portfolio.
Average other retail loans increased $2.3 billion (4.1 percent),
driven by growth in installment loans due to strong auto and
recreational vehicle lending, partially offset by lower home equity
and second mortgages as more customers chose to refinance
their existing first lien residential mortgage balances during the
prior year due to the low interest rate environment.

Interest and rates are presented on a fully taxable-equivalent basis based on a federal income tax rate of 21 percent.

(b) See Non-GAAP Financial Measures beginning on page 60.

(c) Excludes unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investment securities and any premiums or discounts recorded related to the transfer of investment securities at fair value from

available-for-sale to held-to-maturity.

Average investment securities in 2021 were $28.7 billion (22.8

percent) higher than in 2020, primarily due to purchases of
mortgage-backed, U.S. Treasury and state and political
securities, net of prepayments and maturities.

Average total deposits for 2021 were $35.7 billion (8.9

percent) higher than 2020. Average noninterest-bearing deposits
were $28.7 billion (29.1 percent) higher in 2021, compared with
2020, reflecting increases across all business lines. Average total
savings deposits for 2021 were $20.4 billion (7.8 percent) higher
than 2020, driven by increases in Consumer and Business

Banking balances, partially offset by decreases in Corporate and
Commercial Banking balances. The growth in average
noninterest-bearing and total savings deposits was primarily a
result of the actions by the federal government to increase
liquidity in the financial system and government stimulus
programs. Average time deposits for 2021 were $13.4 billion
(35.3 percent) lower than 2020, driven by decreases across most
business lines. Time deposits are managed as an alternative to
other funding sources, based largely on relative pricing and
liquidity characteristics.

(a) This table shows the components of the change in net interest income by volume and rate on a taxable-equivalent basis based on a federal income tax rate of 21 percent. This table does not

take into account the level of noninterest-bearing funding, nor does it fully reflect changes in the mix of assets and liabilities. The change in interest not solely due to changes in volume or rates

has been allocated on a pro-rata basis to volume and yield/rate.

Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses
reflects changes in economic conditions and the size and credit
quality of the entire portfolio of loans. The Company maintains an
allowance for credit losses considered appropriate by
management for expected losses, based on factors discussed in
the “Analysis and Determination of Allowance for Credit Losses”
section.

In 2021, the provision for credit losses was a benefit of
$1.2 billion, compared with a provision for credit losses of
$3.8 billion in 2020. The change was driven by the Company
recognizing a decrease in the allowance for credit losses during
2021 as a result of improvement in the global economy, as well
as strong credit and collateral performance, compared with the
Company recognizing an increase in the allowance for credit

losses in 2020 due to deteriorating economic conditions related
to COVID-19. Net charge-offs decreased $1.1 billion
(61.8 percent) in 2021, compared with 2020, reflecting
improvements across all loan categories. Nonperforming assets
decreased $420 million (32.4 percent) from December 31, 2020
to December 31, 2021, primarily driven by decreases in
nonperforming commercial and commercial real estate loans.

Refer to “Corporate Risk Profile” for further information on the
provision for credit losses, net charge-offs, nonperforming assets
and other factors considered by the Company in assessing the
credit quality of the loan portfolio and establishing the allowance
for credit losses.

Noninterest Income Noninterest income in 2021 was
$10.2 billion, compared with $10.4 billion in 2020. The
$174 million (1.7 percent) decrease in 2021 from 2020 reflected
lower mortgage banking revenue, commercial products revenue,
other noninterest income and securities gains, partially offset by
higher payment services revenue, trust and investment
management fees, deposit service charges, treasury management
fees and investment products fees. Mortgage banking revenue
decreased 34.1 percent in 2021, compared with 2020, due to
lower application volume, given declining refinancing activity, and
related gain on sale margins, along with declines in mortgage
servicing rights (“MSRs”) valuations, net of hedging activities.
Commercial products revenue decreased 3.6 percent in 2021,
compared with 2020, primarily due to lower capital markets
activity and trading revenue, partially offset by higher syndication
revenue and fees, higher non-yield loan fees as a result of higher
unused commitments, and higher foreign currency customer
activity. Other noninterest income decreased 3.6 percent in 2021,
compared with 2020, driven by lower equity investment income
and the 2020 impact of transition services agreement revenue
associated with the sale of the Company’s ATM third-party
servicing business, partially offset by higher retail leasing end of
term residual gains and the 2020 impact of certain asset
impairments as a result of branch optimization. During 2020,
payment services revenue had been adversely affected by the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer and business

TABLE 5 Noninterest Expense

spending, particularly related to travel and entertainment activities.
However, spending has strengthened across most sectors driven
by government stimulus, local jurisdictions reducing restrictions
and consumer behaviors normalizing. As a result, payment
services revenue increased in 2021, compared with 2020, driven
by a 12.6 percent increase in credit and debit card revenue, a
15.7 percent increase in corporate payment products revenue and
a 14.9 percent increase in merchant processing services revenue.
Credit and debit card revenue growth related to stronger sales
volume and fee activity, partially offset by investment in customer
acquisition. Corporate payment products revenue increased
primarily due to improving business spending, while merchant
processing services revenue increased driven by higher sales
volume as well as merchant fees. Trust and investment
management fees increased 5.5 percent driven by business
growth, favorable market conditions and activity related to the
acquisition of PFM Asset Management LLC (“PFM”), partially offset
by higher fee waivers. Deposit service charges increased
6.9 percent primarily due to stronger customer activity. Treasury
management fees increased 8.1 percent due to core growth
driven by the COVID-19 economic recovery. Investment products
fees increased 24.5 percent primarily driven by favorable market
conditions and growth.

Noninterest Expense Noninterest expense in 2021 was
$13.7 billion, compared with $13.4 billion in 2020. The
Company’s efficiency ratio was 60.4 percent in 2021, compared
with 57.8 percent in 2020. The $359 million (2.7 percent) increase
in noninterest expense in 2021 over 2020 was driven by higher
compensation expense, employee benefits expense, technology
and communications expense, professional services expense,
and marketing and business development expense, partially
offset by lower net occupancy and equipment expense and other
noninterest expense. Compensation expense increased
10.0 percent in 2021 over 2020, due to higher performance-
based incentives, revenue related commissions, merit increases
and hiring to support business growth. Employee benefits
expense increased 9.7 percent driven by higher medical claims
expense, compensation related payroll taxes and pension
expense. Technology and communications expense increased
12.4 percent primarily due to expenditures supporting business
investments. Professional services expense increased
14.4 percent primarily due to an increase in business investment
and related initiatives in 2021. Marketing and business
development expense increased 15.1 percent due to the timing
of marketing campaigns supporting business development and
lower marketing activities in 2020 during the pandemic. Net
occupancy and equipment expense decreased 4.0 percent
primarily due to branch closures. Other noninterest expense
decreased 34.2 percent, primarily due to higher COVID-19
related expenses in 2020 including recognizing liabilities related to
future delivery exposures for merchant and airline processing, as
well as lower amortization related to tax-advantaged projects
which were scaled back in 2020 during the pandemic.

Pension Plans Because of the long-term nature of pension
plans, the related accounting is complex and can be impacted by
several factors, including investment funding policies, accounting
methods and actuarial assumptions.

The Company’s pension accounting reflects the long-term
nature of the benefit obligations and the investment horizon of
plan assets. Amounts recorded in the financial statements reflect
actuarial assumptions about participant benefits and plan asset
returns. Changes in actuarial assumptions and differences in
actual plan experience, compared with actuarial assumptions, are
deferred and recognized in expense in future periods.

Pension expense is expected to decrease by approximately
$20 million to $181 million in 2022, primarily related to the return
on higher plan assets and a higher discount rate, partially offset
by demographic experience. Because of the complexity of
forecasting pension plan activities, the accounting methods
utilized for pension plans, the Company’s ability to respond to
factors affecting the plans and the hypothetical nature of actuarial
assumptions, the actual pension expense may differ from the
expected amount.

Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial

Statements for further information on the Company’s pension
plan funding practices, investment policies and asset allocation
strategies, and accounting policies for pension plans.

The following table shows the effect of hypothetical changes in
the discount rate and long-term rate of return (“LTROR”) on the
Company’s expected 2022 pension expense:

Income Tax Expense The provision for income taxes was
$2.2 billion (an effective rate of 21.5 percent) in 2021, compared
with $1.1 billion (an effective rate of 17.6 percent) in 2020. The
higher tax rate for 2021 was due to the marginal impact of
providing taxes on higher pretax earnings in 2021.

For further information on income taxes, refer to Note 19 of

the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Balance Sheet Analysis

Average earning assets were $506.1 billion in 2021, compared
with $481.4 billion in 2020. The increase in average earning
assets of $24.7 billion (5.1 percent) was primarily due to
increases in investment securities of $28.7 billion (22.8 percent)
and other earning assets of $5.3 billion (12.8 percent), primarily
representing higher cash balances, partially offset by a decrease
in loans of $10.3 billion (3.4 percent).

For average balance information, refer to Consolidated Daily
Average Balance Sheet and Related Yields and Rates on pages
134 and 135.

Loans The Company’s loan portfolio was $312.0 billion at
December 31, 2021, compared with $297.7 billion at
December 31, 2020, an increase of $14.3 billion (4.8 percent).
The increase was driven by increases in commercial loans of
$9.2 billion (8.9 percent), other retail loans of $4.9 billion (8.7%),
residential mortgages of $338 million (0.4 percent) and credit
card loans of $154 million (0.7 percent), partially offset by a
decrease in commercial real estate loans of $258 million
(0.7 percent). Table 6 provides a summary of the loan distribution
by product type, while Table 7 provides a summary of the
selected loan maturity distribution by loan category. Average total
loans decreased $10.3 billion (3.4 percent) in 2021, compared
with 2020. The decrease was due to lower commercial loans,
commercial real estate loans and credit card loans, partially offset
by increases in other retail loans and residential mortgages.

Commercial Real Estate The Company’s portfolio of
commercial real estate loans, which includes commercial
mortgages and construction and development loans, decreased
$258 million (0.7 percent) at December 31, 2021, compared with
December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily the result of
customers paying down balances. Average commercial real
estate loans decreased $1.8 billion (4.4 percent) in 2021,
compared with 2020. Table 9 provides a summary of commercial
real estate loans by property type and geographical location.

At December 31, 2021 and 2020, $72 million and $80 million,

respectively, of tax-exempt industrial development loans were

secured by real estate. The Company’s commercial mortgage
and construction and development loans had unfunded
commitments of $11.8 billion and $11.3 billion at December 31,
2021 and 2020, respectively.

The Company also finances the operations of real estate
developers and other entities with operations related to real
estate. These loans are not secured directly by real estate but
have similar characteristics to commercial real estate loans.
These loans were included in the commercial loan category and
totaled $16.6 billion and $14.0 billion at December 31, 2021 and
2020, respectively.

Residential Mortgages Residential mortgages held in the loan
portfolio at December 31, 2021, increased $338 million (0.4

mortgages increased $962 million (1.3 percent) in 2021,
compared with 2020. Residential mortgages originated and
placed in the Company’s loan portfolio include well-secured
jumbo mortgages and branch-originated first lien home equity
loans to borrowers with high credit quality.

home equity and second mortgages and other retail loans,
increased $4.9 billion (8.7 percent) at December 31, 2021,
compared with December 31, 2020, reflecting increases in auto
loans and installment loans, partially offset by decreases in home
equity loans and retail leasing balances. Average other retail loans

The Company generally retains portfolio loans through

maturity; however, the Company’s intent may change over time
based upon various factors such as ongoing asset/liability
management activities, assessment of product profitability, credit
risk, liquidity needs, and capital implications. If the Company’s
intent or ability to hold an existing portfolio loan changes, it is
transferred to loans held for sale.

Loans Held for Sale Loans held for sale, consisting primarily of
residential mortgages to be sold in the secondary market, were

TABLE 13 Investment Securities

$7.8 billion at December 31, 2021, compared with $8.8 billion at
December 31, 2020. The decrease in loans held for sale was
principally due to a lower level of mortgage loan closings in late
2021, compared with the same period of 2020. Almost all of the
residential mortgage loans the Company originates or purchases
for sale follow guidelines that allow the loans to be sold into
existing, highly liquid secondary markets; in particular in
government agency transactions and to government sponsored
enterprises (“GSEs”).

Information related to asset and mortgage-backed securities included above is presented based upon weighted-average maturities that take into account anticipated future prepayments.

(b) Information related to obligations of state and political subdivisions is presented based upon yield to first optional call date if the security is purchased at a premium, and yield to maturity if the

security is purchased at par or a discount.

(c) Maturity calculations for obligations of state and political subdivisions are based on the first optional call date for securities with a fair value above par and the contractual maturity date for

securities with a fair value equal to or below par.

(d) Yields on investment securities are computed based on amortized cost balances. Weighted-average yields for obligations of state and political subdivisions are presented on a fully-taxable

equivalent basis based on a federal income tax rate of 21 percent.

Investment Securities The Company uses its investment
securities portfolio to manage interest rate risk, provide liquidity
(including the ability to meet regulatory requirements), generate
interest and dividend income, and as collateral for public deposits
and wholesale funding sources. While the Company intends to
hold its investment securities indefinitely, it may sell
available-for-sale investment securities in response to structural
changes in the balance sheet and related interest rate risk and to
meet liquidity requirements, among other factors.

Investment securities totaled $174.8 billion at December 31,
2021, compared with $136.8 billion at December 31, 2020. The
$38.0 billion (27.8 percent) increase reflected $41.9 billion of net
investment purchases, partially offset by a $3.8 billion unfavorable
change in net unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale
investment securities. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the
Company transferred $43.1 billion amortized cost ($41.8 billion
fair value) of available-for-sale investment securities to the
held-to-maturity category to reflect its new intent for these
securities. The Company had no outstanding investment
securities classified as held-to-maturity at December 31, 2020.
Average investment securities were $154.7 billion in 2021,
compared with $126.0 billion in 2020. The weighted-average
yield of the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio was
1.73 percent at December 31, 2021, compared with
1.61 percent at December 31, 2020. The weighted-average
maturity of the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio
was 5.5 years at December 31, 2021, compared with 3.4 years
at December 31, 2020. The weighted-average yield of the
held-to-maturity investment securities portfolio was 1.45 percent
at December 31, 2021. The weighted-average maturity of the
held-to-maturity investment securities portfolio was 7.4 years at
December 31, 2021. Investment securities by type are shown in
Table 13.

The Company’s available-for-sale investment securities are
carried at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in other
comprehensive income (loss) unless a portion of a security’s
unrealized loss is related to credit and an allowance for credit
losses is necessary. At December 31, 2021, the Company’s net
unrealized gains on available-for-sale investment securities were
$722 million, compared with $3.2 billion at December 31, 2020.
The unfavorable change in net unrealized gains was primarily due
to decreases in the fair value of mortgage-backed and U.S.
Treasury securities as a result of changes in interest rates,
partially offset by the impact of the transfer of available-for-sale
investment securities to the held-to-maturity category. Gross
unrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities
totaled $812 million at December 31, 2021, compared with
$53 million at December 31, 2020. When evaluating credit losses,
the Company considers various factors such as the nature of the
investment security, the credit ratings or financial condition of the

issuer, the extent of the unrealized loss, expected cash flows of
the underlying collateral, the existence of any government or
agency guarantees, and market conditions. At December 31,
2021, the Company had no plans to sell securities with unrealized
losses, and believes it is more likely than not that it would not be
required to sell such securities before recovery of their amortized
cost.

Refer to Notes 5 and 22 in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for further information on investment
securities.

Deposits Total deposits were $456.1 billion at December 31,
2021, compared with $429.8 billion at December 31, 2020. The
$26.3 billion (6.1 percent) increase in total deposits reflected
increases in noninterest-bearing and total savings deposits,
partially offset by a decrease in time deposits. Average total
deposits in 2021 increased $35.7 billion (8.9 percent) over 2020.

Noninterest-bearing deposits at December 31, 2021,

increased $16.8 billion (14.2 percent) from December 31, 2020.
The increase was driven by higher Wealth Management and
Investment Services, and Corporate and Commercial Banking
balances. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased
$28.7 billion (29.1 percent) in 2021, compared with 2020.

Interest-bearing savings deposits increased $17.5 billion

(6.2 percent) at December 31, 2021, compared with
December 31, 2020. The increase was related to higher interest
checking and savings account deposit balances, partially offset
by lower money market deposit balances. Interest checking
balances increased $19.2 billion (20.0 percent) primarily due to
higher Consumer and Business Banking, and Corporate and
Commercial Banking balances. Savings account balances
increased $8.8 billion (15.3 percent), driven by higher Consumer
and Business Banking balances. Money market deposit balances
decreased $10.4 billion (8.2 percent), primarily due to lower
Wealth Management and Investment Services balances, partially
offset by higher Corporate and Commercial Banking balances.
Average interest-bearing savings deposits increased $20.4 billion
(7.8 percent) in 2021, compared with 2020, reflecting higher
Consumer and Business Banking balances, partially offset by
lower Corporate and Commercial Banking balances.

Interest-bearing time deposits at December 31, 2021,

decreased $8.0 billion (26.2 percent), compared with
December 31, 2020. Average time deposits decreased
$13.4 billion (35.3 percent) in 2021, compared with 2020. The
decreases were primarily driven by lower Corporate and
Commercial Banking, Consumer and Business Banking, and
Wealth Management and Investment Services balances. Changes
in time deposits are primarily related to those deposits managed
as an alternative to other funding sources, based largely on
relative pricing and liquidity characteristics.

Borrowings The Company utilizes both short-term and long-
term borrowings as part of its asset/liability management and
funding strategies. Short-term borrowings, which include federal
funds purchased, commercial paper, repurchase agreements,
borrowings secured by high-grade assets and other short-term
borrowings, were $11.8 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
The $30 million (0.3 percent) increase in short-term borrowings at
December 31, 2021, compared with December 31, 2020,
reflected higher repurchase agreement and commercial paper
balances, mostly offset by lower federal funds purchased
balances.

Long-term debt was $32.1 billion at December 31, 2021,

compared with $41.3 billion at December 31, 2020. The
$9.2 billion (22.2 percent) decrease was primarily due to
$7.0 billion of bank note repayments and maturities, $3.0 billion
of medium-term note repayments and a $1.0 billion decrease in
Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances, partially offset by
$1.0 billion of bank note and $1.3 billion of subordinated note
issuances.

Refer to Notes 13 and 14 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information regarding short-
term borrowings and long-term debt, and the “Liquidity Risk
Management” section for discussion of liquidity management of
the Company.

Corporate Risk Profile

Overview Managing risks is an essential part of successfully
operating a financial services company. The Company’s Board of
Directors has approved a risk management framework which
establishes governance and risk management requirements for all
risk-taking activities. This framework includes Company and
business line risk appetite statements which set boundaries for
the types and amount of risk that may be undertaken in pursuing
business objectives and initiatives. The Board of Directors,
primarily through its Risk Management Committee, oversees
performance relative to the risk management framework, risk
appetite statements, and other policy requirements.

The Executive Risk Committee (“ERC”), which is chaired by
the Chief Risk Officer and includes the Chief Executive Officer and
other members of the executive management team, oversees
execution against the risk management framework and risk
appetite statements. The ERC focuses on current and emerging
risks, including strategic and reputation risks, by directing timely
and comprehensive actions. Senior operating committees have
also been established, each responsible for overseeing a
specified category of risk.

The Company’s most prominent risk exposures are credit,
interest rate, market, liquidity, operational, compliance, strategic,
and reputation. Leveraging the Company’s risk management
framework, the specific impacts of COVID-19 and related risks

35

are identified for each of the most prominent exposures. With
respect to direct impacts from COVID-19, oversight and
governance is managed through a centralized command center
with frequent reporting to the Managing Committee and ERC.
The Board of Directors also oversees the Company’s
responsiveness to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Credit risk is the risk of loss associated with a change in the
credit profile or the failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet
its contractual obligations. Interest rate risk is the current or
prospective risk to earnings and capital, or market valuations,
arising from the impact of changes in interest rates. Market risk
arises from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates,
and security prices that may result in changes in the values of
financial instruments, such as trading and available-for-sale
securities, mortgage loans held for sale (“MLHFS”), MSRs and
derivatives that are accounted for on a fair value basis. Liquidity
risk is the risk that financial condition or overall safety and
soundness is adversely affected by the Company’s inability, or
perceived inability, to meet its cash flow obligations in a timely
and complete manner in either normal or stressed conditions.
Operational risk is the risk to current or projected financial
condition and resilience arising from inadequate or failed internal
processes or systems, people (including human errors or
misconduct), or adverse external events, including the risk of loss
resulting from breaches in data security. Operational risk can also
include the risk of loss due to failures by third parties with which
the Company does business. Compliance risk is the risk that the
Company may suffer legal or regulatory sanctions, financial
losses, and reputational damage if it fails to adhere to compliance
requirements and the Company’s compliance policies. Strategic
risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and
resilience arising from adverse business decisions, poor
implementation of business decisions, or lack of responsiveness
to changes in the banking industry and operating environment.
Reputation risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings,
capital, or franchise or enterprise value arising from negative
public opinion. This risk may impair the Company’s
competitiveness by affecting its ability to establish new
relationships or services, or continue serving existing
relationships. In addition to the risks identified above, other risk
factors exist that may impact the Company. Refer to “Risk
Factors” beginning on page 137, for a detailed discussion of
these factors.

The Company’s Board and management-level governance
committees are supported by a “three lines of defense” model for
establishing effective checks and balances. The first line of
defense, the business lines, manages risks in conformity with
established limits and policy requirements. In turn, business line
leaders and their risk officers establish programs to ensure
conformity with these limits and policy requirements. The second
line of defense, which includes the Chief Risk Officer’s
organization as well as policy and oversight activities of corporate
support functions, translates risk appetite and strategy into
actionable risk limits and policies. The second line of defense
monitors first line of defense conformity with limits and policies,

and provides reporting and escalation of emerging risks and
other concerns to senior management and the Risk Management
Committee of the Board of Directors. The third line of defense,
internal audit, is responsible for providing the Audit Committee of
the Board of Directors and senior management with independent
assessment and assurance regarding the effectiveness of the
Company’s governance, risk management and control
processes.

Management regularly provides reports to the Risk Management

Committee of the Board of Directors. The Risk Management
Committee discusses with management the Company’s risk
management performance, and provides a summary of key risks to
the entire Board of Directors, covering the status of existing matters,
areas of potential future concern and specific information on certain
types of loss events. The Risk Management Committee considers
quarterly reports by management assessing the Company’s
performance relative to the risk appetite statements and the
associated risk limits, including:

– Macroeconomic environment and other qualitative

considerations, such as regulatory and compliance changes,
litigation developments, and technology and cybersecurity;

– Credit measures, including adversely rated and nonperforming

loans, leveraged transactions, credit concentrations and lending
limits;

– Interest rate and market risk, including market value and net
income simulation, and trading-related Value at Risk (“VaR”);

– Liquidity risk, including funding projections under various

stressed scenarios;

– Operational and compliance risk, including losses stemming

from events such as fraud, processing errors, control breaches,
breaches in data security or adverse business decisions, as well
as reporting on technology performance, and various legal and
regulatory compliance measures;

– Capital ratios and projections, including regulatory measures

and stressed scenarios; and

– Strategic and reputation risk considerations, impacts and

responses.

Credit Risk Management The Company’s strategy for credit
risk management includes well-defined, centralized credit
policies, uniform underwriting criteria, and ongoing risk monitoring
and review processes for all commercial and consumer credit
exposures. The strategy also emphasizes diversification on a
geographic, industry and customer level, regular credit
examinations and management reviews of loans exhibiting
deterioration of credit quality. The Risk Management Committee
oversees the Company’s credit risk management process.

In addition, credit quality ratings as defined by the Company,

are an important part of the Company’s overall credit risk
management and evaluation of its allowance for credit losses.
Loans with a pass rating represent those loans not classified on
the Company’s rating scale for problem credits, as minimal credit
risk has been identified. Loans with a special mention or classified
rating, including consumer lending and small business loans that
are 90 days or more past due and still accruing, nonaccrual

36

loans, those loans considered troubled debt restructurings
(“TDRs”), and loans in a junior lien position that are current but are
behind a first lien position on nonaccrual, encompass all loans
held by the Company that it considers to have a potential or well-
defined weakness that may put full collection of contractual cash
flows at risk. The Company’s internal credit quality ratings for
consumer loans are primarily based on delinquency and
nonperforming status, except for a limited population of larger
loans within those portfolios that are individually evaluated. For
this limited population, the determination of the internal credit
quality rating may also consider collateral value and customer
cash flows. Refer to Notes 1 and 6 in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s loan
portfolios including internal credit quality ratings.

The Company categorizes its loan portfolio into two

segments, which is the level at which it develops and documents
a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit
losses. The Company’s two loan portfolio segments are
commercial lending and consumer lending.

The commercial lending segment includes loans and leases

made to small business, middle market, large corporate,
commercial real estate, financial institution, non-profit and public
sector customers. Key risk characteristics relevant to commercial
lending segment loans include the industry and geography of the
borrower’s business, purpose of the loan, repayment source,
borrower’s debt capacity and financial flexibility, loan covenants,
and nature of pledged collateral, if any, as well as
macroeconomic factors such as unemployment rates, gross
domestic product levels, corporate bond spreads and long-term
interest rates, all of which have been impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic. These risk characteristics, among others, are
considered in determining estimates about the likelihood of
default by the borrowers and the severity of loss in the event of
default. The Company considers these risk characteristics in
assigning internal risk ratings to, or forecasting losses on, these
loans, which are the significant factors in determining the
allowance for credit losses for loans in the commercial lending
segment.

The consumer lending segment represents loans and leases
made to consumer customers, including residential mortgages,
credit card loans, and other retail loans such as revolving
consumer lines, auto loans and leases, home equity loans and
lines, and student loans, a run-off portfolio. Home equity or
second mortgage loans are junior lien closed-end accounts fully
disbursed at origination. These loans typically are fixed rate loans,
secured by residential real estate, with a 10- or 15-year fixed
payment amortization schedule. Home equity lines are revolving
accounts giving the borrower the ability to draw and repay
balances repeatedly, up to a maximum commitment, and are
secured by residential real estate. These include accounts in
either a first or junior lien position. Typical terms on home equity
lines in the portfolio are variable rates benchmarked to the prime
rate, with a 10- or 15-year draw period during which a minimum
payment is equivalent to the monthly interest, followed by a 20-
or 10-year amortization period, respectively. At December 31,

2021, substantially all of the Company’s home equity lines were
in the draw period. Approximately $1.2 billion, or 13 percent, of
the outstanding home equity line balances at December 31,
2021, will enter the amortization period within the next 36
months. Key risk characteristics relevant to consumer lending
segment loans primarily relate to the borrowers’ capacity and
willingness to repay and include unemployment rates, consumer
bankruptcy filings and other macroeconomic factors, customer
payment history and credit scores, and in some cases, updated
loan-to-value (“LTV”) information reflecting current market
conditions on real estate-based loans. These and other risk
characteristics, including risk resulting from the COVID-19
pandemic, are reflected in forecasts of delinquency levels,
bankruptcies and losses which are the primary factors in
determining the allowance for credit losses for the consumer
lending segment.

The Company further disaggregates its loan portfolio
segments into various classes based on their underlying risk
characteristics. The two classes within the commercial lending
segment are commercial loans and commercial real estate loans.
The three classes within the consumer lending segment are
residential mortgages, credit card loans and other retail loans.

Because business processes and credit risks associated with

unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as for
loans, the Company utilizes similar processes to estimate its
liability for unfunded credit commitments. The Company also
engages in non-lending activities that may give rise to credit risk,
including derivative transactions for balance sheet hedging
purposes, foreign exchange transactions, deposit overdrafts and
interest rate contracts for customers, investments in securities
and other financial assets, and settlement risk, including
Automated Clearing House transactions and the processing of
credit card transactions for merchants. These activities are
subject to credit review, analysis and approval processes.

Economic and Other Factors In evaluating its credit risk, the
Company considers changes, if any, in underwriting activities, the
loan portfolio composition (including product mix and geographic,
industry or customer-specific concentrations), collateral values,
trends in loan performance and macroeconomic factors, such as
changes in unemployment rates, gross domestic product levels
and consumer bankruptcy filings, as well as the potential impact
on customers and the domestic economy resulting from the
COVID-19 pandemic.

During the first half of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and the

mitigation efforts put in place by companies, consumers and
governmental authorities to contain it, created the most severe
negative impact to the domestic economy since the Great
Depression. During 2021, factors affecting economic conditions,
including the enactment of additional benefits from government
stimulus programs and broad vaccine availability in the
United States, have contributed to economic improvement. As a
result, economic projections for both the gross domestic product
and unemployment levels improved from the prior year. However,
economic uncertainty remains associated with supply chain
concerns, rising inflationary concerns and additional virus variants.

37

Credit Diversification The Company manages its credit risk, in
part, through diversification of its loan portfolio which is achieved
through limit setting by product type criteria, such as industry,
and identification of credit concentrations. As part of its normal
business activities, the Company offers a broad array of
traditional commercial lending products and specialized products
such as asset-based lending, commercial lease financing,
agricultural credit, warehouse mortgage lending, small business
lending, commercial real estate lending, health care lending and
correspondent banking financing. The Company also offers an
array of consumer lending products, including residential
mortgages, credit card loans, auto loans, retail leases, home
equity loans and lines, revolving credit arrangements and other
consumer loans. These consumer lending products are primarily
offered through the branch office network, home mortgage and
loan production offices, mobile and on-line banking, and indirect
distribution channels, such as auto and recreational vehicle
dealers. The Company monitors and manages the portfolio
diversification by industry, customer and geography. Table 6
provides information with respect to the overall product
diversification and changes in the mix during 2021.

The commercial loan class is diversified among various
industries with higher concentrations in real estate and financial
institutions. Additionally, the commercial loan class is diversified
across the Company’s geographical markets, with a higher
concentration in California. Table 8 provides a summary of
significant industry groups and geographical locations of
commercial loans outstanding at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
The commercial real estate loan class reflects the Company’s
focus on serving business owners within states encompassing its
branch office network, as well as regional and national
investment-based real estate owners and builders. Within the
commercial real estate loan class, different property types have
varying degrees of credit risk. Table 9 provides a summary of the
significant property types and geographical locations of
commercial real estate loans outstanding at December 31, 2021
and 2020. At December 31, 2021, approximately 21.1 percent of
the commercial real estate loans represented business owner-
occupied properties that tend to exhibit less credit risk than non

owner-occupied properties. The investment-based real estate
mortgages are diversified among various property types with
somewhat higher concentrations in multi-family, office, industrial
and retail properties. From a geographical perspective, the
Company’s commercial real estate loan class is generally well
diversified, with a higher concentration in California.

The Company’s consumer lending segment utilizes several
distinct business processes and channels to originate consumer
credit, including traditional branch lending, mobile and on-line
banking, indirect lending, alliance partnerships and
correspondent banks. Each distinct underwriting and origination
activity manages unique credit risk characteristics and prices its
loan production commensurate with the differing risk profiles.
Residential mortgage originations are generally limited to
prime borrowers and are performed through the Company’s
branches, loan production offices, mobile and on-line services,
and a wholesale network of originators. The Company may retain
residential mortgage loans it originates on its balance sheet or sell
the loans into the secondary market while retaining the servicing
rights and customer relationships. Utilizing the secondary markets
enables the Company to effectively reduce its credit and other
asset/liability risks. For residential mortgages that are retained in
the Company’s portfolio and for home equity and second
mortgages, credit risk is also diversified by geography and
managed by adherence to LTV and borrower credit criteria during
the underwriting process.

The Company estimates updated LTV information on its
outstanding residential mortgages quarterly, based on a method
that combines automated valuation model updates and relevant
home price indices. LTV is the ratio of the loan’s outstanding
principal balance to the current estimate of property value. For
home equity and second mortgages, combined loan-to-value
(“CLTV”) is the combination of the first mortgage original principal
balance and the second lien outstanding principal balance,
relative to the current estimate of property value. Certain loans do
not have an LTV or CLTV, primarily due to lack of availability of
relevant automated valuation model and/or home price indices
values, or lack of necessary valuation data on acquired loans.

Home equity and second mortgages were $10.4 billion at

December 31, 2021, compared with $12.5 billion at
December 31, 2020, and included $3.0 billion of home equity lines
in a first lien position and $7.4 billion of home equity and second
mortgage loans and lines in a junior lien position. Loans and lines
in a junior lien position at December 31, 2021, included
approximately $2.6 billion of loans and lines for which the
Company also serviced the related first lien loan, and

approximately $4.8 billion where the Company did not service the
related first lien loan. The Company was able to determine the
status of the related first liens using information the Company has
as the servicer of the first lien or information reported on
customer credit bureau files. The Company also evaluates other
indicators of credit risk for these junior lien loans and lines,
including delinquency, estimated average CLTV ratios and
updated weighted-average credit scores in making its
assessment of credit risk, related loss estimates and determining
the allowance for credit losses.

(a) Delinquent loan ratios exclude $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, of loans purchased from GNMA mortgage pools whose repayments are primarily

insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Including these loans, the ratio of residential mortgages 90 days or more past

due including all nonperforming loans was 2.43 percent and 2.87 percent at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Loan Delinquencies Trends in delinquency ratios are an
indicator, among other considerations, of credit risk within the
Company’s loan portfolios. The entire balance of a loan account
is considered delinquent if the minimum payment contractually
required to be made is not received by the date specified on the
billing statement. The Company measures delinquencies, both
including and excluding nonperforming loans, to enable
comparability with other companies. Delinquent loans purchased
from GNMA mortgage pools whose repayments are primarily
insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by
the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, are excluded
from delinquency statistics. In addition, in certain situations, a
consumer lending customer’s account may be re-aged to
remove it from delinquent status. Generally, the purpose of
re-aging accounts is to assist customers who have recently
overcome temporary financial difficulties and have demonstrated
both the ability and willingness to resume regular payments.

In addition, the Company may re-age the consumer lending
account of a customer who has experienced longer-term financial
difficulties and apply modified, concessionary terms and
conditions to the account. Commercial lending loans are
generally not subject to re-aging policies.

Accruing loans 90 days or more past due totaled $472 million

at December 31, 2021, compared with $477 million at
December 31, 2020. Accruing loans 90 days or more past due
are not included in nonperforming assets and continue to accrue
interest because they are adequately secured by collateral, are in
the process of collection and are reasonably expected to result in
repayment or restoration to current status, or are managed in
homogeneous portfolios with specified charge-off timeframes
adhering to regulatory guidelines. The ratio of accruing loans
90 days or more past due to total loans was 0.15 percent at
December 31, 2021, compared with 0.16 percent at
December 31, 2020.

Restructured Loans In certain circumstances, the Company
may modify the terms of a loan to maximize the collection of
amounts due when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties
or is expected to experience difficulties in the near-term. In most
cases the modification is either a concessionary reduction in
interest rate, extension of the maturity date or reduction in the
principal balance that would otherwise not be considered.

Troubled Debt Restructurings Concessionary modifications are
classified as TDRs unless the modification results in only an
insignificant delay in the payments to be received. TDRs accrue
interest if the borrower complies with the revised terms and
conditions and has demonstrated repayment performance at a

level commensurate with the modified terms over several
payment cycles, which is generally six months or greater. At
December 31, 2021, performing TDRs were $3.1 billion,
compared with $3.6 billion at December 31, 2020.

The Company continues to work with customers to modify
loans for borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties.
Many of the Company’s TDRs are determined on a case-by-case
basis in connection with ongoing loan collection processes. The
modifications vary within each of the Company’s loan classes.
Commercial lending segment TDRs generally include extensions
of the maturity date and may be accompanied by an increase or
decrease to the interest rate. The Company may also work with
the borrower to make other changes to the loan to mitigate
losses, such as obtaining additional collateral and/or guarantees
to support the loan.

The Company has also implemented certain residential
mortgage loan restructuring programs that may result in TDRs.
The Company modifies residential mortgage loans under Federal
Housing Administration, United States Department of Veterans
Affairs, and its own internal programs. Under these programs, the
Company offers qualifying homeowners the opportunity to
permanently modify their loan and achieve more affordable
monthly payments by providing loan concessions. These
concessions may include adjustments to interest rates,
conversion of adjustable rates to fixed rates, extensions of
maturity dates or deferrals of payments, capitalization of accrued
interest and/or outstanding advances, or in limited situations,
partial forgiveness of loan principal. In most instances,
participation in residential mortgage loan restructuring programs
requires the customer to complete a short-term trial period. A
permanent loan modification is contingent on the customer
successfully completing the trial period arrangement, and the loan
documents are not modified until that time. The Company reports
loans in a trial period arrangement as TDRs and continues to
report them as TDRs after the trial period.

Credit card and other retail loan TDRs are generally part of
distinct restructuring programs providing customers modification
solutions over a specified time period, generally up to 60 months.

In accordance with regulatory guidance, the Company

considers secured consumer loans that have had debt
discharged through bankruptcy where the borrower has not
reaffirmed the debt to be TDRs. If the loan amount exceeds the
collateral value, the loan is charged down to collateral value and
the remaining amount is reported as nonperforming.

Loan modifications or concessions granted to customers
resulting directly from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,
who were otherwise in current payment status, are not
considered to be TDRs.

business credit cards with a modified rate equal to 0 percent.

(c) Primarily represents loans with a modified rate equal to 0 percent.

(d) Includes $231 million of residential mortgage loans to borrowers that have had debt discharged through bankruptcy and $22 million in trial period arrangements or previously placed in trial

period arrangements but not successfully completed.

(e)

Includes $69 million of other retail loans to borrowers that have had debt discharged through bankruptcy and $14 million in trial period arrangements or previously placed in trial period

(f)

Includes $177 million of Federal Housing Administration and United States Department of Veterans Affairs residential mortgage loans to borrowers that have had debt discharged through

bankruptcy and $132 million in trial period arrangements or previously placed in trial period arrangements but not successfully completed.

(g) Approximately 8.5 percent and 35.8 percent of the total TDR loans purchased from GNMA mortgage pools are 30-89 days past due and 90 days or more past due, respectively, but are not

classified as delinquent as their repayments are insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.

Short-term and Other Loan Modifications The Company
makes short-term and other modifications that it does not
consider to be TDRs, in limited circumstances, to assist
borrowers experiencing temporary hardships. Short-term
consumer lending modification programs include payment
reductions, deferrals of up to three past due payments, and the
ability to return to current status if the borrower makes required
payments. The Company may also make short-term
modifications to commercial lending loans, with the most
common modification being an extension of the maturity date of
three months or less. Such extensions generally are used when
the maturity date is imminent and the borrower is experiencing
some level of financial stress, but the Company believes the
borrower will pay all contractual amounts owed.

COVID-19 Payment Relief The Company has offered payment
relief, including forbearance, payment deferrals and other
customer accommodations, to assist borrowers that have
experienced financial hardship resulting from the effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of these borrowers were not
delinquent on payments at the time they received the payment
relief. Most of the borrowers who received account modifications
are no longer participating in these payment relief programs, as
the programs are generally short-term. At December 31, 2021,
less than 3,000 accounts representing approximately $304 million
in loan balances, were currently in the Company’s payment relief
programs. Borrowers participating in these programs at
December 31, 2021 primarily represented those receiving
payment forbearance on residential mortgages; payment relief for
other loan products is insignificant. These amounts exclude loans
purchased from GNMA mortgage pools whose repayments are
primarily insured by the Federal Housing Administration or
guaranteed by the United States Department of Veteran Affairs

and have received COVID-19 payment relief under the respective
government agency’s programs.

Nonperforming Assets The level of nonperforming assets
represents another indicator of the potential for future credit
losses. Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans,
restructured loans not performing in accordance with modified
terms and not accruing interest, restructured loans that have not
met the performance period required to return to accrual status,
other real estate owned (“OREO”) and other nonperforming
assets owned by the Company. Interest payments collected from
assets on nonaccrual status are generally applied against the
principal balance and not recorded as income. However, interest
income may be recognized for interest payments if the remaining
carrying amount of the loan is believed to be collectible.

At December 31, 2021, total nonperforming assets were
$878 million, compared with $1.3 billion at December 31, 2020.
The $420 million (32.4 percent) decrease in nonperforming
assets, from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021, was
driven by decreases in nonperforming commercial and
commercial real estate loans. The ratio of total nonperforming
assets to total loans and other real estate was 0.28 percent at
December 31, 2021, compared with 0.44 percent at
December 31, 2020. Nonperforming assets are expected to
continue to decline over the next several quarters. However,
some manageable levels of elevated nonperforming assets in
certain industries and loan categories impacted by the pandemic
may experience longer recovery periods.

OREO was $22 million at December 31, 2021, compared with
$24 million at December 31, 2020, and was related to foreclosed
properties that previously secured loan balances. These balances
exclude foreclosed GNMA loans whose repayments are primarily
insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by
the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.

Analysis of Loan Net Charge-offs Total loan net charge-offs
were $682 million in 2021, compared with $1.8 billion in 2020. The
$1.1 billion (61.8 percent) decrease in total net charge-offs in 2021,
compared with 2020, reflected improvement across most loan
categories, associated with improving economic conditions,
borrower liquidity and strong asset prices in the market that support
repayment and recovery on problem loans. The ratio of total loan net
charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 0.23 percent in 2021,
compared with 0.58 percent in 2020.

Commercial and commercial real estate loan net charge-offs for
2021 were $105 million (0.07 percent of average loans outstanding),
compared with $700 million (0.45 percent of average loans
outstanding) in 2020. The decrease in net charge-offs in 2021,
compared with 2020, reflected lower charge-offs as a result of
improving economic conditions in 2021.

Residential mortgage loan net charge-offs for 2021 reflected a

net recovery of $32 million (0.04 percent of average loans
outstanding), compared with a net recovery of $12 million
(0.02 percent of average loans outstanding) in 2020. Credit card loan
net charge-offs in 2021 were $512 million (2.37 percent of average
loans outstanding), compared with $829 million (3.71 percent of
average loans outstanding) in 2020. Other retail loan net charge-offs
for 2021 were $97 million (0.16 percent of average loans
outstanding), compared with $269 million (0.47 percent of average
loans outstanding) in 2020. The decrease in total residential
mortgage, credit card and other retail loan net charge-offs in 2021,
compared with 2020, reflected improving economic conditions. The
Company expects net charge-offs to return to more normalized
levels over time.

Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Credit
Losses The allowance for credit losses is established for current
expected credit losses on the Company’s loan and lease
portfolio, including unfunded credit commitments. The allowance
considers expected losses for the remaining lives of the
applicable assets, inclusive of expected recoveries. The
allowance for credit losses is increased through provisions
charged to earnings and reduced by net charge-offs.

Management evaluates the appropriateness of the allowance
for credit losses on a quarterly basis. Multiple economic scenarios
are considered over a three-year reasonable and supportable
forecast period, which includes increasing consideration of
historical loss experience over years two and three. These
economic scenarios are constructed with interrelated projections
of multiple economic variables, and loss estimates are produced
that consider the historical correlation of those economic
variables with credit losses. After the forecast period, the
Company fully reverts to long-term historical loss experience,
adjusted for prepayments and characteristics of the current loan
and lease portfolio, to estimate losses over the remaining life of
the portfolio. The economic scenarios are updated at least
quarterly and are designed to provide a range of reasonable
estimates from better to worse than current expectations.
Scenarios are weighted based on the Company’s expectation of
economic conditions for the foreseeable future and reflect
significant judgment and consideration of uncertainties that exist.
Final loss estimates also consider factors affecting credit losses
not reflected in the scenarios, due to the unique aspects of
current conditions and expectations. These factors may include,
but are not limited to, loan servicing practices, regulatory
guidance, and/or fiscal and monetary policy actions.

Because business processes and credit risks associated with

unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as for
loans, the Company utilizes similar processes to estimate its

44

liability for unfunded credit commitments, which is included in
other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Both the
allowance for loan losses and the liability for unfunded credit
commitments are included in the Company’s analysis of credit
losses and reported reserve ratios.

The allowance recorded for credit losses utilizes forward-
looking expected loss models to consider a variety of factors
affecting lifetime credit losses. These factors include, but are not
limited to, macroeconomic variables such as unemployment
rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels and
corporate bonds spreads, as well as loan and borrower
characteristics, such as internal risk ratings on commercial loans
and consumer credit scores, delinquency status, collateral type
and available valuation information, consideration of end-of-term
losses on lease residuals, and the remaining term of the loan,
adjusted for expected prepayments. For each loan portfolio,
model estimates are adjusted as necessary to consider any
relevant changes in portfolio composition, lending policies,
underwriting standards, risk management practices, economic
conditions or other factors that may affect the accuracy of the
model. Expected credit loss estimates also include consideration
of expected cash recoveries on loans previously charged-off or
expected recoveries on collateral-dependent loans where
recovery is expected through sale of the collateral. Where loans
do not exhibit similar risk characteristics, an individual analysis is
performed to consider expected credit losses.

The allowance recorded for individually evaluated loans
greater than $5 million in the commercial lending segment is
based on an analysis utilizing expected cash flows discounted
using the original effective interest rate, the observable market
price of the loan, or the fair value of the collateral, less selling
costs, for collateral-dependent loans as appropriate. For
commercial TDRs individually evaluated for impairment, attributes
of the borrower are the primary factors in determining the
allowance for credit losses. However, historical loss experience is
also incorporated into the allowance methodology applied to this
category of loans. Commercial lending segment TDR loans may
be collectively evaluated for impairment where observed
performance history, including defaults, is a primary driver of the
loss allocation.

The allowance recorded for TDR loans in the consumer
lending segment is determined on a homogenous pool basis
utilizing expected cash flows discounted using the original
effective interest rate of the pool. The expected cash flows on
TDR loans consider subsequent payment defaults since
modification, the borrower’s ability to pay under the restructured
terms, and the timing and amount of payments. The allowance
for collateral-dependent loans in the consumer lending segment
is determined based on the current fair value of the collateral less
costs to sell.

When evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for
credit losses for any loans and lines in a junior lien position, the
Company considers the delinquency and modification status of
the first lien. At December 31, 2021, the Company serviced the
first lien on 35 percent of the home equity loans and lines in a

junior lien position. The Company also considers the status of first
lien mortgage accounts reported on customer credit bureau files
when the first lien is not serviced by the Company. Regardless of
whether the Company services the first lien, an assessment is
made of economic conditions, problem loans, recent loss
experience and other factors in determining the allowance for
credit losses. Based on the available information, the Company
estimated $224 million or 2.1 percent of its total home equity
portfolio at December 31, 2021, represented non-delinquent
junior liens where the first lien was delinquent or modified,
excluding loans in COVID-related forbearance programs.

The Company considers historical loss experience on the
loans and lines in a junior lien position to establish loss estimates
for junior lien loans and lines the Company services that are
current, but the first lien is delinquent or modified. The historical
long-term average loss experience related to junior liens has been
relatively limited (less than 1 percent of the total portfolio
annually), and estimates are adjusted to consider current
collateral support and portfolio risk characteristics. These include
updated credit scores and collateral estimates obtained on the
Company’s home equity portfolio each quarter. In its evaluation of
the allowance for credit losses, the Company also considers the
increased risk of loss associated with home equity lines that are
contractually scheduled to convert from a revolving status to a
fully amortizing payment.

Beginning January 1, 2020, when a loan portfolio is

purchased, the acquired loans are divided into those considered
purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration
(“PCD”) and those not considered purchased with more than
insignificant credit deterioration. An allowance is established for
each population and considers product mix, risk characteristics
of the portfolio, bankruptcy experience, delinquency status and
refreshed LTV ratios when possible. The allowance established
for purchased loans not considered PCD is recognized through
provision expense upon acquisition, whereas the allowance
established for loans considered PCD at acquisition is offset by
an increase in the basis of the acquired loans. Any subsequent
increases and decreases in the allowance related to purchased
loans, regardless of PCD status, are recognized through
provision expense, with charge-offs charged to the allowance.
The Company did not have a material amount of PCD loans
included in its loan portfolio at December 31, 2021.

The Company’s methodology for determining the appropriate
allowance for credit losses also considers the imprecision inherent
in the methodologies used and allocated to the various loan
portfolios. As a result, amounts determined under the
methodologies described above are adjusted by management to
consider the potential impact of other qualitative factors not
captured in quantitative model adjustments which include, but are
not limited to, the following: model imprecision, imprecision in
economic scenario assumptions, and emerging risks related to
either changes in the economic environment that are affecting
specific portfolios, or changes in portfolio concentrations over time
that may affect model performance. The consideration of these
items results in adjustments to allowance amounts included in the
Company’s allowance for credit losses for each loan portfolio.

The results of the analysis are evaluated quarterly to confirm

the estimates are appropriate for each loan portfolio. Table 19
shows the amount of the allowance for credit losses by loan class
and underlying portfolio category.

Although the Company determined the amount of each
element of the allowance separately and considers this process
to be an important credit management tool, the entire allowance
for credit losses is available for the entire loan portfolio. The actual
amount of losses can vary significantly from the estimated
amounts.

At December 31, 2021, the allowance for credit losses was
$6.2 billion (1.97 percent of period-end loans), compared with an
allowance of $8.0 billion (2.69 percent of period-end loans) at
December 31, 2020. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses
to nonperforming loans was 738 percent at December 31, 2021,
compared with 654 percent at December 31, 2020. The ratio of
the allowance for credit losses to annual loan net charge-offs at
December 31, 2021, was 902 percent, compared with
448 percent at December 31, 2020. Management determined
the allowance for credit losses was appropriate at December 31,
2021 and 2020.

The decrease in the allowance for credit losses of $1.9 billion

(23.2 percent) at December 31, 2021, compared with
December 31, 2020, reflected factors affecting economic

conditions during 2021, including the enactment of additional
benefits from government stimulus programs and broad vaccine
availability in the United States that has reduced the risks
associated with COVID-19, contributing to an economic recovery.
However, economic uncertainty remains associated with supply
chain concerns, rising inflationary concerns and additional virus
variants. In addition to these factors, expected loss estimates
consider various factors including customer specific information
impacting changes in risk ratings, projected delinquencies and
potential effects of diminishing liquidity without support of
mortgage forbearance and direct federal stimulus. Consumer
credit trends continued to perform better than expected in 2021,
while select wholesale portfolios continue to be monitored for
pandemic related impacts.

Changes in economic conditions considered in estimating the

allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2021 included
improvements in projected gross domestic product and
unemployment levels, which reflected the additional government
stimulus and availability of vaccines. These factors are evaluated
through a combination of quantitative calculations using
economic scenarios and qualitative assessments that consider
the high degree of uncertainty related to the unprecedented levels
of both economic stress and the stimulus response.

Baseline economic forecasts are used in combination with
alternative scenarios and historical loss experience as is considered
reasonable and supportable to inform the Company’s allowance for
credit losses. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are based
on a variety of factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio
credit quality and mix changes, and changes in general economic
conditions and expectations (including for unemployment and gross
domestic product), among other factors.

Based on economic conditions at December 31, 2021, it was

difficult to estimate the length and severity of the longer term
effects on certain industry sectors that may result from COVID-19
and the impact of other factors that may influence the level of
eventual losses and corresponding requirements for the
allowance for credit losses, including the impact of inflationary
pressures on certain lending sectors and diminishing liquidity after
economic stimulus programs and accommodations delaying
mortgage and rent payments end. While reserves consider the
uncertainty in these estimates, the unpredictability of the
COVID-19 pandemic could result in the recognition of credit
losses in the Company’s loan portfolios and increases in the
allowance for credit losses. Scenarios worse than the Company’s
expected outcome at December 31, 2021 include risks that
government stimulus in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is
less effective than expected, or that a longer or more severe
health crisis prolongs the downturn in economic activity,
potentially reducing the number of businesses that are ultimately
able to resume operations after the crisis has passed. Other
factors considered include concerns around inflationary
pressures, new virus variants, sustainability of asset values and
borrower liquidity.

The allowance for credit losses related to commercial lending

segment loans decreased $995 million during the year ended
December 31, 2021, due to improvements in general economic
conditions and portfolio credit quality that included some return of
economic activity in certain industry sectors affected by
COVID-19.

The allowance for credit losses related to consumer lending

segment loans decreased $860 million during the year ended
December 31, 2021, due to improving economic risks, including
those due to decreased unemployment, along with continued

strong underlying credit quality that supports expectations of
long-term repayment.

Residual Value Risk Management The Company manages its
risk to changes in the residual value of leased vehicles, office and
business equipment, and other assets through disciplined
residual valuation setting at the inception of a lease, diversification
of its leased assets, regular residual asset valuation reviews and
monitoring of residual value gains or losses upon the disposition
of assets. Lease originations are subject to the same well-defined
underwriting standards referred to in the “Credit Risk
Management” section, which includes an evaluation of the
residual value risk. Retail lease residual value risk is mitigated
further by effective end-of-term marketing of off-lease vehicles.
Included in the retail leasing portfolio was approximately
$5.6 billion of retail leasing residuals at December 31, 2021,
compared with $6.3 billion at December 31, 2020. The Company
monitors concentrations of leases by manufacturer and vehicle
type. As of December 31, 2021, vehicle lease residuals related to
sport utility vehicles were 46.7 percent of the portfolio, while truck
and crossover utility vehicle classes represented approximately
32.5 percent and 14.7 percent of the portfolio, respectively. At
year-end 2021, the individual vehicle model with the largest
residual value outstanding represented 14.9 percent of the
aggregate residual value of all vehicles in the portfolio. At
December 31, 2021 and 2020, the weighted-average origination
term of the portfolio was 41 months. At December 31, 2021, the
commercial leasing portfolio had $515 million of residuals,
compared with $498 million at December 31, 2020. At year-end
2021, lease residuals related to trucks and other transportation
equipment represented 33.4 percent of the total residual
portfolio, while business and office equipment represented
29.7 percent.

Operational Risk Management. The Company operates in
many different businesses in diverse markets and relies on the
ability of its employees and systems to process a high number of
transactions. Operational risk is inherent in all business activities,
and the management of this risk is important to the achievement
of the Company’s objectives. Business lines have direct and
primary responsibility and accountability for identifying,
controlling, and monitoring operational risks embedded in their

48

business activities, including those additional or increased risks 
created by the economic and financial disruptions, and the 
Company’s alternative working arrangements resulting from the 
COVID-19 pandemic. The Company maintains a system of 
controls with the objective of providing proper transaction 
authorization and execution, proper system operations, proper 
oversight of third parties with whom it does business, 
safeguarding of assets from misuse or theft, and ensuring the 
reliability and security of financial and other data. 

Business continuation and disaster recovery planning is also 
critical to effectively managing operational risks. Each business 
unit of the Company is required to develop, maintain and test 
these plans at least annually to ensure that recovery activities, if 
needed, can support mission critical functions, including 
technology, networks and data centers supporting customer 
applications and business operations. 

While the Company believes it has designed effective 
processes to minimize operational risks, there is no absolute 
assurance that business disruption or operational losses would 
not occur from an external event or internal control breakdown. 
On an ongoing basis, management makes process changes and 
investments to enhance its systems of internal controls and 
business continuity and disaster recovery plans. 

In the past, the Company has experienced attack attempts on 
its computer systems, including various denial-of-service attacks 
on customer-facing websites. The Company has not experienced 
any material losses relating to these attempts, as a result of its 
controls, processes and systems to protect its networks, 
computers, software and data from attack, damage or 
unauthorized access but future attacks could be more disruptive 
or damaging. Attack attempts on the Company’s computer 
systems are evolving and increasing, and the Company continues 
to develop and enhance its controls and processes to protect 
against these attempts. 

Compliance Risk Management The Company may suffer legal 
or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, or damage to its 
reputation through failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, 
standards of good practice, and codes of conduct, including 
those related to compliance with Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money 
laundering requirements, sanctions compliance requirements as 
administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, consumer 
protection and other requirements. The Company has controls 
and processes in place for the assessment, identification, 
monitoring, management and reporting of compliance risks and 
issues, including those created or increased by the economic and 

TABLE 20  Sensitivity of Net Interest Income 

financial disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to 
“Supervision and Regulation” in the Company’s Annual Report on 
Form 10-K for further discussion of the regulatory framework 
applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. 

Interest Rate Risk Management In the banking industry, 
changes in interest rates are a significant risk that can impact 
earnings and the safety and soundness of an entity. The 
Company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates 
through asset and liability management activities within guidelines 
established by its Asset Liability Management Committee 
(“ALCO”) and approved by the Board of Directors. The ALCO has 
the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with the 
ALCO management policies, including interest rate risk exposure. 
One way the Company measures and analyzes its interest rate 
risk is through net interest income simulation analysis. 

Simulation analysis incorporates substantially all of the 

Company’s assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet 
instruments, together with forecasted changes in the balance 
sheet and assumptions that reflect the current interest rate 
environment. Through this simulation, management estimates the 
impact on net interest income of various interest rate changes 
that differ in the direction, amount and speed of change over 
time, as well as the shape of the yield curve. This simulation 
includes assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to be 
affected by changes in loan and deposit growth. Assumptions are 
made to project interest rates for new loans and deposits based 
on historical analysis, management’s outlook and re-pricing 
strategies. These assumptions are reviewed and validated on a 
periodic basis with sensitivity analysis being provided for key 
variables of the simulation. The results are reviewed monthly by 
the ALCO and are used to guide asset/liability management 
strategies. 

The Company manages its interest rate risk position by 

holding assets with desired interest rate risk characteristics on its 
balance sheet, implementing certain pricing strategies for loans 
and deposits and selecting derivatives and various funding and 
investment portfolio strategies. 

Table 20 summarizes the projected impact to net interest 
income over the next 12 months of various potential interest rate 
changes. The sensitivity of the projected impact to net interest 
income over the next 12 months is dependent on balance sheet 
growth, product mix, deposit behavior, pricing and funding 
decisions. While the Company utilizes models and assumptions 
based on historical information and expected behaviors, actual 
outcomes could vary significantly.

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and Other Risks 
To manage the sensitivity of earnings and capital to interest rate, 
prepayment, credit, price and foreign currency fluctuations (asset 
and liability management positions), the Company enters into 
derivative transactions. The Company uses derivatives for asset 
and liability management purposes primarily in the following ways: 

– To convert fixed-rate debt and available-for-sale investment 

securities from fixed-rate payments to floating-rate payments; 

– To convert floating-rate debt from floating-rate payments to 

fixed-rate payments; 

– To mitigate changes in value of the Company’s unfunded 
mortgage loan commitments, funded MLHFS and MSRs; 

– To mitigate remeasurement volatility of foreign currency 

denominated balances; and 

– To mitigate the volatility of the Company’s net investment in 
foreign operations driven by fluctuations in foreign currency 
exchange rates. 

In addition, the Company enters into interest rate and foreign 

exchange derivative contracts to support the business 
requirements of its customers (customer-related positions). The 
Company minimizes the market and liquidity risks of customer-
related positions by either entering into similar offsetting positions 
with broker-dealers, or on a portfolio basis by entering into other 
derivative or non-derivative financial instruments that partially or 
fully offset the exposure from these customer-related positions. 
The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are either 
exchange-traded, centrally cleared through clearinghouses or 
over-the-counter. The Company does not utilize derivatives for 
speculative purposes. 

The Company does not designate all of the derivatives that it 
enters into for risk management purposes as accounting hedges 
because of the inefficiency of applying the accounting 
requirements and may instead elect fair value accounting for the 
related hedged items. In particular, the Company enters into 
interest rate swaps, swaptions, forward commitments to buy 
to-be-announced securities (“TBAs”), U.S. Treasury and 
Eurodollar futures and options on U.S. Treasury futures to 
mitigate fluctuations in the value of its MSRs, but does not 
designate those derivatives as accounting hedges. The estimated 
net sensitivity to changes in interest rates of the fair value of the 
MSRs and the related derivative instruments at December 31, 
2021, to an immediate 25, 50 and 100 bps downward movement 
in interest rates would be a decrease of approximately $8 million, 
$15 million and $22 million, respectively. An immediate upward 
movement in interest rates at December 31, 2021, of 25, 50 and 
100 bps would result in an increase of approximately $8 million, 
an increase of $9 million and a decrease of $25 million, in the fair 
value of the MSRs and related derivative instruments, 
respectively. Refer to Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements for additional information regarding MSRs. 
Additionally, the Company uses forward commitments to sell 
TBAs and other commitments to sell residential mortgage loans at 
specified prices to economically hedge the interest rate risk in its 
residential mortgage loan production activities. At December 31, 

2021, the Company had $8.6 billion of forward commitments to 
sell, hedging $5.4 billion of MLHFS and $4.7 billion of unfunded 
mortgage loan commitments. The forward commitments to sell 
and the unfunded mortgage loan commitments on loans intended 
to be sold are considered derivatives under the accounting 
guidance related to accounting for derivative instruments and 
hedging activities. The Company has elected the fair value option 
for the MLHFS. 

Derivatives are subject to credit risk associated with 
counterparties to the contracts. Credit risk associated with 
derivatives is measured by the Company based on the probability 
of counterparty default, including consideration of the COVID-19 
pandemic. The Company manages the credit risk of its derivative 
positions by diversifying its positions among various 
counterparties, by entering into master netting arrangements, and, 
where possible, by requiring collateral arrangements. The 
Company may also transfer counterparty credit risk related to 
interest rate swaps to third parties through the use of risk 
participation agreements. In addition, certain interest rate swaps, 
interest rate forwards and credit contracts are required to be 
centrally cleared through clearinghouses to further mitigate 
counterparty credit risk. 

For additional information on derivatives and hedging activities, 

refer to Notes 20 and 21 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements. 

LIBOR Transition In July 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial 
Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) announced that it would no longer 
require banks to submit rates for the London InterBank Offered 
Rate (“LIBOR”) after 2021. In March 2021, the FCA and the 
administrator of LIBOR announced that, with respect to the most 
commonly used tenors of United States Dollar LIBOR, LIBOR will 
no longer be published on a representative basis after 
June 30, 2023. The publication of all other tenors of United States 
Dollar LIBOR ceased to be provided or ceased to be 
representative after December 31, 2021. The Company holds 
financial instruments impacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR, 
including certain loans, investment securities, derivatives, 
borrowings and other financial instruments that use LIBOR as the 
benchmark rate. The Company also provides various services to 
customers in its capacities as trustee and servicer, which involve 
financial instruments that will be similarly impacted by the 
discontinuance of LIBOR. 

The Company has transitioned financial instruments associated 

to LIBOR currencies and tenors that ceased or became 
nonrepresentative on December 31, 2021 to alternative reference 
rates, with limited exceptions. The Company also anticipates that 
additional financial instruments associated to the remaining United 
States Dollar LIBOR tenors will require transition to a new 
reference rate by June 30, 2023. This transition will occur over 
time as many of these arrangements do not have an alternative 
rate referenced in their contracts or a clear path for the parties to 
agree upon an alternative reference rate and therefore require 
remediation. For residual exposure related to these rates after 
June 30, 2023, the Company is assessing the applicability of 
relevant contractual and statutory solutions. Certain states have 
passed legislation, and federal legislation has been proposed, 

50 

that would transition contracts from LIBOR to an alternative 
reference rate for any contracts with non-existent or impracticable 
fallback language. The Company is assessing the impact of such 
legislative solutions to its various products. 

In order to facilitate the transition process, the Company has 

instituted a LIBOR Transition Office and commenced an 
enterprise-wide project to identify, assess, monitor and mitigate 
risks associated with the expected discontinuance or 
unavailability of LIBOR, actively engage with industry working 
groups and regulators, achieve operational readiness for the use 
of alternative reference rates and engage impacted customers to 
remediate and transition impacted instruments. The Company 
has also invested in updating its systems, models, procedures 
and internal infrastructure as part of the transition program. 
Additionally, in alignment with guidance from United States 
banking agencies and the FCA, the Company has ceased the use 
of LIBOR as a reference rate in new contracts, with limited 
exceptions, and continues to increase the usage of alternative 
reference rates such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate 
(“SOFR”). The Company has also adopted industry best practice 
guidelines for fallback language for new transactions, converted 
its cleared interest rate swaps discounting to SOFR discounting, 
and distributed communications related to the transition to certain 
impacted parties, both inside and outside the Company. Refer to 
“Risk Factors” beginning on page 137, for further discussion on 
potential risks that could adversely affect the Company’s financial 
results as a result of the LIBOR transition. 

Market Risk Management In addition to interest rate risk, the 
Company is exposed to other forms of market risk, principally 
related to trading activities which support customers’ strategies 
to manage their own foreign currency, interest rate risk and 
funding activities. For purposes of its internal capital adequacy 
assessment process, the Company considers risk arising from its 
trading activities, as well as the remeasurement volatility of foreign 
currency denominated balances included on its Consolidated 
Balance Sheet (collectively, “Covered Positions”), employing 
methodologies consistent with the requirements of regulatory 
rules for market risk. The Company’s Market Risk Committee 
(“MRC”), within the framework of the ALCO, oversees market risk 
management. The MRC monitors and reviews the Company’s 
Covered Positions and establishes policies for market risk 
management, including exposure limits for each portfolio. The 
Company uses a VaR approach to measure general market risk. 
Theoretically, VaR represents the statistical risk of loss the 
Company has to adverse market movements over a one-day time 
horizon. The Company uses the Historical Simulation method to 
calculate VaR for its Covered Positions measured at the ninety-
ninth percentile using a one-year look-back period for 
distributions derived from past market data. The market factors 
used in the calculations include those pertinent to market risks 
inherent in the underlying trading portfolios, principally those that 
affect the Company’s corporate bond trading business, foreign 

currency transaction business, client derivatives business, loan 
trading business and municipal securities business, as well as 
those inherent in the Company’s foreign denominated balances 
and the derivatives used to mitigate the related measurement 
volatility. On average, the Company expects the one-day VaR to 
be exceeded by actual losses two to three times per year related 
to these positions. The Company monitors the accuracy of 
internal VaR models and modeling processes by back-testing 
model performance, regularly updating the historical data used by 
the VaR models and regular model validations to assess the 
accuracy of the models’ input, processing, and reporting 
components. All models are required to be independently 
reviewed and approved prior to being placed in use. If the 
Company were to experience market losses in excess of the 
estimated VaR more often than expected, the VaR models and 
associated assumptions would be analyzed and adjusted. 

The average, high, low and period-end one-day VaR amounts for 
the Company’s Covered Positions were as follows:

The Company did not experience any actual losses for its 
combined Covered Positions that exceeded VaR during the year 
ended December 31, 2021. Given the market volatility in the first 
quarter of 2020 resulting from effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
the Company experienced actual losses for its combined 
Covered Positions that exceeded VaR five times during the year 
ended December 31, 2020. The Company stress tests its market 
risk measurements to provide management with perspectives on 
market events that may not be captured by its VaR models, 
including worst case historical market movement combinations 
that have not necessarily occurred on the same date. 

The Company calculates Stressed VaR using the same 
underlying methodology and model as VaR, except that a 
historical continuous one-year look-back period is utilized that 
reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate to the 
Company’s Covered Positions. The period selected by the 
Company includes the significant market volatility of the last four 
months of 2008. 

The average, high, low and period-end one-day Stressed VaR 
amounts for the Company’s Covered Positions were as follows:

Valuations of positions in client derivatives and foreign 
currency activities are based on discounted cash flow or other 
valuation techniques using market-based assumptions. These 
valuations are compared to third-party quotes or other market 
prices to determine if there are significant variances. Significant 
variances are approved by senior management in the Company’s 
corporate functions. Valuation of positions in the corporate bond 
trading, loan trading and municipal securities businesses are 
based on trader marks. These trader marks are evaluated against 
third-party prices, with significant variances approved by senior 
management in the Company’s corporate functions. 

The Company also measures the market risk of its hedging 

activities related to residential MLHFS and MSRs using the 
Historical Simulation method. The VaRs are measured at the 
ninety-ninth percentile and employ factors pertinent to the market 
risks inherent in the valuation of the assets and hedges. A 
one-year look-back period is used to obtain past market data for 
the models. 

The average, high and low VaR amounts for the residential 
MLHFS and related hedges and the MSRs and related hedges 
were as follows:

Liquidity Risk Management The Company’s liquidity risk 
management process is designed to identify, measure, and 
manage the Company’s funding and liquidity risk to meet its daily 
funding needs and to address expected and unexpected 
changes in its funding requirements. The Company engages in 
various activities to manage its liquidity risk. These activities 
include diversifying its funding sources, stress testing, and 
holding readily-marketable assets which can be used as a source 
of liquidity if needed. In addition, the Company’s profitable 
operations, sound credit quality and strong capital position have 
enabled it to develop a large and reliable base of core deposit 
funding within its market areas and in domestic and global capital 
markets. 

The Company’s Board of Directors approves the Company’s 

liquidity policy. The Risk Management Committee of the 
Company’s Board of Directors oversees the Company’s liquidity 
risk management process and approves a contingency funding 
plan. The ALCO reviews the Company’s liquidity policy and limits, 
and regularly assesses the Company’s ability to meet funding 
requirements arising from adverse company-specific or market 
events. 

The Company’s liquidity policy requires it to maintain 

diversified wholesale funding sources to avoid maturity, entity and 

market concentrations. The Company operates a Cayman 
Islands branch for issuing Eurodollar time deposits. In addition, 
the Company has relationships with dealers to issue national 
market retail and institutional savings certificates and short-term 
and medium-term notes. The Company also maintains a 
significant correspondent banking network and relationships. 
Accordingly, the Company has access to national federal funds, 
funding through repurchase agreements and sources of stable 
certificates of deposit and commercial paper. 

The Company regularly projects its funding needs under 
various stress scenarios and maintains a contingency funding 
plan consistent with the Company’s access to diversified sources 
of contingent funding. The Company maintains a substantial level 
of total available liquidity in the form of on-balance sheet and 
off-balance sheet funding sources. These liquidity sources include 
cash at the Federal Reserve Bank and certain European central 
banks, unencumbered liquid assets, and capacity to borrow from 
the FHLB and at the Federal Reserve Bank’s Discount Window. 
Unencumbered liquid assets in the Company’s investment 
securities portfolio provides asset liquidity through the Company’s 
ability to sell the securities or pledge and borrow against them. At 
December 31, 2021, the fair value of unencumbered investment 
securities totaled $144.0 billion, compared with $125.9 billion at 
December 31, 2020. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements and “Balance Sheet Analysis” 
for further information on investment securities maturities and 
trends. Asset liquidity is further enhanced by the Company’s 
practice of pledging loans to access secured borrowing facilities 
through the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank. At December 31, 
2021, the Company could have borrowed a total of an additional 
$101.0 billion from the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank based 
on collateral available for additional borrowings. 

The Company’s diversified deposit base provides a sizeable 
source of relatively stable and low-cost funding, while reducing 
the Company’s reliance on the wholesale markets. Total deposits 
were $456.1 billion at December 31, 2021, compared with 
$429.8 billion at December 31, 2020. Refer to Note 12 of the 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and “Balance Sheet 
Analysis” for further information on the maturities, terms and 
trends of the Company’s deposits. 

Additional funding is provided by long-term debt and short-

term borrowings. Long-term debt was $32.1 billion at 
December 31, 2021, and is an important funding source because 
of its multi-year borrowing structure. Refer to Note 14 of the 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on 
the terms and maturities of the Company’s long-term debt 
issuances and “Balance Sheet Analysis” for discussion on long-
term debt trends. Short-term borrowings were $11.8 billion at 
December 31, 2021, and supplement the Company’s other 
funding sources. Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements and “Balance Sheet Analysis” for further 
information on the terms and trends of the Company’s short-term 
borrowings. 

The Company’s ability to raise negotiated funding at 

competitive prices is influenced by rating agencies’ views of the 
Company’s credit quality, liquidity, capital and earnings. Table 21 
details the rating agencies’ most recent assessments.

In addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis, 
the Company monitors the parent company’s liquidity. The parent 
company’s routine funding requirements consist primarily of 
operating expenses, dividends paid to shareholders, debt 
service, repurchases of common stock and funds used for 
acquisitions. The parent company obtains funding to meet its 
obligations from dividends collected from its subsidiaries and the 
issuance of debt and capital securities. The Company establishes 
limits for the minimal number of months into the future where the 
parent company can meet existing and forecasted obligations 
with cash and securities held that can be readily monetized. The 
Company measures and manages this limit in both normal and 
adverse conditions. The Company maintains sufficient funding to 
meet expected capital and debt service obligations for 24 months 
without the support of dividends from subsidiaries and assuming 
access to the wholesale markets is maintained. The Company 
maintains sufficient liquidity to meet its capital and debt service 
obligations for 12 months under adverse conditions without the 
support of dividends from subsidiaries or access to the wholesale 
markets. The parent company is currently well in excess of 
required liquidity minimums. 

Under United States Securities and Exchange Commission 

rules, the parent company is classified as a “well-known 
seasoned issuer,” which allows it to file a registration statement 
that does not have a limit on issuance capacity. “Well-known 
seasoned issuers” generally include those companies with 
outstanding common securities with a market value of at least 
$700 million held by non-affiliated parties or those companies 
that have issued at least $1 billion in aggregate principal amount 
of non-convertible securities, other than common equity, in the 
last three years. However, the parent company’s ability to issue 
debt and other securities under a registration statement filed with 
the United States Securities and Exchange Commission under 

these rules is limited by the debt issuance authority granted by 
the Company’s Board of Directors and/or the ALCO policy. 
At December 31, 2021, parent company long-term debt 
outstanding was $18.9 billion, compared with $20.9 billion at 
December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to 
$3.0 billion of medium-term note repayments, partially offset by 
$1.3 billion of subordinated note issuances. As of December 31, 
2021, there was $2.3 billion of parent company debt scheduled 
to mature in 2022. Future debt maturities may be met through 
medium-term note and capital security issuances and dividends 
from subsidiaries, as well as from parent company cash and cash 
equivalents. 

Dividend payments to the Company by its subsidiary bank are 
subject to regulatory review and statutory limitations and, in some 
instances, regulatory approval. In general, dividends to the parent 
company from its banking subsidiary are limited by rules which 
compare dividends to net income for regulatorily-defined periods. 
For further information, see Note 25 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements. 

The Company is subject to a regulatory Liquidity Coverage 
Ratio (“LCR”) requirement which requires banks to maintain an 
adequate level of unencumbered high quality liquid assets to 
meet estimated liquidity needs over a 30-day stressed period. At 
December 31, 2021, the Company was compliant with this 
requirement. 

Beginning July 1, 2021, the Company is also subject to a 
regulatory Net Stable Funding Ratio (“NSFR”) requirement which 
requires banks to maintain a minimum level of stable funding 
based on the liquidity characteristics of their assets, 
commitments, and derivative exposures over a one-year time 
horizon. At December 31, 2021, the Company was compliant 
with this requirement. 

53 

European Exposures The Company provides merchant 
processing and corporate trust services in Europe either directly 
or through banking affiliations in Europe. Revenue generated 
from sources in Europe represented approximately 2 percent of 
the Company’s total net revenue for 2021. Operating cash for 
these businesses is deposited on a short-term basis typically 
with certain European central banks. For deposits placed at 
other European banks, exposure is mitigated by the Company 
placing deposits at multiple banks and managing the amounts 
on deposit at any bank based on institution-specific deposit 
limits. At December 31, 2021, the Company had an aggregate 
amount on deposit with European banks of approximately 
$9.8 billion, predominately with the Central Bank of Ireland and 
Bank of England. 

In addition, the Company provides financing to domestic 
multinational corporations that generate revenue from customers 
in European countries, transacts with various European banks as 
counterparties to certain derivative-related activities, and through 
a subsidiary, manages money market funds that hold certain 
investments in European sovereign debt. Any deterioration in 
economic conditions in Europe is not expected to have a 
significant effect on the Company related to these activities. 

Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Other Contractual 
Obligations The Company participates in many different 
contractual arrangements which may or may not be recorded on 
its balance sheet, with unrelated or unconsolidated entities, 
under which the Company has an obligation to pay certain 
amounts, provide credit or liquidity enhancements or market risk 
support. These arrangements also include any obligation related 
to a variable interest held in an unconsolidated entity that 
provides financing, liquidity, credit enhancement or market risk 
support. The Company has not utilized private label asset 
securitizations as a source of funding. 

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into 
contractual obligations that may require future cash payments, 
including funding for customer loan requests, customer deposit 
maturities and withdrawals, debt service, leases for premises 
and equipment, and other cash commitments including $3.3 
billion of contractual interest payments at December 31, 2021. 
Refer to Notes 7, 12, 14, 17 and 23 in the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the 
Company’s operating lease obligations, deposits, long-term 
debt, benefit obligations and guarantees and other 
commitments, respectively. 

Commitments to extend credit are legally binding and 
generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination 
clauses. Many of the Company’s commitments to extend credit 
expire without being drawn and, therefore, total commitment 
amounts do not necessarily represent future liquidity 
requirements or the Company’s exposure to credit loss. 
Commitments to extend credit also include consumer credit lines 
that are cancelable upon notification to the consumer. Total 
contractual amounts of commitments to extend credit at 
December 31, 2021 were $355.1 billion. The Company also 
issues and confirms various types of letters of credit, including 

standby and commercial. Total contractual amounts of letters of 
credit at December 31, 2021 were $10.5 billion. For more 
information on the Company’s commitments to extend credit 
and letters of credit, refer to Note 23 in the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Company’s off-balance sheet arrangements with 
unconsolidated entities primarily consist of private investment 
funds or partnerships that make equity investments, provide 
debt financing or support community-based investments in 
tax-advantaged projects. In addition to providing investment 
returns, these arrangements in many cases assist the Company 
in complying with requirements of the Community Reinvestment 
Act. The investments in these entities generate a return primarily 
through the realization of federal and state income tax credits 
and other tax benefits, such as tax deductions from operating 
losses of the investments, over specified time periods. The 
entities in which the Company invests are generally considered 
variable interest entities (“VIEs”). The Company’s recorded 
investment in these entities, net of contractual equity investment 
commitments of $1.9 billion, was $2.6 billion at December 31, 
2021. 

The Company also has non-controlling financial investments 

in private funds and partnerships considered VIEs. The 
Company’s recorded investment in these entities was 
approximately $40 million at December 31, 2021, and the 
Company had unfunded commitments to invest an additional 
$44 million. For more information on the Company’s interests in 
unconsolidated VIEs, refer to Note 8 in the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Guarantees are contingent commitments issued by the 
Company to customers or other third parties requiring the 
Company to perform if certain conditions exist or upon the 
occurrence or nonoccurrence of a specified event, such as a 
scheduled payment to be made under contract. The Company’s 
primary guarantees include commitments from securities lending 
activities in which indemnifications are provided to customers; 
indemnification or buy-back provisions related to sales of loans 
and tax credit investments; and merchant charge-back 
guarantees through the Company’s involvement in providing 
merchant processing services. For certain guarantees, the 
Company may have access to collateral to support the 
guarantee, or through the exercise of other recourse provisions, 
be able to offset some or all of any payments made under these 
guarantees. 

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries, along with other 

Visa U.S.A. Inc. member banks, have a contingent guarantee 
obligation to indemnify Visa Inc. for potential losses arising from 
antitrust lawsuits challenging the practices of Visa U.S.A. Inc. 
and MasterCard International. The indemnification by the 
Company and other Visa U.S.A. Inc. member banks has no 
maximum amount. Refer to Note 23 in the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding 
guarantees, other commitments, and contingent liabilities, 
including maximum potential future payments and current 
carrying amounts. 

54 

Capital Management The Company is committed to managing 
capital to maintain strong protection for depositors and creditors 
and for maximum shareholder benefit. The Company continually 
assesses its business risks and capital position. The Company 
also manages its capital to exceed regulatory capital 
requirements for banking organizations. To achieve its capital 
goals, the Company employs a variety of capital management 
tools, including dividends, common share repurchases, and the 
issuance of subordinated debt, non-cumulative perpetual 
preferred stock, common stock and other capital instruments. 
The Company repurchased approximately 28 million shares 

of its common stock in 2021, compared with approximately 
31 million shares in 2020. The average price paid for the shares 
repurchased in 2021 was $54.18 per share, compared with 
$53.32 per share in 2020. Beginning in March of 2020 and 
continuing through the remainder of 2020, the Company 
suspended all common stock repurchases except for those 
done exclusively in connection with its stock-based 
compensation programs. This action was initially taken to 
maintain strong capital levels given the impact and uncertainties 
of COVID-19 on the economy and global markets. Due to 
continued economic uncertainty, the Federal Reserve Board 
implemented measures beginning in the third quarter of 2020 
and extending through the second quarter of 2021, restricting 
capital distributions of all large bank holding companies, 
including the Company. These restrictions limited the aggregate 
amount of common stock dividends and share repurchases to 
an amount that did not exceed the average net income of the 
four preceding calendar quarters. Based on the results of the 
December 2020 Federal Reserve Board Stress Test, the 
Company announced on December 22, 2020 that its Board of 
Directors had approved an authorization to repurchase 
$3.0 billion of its common stock beginning January 1, 2021, and 
repurchased $1.5 billion of its common stock during the first six 
months of 2021 under this program. The Company suspended 
all common stock repurchases at the beginning of the third 
quarter of 2021, except for those done exclusively in connection 
with its stock-based compensation programs, due to its recently 
announced pending acquisition of MUFG Union Bank’s core 
regional banking franchise. The Company does not expect to 
commence repurchasing its common stock again until the 
second half of 2022, or after the acquisition closes in order to 
build capital prior to the acquisition. 

Based on the results of the 2021 Federal Reserve Board 
Annual Stress Test, the Company announced on September 14, 
2021 that its Board of Directors had approved a regular quarterly 
dividend of $0.46 per common share. This represented a 
9.5 percent increase over the previous dividend rate per 
common share of $0.42 per quarter. 

The Company will continue to monitor its capital position and 

may adjust its capital distributions based on economic 
conditions and its financial performance. Capital distributions, 
including dividends and stock repurchases, are subject to the 
approval of the Company’s Board of Directors and will align with 
regulatory requirements. For a more complete analysis of 

activities impacting shareholders’ equity and capital 
management programs, refer to Note 15 of the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Total U.S. Bancorp shareholders’ equity was $54.9 billion at 

December 31, 2021, compared with $53.1 billion at 
December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily the result of 
corporate earnings, partially offset by changes in unrealized gains 
and losses on available-for-sale investment securities included in 
other comprehensive income (loss), dividends and common 
share repurchases. 

The regulatory capital requirements effective for the Company 
follow Basel III, with the Company being subject to calculating its 
capital adequacy as a percentage of risk-weighted assets under 
the standardized approach. Under Basel III, banking regulators 
define minimum capital requirements for banks and financial 
services holding companies. These requirements are expressed 
in the form of a minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio, tier 1 
capital ratio, total risk-based capital ratio, tier 1 leverage ratio and 
a tier 1 total leverage exposure, or supplementary leverage, ratio. 
The Company’s minimum required level for these ratios at 
December 31, 2021, which include a stress capital buffer of 
2.5 percent for the common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital and 
total capital ratios, was 7.0 percent, 8.5 percent, 10.5 percent, 
4.0 percent, and 3.0 percent, respectively. The Company targets 
its regulatory capital levels, at both the bank and bank holding 
company level, to exceed the “well-capitalized” threshold for 
these ratios under the FDIC Improvement Act prompt corrective 
action provisions that are applicable to all banks. At 
December 31, 2021, the minimum “well-capitalized” thresholds 
under the prompt corrective action framework for the common 
equity tier 1 capital ratio, tier 1 capital ratio, total risk-based 
capital ratio, tier 1 leverage ratio, and tier 1 total leverage 
exposure ratio was 6.5 percent, 8.0 percent, 10.0 percent, 
5.0 percent, and 3.0 percent, respectively. Beginning in 2020, the 
Company elected to adopt a rule issued in 2020 by its regulators 
which permits banking organizations who adopt accounting 
guidance related to the impairment of financial instruments based 
on the current expected credit losses (“CECL”) methodology 
during 2020, the option to defer the impact of the effect of that 
guidance at adoption plus 25 percent of its quarterly credit 
reserve increases over the next two years on its regulatory capital 
requirements, followed by a three-year transition period to phase 
in the cumulative deferred impact. As of December 31, 2021, the 
Company’s bank subsidiary met all regulatory capital ratios to be 
considered “well-capitalized”. There are no conditions or events 
since December 31, 2021 that management believes have 
changed the risk-based category of its covered subsidiary bank. 

As an approved mortgage seller and servicer, U.S. Bank National 

Association, through its mortgage banking division, is required to 
maintain various levels of shareholder’s equity, as specified by 
various agencies, including the United States Department of 
Housing and Urban Development, Government National Mortgage 
Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the 
Federal National Mortgage Association. At December 31, 2021, 
U.S. Bank National Association met these requirements.

Table 22 provides a summary of statutory regulatory capital 
ratios in effect for the Company at December 31, 2021 and 2020. 
All regulatory ratios exceeded regulatory “well-capitalized” 
requirements. 

The Company believes certain other capital ratios are useful in 

evaluating its capital adequacy. At December 31, 2021, the 
Company’s tangible common equity, as a percent of tangible 
assets and as a percent of risk-weighted assets determined in 
accordance with transitional regulatory capital requirements 
related to the CECL methodology under the standardized 
approach, was 6.8 percent and 9.2 percent, respectively, 
compared with 6.9 percent and 9.5 percent at December 31, 
2020, respectively. In addition, the Company’s common equity 
tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio, reflecting the full 
implementation of the CECL methodology was 9.6 percent at 
December 31, 2021, compared with 9.3 percent at 
December 31, 2020. Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” 
beginning on page 60 for further information on these other 
capital ratios. 

Line of Business Financial Review 

The Company’s major lines of business are Corporate and 
Commercial Banking, Consumer and Business Banking, Wealth 
Management and Investment Services, Payment Services, and 
Treasury and Corporate Support. These operating segments are 
components of the Company about which financial information is 
prepared and is evaluated regularly by management in deciding 
how to allocate resources and assess performance. 

Basis for Financial Presentation Business line results are 
derived from the Company’s business unit profitability reporting 
systems by specifically attributing managed balance sheet assets, 
deposits and other liabilities and their related income or expense. 
Refer to Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements for further information on the business lines’ basis for 
financial presentation. 

Designations, assignments and allocations change from time 

to time as management systems are enhanced, methods of 
evaluating performance or product lines change or business 
segments are realigned to better respond to the Company’s 
diverse customer base. During 2021, certain organization and 

methodology changes were made and, accordingly, 2020 results 
were restated and presented on a comparable basis. 

Corporate and Commercial Banking Corporate and 
Commercial Banking offers lending, equipment finance and small-
ticket leasing, depository services, treasury management, capital 
markets services, international trade services and other financial 
services to middle market, large corporate, commercial real 
estate, financial institution, non-profit and public sector clients. 
Corporate and Commercial Banking contributed $1.6 billion of 
the Company’s net income in 2021, or a decrease of $33 million 
(2.0 percent), compared with 2020. 

Net revenue decreased $593 million (13.1 percent) in 2021, 

compared with 2020. Net interest income, on a taxable-
equivalent basis, decreased $511 million (15.0 percent) in 2021, 
compared with 2020, primarily due to the impact of declining 
interest rates on the margin benefit from deposits as well as lower 
average loan balances, partially offset by favorable deposit mix 
with higher noninterest-bearing deposit balances and slightly 
higher loan spreads. Noninterest income decreased $82 million 
(7.3 percent) in 2021, compared with 2020, primarily driven by 
lower capital markets activities and trading revenue, partially 
offset by continued stronger treasury management fees due to 
core growth driven by the economic recovery. 

Noninterest expense decreased $33 million (1.9 percent) in 

2021, compared with 2020, primarily due to lower FDIC 
insurance expense and higher capitalized loan costs, partially 
offset by an increase in net shared services expense driven by 
investment in infrastructure and technology development. The 
provision for credit losses decreased $515 million (85.3 percent) 
in 2021, compared with 2020, primarily due to a decrease in the 
reserve allocation driven by improving portfolio credit quality in 
2021, compared with deteriorating credit quality in 2020. 

Consumer and Business Banking Consumer and Business 
Banking delivers products and services through banking offices, 
telephone servicing and sales, on-line services, direct mail, ATM 
processing and mobile devices. It encompasses community 
banking, metropolitan banking and indirect lending, as well as 
mortgage banking. Consumer and Business Banking contributed 
$2.3 billion of the Company’s net income in 2021, or a decrease 
of $103 million (4.3 percent), compared with 2020. 

56 

Net revenue decreased $358 million (4.0 percent) in 2021, 

compared with 2020. Net interest income, on a taxable-
equivalent basis, increased $318 million (5.5 percent) in 2021, 
compared with 2020, reflecting continued strong growth in 
deposit balances as well as favorable deposit mix, favorable loan 
spreads driven by growth in installment loans, and higher loan 
fees driven by loan forgiveness related to the SBA’s Paycheck 
Protection Program. These increases in net interest income were 
partially offset by lower deposit spreads and loan balances. 
Noninterest income decreased $676 million (21.3 percent) in 
2021, compared with 2020, primarily due to lower mortgage 
banking revenue reflecting lower application volume and related 
gain on sale margins as refinancing activities declined, along with 
a reduction in the fair value of MSRs, net of hedging activities, 
partially offset by higher gains on GNMA loan sales and higher 
retail product fees driven by retail leasing end of term residual 
gains. 

Noninterest expense increased $216 million (3.9 percent) in 

2021, compared with 2020, primarily due to increases in net 
shared services expense due to investments in digital capabilities 
and higher compensation expense related to merit increases, 
business growth and revenue-related compensation driven by 
business production. The provision for credit losses decreased 
$435 million in 2021, compared with 2020, due to a decrease in 
the reserve allocation reflecting improved credit quality in the 
current year. 

Wealth Management and Investment Services Wealth 
Management and Investment Services provides private banking, 
financial advisory services, investment management, retail 
brokerage services, insurance, trust, custody and fund servicing 
through four businesses: Wealth Management, Global Corporate 
Trust & Custody, U.S. Bancorp Asset Management and 
Fund Services. Wealth Management and Investment Services 
contributed $837 million of the Company’s net income in 2021, 
or a decrease of $104 million (11.1 percent), compared with 
2020. 

Net revenue decreased $45 million (1.4 percent) in 2021, 

compared with 2020. Net interest income, on a taxable-
equivalent basis, decreased $244 million (19.6 percent) in 2021, 
compared with 2020, primarily due to the declining margin benefit 
from deposits, partially offset by higher noninterest-bearing 
deposit balances driving favorable deposit mix, as well as higher 
average loan balances. Noninterest income increased 
$199 million (9.8 percent) in 2021, compared with 2020, primarily 
due to core business growth in trust and investment 

management fees and investment products fees, both driven by 
favorable market conditions, partially offset by higher fee waivers 
related to money market funds. 

Noninterest expense increased $86 million (4.4 percent) in 

2021, compared with 2020, reflecting higher compensation 
expense as a result of merit increases, higher performance-based 
incentives related to investment sales volumes and core business 
growth, and an increase in net shared services expense, partially 
offset by lower other noninterest expense due to the allocation to 
the business line of previously reserved legal matters in 2020. The 
provision for credit losses increased $7 million (17.5 percent) in 
2021, compared with 2020, due to increased loan loss provisions 
supporting stronger balance sheet growth in 2021 compared to 
2020. 

Payment Services Payment Services includes consumer and 
business credit cards, stored-value cards, debit cards, corporate, 
government and purchasing card services, consumer lines of 
credit and merchant processing. Payment Services contributed 
$1.7 billion of the Company’s net income in 2021, or an increase 
of $420 million (32.3 percent), compared with 2020. 

Net revenue increased $322 million (5.7 percent) in 2021, 

compared with 2020. Net interest income, on a taxable-
equivalent basis, decreased $104 million (4.1 percent) in 2021, 
compared with 2020, primarily due to lower loan balances and 
yields driven by higher credit card payment rates by customers. 
Noninterest income increased $426 million (13.6 percent) in 
2021, compared with 2020, mainly due to continued 
strengthening of consumer and business spending across most 
sectors driven by government stimulus, local jurisdictions 
reducing restrictions and consumer behaviors normalizing. As a 
result, there was strong growth in merchant processing services 
revenue driven by increased sales volume and higher merchant 
fees, partially offset by higher rebates. There was also solid 
growth in corporate payment products revenue driven by 
improving business spending across all product groups. Credit 
and debit card revenue increased, driven by stronger sales 
volume and fee activity. 

Noninterest expense increased $93 million (2.8 percent) in 
2021, compared with 2020, due to lower marketing costs during 
2020 reflecting the timing of marketing campaigns, along with 
incremental costs related to the prepaid card business in 2021. 
The provision for credit losses decreased $332 million (48.8 
percent) in 2021, compared with 2020, primarily driven by 
improved credit quality in 2021.

Treasury and Corporate Support Treasury and Corporate 
Support includes the Company’s investment portfolios, funding, 
capital management, interest rate risk management, income 
taxes not allocated to the business lines, including most 
investments in tax-advantaged projects, and the residual 
aggregate of those expenses associated with corporate activities 
that are managed on a consolidated basis. Treasury and 
Corporate Support recorded net income of $1.5 billion in 2021, 
compared with a net loss of $1.3 billion in 2020. 

Net revenue increased $176 million (19.4 percent) in 2021, 

compared with 2020. Net interest income, on a taxable-
equivalent basis, increased $217 million in 2021, compared with 
2020, due to favorable funding and deposit mix. Noninterest 
income decreased $41 million (4.3 percent) in 2021, compared 
with 2020, reflecting lower securities gains and changes in other 
noninterest income due to lower equity investment income and 
lower gains on sales of businesses in 2021, offset by the impact 
of asset impairments in 2020 as a result of branch closures. 
Noninterest expense decreased $3 million (0.3 percent) in 
2021, compared with 2020, primarily due to lower COVID-19 
related expenses compared with the prior year, including 
recognizing liabilities related to future delivery exposures for 
merchant and airline processing, lower net shared services 
expense, lower amortization related to tax-advantaged 
investments and lower severance and other accruals. These 
decreases were partially offset by higher compensation expense 
as a result of higher performance-based incentives and merit 
increases, as well as higher employee benefits driven by higher 
medical claims. The provision for credit losses was $3.7 billion 
lower in 2021, compared with 2020, reflecting the residual impact 
of changes in the allowance for credit losses being impacted by 
improving economic conditions in the current year, compared to 
deteriorating conditions in the prior year. 

Income taxes are assessed to each line of business at a 
managerial tax rate of 25.0 percent with the residual tax expense 
or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included 
in Treasury and Corporate Support. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

In addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the 
Company considers various other measures when evaluating 
capital utilization and adequacy, including: 

– Tangible common equity to tangible assets, 

– Tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets, and 

– Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, reflecting 

the full implementation of the CECL methodology. 

These capital measures are viewed by management as useful 

additional methods of evaluating the Company’s utilization of its 
capital held and the level of capital available to withstand 
unexpected negative market or economic conditions. 
Additionally, presentation of these measures allows investors, 
analysts and banking regulators to assess the Company’s capital 
position relative to other financial services companies. These 
capital measures are not defined in generally accepted 
accounting principles (“GAAP”), or are not currently effective or 
defined in banking regulations. In addition, certain of these 
measures differ from currently effective capital ratios defined by 
banking regulations principally in that the currently effective ratios, 
which are subject to certain transitional provisions, temporarily 
exclude the impact of the 2020 adoption of accounting guidance 
related to impairment of financial instruments based on the CECL 
methodology. As a result, these capital measures disclosed by 
the Company may be considered non-GAAP financial measures. 
Management believes this information helps investors assess 
trends in the Company’s capital adequacy. 

The Company also discloses net interest income and related 
ratios and analysis on a taxable-equivalent basis, which may also 
be considered non-GAAP financial measures. The Company 
believes this presentation to be the preferred industry 
measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant 
comparison of net interest income arising from taxable and 
tax-exempt sources. In addition, certain performance measures, 
including the efficiency ratio and net interest margin utilize net 
interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis. 

There may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to 

investors. As a result, the Company encourages readers to 
consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial 
information contained in this report in their entirety, and not to rely 
on any single financial measure.
