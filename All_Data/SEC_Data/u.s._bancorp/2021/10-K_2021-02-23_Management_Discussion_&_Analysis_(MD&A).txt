Management’s Discussion and Analysis 

Overview 
In 2020, U.S. Bancorp and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) 
continued to demonstrate its financial strength despite significant 
weakness in the domestic and global economies. The COVID-19 
pandemic and the mitigation efforts put in place by companies, 
consumers and governmental authorities to contain it created the 
most severe negative impact to the domestic and global 
economies since the Great Depression. These adverse economic 
conditions moderated during the second half of 2020 as the 
economies began to recover and unemployment began to 
decline. Despite a challenging economic environment, the 
Company’s diversified business mix generated healthy fee 
revenue growth, capital and liquidity are in a strong position, and 
the Company demonstrated strong discipline over its expense 
growth while continuing to invest in digital capabilities and key 
business initiatives to drive growth and improve efficiencies in the 
future. 

As a result of the economic challenges, the Company earned 
$5.0 billion in 2020, a decrease of $2.0 billion (28.3 percent) from 
2019, reflecting an increase in the provision for credit losses, 
lower net interest income and higher noninterest expense, 
partially offset by noninterest income growth. The increase in the 
provision for credit losses was driven by unfavorable economic 
conditions caused by the impact of COVID-19 on the domestic 
and global economies. Net interest income decreased as a result 
of lower interest rates, partially offset by changes in deposit and 
funding mix, loan growth and higher loan fees. Noninterest 
income increased due to significant growth in mortgage banking 
revenue due to refinancing activities and strong growth in 
commercial products revenue, partially offset by declines in 
payment services revenue and deposit service charges due to 
lower consumer and business spending. Noninterest expense 
increased reflecting costs incurred related to the COVID-19 
environment, an increase in revenue-related production expenses 
and higher costs related to developing digital capabilities and 
related business investment. 

In 2020, the Company grew its loan portfolio and increased 
deposits significantly. Average loan balances in 2020 increased 
$16.6 billion (5.7 percent) over 2019 primarily due to higher 
commercial loans, reflecting customer utilization of bank credit 
facilities to support their liquidity requirements, loans made under 

the Small Business Administration’s (“SBA”) Paycheck Protection 
Program, growth in residential mortgages given the lower interest 
rate environment, and higher commercial real estate loans. These 
increases were partially offset by lower credit card loans driven by 
a decline in consumer spending during the year, and lower other 
retail loans. Average deposit balances in 2020 increased 
$51.8 billion (14.9 percent) over 2019 primarily due to higher total 
savings and noninterest-bearing deposit balances, partially offset 
by lower time deposit balances. The growth in average total 
savings and noninterest-bearing deposits was primarily a result of 
actions taken by the federal government to increase liquidity in 
the financial system, customers maintaining balance sheet 
liquidity by utilizing existing credit facilities and government 
stimulus programs. 

The Company’s common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted 

assets ratio, using the Basel III standardized approach was 
9.7 percent at December 31, 2020. Refer to Table 23 for a 
summary of the statutory capital ratios in effect for the Company 
at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Further, credit rating 
organizations rate the Company’s debt among the highest of any 
bank in the world. This comparative financial strength provides 
the Company with favorable funding costs, strong liquidity and 
the ability to attract new customers. 

The Company’s financial strength, business model, credit 
culture and focus on efficiency have enabled it to deliver solid 
financial performance during the challenging economic 
environment of 2020. Given the current economic environment, 
the Company will continue to focus on managing credit losses 
and operating costs, while also utilizing its financial strength to 
grow market share. The Company believes it is well positioned for 
long-term growth in earnings per common share and industry-
leading returns on assets and common equity. The Company 
remains committed to delivering best-in-class products and 
services and in 2021 will continue to invest in its digital 
capabilities, technology and people to drive revenue growth and 
efficiency improvement.

Earnings Summary The Company reported net income 
attributable to U.S. Bancorp of $5.0 billion in 2020, or $3.06 per 
diluted common share, compared with $6.9 billion, or $4.16 per 
diluted common share, in 2019. Return on average assets and 
return on average common equity were 0.93 percent and 
10.0 percent, respectively, in 2020, compared with 1.45 percent 
and 14.1 percent, respectively, in 2019. During a challenging 
period adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
Company’s diversified business generated growth in net revenue 
and supported a provision for credit losses of $3.8 billion resulting 
in a $2.0 billion increase in the allowance for credit losses in 
2020. 

Total net revenue for 2020 was $339 million (1.5 percent) 
higher than 2019, reflecting a 5.8 percent increase in noninterest 
income, partially offset by a 1.7 percent decrease in net interest 
income (1.8 percent on a taxable-equivalent basis). The decrease 
in net interest income from the prior year was primarily due to the 
impact of lower rates, partially offset by changes in deposit and 
funding mix, loan growth and higher loan fees. The increase in 
noninterest income was driven by significant growth in mortgage 
banking revenue and commercial products revenue, as well as 
increases in trust and investment management fees and gains on 
the sale of investment securities. Growth in these fee categories 
was partially offset by a decline in payment services revenue and 
deposit service charges related to lower consumer and business 
spending. Additionally, other noninterest income declined from 
the prior year due to lower equity investment income and certain 
asset impairments, partially offset by gains on sale of certain 
businesses in 2020. 

Noninterest expense in 2020 was $584 million (4.6 percent) 
higher than 2019, reflecting costs related to COVID-19 and an 
increase in revenue-related production expenses in 2020. 
Additionally, noninterest expense reflected an increase in 
personnel costs and technology and communications expense 
related to developing digital capabilities and related business 
investment, as well as an increase in other noninterest expense, 
partially offset by lower marketing and business development 
expense. 

Results for 2019 Compared With 2018 For discussion related 
to changes in financial condition and results of operations for 
2019 compared with 2018, refer to “Management’s Discussion 
and Analysis” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for 
the year ended December 31, 2019, which was filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission on February 20, 2020. 

Statement of Income Analysis 
Net Interest Income Net interest income, on a taxable-
equivalent basis, was $12.9 billion in 2020, compared with 
$13.2 billion in 2019. The $231 million (1.8 percent) decrease in 
net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, in 2020 
compared with 2019, was principally driven by the impact of 
lower interest rates from the prior year, partially offset by changes 
in deposit and funding mix, loan growth and higher loan fees. 
Average earning assets were $50.9 billion (11.8 percent) higher in 
2020, compared with 2019, reflecting increases in loans, 
investment securities and other earning assets primarily 
representing cash balances. The net interest margin, on a 
taxable-equivalent basis, in 2020 was 2.68 percent, compared 
with 3.06 percent in 2019. The decrease in the net interest 
margin in 2020, compared with 2019, was primarily due to the 
impact of lower interest rates, changes in the yield curve, a 
decision to maintain higher cash balances for liquidity, and higher 
premium amortization within the investment portfolio, partially 
offset by the net benefit of changes in loan mix and deposit and 
funding mix. Refer to the “Interest Rate Risk Management” 
section for further information on the sensitivity of the Company’s 
net interest income to changes in interest rates. 

Average total loans were $307.3 billion in 2020, compared 

with $290.7 billion in 2019. The $16.6 billion (5.7 percent) 
increase was primarily due to higher commercial loans, residential 
mortgages and commercial real estate loans, partially offset by 
decreases in credit card loans and other retail loans. Average 
commercial loans increased $10.8 billion (10.4 percent), reflecting 
the utilization of bank credit facilities by customers to support 
liquidity requirements as well as the impact of loans made under 
the SBA’s Paycheck Protection Program. Average residential 
mortgages increased $5.9 billion (8.7 percent) due to higher 
mortgage loan production given the lower interest rate 
environment, and higher Government National Mortgage 
Association (“GNMA”) buybacks. Average commercial real estate 
loans increased $1.2 billion (3.0 percent) in 2020, compared with 
2019, primarily the result of higher commercial mortgage new 
business in the first half of 2020, along with slower paydowns of 
balances by customers in the second half of the year. Average 
credit card balances decreased $977 million (4.2 percent), 
reflecting the net impact of lower consumer spending during 
2020, partially offset by the acquisition of a credit card portfolio in 
2020. The $291 million (0.5 percent) decrease in average other 
retail loans was primarily due to lower home equity loans, 
revolving credit balances, auto loans and retail leasing loans, 
partially offset by an increase in installment loans.

Average investment securities in 2020 were $8.8 billion (7.5 

percent) higher than in 2019, primarily due to purchases of 
mortgage-backed securities, net of prepayments and maturities. 
Average total deposits for 2020 were $51.8 billion (14.9 
percent) higher than 2019. Average total savings deposits for 
2020 were $33.7 billion (14.7 percent) higher than 2019, driven 
by increases in Consumer and Business Banking, Corporate and 
Commercial Banking, and Wealth Management and Investment 
Services balances. Average noninterest-bearing deposits were 
$24.7 billion (33.4 percent) higher in 2020, compared with 2019, 
reflecting increases across all business lines. The growth in 
average total savings and noninterest-bearing deposits was 

primarily a result of the actions by the federal government to 
increase liquidity in the financial system, customers maintaining 
balance sheet liquidity by utilizing existing credit facilities and 
government stimulus programs. The increase in average 
noninterest-bearing deposits in Payment Services was driven by 
state unemployment distributions on prepaid debit cards. 
Average time deposits for 2020 were $6.5 billion (14.7 percent) 
lower than 2019, primarily driven by decreases in those deposits 
managed as an alternative to other funding sources, based 
largely on relative pricing and liquidity characteristics, partially 
offset by increases in Consumer and Business Banking balances 
reflecting the acquisition of deposit balances from State Farm 
Bank in the fourth quarter of 2020.

(a)  This table shows the components of the change in net interest income by volume and rate on a taxable-equivalent basis based on a federal income tax rate of 21 percent. This table does not 
take into account the level of noninterest-bearing funding, nor does it fully reflect changes in the mix of assets and liabilities. The change in interest not solely due to changes in volume or rates 
has been allocated on a pro-rata basis to volume and yield/rate. 

Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses 
reflects changes in economic conditions and the size and credit 
quality of the entire portfolio of loans. The Company maintains an 
allowance for credit losses considered appropriate by 
management for expected losses, based on factors discussed in 
the “Analysis and Determination of Allowance for Credit Losses” 
section. 

In 2020, the provision for credit losses was $3.8 billion, 
compared with $1.5 billion in 2019. In March 2020, economic 
conditions began to deteriorate, and continued to worsen in the 
second quarter of 2020, due to the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic. Economic conditions moderated during the second 
half of 2020 as economic projections for both the gross domestic 
product and unemployment levels improved throughout the third 
and fourth quarters. The Company recognized an increase of 
$1.9 billion in the allowance for credit losses during 2020 due to 
deteriorating credit quality and expected ongoing effects of these 
adverse economic conditions. In addition, the Company 

recognized an increase of $120 million in the allowance for credit 
losses during 2020, reflecting the expected losses within the 
acquired State Farm Bank credit card portfolio. Net charge-offs 
increased $332 million (22.8 percent) in 2020, compared with 
2019, reflecting higher commercial and commercial real estate 
loan net charge-offs, partially offset by a decrease in credit card 
loan net charge-offs. Nonperforming assets increased 
$469 million (56.6 percent) from December 31, 2019 to 
December 31, 2020, primarily driven by increases in 
nonperforming commercial and commercial real estate loans. 

Refer to “Corporate Risk Profile” for further information on the 
provision for credit losses, net charge-offs, nonperforming assets 
and other factors considered by the Company in assessing the 
credit quality of the loan portfolio and establishing the allowance 
for credit losses.

Noninterest Income Noninterest income in 2020 was 
$10.4 billion, compared with $9.8 billion in 2019. The $570 million 
(5.8 percent) increase in 2020 over 2019 reflected growth in 
mortgage banking revenue, commercial products revenue, and 
trust and investment management fees, as well as higher gains on 
sales of investment securities, partially offset by lower payment 
services revenue, deposit service charges and other noninterest 
income. Mortgage banking revenue increased $1.2 billion in 2020, 
compared with 2019, due to higher mortgage loan production 
driven by refinancing activities and stronger gain on sale margins, 
partially offset by declines in mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) 
valuations, net of hedging activities. Commercial products revenue 
increased 22.4 percent in 2020, compared with 2019, primarily 
due to higher corporate bond issuance fees and trading revenue. 
Trust and investment management fees increased 3.8 percent due 
to business growth and favorable market conditions. Payment 
services revenue decreased in 2020, compared with 2019, due to 
a 5.3 percent decrease in credit and debit card revenue, a 
25.2 percent decrease in corporate payment products revenue 

TABLE 5  Noninterest Expense 

Year Ended December 31 (Dollars in Millions) 

and a 21.2 percent decrease in merchant processing services 
revenue, all driven by lower sales volume due to the worldwide 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer and business 
spending. The decrease in credit and debit card revenue was 
partially offset by the impact of higher prepaid card fees related to 
government stimulus programs adopted in 2020. Deposit service 
charges decreased 25.5 percent primarily due to lower consumer 
spending activities. Other noninterest income decreased 
19.2 percent in 2020, compared with 2019, primarily due to lower 
equity investment income and certain 2020 asset impairments as 
a result of expected branch closures and property damage from 
civil unrest that occurred during the year. These decreases in other 
noninterest income were partially offset by higher retail leasing end 
of term residual gains, higher tax-advantaged investment 
syndication revenue, gains on sales of certain businesses in 2020 
and the impact of a charge of $140 million in 2019 for a derivative 
liability related to Visa shares previously sold by the Company.

Noninterest Expense Noninterest expense in 2020 was 
$13.4 billion, compared with $12.8 billion in 2019. The 
Company’s efficiency ratio was 57.8 percent in 2020, compared 
with 55.8 percent in 2019. The $584 million (4.6 percent) increase 
in noninterest expense in 2020 over 2019 was driven by 
additional expenses of $574 million in 2020, representing 
incremental costs related to the prepaid card business, expenses 
related to COVID-19, and revenue-related expenses due to 
higher mortgage production and capital markets activities. In 
addition, the increases were also driven by business investments, 
including those related to increased digital capabilities. The 
increase in 2020 noninterest expense over 2019 reflected higher 
compensation expense, technology and communications 
expense, and other noninterest expense, partially offset by lower 
marketing and business development expense, net occupancy 
and equipment expense, and professional services expense. 
Compensation expense increased 4.9 percent in 2020 over 
2019, due to the impacts of merit increases and higher variable 
compensation related to business production within the 
mortgage banking and fixed income capital markets businesses. 
Technology and communications expense increased 
18.2 percent primarily due to capital expenditures supporting 
business technology investments and the impact of increased call 
center volume on prepaid cards related to government stimulus 
programs adopted in 2020. Other noninterest expense increased 
13.3 percent, reflecting expenses in 2020 related to COVID-19, 
higher revenue-related costs, merger-related costs related to 
acquired deposits, higher FDIC insurance expense driven by an 
increase in the assessment base, and higher state franchise 
taxes, partially offset by lower costs related to tax-advantaged 
projects in 2020 and the impact of $200 million of severance 
charges and asset impairment accruals recorded in 2019. 
Incremental costs related to COVID-19 include increased liabilities 
driven by the Company’s exposure as a credit card processor to 
charge-back risk on undelivered goods and services, including 
prepaid airline tickets, as well as expenses related to paying 
premium compensation to front-line workers and providing a safe 
working environment for employees. Marketing and business 
development expense decreased 25.4 percent due to a reduction 
in travel as a result of COVID-19 and a decrease in 2020 
marketing campaigns. Net occupancy and equipment expense 
decreased 2.8 percent due to branch closures, while professional 
services expense decreased 5.3 percent primarily due to fewer 
initiatives in 2020. 

Pension Plans Because of the long-term nature of pension 
plans, the related accounting is complex and can be impacted by 
several factors, including investment funding policies, accounting 
methods and actuarial assumptions. 

The Company’s pension accounting reflects the long-term 
nature of the benefit obligations and the investment horizon of 
plan assets. Amounts recorded in the financial statements reflect 
actuarial assumptions about participant benefits and plan asset 
returns. Changes in actuarial assumptions and differences in 
actual plan experience, compared with actuarial assumptions, are 
deferred and recognized in expense in future periods. 

Pension expense is expected to remain unchanged at 
$201 million in 2021, primarily due to expected earnings on 
higher plan assets due to the Company’s 2020 contributions of 
$1.2 billion, offset by a lower expected rate of return on assets of 
6.50 percent and a lower discount rate. Because of the 
complexity of forecasting pension plan activities, the accounting 
methods utilized for pension plans, the Company’s ability to 
respond to factors affecting the plans and the hypothetical nature 
of actuarial assumptions, the actual pension expense may differ 
from the expected amount. 

Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements for further information on the Company’s pension

Income Tax Expense The provision for income taxes was 
$1.1 billion (an effective rate of 17.6 percent) in 2020, compared 
with $1.6 billion (an effective rate of 19.2 percent) in 2019. The 
reduced tax rate for 2020 was primarily a result of reduced pretax 
income driven by current economic conditions, including the 
higher provision for credit losses. 

For further information on income taxes, refer to Note 18 of 

the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Balance Sheet Analysis 
Average earning assets were $481.4 billion in 2020, compared 
with $430.5 billion in 2019. The increase in average earning 
assets of $50.9 billion (11.8 percent) was primarily due to 
increases in loans of $16.6 billion (5.7 percent), investment 
securities of $8.8 billion (7.5 percent) and other earning assets of 
$22.3 billion, primarily representing higher cash balances. 

For average balance information, refer to Consolidated Daily 
Average Balance Sheet and Related Yields and Rates on pages 
144 and 145. 

Loans The Company’s loan portfolio was $297.7 billion at 
December 31, 2020, compared with $296.1 billion at 
December 31, 2019, an increase of $1.6 billion (0.5 percent). The 
increase was driven by an increase in residential mortgages of 
$5.6 billion (7.9 percent), partially offset by decreases in credit 
card loans of $2.4 billion (9.9 percent), commercial loans of 
$992 million (1.0 percent), commercial real estate loans of 
$435 million (1.1 percent) and other retail loans of $94 million

(0.2 percent). Table 6 provides a summary of the loan distribution by 
product type, while Table 12 provides a summary of the selected 
loan maturity distribution by loan category. Average total loans 
increased $16.6 billion (5.7 percent) in 2020, compared with 2019. 
The increase was due to growth in commercial loans, residential 
mortgages and commercial real estate loans, partially offset by lower 
credit card and other retail loans. 

Commercial Commercial loans, including lease financing, 
decreased $992 million (1.0 percent) at December 31, 2020, 
compared with December 31, 2019, reflecting paydowns by 
corporate customers, partially offset by loans made under the SBA’s 
Paycheck Protection Program. Average commercial loans increased 
$10.8 billion (10.4 percent) in 2020, compared with 2019, reflecting 
the utilization of bank credit facilities by customers to support 
liquidity requirements as well as the impact of loans made under the 
SBA’s Paycheck Protection Program. Table 7 provides a summary 
of commercial loans by industry and geographical location. 

Commercial Real Estate The Company’s portfolio of commercial 
real estate loans, which includes commercial mortgages and 
construction and development loans, decreased $435 million (1.1 
percent) at December 31, 2020, compared with December 31, 
2019. The decrease was primarily the result of customers paying 
TABLE 6  Loan Portfolio Distribution 

down balances, partially offset by new originations. Average 
commercial real estate loans increased $1.2 billion (3.0 percent) in 
2020, compared with 2019. Table 8 provides a summary of 
commercial real estate loans by property type and geographical 
location. 

The Company reclassifies construction loans to the 

commercial mortgage category if permanent financing criteria are 
met. In 2020, approximately $489 million of construction loans 
were reclassified to the commercial mortgage category. At 
December 31, 2020 and 2019, $80 million and $101 million, 
respectively, of tax-exempt industrial development loans were 
secured by real estate. The Company’s commercial mortgage 
and construction and development loans had unfunded 
commitments of $11.3 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019. 
The Company also finances the operations of real estate 
developers and other entities with operations related to real 
estate. These loans are not secured directly by real estate but 
have similar characteristics to commercial real estate loans. 
These loans were included in the commercial loan category and 
totaled $14.0 billion and $14.3 billion at December 31, 2020 and 
2019, respectively.

Residential Mortgages Residential mortgages held in the loan 
portfolio at December 31, 2020, increased $5.6 billion (7.9 
percent) over December 31, 2019. Average residential mortgages 
increased $5.9 billion (8.7 percent) in 2020, compared with 2019. 
The growth reflected higher mortgage production given the lower 
interest rate environment, and higher GNMA buybacks. 
Residential mortgages originated and placed in the Company’s 
loan portfolio include well-secured jumbo mortgages and branch-
originated first lien home equity loans to borrowers with high 
credit quality. 

Credit Card Total credit card loans decreased $2.4 billion 
(9.9 percent) at December 31, 2020, compared with 
December 31, 2019. Average credit card balances decreased 
$977 million (4.2 percent) in 2020, compared with 2019. The 
decreases reflected reduced consumer spending in 2020 driven 
by the impact of COVID-19, partially offset by the acquisition of 
the State Farm Bank credit card portfolio during 2020.

The Company generally retains portfolio loans through 

maturity; however, the Company’s intent may change over time 
based upon various factors such as ongoing asset/liability 
management activities, assessment of product profitability, credit 
risk, liquidity needs, and capital implications. If the Company’s 
intent or ability to hold an existing portfolio loan changes, it is 
transferred to loans held for sale. 

Loans Held for Sale Loans held for sale, consisting primarily of 
residential mortgages to be sold in the secondary market, were 

$8.8 billion at December 31, 2020, compared with $5.6 billion at 
December 31, 2019. The increase in loans held for sale was 
principally due to a higher level of mortgage loan closings in late 
2020, compared with the same period of 2019, given the lower 
interest rate environment. Almost all of the residential mortgage 
loans the Company originates or purchases for sale follow 
guidelines that allow the loans to be sold into existing, highly 
liquid secondary markets; in particular in government agency 
transactions and to government sponsored enterprises (“GSEs”).

(a)  Information related to asset and mortgage-backed securities included above is presented based upon weighted-average maturities that take into account anticipated future prepayments. 
(b)  Information related to obligations of state and political subdivisions is presented based upon yield to first optional call date if the security is purchased at a premium, and yield to maturity if the 

security is purchased at par or a discount. 

(c)  Maturity calculations for obligations of state and political subdivisions are based on the first optional call date for securities with a fair value above par and the contractual maturity date for 

securities with a fair value equal to or below par. 

(d)  Yields on investment securities are computed based on amortized cost balances. Weighted-average yields for obligations of state and political subdivisions are presented on a fully-taxable 

equivalent basis based on a federal income tax rate of 21 percent. 

Investment Securities The Company uses its investment 
securities portfolio to manage interest rate risk, provide liquidity 
(including the ability to meet regulatory requirements), generate 
interest and dividend income, and as collateral for public deposits 
and wholesale funding sources. While the Company intends to 
hold its investment securities indefinitely, it may sell 
available-for-sale securities in response to structural changes in 
the balance sheet and related interest rate risk and to meet 
liquidity requirements, among other factors. 

Available-for-sale investment securities totaled $136.8 billion 

at December 31, 2020, compared with $122.6 billion at 
December 31, 2019. The $14.2 billion (11.6 percent) increase 
reflected $11.5 billion of net investment purchases and a 
$2.7 billion favorable change in net unrealized gains (losses) on 
available-for-sale investment securities. The Company had no 
outstanding investment securities classified as held-to-maturity at 
December 31, 2020 and 2019. 

Average investment securities were $126.0 billion in 2020, 
compared with $117.2 billion in 2019. The weighted-average 
yield of the investment securities portfolio was 1.61 percent at 
December 31, 2020, compared with 2.38 percent at 
December 31, 2019. The weighted-average maturity of the 
investment securities portfolio was 3.4 years at December 31, 
2020, compared with 4.2 years at December 31, 2019. 
Available-for-sale investment securities by type are shown in 
Table 13. 

The Company’s available-for-sale investment securities are 
carried at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in other 
comprehensive income (loss) unless a portion of a security’s 
unrealized loss is related to credit and an allowance for credit 
losses is necessary. At December 31, 2020, the Company’s net 
unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities were $3.2 billion, 
compared with $496 million at December 31, 2019. The 
favorable change in net unrealized gains was primarily due to 
increases in the fair value of mortgage-backed, U.S. Treasury, 
and state and political securities as a result of changes in interest 
rates. Gross unrealized losses on available-for-sale investment 
securities totaled $53 million at December 31, 2020, compared 
with $448 million at December 31, 2019. When evaluating credit 
losses, the Company considers various factors such as the 
nature of the investment security, the credit ratings or financial 
condition of the issuer, the extent of the unrealized loss, expected 
cash flows of the underlying collateral, the existence of any 
government or agency guarantees, and market conditions. At 
December 31, 2020, the Company had no plans to sell securities 
with unrealized losses, and believes it is more likely than not that 
it would not be required to sell such securities before recovery of 
their amortized cost.

Financial Statements for further information on investment 
securities.

Deposits Total deposits were $429.8 billion at December 31, 
2020, compared with $361.9 billion at December 31, 2019. The 
$67.9 billion (18.7 percent) increase in total deposits reflected 
increases in noninterest-bearing and total savings deposits, 
partially offset by a decrease in time deposits. The increase in 
total deposits includes approximately $10 billion related to the 
acquisition of deposit balances from State Farm Bank in the 
fourth quarter of 2020. Average total deposits in 2020 increased 
$51.8 billion (14.9 percent) over 2019. 

Noninterest-bearing deposits at December 31, 2020, 

increased $42.5 billion (56.2 percent) from December 31, 2019. 
Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $24.7 billion 
(33.4 percent) in 2020, compared with 2019, reflecting increases 
across all business lines. 

Interest-bearing savings deposits increased $37.6 billion 

(15.4 percent) at December 31, 2020, compared with 
December 31, 2019. The increase was related to higher interest 
checking, savings and money market deposit balances. Interest 
checking balances increased $19.9 billion (26.3 percent) primarily 
due to higher Consumer and Business Banking, and Wealth 
Management and Investment Services balances. Savings 
account balances increased $9.6 billion (20.3 percent), driven by 
higher Consumer and Business Banking balances. Money market 
deposit balances increased $8.0 billion (6.6 percent), primarily 
due to higher Consumer and Business Banking, and Wealth 
Management and Investment Services balances. Average 
interest-bearing savings deposits in 2020 increased $33.7 billion 
(14.7 percent), compared with 2019, reflecting higher Consumer 

and Business Banking, Corporate and Commercial Banking, and 
Wealth Management and Investment Services balances. 

The growth in noninterest-bearing and total savings deposits 

was primarily a result of the economic impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic on the world economy resulting in actions by the 
federal government to increase liquidity in the financial system, 
customers maintaining balance sheet liquidity by utilizing existing 
credit facilities and government stimulus programs. The increase 
in noninterest-bearing deposits in Payment Services was driven 
by state unemployment distributions on prepaid debit cards. 
Interest-bearing time deposits at December 31, 2020, 

decreased $12.2 billion (28.4 percent), compared with 
December 31, 2019. Average time deposits decreased $6.5 billion 
(14.7 percent) in 2020, compared with 2019. The decreases were 
primarily driven by a decrease in those deposits managed as an 
alternative to other funding sources, based largely on relative pricing 
and liquidity characteristics, partially offset by an increase in 
Consumer and Business Banking balances reflecting the acquisition 
of deposit balances from State Farm Bank during 2020. 

Borrowings The Company utilizes both short-term and long-term 
borrowings as part of its asset/liability management and funding 
strategies. Short-term borrowings, which include federal funds 
purchased, commercial paper, repurchase agreements, borrowings 
secured by high-grade assets and other short-term borrowings, 
were $11.8 billion at December 31, 2020, compared with 
$23.7 billion at December 31, 2019. The $11.9 billion 
(50.4 percent) decline in short-term borrowings was primarily due to 
decreases in short-term Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”)

inability to fund obligations or new business at a reasonable cost 
and in a timely manner. Operational risk is the risk to current or 
projected financial condition and resilience arising from inadequate 
or failed internal processes or systems, people (including human 
errors or misconduct), or adverse external events, including the risk 
of loss resulting from breaches in data security. Operational risk can 
also include the risk of loss due to failures by third parties with which 
the Company does business. Compliance risk is the risk that the 
Company may suffer legal or regulatory sanctions, financial losses, 
and reputational damage if it fails to adhere to compliance 
requirements and the Company’s compliance policies. Strategic risk 
is the risk to current or projected financial condition arising from 
adverse business decisions, poor implementation of business 
decisions, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the banking 
industry and operating environment. Reputation risk is the risk to 
current or anticipated earnings, capital, or franchise or enterprise 
value arising from negative public opinion. This risk may impair the 
Company’s competitiveness by affecting its ability to establish new 
relationships or services, or continue serving existing relationships. In 
addition to the risks identified above, other risk factors exist that may 
impact the Company. Refer to “Risk Factors” beginning on 
page 146, for a detailed discussion of these factors. 

The Company’s Board and management-level governance 
committees are supported by a “three lines of defense” model for 
establishing effective checks and balances. The first line of 
defense, the business lines, manages risks in conformity with 
established limits and policy requirements. In turn, business line 
leaders and their risk officers establish programs to ensure 
conformity with these limits and policy requirements. The second 
line of defense, which includes the Chief Risk Officer’s 
organization as well as policy and oversight activities of corporate 
support functions, translates risk appetite and strategy into 
actionable risk limits and policies. The second line of defense 
monitors first line of defense conformity with limits and policies, 
and provides reporting and escalation of emerging risks and 
other concerns to senior management and the Risk Management 
Committee of the Board of Directors. The third line of defense, 
internal audit, is responsible for providing the Audit Committee of 
the Board of Directors and senior management with independent 
assessment and assurance regarding the effectiveness of the 
Company’s governance, risk management and control 
processes. 

Management regularly provides reports to the Risk 

Management Committee of the Board of Directors. The Risk 
Management Committee discusses with management the 
Company’s risk management performance, and provides a 
summary of key risks to the entire Board of Directors, covering 
the status of existing matters, areas of potential future concern 
and specific information on certain types of loss events. The Risk 
Management Committee considers quarterly reports by 
management assessing the Company’s performance relative to 

advances, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings 
balances, partially offset by higher repurchase agreement balances. 
Long-term debt was $41.3 billion at December 31, 2020, 

compared with $40.2 billion at December 31, 2019. The 
$1.1 billion (2.8 percent) increase was primarily due to $3.3 billion 
of bank note and $2.8 billion of medium-term note issuances, 
partially offset by $4.5 billion of bank note repayments and 
maturities, and $1.2 billion of medium-term note repayments. 
Refer to Notes 12 and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements for additional information regarding short-
term borrowings and long-term debt, and the “Liquidity Risk 
Management” section for discussion of liquidity management of 
the Company. 

Corporate Risk Profile 
Overview Managing risks is an essential part of successfully 
operating a financial services company. The Company’s Board of 
Directors has approved a risk management framework which 
establishes governance and risk management requirements for all 
risk-taking activities. This framework includes Company and 
business line risk appetite statements which set boundaries for 
the types and amount of risk that may be undertaken in pursuing 
business objectives and initiatives. The Board of Directors, 
primarily through its Risk Management Committee, oversees 
performance relative to the risk management framework, risk 
appetite statements, and other policy requirements. 

The Executive Risk Committee (“ERC”), which is chaired by 
the Chief Risk Officer and includes the Chief Executive Officer and 
other members of the executive management team, oversees 
execution against the risk management framework and risk 
appetite statements. The ERC focuses on current and emerging 
risks, including strategic and reputation risks, by directing timely 
and comprehensive actions. Senior operating committees have 
also been established, each responsible for overseeing a 
specified category of risk. 

The Company’s most prominent risk exposures are credit, 
interest rate, market, liquidity, operational, compliance, strategic, 
and reputation. Leveraging the Company’s risk management 
framework, the specific impacts of COVID-19 and related risks are 
identified for each of the most prominent exposures. With respect to 
direct impacts from COVID-19, oversight and governance is 
managed through a centralized command center with frequent 
reporting to the Managing Committee and ERC. The Board of 
Directors also oversees the Company’s responsiveness to the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Credit risk is the risk of loss associated with a 
change in the credit profile or the failure of a borrower or 
counterparty to meet its contractual obligations. Interest rate risk is 
the potential reduction of net interest income or market valuations as 
a result of changes in interest rates. Market risk arises from 
fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and security 
prices that may result in changes in the values of financial 
instruments, such as trading and available-for-sale securities, 
mortgage loans held for sale (“MLHFS”), MSRs and derivatives that 
are accounted for on a fair value basis. Liquidity risk is the possible 

36 

the risk appetite statements and the associated risk limits, 
including: 

– Macroeconomic environment and other qualitative 

considerations, such as regulatory and compliance changes, 
litigation developments, and technology and cybersecurity; 
– Credit measures, including adversely rated and nonperforming 

loans, leveraged transactions, credit concentrations and lending 
limits; 

– Interest rate and market risk, including market value and net 
income simulation, and trading-related Value at Risk (“VaR”); 

– Liquidity risk, including funding projections under various 

stressed scenarios; 

– Operational and compliance risk, including losses stemming 

from events such as fraud, processing errors, control breaches, 
breaches in data security or adverse business decisions, as well 
as reporting on technology performance, and various legal and 
regulatory compliance measures; 

– Capital ratios and projections, including regulatory measures 

and stressed scenarios; and 

– Strategic and reputation risk considerations, impacts and 

responses. 

Credit Risk Management The Company’s strategy for credit 
risk management includes well-defined, centralized credit 
policies, uniform underwriting criteria, and ongoing risk monitoring 
and review processes for all commercial and consumer credit 
exposures. The strategy also emphasizes diversification on a 
geographic, industry and customer level, regular credit 
examinations and management reviews of loans exhibiting 
deterioration of credit quality. The Risk Management Committee 
oversees the Company’s credit risk management process. 

In addition, credit quality ratings as defined by the Company, 

are an important part of the Company’s overall credit risk 
management and evaluation of its allowance for credit losses. 
Loans with a pass rating represent those loans not classified on 
the Company’s rating scale for problem credits, as minimal credit 
risk has been identified. Loans with a special mention or classified 
rating, including consumer lending and small business loans that 
are 90 days or more past due and still accruing, nonaccrual loans, 
those loans considered troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”), and 
loans in a junior lien position that are current but are behind a first 
lien position on nonaccrual, encompass all loans held by the 
Company that it considers to have a potential or well-defined 
weakness that may put full collection of contractual cash flows at 
risk. The Company’s internal credit quality ratings for consumer 
loans are primarily based on delinquency and nonperforming 
status, except for a limited population of larger loans within those 
portfolios that are individually evaluated. For this limited population, 
the determination of the internal credit quality rating may also 
consider collateral value and customer cash flows. Refer to Notes 
1 and 5 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for 
further discussion of the Company’s loan portfolios including 
internal credit quality ratings. 

The Company categorizes its loan portfolio into two 

segments, which is the level at which it develops and documents 

a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit 
losses. The Company’s two loan portfolio segments are 
commercial lending and consumer lending. 

The commercial lending segment includes loans and leases 

made to small business, middle market, large corporate, 
commercial real estate, financial institution, non-profit and public 
sector customers. Key risk characteristics relevant to commercial 
lending segment loans include the industry and geography of the 
borrower’s business, purpose of the loan, repayment source, 
borrower’s debt capacity and financial flexibility, loan covenants, 
and nature of pledged collateral, if any, as well as 
macroeconomic factors such as unemployment rates, gross 
domestic product levels, corporate bond spreads and long-term 
interest rates, all of which have been impacted by the COVID-19 
pandemic. These risk characteristics, among others, are 
considered in determining estimates about the likelihood of 
default by the borrowers and the severity of loss in the event of 
default. The Company considers these risk characteristics in 
assigning internal risk ratings to, or forecasting losses on, these 
loans, which are the significant factors in determining the 
allowance for credit losses for loans in the commercial lending 
segment. 

The consumer lending segment represents loans and leases 
made to consumer customers, including residential mortgages, 
credit card loans, and other retail loans such as revolving 
consumer lines, auto loans and leases, home equity loans and 
lines, and student loans, a run-off portfolio. Home equity or 
second mortgage loans are junior lien closed-end accounts fully 
disbursed at origination. These loans typically are fixed rate loans, 
secured by residential real estate, with a 10- or 15-year fixed 
payment amortization schedule. Home equity lines are revolving 
accounts giving the borrower the ability to draw and repay 
balances repeatedly, up to a maximum commitment, and are 
secured by residential real estate. These include accounts in 
either a first or junior lien position. Typical terms on home equity 
lines in the portfolio are variable rates benchmarked to the prime 
rate, with a 10- or 15-year draw period during which a minimum 
payment is equivalent to the monthly interest, followed by a 20-
or 10-year amortization period, respectively. At December 31, 
2020, substantially all of the Company’s home equity lines were 
in the draw period. Approximately $1.3 billion, or 12 percent, of 
the outstanding home equity line balances at December 31, 
2020, will enter the amortization period within the next 36 
months. Key risk characteristics relevant to consumer lending 
segment loans primarily relate to the borrowers’ capacity and 
willingness to repay and include unemployment rates, consumer 
bankruptcy filings and other macroeconomic factors, customer 
payment history and credit scores, and in some cases, updated 
loan-to-value (“LTV”) information reflecting current market 
conditions on real estate-based loans. These and other risk 
characteristics, including elevated risk resulting from the 
COVID-19 pandemic, are reflected in forecasts of delinquency 
levels, bankruptcies and losses which are the primary factors in 
determining the allowance for credit losses for the consumer 
lending segment. 

37 

The Company further disaggregates its loan portfolio 
segments into various classes based on their underlying risk 
characteristics. The two classes within the commercial lending 
segment are commercial loans and commercial real estate loans. 
The three classes within the consumer lending segment are 
residential mortgages, credit card loans and other retail loans. 

Because business processes and credit risks associated with 

unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as for 
loans, the Company utilizes similar processes to estimate its 
liability for unfunded credit commitments. The Company also 
engages in non-lending activities that may give rise to credit risk, 
including derivative transactions for balance sheet hedging 
purposes, foreign exchange transactions, deposit overdrafts and 
interest rate contracts for customers, investments in securities 
and other financial assets, and settlement risk, including 
Automated Clearing House transactions and the processing of 
credit card transactions for merchants. These activities are 
subject to credit review, analysis and approval processes. 

Economic and Other Factors In evaluating its credit risk, the 
Company considers changes, if any, in underwriting activities, the 
loan portfolio composition (including product mix and geographic, 
industry or customer-specific concentrations), collateral values, 
trends in loan performance and macroeconomic factors, such as 
changes in unemployment rates, gross domestic product levels 
and consumer bankruptcy filings, as well as the potential impact 
on customers and the domestic economy resulting from the 
COVID-19 pandemic. 

During the first half of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and the 

mitigation efforts put in place by companies, consumers and 
governmental authorities to contain it created the most severe 
negative impact to the domestic and global economies since the 
Great Depression. Beginning in the late first quarter and 
continuing into the second quarter of 2020, the gross domestic 
product declined substantially, while unemployment claims rose 
significantly. During the second half of the year, economic 
conditions began to moderate as economic projections for both 
the gross domestic product and unemployment levels improved 
from the second quarter. Although spending on many services 
continues to lag pre-pandemic levels, the rebound in the gross 
domestic product has been broad based across many industries. 
However, economic growth slowed somewhat in the fourth 
quarter as the number of COVID-19 cases increased and certain 
mitigation efforts were re-instated. Although a significant level of 
uncertainty exists related to future economic growth, economic 
activity is currently expected to remain at lower levels during the 
first half of 2021 and begin to grow in the second half of the year. 

Credit Diversification The Company manages its credit risk, in 
part, through diversification of its loan portfolio which is achieved 
through limit setting by product type criteria, such as industry, 
and identification of credit concentrations. As part of its normal 
business activities, the Company offers a broad array of 
traditional commercial lending products and specialized products 
such as asset-based lending, commercial lease financing, 
agricultural credit, warehouse mortgage lending, small business 

lending, commercial real estate lending, health care lending and 
correspondent banking financing. The Company also offers an 
array of consumer lending products, including residential 
mortgages, credit card loans, auto loans, retail leases, home 
equity loans and lines, revolving credit arrangements and other 
consumer loans. These consumer lending products are primarily 
offered through the branch office network, home mortgage and 
loan production offices, mobile and on-line banking, and indirect 
distribution channels, such as auto dealers. The Company 
monitors and manages the portfolio diversification by industry, 
customer and geography. Table 6 provides information with 
respect to the overall product diversification and changes in the 
mix during 2020. 

The commercial loan class is diversified among various industries 

with higher concentrations in real estate, financial institutions, 
healthcare, personal, professional and commercial services, media 
and entertainment, and retail. Additionally, the commercial loan class 
is diversified across the Company’s geographical markets with 
62.6 percent of total commercial loans within the Company’s 
Consumer and Business Banking region. Credit relationships 
outside of the Company’s Consumer and Business Banking region 
relate to the corporate banking, mortgage banking, auto dealer and 
leasing businesses, focusing on large national customers and 
specifically targeted industries, such as healthcare, utilities, oil and 
gas, and state and municipal government. Loans to mortgage 
banking customers are primarily warehouse lines which are 
collateralized with the underlying mortgages. The Company regularly 
monitors its mortgage collateral position to manage its risk 
exposure. Table 7 provides a summary of significant industry groups 
and geographical locations of commercial loans outstanding at 
December 31, 2020 and 2019. 

The commercial real estate loan class reflects the Company’s 
focus on serving business owners within its geographic footprint 
as well as regional and national investment-based real estate 
owners and builders. Within the commercial real estate loan 
class, different property types have varying degrees of credit risk. 
Table 8 provides a summary of the significant property types and 
geographical locations of commercial real estate loans 
outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019. At December 31, 
2020, approximately 21.9 percent of the commercial real estate 
loans represented business owner-occupied properties that tend 
to exhibit less credit risk than non owner-occupied properties. 
The investment-based real estate mortgages are diversified 
among various property types with somewhat higher 
concentrations in multi-family, office and retail properties. From a 
geographical perspective, the Company’s commercial real estate 
loan class is generally well diversified. However, at December 31, 
2020, 24.6 percent of the Company’s commercial real estate 
loans were secured by collateral in California, which has 
historically experienced higher credit quality deterioration in 
recessionary periods due to excess inventory levels and declining 
valuations. Included in commercial real estate at year-end 2020 
was approximately $431 million in loans related to land held for 
development and $419 million of loans related to residential and 
commercial acquisition and development properties. These loans 

38 

are subject to quarterly monitoring for changes in local market 
conditions due to a higher credit risk profile. The commercial real 
estate loan class is diversified across the Company’s 
geographical markets with 82.5 percent of total commercial real 
estate loans outstanding at December 31, 2020, within the 
Company’s Consumer and Business Banking region. 

The Company’s consumer lending segment utilizes several 
distinct business processes and channels to originate consumer 
credit, including traditional branch lending, mobile and on-line 
banking, indirect lending, alliance partnerships, correspondent 
banks and loan brokers. Each distinct underwriting and origination 
activity manages unique credit risk characteristics and prices its 
loan production commensurate with the differing risk profiles. 

Residential mortgage originations are generally limited to prime 
borrowers and are performed through the Company’s branches, loan 
production offices, mobile and on-line services, and a wholesale 
network of originators. The Company may retain residential mortgage 
loans it originates on its balance sheet or sell the loans into the 
secondary market while retaining the servicing rights and customer 
relationships. Utilizing the secondary markets enables the Company to 
effectively reduce its credit and other asset/liability risks. For residential 
mortgages that are retained in the Company’s portfolio and for home 
equity and second mortgages, credit risk is also diversified by 
geography and managed by adherence to LTV and borrower credit 
criteria during the underwriting process. 

The Company estimates updated LTV information on its 
outstanding residential mortgages quarterly, based on a method 
that combines automated valuation model updates and relevant 
home price indices. LTV is the ratio of the loan’s outstanding 
principal balance to the current estimate of property value. For 
home equity and second mortgages, combined loan-to-value 
(“CLTV”) is the combination of the first mortgage original principal 
balance and the second lien outstanding principal balance, 
relative to the current estimate of property value. Certain loans do 
not have an LTV or CLTV, primarily due to lack of availability of 
relevant automated valuation model and/or home price indices 
values, or lack of necessary valuation data on acquired loans. 

The following tables provide summary information of residential 
mortgages and home equity and second mortgages by LTV at

balances were considered sub-prime. 

Home equity and second mortgages were $12.5 billion at 

December 31, 2020, compared with $15.0 billion at 
December 31, 2019, and included $3.5 billion of home equity 
lines in a first lien position and $9.0 billion of home equity and 
second mortgage loans and lines in a junior lien position. Loans 
and lines in a junior lien position at December 31, 2020, included 
approximately $3.4 billion of loans and lines for which the 
Company also serviced the related first lien loan, and 
approximately $5.6 billion where the Company did not service the 
related first lien loan. The Company was able to determine the 
status of the related first liens using information the Company has 
as the servicer of the first lien or information reported on 
customer credit bureau files. The Company also evaluates other 
indicators of credit risk for these junior lien loans and lines, 
including delinquency, estimated average CLTV ratios and 
updated weighted-average credit scores in making its 
assessment of credit risk, related loss estimates and determining 
the allowance for credit losses.

Credit card and other retail loans are diversified across customer 
segments and geographies. Diversification in the credit card portfolio 
is achieved with broad customer relationship distribution through the 
Company’s and financial institution partners’ branches, retail and 
affinity partners, and digital channels.

(a)  Delinquent loan ratios exclude $1.8 billion, $1.7 billion, $1.7 billion, $1.9 billion and $2.5 billion at December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, of loans purchased from 
GNMA mortgage pools whose repayments are primarily insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Including these 
loans, the ratio of residential mortgages 90 days or more past due including all nonperforming loans was 2.87 percent, 2.92 percent, 3.21 percent, 4.16 percent and 5.73 percent at 
December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. 

Loan Delinquencies Trends in delinquency ratios are an 
indicator, among other considerations, of credit risk within the 
Company’s loan portfolios. The entire balance of a loan account 
is considered delinquent if the minimum payment contractually 
required to be made is not received by the date specified on the 
billing statement. The Company measures delinquencies, both 
including and excluding nonperforming loans, to enable 
comparability with other companies. Delinquent loans purchased 
from GNMA mortgage pools whose repayments are primarily 
insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by 
the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, are excluded 
from delinquency statistics. In addition, in certain situations, a 
consumer lending customer’s account may be re-aged to 
remove it from delinquent status. Generally, the purpose of 
re-aging accounts is to assist customers who have recently 
overcome temporary financial difficulties and have demonstrated 
both the ability and willingness to resume regular payments. To 
qualify for re-aging, the account must have been open for at least 
nine months and cannot have been re-aged during the preceding 
365 days. An account may not be re-aged more than two times 
in a five-year period. To qualify for re-aging, the customer must 

also have made three regular minimum monthly payments within 
the last 90 days. In addition, the Company may re-age the 
consumer lending account of a customer who has experienced 
longer-term financial difficulties and apply modified, 
concessionary terms and conditions to the account. Such 
additional re-ages are limited to one in a five-year period and 
must meet the qualifications for re-aging described above. All 
re-aging strategies must be independently approved by the 
Company’s risk management department. Commercial lending 
loans are generally not subject to re-aging policies. 

Accruing loans 90 days or more past due totaled $477 million 

at December 31, 2020, compared with $605 million at 
December 31, 2019. Accruing loans 90 days or more past due 
are not included in nonperforming assets and continue to accrue 
interest because they are adequately secured by collateral, are in 
the process of collection and are reasonably expected to result in 
repayment or restoration to current status, or are managed in 
homogeneous portfolios with specified charge-off timeframes 
adhering to regulatory guidelines. The ratio of accruing loans 
90 days or more past due to total loans was 0.16 percent at 
December 31, 2020, compared with 0.20 percent at 
December 31, 2019.

continue to accrue interest, compared with $428 million and $1.7 billion at December 31, 
2019, respectively. 

(b)  Includes revolving credit, installment, automobile and student loans. 

Restructured Loans In certain circumstances, the Company 
may modify the terms of a loan to maximize the collection of 
amounts due when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties 
or is expected to experience difficulties in the near-term. In most 
cases the modification is either a concessionary reduction in 
interest rate, extension of the maturity date or reduction in the 
principal balance that would otherwise not be considered. 

Troubled Debt Restructurings Concessionary modifications are 
classified as TDRs unless the modification results in only an 
insignificant delay in the payments to be received. TDRs accrue 
interest if the borrower complies with the revised terms and 
conditions and has demonstrated repayment performance at a 
level commensurate with the modified terms over several 
payment cycles, which is generally six months or greater. At 
December 31, 2020, performing TDRs were $3.6 billion, 

The Company continues to work with customers to modify 
loans for borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties. 
Many of the Company’s TDRs are determined on a case-by-case 
basis in connection with ongoing loan collection processes. The 
modifications vary within each of the Company’s loan classes. 
Commercial lending segment TDRs generally include extensions 
of the maturity date and may be accompanied by an increase or 
decrease to the interest rate. The Company may also work with 
the borrower to make other changes to the loan to mitigate 
losses, such as obtaining additional collateral and/or guarantees 
to support the loan. 

The Company has also implemented certain residential 
mortgage loan restructuring programs that may result in TDRs. 
The Company modifies residential mortgage loans under Federal 
Housing Administration, United States Department of Veterans 
Affairs, and its own internal programs. Under these programs, the 
Company offers qualifying homeowners the opportunity to 
permanently modify their loan and achieve more affordable 
monthly payments by providing loan concessions. These 
concessions may include adjustments to interest rates, 
conversion of adjustable rates to fixed rates, extensions of 
maturity dates or deferrals of payments, capitalization of accrued 
interest and/or outstanding advances, or in limited situations, 
partial forgiveness of loan principal. In most instances, 
participation in residential mortgage loan restructuring programs 
requires the customer to complete a short-term trial period. A 
permanent loan modification is contingent on the customer 
successfully completing the trial period arrangement, and the loan 
documents are not modified until that time. The Company reports 
loans in a trial period arrangement as TDRs and continues to 
report them as TDRs after the trial period. 

Credit card and other retail loan TDRs are generally part of 
distinct restructuring programs providing customers modification 
solutions over a specified time period, generally up to 60 months. 

In accordance with regulatory guidance, the Company 

considers secured consumer loans that have had debt 
discharged through bankruptcy where the borrower has not 
reaffirmed the debt to be TDRs. If the loan amount exceeds the 
collateral value, the loan is charged down to collateral value and 
the remaining amount is reported as nonperforming. 

Loan modifications or concessions granted to customers 
resulting directly from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
who were otherwise in current payment status, are not 
considered to be TDRs.

business credit cards with a modified rate equal to 0 percent. 

(b)  Primarily represents loans less than six months from the modification date that have not met the performance period required to return to accrual status (generally six months). 
(c)  Primarily represents loans with a modified rate equal to 0 percent. 
(d)  Includes $272 million of residential mortgage loans to borrowers that have had debt discharged through bankruptcy and $33 million in trial period arrangements or previously placed in trial 

period arrangements but not successfully completed. 

(e)  Includes $77 million of other retail loans to borrowers that have had debt discharged through bankruptcy and $16 million in trial period arrangements or previously placed in trial period

Includes $150 million of Federal Housing Administration and United States Department of Veterans Affairs residential mortgage loans to borrowers that have had debt discharged through 
bankruptcy and $277 million in trial period arrangements or previously placed in trial period arrangements but not successfully completed. 

(g)  Approximately 12.3 percent and 41.0 percent of the total TDR loans purchased from GNMA mortgage pools are 30-89 days past due and 90 days or more past due, respectively, but are not 

classified as delinquent as their repayments are insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. 

Short-term and Other Loan Modifications The Company 
makes short-term and other modifications that it does not 
consider to be TDRs, in limited circumstances, to assist 
borrowers experiencing temporary hardships. Short-term 
consumer lending modification programs include payment 
reductions, deferrals of up to three past due payments, and the 
ability to return to current status if the borrower makes required 
payments. The Company may also make short-term 
modifications to commercial lending loans, with the most 
common modification being an extension of the maturity date of 
three months or less. Such extensions generally are used when 
the maturity date is imminent and the borrower is experiencing 
some level of financial stress, but the Company believes the 
borrower will pay all contractual amounts owed. 

COVID-19 Payment Relief The Company has offered payment 
relief, including forbearance, payment deferrals and other 
customer accommodations, to assist borrowers that have 
experienced financial hardship resulting from the effects of the 

COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of these borrowers were not 
delinquent on payments at the time they received the payment 
relief. From March 2020 through December 31, 2020, the 
Company had approved approximately 365,000 loan 
modifications for these borrowers, representing approximately 
$27.2 billion. The loans modified consisted primarily of payment 
forbearance or deferrals of 90 days or less. A portion of the 
borrowers who received account modifications are no longer 
participating in these payment relief programs, as the programs 
are generally short-term; and at December 31, 2020, 
approximately 83,000 accounts, representing $10.1 billion, were 
currently in an active payment relief program. The recognition of 
delinquent or nonaccrual loans and loan net charge-offs may be 
delayed for those customers enrolled in these payment relief 
programs who would have otherwise moved into past due or 
nonaccrual status, as these customer accounts do not continue 
to age during the period the payment delay is provided.

Note: Payment relief generally includes payment deferrals, forbearances, extensions and re-ages, and excludes loans made under the Small Business Administration’s (“SBA”) Paycheck Protection 
Program, as amounts due under that program are expected to be fully forgiven by the SBA. 
(a)  Excludes loans purchased from GNMA mortgage pools, whose repayments are primarily insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the United States Department of 

Veterans Affairs. At December 31, 2020, 52.12 percent of the total number of accounts and 55.71 percent of the total loan balances of loans purchased from GNMA mortgage pools were to 
borrowers enrolled in payment relief programs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Including these loans, 13.61 percent of the total number of accounts and 11.42 percent of the total 
balances of residential mortgages were to borrowers enrolled in payment relief programs as result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Including these loans, .61 percent of the total number of 
accounts and 3.35 percent of the total balances of all loans were to borrowers enrolled in payment relief programs as result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Nonperforming Assets The level of nonperforming assets 
represents another indicator of the potential for future credit 
losses. Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, 
restructured loans not performing in accordance with modified 
terms and not accruing interest, restructured loans that have not 
met the performance period required to return to accrual status, 
other real estate owned (“OREO”) and other nonperforming 
assets owned by the Company. Interest payments collected from 
assets on nonaccrual status are generally applied against the 
principal balance and not recorded as income. However, interest 
income may be recognized for interest payments if the remaining 
carrying amount of the loan is believed to be collectible. 

At December 31, 2020, total nonperforming assets were 
$1.3 billion, compared with $829 million at December 31, 2019. 

The $469 million (56.6 percent) increase in nonperforming assets, 
from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020, was driven by 
increases in nonperforming commercial and commercial real 
estate loans. The ratio of total nonperforming assets to total loans 
and other real estate was 0.44 percent at December 31, 2020, 
compared with 0.28 percent at December 31, 2019. The 
Company expects nonperforming assets to remain elevated given 
current economic conditions. 

OREO was $24 million at December 31, 2020, compared with 
$78 million at December 31, 2019, and was related to foreclosed 
properties that previously secured loan balances. These balances 
exclude foreclosed GNMA loans whose repayments are primarily 
insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by 
the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.

Analysis of Loan Net Charge-offs Total loan net charge-offs 
were $1.8 billion in 2020, compared with $1.5 billion in 2019. The 
$332 million (22.8 percent) increase in total net charge-offs in 
2020, compared with 2019, reflected higher commercial and 
commercial real estate loan net charge-offs, partially offset by a 
decrease in credit card loan net charge-offs. The ratio of total 
loan net charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 
0.58 percent in 2020, compared with 0.50 percent in 2019. 

Commercial and commercial real estate loan net charge-offs 

for 2020 were $700 million (0.45 percent of average loans 
outstanding), compared with $299 million (0.21 percent of 
average loans outstanding) in 2019. The increase in net charge-
offs in 2020, compared with 2019, reflected higher charge-offs as 
a result of deteriorating economic conditions in 2020. 

Residential mortgage loan net charge-offs for 2020 reflected a 

net recovery of $12 million (0.02 percent of average loans 

outstanding), compared with $3 million of net charge-offs in 
2019. Credit card loan net charge-offs in 2020 were $829 million 
(3.71 percent of average loans outstanding), compared with 
$893 million (3.83 percent of average loans outstanding) in 2019. 
Other retail loan net charge-offs for 2020 were $269 million 
(0.47 percent of average loans outstanding), compared with 
$259 million (0.45 percent of average loans outstanding) in 2019. 
The decrease in total residential mortgage, credit card and other 
retail loan net charge-offs in 2020, compared with 2019, reflected 
lower credit card and residential mortgage loan charge-offs, 
partially offset by higher retail leasing charge-offs due to the 
inclusion of end of term losses on residual lease values as of 
January 1, 2020.

Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Credit Losses 
Prior to January 1, 2020, the allowance for credit losses was 
established to reserve for probable and estimable losses incurred in 
the Company’s loan and lease portfolio, including unfunded credit 
commitments. Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted 
new accounting guidance which changed previous impairment 
recognition to a model that is based on expected losses rather than 
incurred losses. The allowance considers expected losses for the 
remaining lives of the applicable assets, inclusive of expected 
recoveries. The allowance for credit losses is increased through 
provisions charged to earnings and reduced by net charge-offs. 
Management evaluates the appropriateness of the allowance for 
credit losses on a quarterly basis. Multiple economic scenarios are 
considered over a three-year reasonable and supportable forecast 
period, which incorporates historical loss experience in years two 
and three. These economic scenarios are constructed with 
interrelated projections of multiple economic variables, and loss 
estimates are produced that consider the historical correlation of 
those economic variables with credit losses. After the forecast 
period, the Company fully reverts to long-term historical loss 
experience, adjusted for prepayments and characteristics of the 
current loan and lease portfolio, to estimate losses over the 
remaining life of the portfolio. The economic scenarios are updated 
at least quarterly and are designed to provide a range of reasonable 
estimates, which are both better and worse than current 
expectations. Scenarios are weighted based on the Company’s 
expectation of economic conditions for the foreseeable future and 
reflect significant judgment and consider uncertainties that exist. 
Final loss estimates also consider factors affecting credit losses not 
reflected in the scenarios, due to the unique aspects of current 
conditions and expectations. These factors may include, but are not 
limited to, loan servicing practices, regulatory guidance, and/or fiscal 
and monetary policy actions. Because business processes and 
credit risks associated with unfunded credit commitments are 
essentially the same as for loans, the Company utilizes similar 
processes to estimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments, 

which is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet. Both the allowance for loan losses and the liability for 
unfunded credit commitments are included in the Company’s 
analysis of credit losses and reported reserve ratios. 

The allowance recorded for credit losses utilizes forward-
looking expected loss models to consider a variety of factors 
affecting lifetime credit losses. These factors include, but are not 
limited to, macroeconomic variables such as unemployment 
rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels, corporate 
bonds spreads and long-term interest rate forecasts, as well as 
loan and borrower characteristics, such as internal risk ratings on 
commercial loans and consumer credit scores, delinquency 
status, collateral type and available valuation information, 
consideration of end-of-term losses on lease residuals, and the 
remaining term of the loan, adjusted for expected prepayments. 
For each loan portfolio, model estimates are adjusted as 
necessary to consider any relevant changes in portfolio 
composition, lending policies, underwriting standards, risk 
management practices, economic conditions or other factors that 
may affect the accuracy of the model. Expected credit loss 
estimates also include consideration of expected cash recoveries 
on loans previously charged-off or expected recoveries on 
collateral-dependent loans where recovery is expected through 
sale of the collateral. Where loans do not exhibit similar risk 
characteristics, an individual analysis is performed to consider 
expected credit losses. 

The allowance recorded for individually evaluated loans 
greater than $5 million in the commercial lending segment is 
based on an analysis utilizing expected cash flows discounted 
using the original effective interest rate, the observable market 
price of the loan, or the fair value of the collateral, less selling 
costs, for collateral-dependent loans as appropriate. For 
commercial TDRs individually evaluated for impairment, attributes 
of the borrower are the primary factors in determining the 
allowance for credit losses. However, historical loss experience is

also incorporated into the allowance methodology applied to this 
category of loans. Commercial lending segment TDR loans may 
be collectively evaluated for impairment where observed 
performance history, including defaults, is a primary driver of the 
loss allocation. 

The allowance recorded for TDR loans in the consumer 
lending segment is determined on a homogenous pool basis 
utilizing expected cash flows discounted using the original 
effective interest rate of the pool. The expected cash flows on 
TDR loans consider subsequent payment defaults since 
modification, the borrower’s ability to pay under the restructured 
terms, and the timing and amount of payments. The allowance 
for collateral-dependent loans in the consumer lending segment 
is determined based on the current fair value of the collateral less 
costs to sell. 

When evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for 
credit losses for any loans and lines in a junior lien position, the 
Company considers the delinquency and modification status of 
the first lien. At December 31, 2020, the Company serviced the 
first lien on 38 percent of the home equity loans and lines in a 
junior lien position. The Company also considers the status of first 
lien mortgage accounts reported on customer credit bureau files 
when the first lien is not serviced by the Company. Regardless of 
whether the Company services the first lien, an assessment is 
made of economic conditions, problem loans, recent loss 
experience and other factors in determining the allowance for 
credit losses. Based on the available information, the Company 
estimated $209 million or 1.7 percent of its total home equity 
portfolio at December 31, 2020, represented non-delinquent 
junior liens where the first lien was delinquent or modified, 
excluding loans in COVID-related forbearance programs. 

The Company considers historical loss experience on the 
loans and lines in a junior lien position to establish loss estimates 
for junior lien loans and lines the Company services that are 

current, but the first lien is delinquent or modified. The historical 
long-term average loss experience related to junior liens has been 
relatively limited (less than 1 percent of the total portfolio 
annually), and estimates are adjusted to consider current 
collateral support and portfolio risk characteristics. These include 
updated credit scores and collateral estimates obtained on the 
Company’s home equity portfolio each quarter. In its evaluation of 
the allowance for credit losses, the Company also considers the 
increased risk of loss associated with home equity lines that are 
contractually scheduled to convert from a revolving status to a 
fully amortizing payment. 

Beginning January 1, 2020, when a loan portfolio is 

purchased, the acquired loans are divided into those considered 
purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration 
(“PCD”) and those not considered purchased with more than 
insignificant credit deterioration. An allowance is established for 
each population and considers product mix, risk characteristics 
of the portfolio, bankruptcy experience, delinquency status and 
refreshed LTV ratios when possible. The allowance established 
for purchased loans not considered PCD is recognized through 
provision expense upon acquisition, whereas the allowance 
established for loans considered PCD at acquisition is offset by 
an increase in the basis of the acquired loans. Any subsequent 
increases and decreases in the allowance related to purchased 
loans, regardless of PCD status, are recognized through 
provision expense, with charge-offs charged to the allowance. 
The Company did not have a material amount of PCD loans 
included in its loan portfolio at December 31, 2020. 

The Company’s methodology for determining the appropriate 
allowance for credit losses also considers the imprecision inherent 
in the methodologies used and allocated to the various loan 
portfolios. As a result, amounts determined under the 
methodologies described above are adjusted by management to 

48 

consider the potential impact of other qualitative factors not 
captured in quantitative model adjustments which include, but are 
not limited to, the following: model imprecision, imprecision in 
economic scenario assumptions, and emerging risks related to 
either changes in the economic environment that are affecting 
specific portfolios, or changes in portfolio concentrations over time 
that may affect model performance. The consideration of these 
items results in adjustments to allowance amounts included in the 
Company’s allowance for credit losses for each loan portfolio. 

The results of the analysis are evaluated quarterly to confirm 

the estimates are appropriate for each loan portfolio. Table 19 
shows the amount of the allowance for credit losses by loan class 
and underlying portfolio category. 

Although the Company determined the amount of each 
element of the allowance separately and considers this process 
to be an important credit management tool, the entire allowance 
for credit losses is available for the entire loan portfolio. The actual 
amount of losses can vary significantly from the estimated 
amounts. 

At December 31, 2020, the allowance for credit losses was 
$8.0 billion (2.69 percent of period-end loans), compared with an 
allowance of $4.5 billion (1.52 percent of period-end loans) at 
December 31, 2019. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to 
nonperforming loans was 654 percent at December 31, 2020, 
compared with 649 percent at December 31, 2019. The ratio of the 
allowance for credit losses to annual loan net charge-offs at 
December 31, 2020, was 448 percent, compared with 309 percent 
at December 31, 2019. Management determined the allowance for 
credit losses was appropriate at December 31, 2020. 

The increase in the allowance for credit losses of $3.5 billion 

(78.4 percent) at December 31, 2020, compared with 

December 31, 2019, reflected the $1.5 billion impact of the 
January 1, 2020 adoption of new accounting guidance, along 
with an additional $2.0 billion increase during 2020 to recognize 
the expected losses resulting from the deteriorating and ongoing 
effects of adverse economic conditions driven by the impact of 
COVID-19 on the domestic and global economies, as well as new 
loan production and acquired loans. Expected loss estimates 
consider various factors including the changing economic activity, 
potential mitigating effects of government stimulus, estimated 
duration and severity of the health crisis, customer specific 
information impacting changes in risk ratings, projected 
delinquencies and the impact of industry-wide loan modification 
efforts designed to limit long-term effects of the COVID-19 
pandemic, among other factors. 

Changes in economic conditions in 2020 included significant 

reductions in economic activity related to actions taken by 
customers and governmental authorities to slow the spread of 
COVID-19. Levels of employment and overall gross domestic 
product in the United States declined significantly with the initial 
wave of the pandemic, and had not fully recovered at December 
31, 2020, which contributed to the increase in expected credit 
losses. At the same time, record economic stimulus measures 
were also enacted, and additional measures are being 
considered, with the intent to support businesses and consumers 
through what is expected to be a period of reduced economic 
activity. These competing positive and negative factors are 
evaluated through a combination of quantitative calculations 
using economic scenarios and qualitative assessments that 
consider the high degree of uncertainty related to the 
unprecedented levels of both economic stress and the stimulus 
response. 

The following table summarizes the baseline forecast for key economic variables the Company used in its estimate of the allowance for 
credit losses at January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020:

Baseline economic forecasts are used in combination with 

alternative scenarios and historical loss experience as is 
considered reasonable and supportable to inform the Company’s 
allowance for credit losses. Changes in the allowance for credit 
losses are based on a variety of factors, including loan balance 
changes, portfolio credit quality and mix changes, and changes in 
general economic conditions and expectations (including for 
unemployment and gross domestic product), among other 
factors. Based on economic conditions at December 31, 2020, it 
was difficult to estimate the length and severity of the economic 
downturn that may result from COVID-19 and the impact of other 
factors that may influence the level of eventual losses and 
corresponding requirements for the allowance for credit losses, 
including the impact of economic stimulus programs and 
customer accommodation activity. While reserves consider the 
uncertainty in these estimates, the unpredictability of the 
COVID-19 pandemic could continue to result in the recognition of 
credit losses in the Company’s loan portfolios and changes in the 
allowance for credit losses, particularly if the economy worsens. 
The allowance for credit losses related to commercial lending 

segment loans increased $1.4 billion during the year ended 
December 31, 2020, as increased loan volume and credit 
downgrades during the period reflected the impact of COVID-19 
on certain industry sectors, including the retail and restaurants, 
energy, media and entertainment, lodging and airline industries 
that were severely impacted by virus containment measures. 

The following table summarizes the Company’s commercial 
lending segment credit exposure to customers within the industry 
sectors most impacted by COVID-19, as a percentage of total 
loans and legal commitments outstanding at December 31, 2020:

The allowance for credit losses related to consumer lending 

segment loans increased $592 million during the year ended 
December 31, 2020, as higher economic risks, including those 
due to increased unemployment, and increases in expected 
losses related to acquired portfolios were partially mitigated by 
strong underlying credit quality that supports expectations of 
long-term repayment, and the decline in funded loan balances. 

Residual Value Risk Management The Company manages its 
risk to changes in the residual value of leased vehicles, office and 
business equipment, and other assets through disciplined 
residual valuation setting at the inception of a lease, diversification 
of its leased assets, regular residual asset valuation reviews and 
monitoring of residual value gains or losses upon the disposition 
of assets. Lease originations are subject to the same well-defined 
underwriting standards referred to in the “Credit Risk 
Management” section, which includes an evaluation of the 
residual value risk. Retail lease residual value risk is mitigated 

further by effective end-of-term marketing of off-lease vehicles. 
Included in the retail leasing portfolio was approximately 
$6.3 billion of retail leasing residuals at December 31, 2020, 
compared with $6.6 billion at December 31, 2019. The Company 
monitors concentrations of leases by manufacturer and vehicle 
type. As of December 31, 2020, vehicle lease residuals related to 
sport utility vehicles were 46.3 percent of the portfolio, while truck 
and crossover utility vehicle classes represented approximately 
32.8 percent and 14.3 percent of the portfolio, respectively. At 
year-end 2020, the individual vehicle model with the largest 
residual value outstanding represented 13.2 percent of the 
aggregate residual value of all vehicles in the portfolio. At 
December 31, 2020 and 2019, the weighted-average origination 
term of the portfolio was 41 months. At December 31, 2020, the 
commercial leasing portfolio had $498 million of residuals, 
compared with $481 million at December 31, 2019. At year-end 
2020, lease residuals related to trucks and other transportation 
equipment represented 32.2 percent of the total residual 
portfolio, while business and office equipment represented 
32.1 percent. 

Operational Risk Management. The Company operates in 
many different businesses in diverse markets and relies on the 
ability of its employees and systems to process a high number of 
transactions. Operational risk is inherent in all business activities, 
and the management of this risk is important to the achievement 
of the Company’s objectives. Business lines have direct and 
primary responsibility and accountability for identifying, 
controlling, and monitoring operational risks embedded in their 
business activities, including those additional or increased risks 
created by the economic and financial disruptions, and the 
Company’s alternative working arrangements resulting from the 
COVID-19 pandemic. The Company maintains a system of 
controls with the objective of providing proper transaction 
authorization and execution, proper system operations, proper 
oversight of third parties with whom it does business, 
safeguarding of assets from misuse or theft, and ensuring the 
reliability and security of financial and other data. 

Business continuation and disaster recovery planning is also 
critical to effectively managing operational risks. Each business 
unit of the Company is required to develop, maintain and test 
these plans at least annually to ensure that recovery activities, if 
needed, can support mission critical functions, including 
technology, networks and data centers supporting customer 
applications and business operations. 

While the Company believes it has designed effective 
processes to minimize operational risks, there is no absolute 
assurance that business disruption or operational losses would 
not occur from an external event or internal control breakdown. 
On an ongoing basis, management makes process changes and 
investments to enhance its systems of internal controls and 
business continuity and disaster recovery plans. 

In the past, the Company has experienced attack attempts on 
its computer systems, including various denial-of-service attacks 
on customer-facing websites. The Company has not experienced 
any material losses relating to these attempts, as a result of its 

50 

controls, processes and systems to protect its networks, 
computers, software and data from attack, damage or 
unauthorized access but future attacks could be more disruptive 
or damaging. Attack attempts on the Company’s computer 
systems are evolving and increasing, and the Company continues 
to develop and enhance its controls and processes to protect 
against these attempts. 

Compliance Risk Management The Company may suffer legal 
or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, or damage to its 
reputation through failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, 
standards of good practice, and codes of conduct, including 
those related to compliance with Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money 
laundering requirements, sanctions compliance requirements as 
administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, consumer 
protection and other requirements. The Company has controls 
and processes in place for the assessment, identification, 
monitoring, management and reporting of compliance risks and 
issues, including those created or increased by the economic and 
financial disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to 
“Supervision and Regulation” in the Company’s Annual Report on 
Form 10-K for further discussion of the regulatory framework 
applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. 

Interest Rate Risk Management In the banking industry, 
changes in interest rates are a significant risk that can impact 
earnings and the safety and soundness of an entity. The 
Company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates 
through asset and liability management activities within guidelines 
established by its Asset Liability Management Committee 
(“ALCO”) and approved by the Board of Directors. The ALCO has 
the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with the 
ALCO management policies, including interest rate risk exposure. 

TABLE 20  Sensitivity of Net Interest Income 

One way the Company measures and analyzes its interest rate 
risk is through net interest income simulation analysis. 

Simulation analysis incorporates substantially all of the 

Company’s assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet 
instruments, together with forecasted changes in the balance 
sheet and assumptions that reflect the current interest rate 
environment. Through this simulation, management estimates the 
impact on net interest income of various interest rate changes 
that differ in the direction, amount and speed of change over 
time, as well as the shape of the yield curve. This simulation 
includes assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to be 
affected by changes in loan and deposit growth. Assumptions are 
made to project interest rates for new loans and deposits based 
on historical analysis, management’s outlook and re-pricing 
strategies. These assumptions are reviewed and validated on a 
periodic basis with sensitivity analysis being provided for key 
variables of the simulation. The results are reviewed monthly by 
the ALCO and are used to guide asset/liability management 
strategies. 

The Company manages its interest rate risk position by 

holding assets with desired interest rate risk characteristics on its 
balance sheet, implementing certain pricing strategies for loans 
and deposits and selecting derivatives and various funding and 
investment portfolio strategies. 

Table 20 summarizes the projected impact to net interest 
income over the next 12 months of various potential interest rate 
changes. The sensitivity of the projected impact to net interest 
income over the next 12 months is dependent on balance sheet 
growth, product mix, deposit behavior, pricing and funding 
decisions. While the Company utilizes models and assumptions 
based on historical information and expected behaviors, actual 
outcomes could vary significantly.

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and Other Risks 
To manage the sensitivity of earnings and capital to interest rate, 
prepayment, credit, price and foreign currency fluctuations (asset 
and liability management positions), the Company enters into 
derivative transactions. The Company uses derivatives for asset 
and liability management purposes primarily in the following ways: 

– To convert fixed-rate debt and available-for-sale investment 

securities from fixed-rate payments to floating-rate payments; 

– To convert the cash flows associated with floating-rate debt 

from floating-rate payments to fixed-rate payments; 

– To mitigate changes in value of the Company’s unfunded 
mortgage loan commitments, funded MLHFS and MSRs; 

– To mitigate remeasurement volatility of foreign currency 

denominated balances; and 

– To mitigate the volatility of the Company’s net investment in 
foreign operations driven by fluctuations in foreign currency 
exchange rates. 

In addition, the Company enters into interest rate and foreign 

exchange derivative contracts to support the business 
requirements of its customers (customer-related positions). The 
Company minimizes the market and liquidity risks of customer-
related positions by either entering into similar offsetting positions 
with broker-dealers, or on a portfolio basis by entering into other 
derivative or non-derivative financial instruments that partially or 
fully offset the exposure from these customer-related positions. 
The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are either 
exchange-traded, centrally cleared through clearinghouses or 
over-the-counter. The Company does not utilize derivatives for 
speculative purposes. 

The Company does not designate all of the derivatives that it 
enters into for risk management purposes as accounting hedges 
because of the inefficiency of applying the accounting 
requirements and may instead elect fair value accounting for the 
related hedged items. In particular, the Company enters into 
interest rate swaps, swaptions, forward commitments to buy 
to-be-announced securities (“TBAs”), U.S. Treasury and 
Eurodollar futures and options on U.S. Treasury futures to 
mitigate fluctuations in the value of its MSRs, but does not 
designate those derivatives as accounting hedges. The estimated 
net sensitivity to changes in interest rates of the fair value of the 
MSRs and the related derivative instruments at December 31, 
2020, to an immediate 25, 50 and 100 bps downward movement 
in interest rates would be a decrease of approximately $5 million, 
an increase of $10 million and an increase of $81 million, 
respectively. An immediate upward movement in interest rates at 
December 31, 2020, of 25, 50 and 100 bps would result in an 
increase of approximately $20 million, $39 million and $46 million, 
in the fair value of the MSRs and related derivative instruments, 
respectively. Refer to Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements for additional information regarding MSRs. 
Additionally, the Company uses forward commitments to sell 
TBAs and other commitments to sell residential mortgage loans at 
specified prices to economically hedge the interest rate risk in its 
residential mortgage loan production activities. At December 31, 

2020, the Company had $15.0 billion of forward commitments to 
sell, hedging $7.0 billion of MLHFS and $12.0 billion of unfunded 
mortgage loan commitments. The forward commitments to sell 
and the unfunded mortgage loan commitments on loans intended 
to be sold are considered derivatives under the accounting 
guidance related to accounting for derivative instruments and 
hedging activities. The Company has elected the fair value option 
for the MLHFS. 

Derivatives are subject to credit risk associated with 
counterparties to the contracts. Credit risk associated with 
derivatives is measured by the Company based on the probability 
of counterparty default, including consideration of the COVID-19 
pandemic. The Company manages the credit risk of its derivative 
positions by diversifying its positions among various 
counterparties, by entering into master netting arrangements, 
and, where possible, by requiring collateral arrangements. The 
Company may also transfer counterparty credit risk related to 
interest rate swaps to third parties through the use of risk 
participation agreements. In addition, certain interest rate swaps, 
interest rate forwards and credit contracts are required to be 
centrally cleared through clearinghouses to further mitigate 
counterparty credit risk. 

For additional information on derivatives and hedging 

activities, refer to Notes 19 and 20 in the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements. 

LIBOR Transition In July 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial 
Conduct Authority announced that it would no longer require 
banks to submit rates for the London InterBank Offered Rate 
(“LIBOR”) after 2021. In November 2020, the Intercontinental 
Exchange Benchmark Administration, which is the administrator 
of LIBOR, proposed to cease the publication of all non-United 
States Dollar LIBOR rates and one week and two month United 
States Dollar LIBOR rates on December 31, 2021, but extend the 
publication of the remainder of United States Dollar LIBOR rates 
until June 30, 2023. The Company holds financial instruments 
that will be impacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR, including 
certain loans, investment securities, derivatives, borrowings and 
other financial instruments that use LIBOR as the benchmark 
rate. The Company also provides various services to customers 
in its capacity as trustee, which involve financial instruments that 
will be similarly impacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR. The 
Company anticipates these financial instruments will require 
transition to a new reference rate. This transition will occur over 
time as many of these arrangements do not have an alternative 
rate referenced in their contracts or a clear path for the parties to 
agree upon an alternative reference rate. In order to facilitate the 
transition process, the Company has instituted a LIBOR 
Transition Office and commenced an enterprise-wide project to 
identify, assess and monitor risks associated with the expected 
discontinuance or unavailability of LIBOR, actively engage with 
industry working groups and regulators, achieve operational 
readiness and engage impacted customers. During 2020, the 
Company began modifying its systems, models, procedures and 
internal infrastructure to be prepared to accept alternative 

52 

reference rates. The Company also adopted industry best 
practice guidelines for fallback language for new transactions, 
converted its cleared interest rate swaps discounting to Secured 
Overnight Financing Rate discounting, and distributed 
communications to certain impacted parties, both inside and 
outside the Company, on the transition. Refer to “Risk Factors” 
beginning on page 146, for further discussion on potential risks 
that could adversely affect the Company’s financial results as a 
result of the LIBOR transition. 

Market Risk Management In addition to interest rate risk, the 
Company is exposed to other forms of market risk, principally 
related to trading activities which support customers’ strategies 
to manage their own foreign currency, interest rate risk and 
funding activities. For purposes of its internal capital adequacy 
assessment process, the Company considers risk arising from its 
trading activities, as well as the remeasurement volatility of foreign 
currency denominated balances included on its Consolidated 
Balance Sheet (collectively, “Covered Positions”), employing 
methodologies consistent with the requirements of regulatory 
rules for market risk. The Company’s Market Risk Committee 
(“MRC”), within the framework of the ALCO, oversees market risk 
management. The MRC monitors and reviews the Company’s 
Covered Positions and establishes policies for market risk 
management, including exposure limits for each portfolio. The 
Company uses a VaR approach to measure general market risk. 
Theoretically, VaR represents the statistical risk of loss the 
Company has to adverse market movements over a one-day time 
horizon. The Company uses the Historical Simulation method to 
calculate VaR for its Covered Positions measured at the ninety-
ninth percentile using a one-year look-back period for 
distributions derived from past market data. The market factors 
used in the calculations include those pertinent to market risks 
inherent in the underlying trading portfolios, principally those that 
affect the Company’s corporate bond trading business, foreign 
currency transaction business, client derivatives business, loan 
trading business and municipal securities business, as well as 
those inherent in the Company’s foreign denominated balances 
and the derivatives used to mitigate the related measurement 
volatility. On average, the Company expects the one-day VaR to 
be exceeded by actual losses two to three times per year related 
to these positions. The Company monitors the accuracy of 
internal VaR models and modeling processes by back-testing 
model performance, regularly updating the historical data used by 
the VaR models and regular model validations to assess the 
accuracy of the models’ input, processing, and reporting 
components. All models are required to be independently 
reviewed and approved prior to being placed in use. If the 
Company were to experience market losses in excess of the 
estimated VaR more often than expected, the VaR models and 
associated assumptions would be analyzed and adjusted. 

The average, high, low and period-end one-day VaR amounts for 
the Company’s Covered Positions were as follows:

Given the market volatility in the first quarter of 2020 resulting 

from effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company 
experienced actual losses for its combined Covered Positions 
that exceeded VaR five times during the year ended 
December 31, 2020. The Company did not experience any actual 
losses for its combined Covered Positions that exceeded VaR 
during 2019. The Company stress tests its market risk 
measurements to provide management with perspectives on 
market events that may not be captured by its VaR models, 
including worst case historical market movement combinations 
that have not necessarily occurred on the same date. 

The Company calculates Stressed VaR using the same 
underlying methodology and model as VaR, except that a 
historical continuous one-year look-back period is utilized that 
reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate to the 
Company’s Covered Positions. The period selected by the 
Company includes the significant market volatility of the last four 
months of 2008. 

The average, high, low and period-end one-day Stressed VaR 
amounts for the Company’s Covered Positions were as follows:

Valuations of positions in client derivatives and foreign 
currency activities are based on discounted cash flow or other 
valuation techniques using market-based assumptions. These 
valuations are compared to third-party quotes or other market 
prices to determine if there are significant variances. Significant 
variances are approved by senior management in the Company’s 
corporate functions. Valuation of positions in the corporate bond 
trading, loan trading and municipal securities businesses are 
based on trader marks. These trader marks are evaluated against 
third-party prices, with significant variances approved by senior 
management in the Company’s corporate functions. 

The Company also measures the market risk of its hedging 

activities related to residential MLHFS and MSRs using the 
Historical Simulation method. The VaRs are measured at the 
ninety-ninth percentile and employ factors pertinent to the market 
risks inherent in the valuation of the assets and hedges. A 
one-year look-back period is used to obtain past market data for 
the models.

Liquidity Risk Management The Company’s liquidity risk 
management process is designed to identify, measure, and 
manage the Company’s funding and liquidity risk to meet its daily 
funding needs and to address expected and unexpected 
changes in its funding requirements. The Company engages in 
various activities to manage its liquidity risk. These activities 
include diversifying its funding sources, stress testing, and 
holding readily-marketable assets which can be used as a source 
of liquidity if needed. In addition, the Company’s profitable 
operations, sound credit quality and strong capital position have 
enabled it to develop a large and reliable base of core deposit 
funding within its market areas and in domestic and global capital 
markets. 

The Company’s Board of Directors approves the Company’s 

liquidity policy. The Risk Management Committee of the 
Company’s Board of Directors oversees the Company’s liquidity 
risk management process and approves a contingency funding 
plan. The ALCO reviews the Company’s liquidity policy and limits, 
and regularly assesses the Company’s ability to meet funding 
requirements arising from adverse company-specific or market 
events. 

The Company’s liquidity policy requires it to maintain 

diversified wholesale funding sources to avoid maturity, entity and 
market concentrations. The Company operates a Cayman 
Islands branch for issuing Eurodollar time deposits. In addition, 
the Company has relationships with dealers to issue national 
market retail and institutional savings certificates and short-term 
and medium-term notes. The Company also maintains a 
significant correspondent banking network and relationships. 
Accordingly, the Company has access to national federal funds, 
funding through repurchase agreements and sources of stable 
certificates of deposit and commercial paper. 

The Company regularly projects its funding needs under 
various stress scenarios and maintains a contingency funding 
plan consistent with the Company’s access to diversified sources 
of contingent funding. The Company maintains a substantial level 
of total available liquidity in the form of on-balance sheet and 
off-balance sheet funding sources. These liquidity sources include 
cash at the Federal Reserve Bank and certain European central 
banks, unencumbered liquid assets, and capacity to borrow from 
the FHLB and at Federal Reserve Bank’s Discount Window. 
Unencumbered liquid assets in the Company’s investment 
securities portfolio provides asset liquidity through the Company’s 
ability to sell the securities or pledge and borrow against them. At 
December 31, 2020, the fair value of unencumbered investment 
securities totaled $125.9 billion, compared with $114.2 billion at 
December 31, 2019. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements and “Balance Sheet Analysis” 
for further information on investment securities maturities and 
trends. Asset liquidity is further enhanced by the Company’s 
practice of pledging loans to access secured borrowing facilities 
through the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank. At December 31, 
2020, the Company could have borrowed a total of an additional 
$96.5 billion from the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank based on 
collateral available for additional borrowings. 

The Company’s diversified deposit base provides a sizeable 
source of relatively stable and low-cost funding, while reducing 
the Company’s reliance on the wholesale markets. Total deposits 
were $429.8 billion at December 31, 2020, compared with 
$361.9 billion at December 31, 2019. Refer to Table 14 and 
“Balance Sheet Analysis” for further information on the 
Company’s deposits. 

Additional funding is provided by long-term debt and short-

term borrowings. Long-term debt was $41.3 billion at 
December 31, 2020, and is an important funding source because 
of its multi-year borrowing structure. Refer to Note 13 of the 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on 
the terms and maturities of the Company’s long-term debt 
issuances and “Balance Sheet Analysis” for discussion on long-
term debt trends. Short-term borrowings were $11.8 billion at 
December 31, 2020, and supplement the Company’s other 
funding sources. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements and “Balance Sheet Analysis” for further 
information on the terms and trends of the Company’s short-term 
borrowings. 

The Company’s ability to raise negotiated funding at 

competitive prices is influenced by rating agencies’ views of the 
Company’s credit quality, liquidity, capital and earnings. Table 21 
details the rating agencies’ most recent assessments.

In addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis, 
the Company monitors the parent company’s liquidity. The parent 
company’s routine funding requirements consist primarily of 
operating expenses, dividends paid to shareholders, debt 
service, repurchases of common stock and funds used for 
acquisitions. The parent company obtains funding to meet its 
obligations from dividends collected from its subsidiaries and the 
issuance of debt and capital securities. The Company establishes 
limits for the minimal number of months into the future where the 
parent company can meet existing and forecasted obligations 
with cash and securities held that can be readily monetized. The 
Company measures and manages this limit in both normal and 
adverse conditions. The Company maintains sufficient funding to 
meet expected capital and debt service obligations for 24 months 
without the support of dividends from subsidiaries and assuming 
access to the wholesale markets is maintained. The Company 
maintains sufficient liquidity to meet its capital and debt service 
obligations for 12 months under adverse conditions without the 
support of dividends from subsidiaries or access to the wholesale 
markets. The parent company is currently well in excess of 
required liquidity minimums. 

Under United States Securities and Exchange Commission 

rules, the parent company is classified as a “well-known 
seasoned issuer,” which allows it to file a registration statement 
that does not have a limit on issuance capacity. “Well-known 
seasoned issuers” generally include those companies with 
outstanding common securities with a market value of at least 
$700 million held by non-affiliated parties or those companies 
that have issued at least $1 billion in aggregate principal amount 
of non-convertible securities, other than common equity, in the 
last three years. However, the parent company’s ability to issue 
debt and other securities under a registration statement filed with 
the United States Securities and Exchange Commission under 

these rules is limited by the debt issuance authority granted by 
the Company’s Board of Directors and/or the ALCO policy. 
At December 31, 2020, parent company long-term debt 
outstanding was $20.9 billion, compared with $18.6 billion at 
December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to 
$2.8 billion of medium-term note issuances, partially offset by 
$1.2 billion of medium-term note repayments. As of 
December 31, 2020, there was $1.5 billion of parent company 
debt scheduled to mature in 2021. Future debt maturities may be 
met through medium-term note and capital security issuances 
and dividends from subsidiaries, as well as from parent company 
cash and cash equivalents. 

Dividend payments to the Company by its subsidiary bank are 
subject to regulatory review and statutory limitations and, in some 
instances, regulatory approval. In general, dividends to the parent 
company from its banking subsidiary are limited by rules which 
compare dividends to net income for regulatorily-defined periods. 
For further information, see Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements. 

The Company is subject to a regulatory Liquidity Coverage 
Ratio (“LCR”) requirement which requires banks to maintain an 
adequate level of unencumbered high quality liquid assets to 
meet estimated liquidity needs over a 30-day stressed period. At 
December 31, 2020, the Company was compliant with this 
requirement. 

European Exposures The Company provides merchant 
processing and corporate trust services in Europe either directly 
or through banking affiliations in Europe. Revenue generated from 
sources in Europe represented approximately 2 percent of the 
Company’s total net revenue for 2020. Operating cash for these 
businesses is deposited on a short-term basis typically with 
certain European central banks. For deposits placed at other 
European banks, exposure is mitigated by the Company placing

(a)  Unrecognized tax positions of $474 million at December 31, 2020, are excluded as the Company cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the 

respective taxing authority. 

(b)  Includes obligations under finance leases. 
(c)  Amounts include obligations related to the unfunded non-qualified pension plan and postretirement welfare plan.

deposits at multiple banks and managing the amounts on deposit at 
any bank based on institution-specific deposit limits. At 
December 31, 2020, the Company had an aggregate amount on 
deposit with European banks of approximately $10.9 billion, 
predominately with the Central Bank of Ireland and Bank of England. 

In addition, the Company provides financing to domestic 
multinational corporations that generate revenue from customers 
in European countries, transacts with various European banks as 
counterparties to certain derivative-related activities, and through 
a subsidiary, manages money market funds that hold certain 
investments in European sovereign debt. Any further deterioration 
in economic conditions in Europe, including the potential negative 
impact of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European 
Union (“Brexit”), is not expected to have a significant effect on the 
Company related to these activities. The Company is focused on 
providing continuity of services, with minimal disruption resulting 
from Brexit, to customers with activities in European countries. 
The Company has made certain structural changes to its legal 
entities and operations in the United Kingdom and European 
Union, where needed, and migrated certain business activities to 
the appropriate jurisdictions to continue to provide such services 
and generate revenue. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Off-balance sheet 
arrangements include any contractual arrangements to which an 
unconsolidated entity is a party, under which the Company has 
an obligation to provide credit or liquidity enhancements or 
market risk support. Off-balance sheet arrangements also include 
any obligation related to a variable interest held in an 
unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, credit 
enhancement or market risk support. The Company has not 
utilized private label asset securitizations as a source of funding. 

Commitments to extend credit are legally binding and 

generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. 
Many of the Company’s commitments to extend credit expire 
without being drawn and, therefore, total commitment amounts 
do not necessarily represent future liquidity requirements or the 
Company’s exposure to credit loss. Commitments to extend 

credit also include consumer credit lines that are cancelable upon 
notification to the consumer. Total contractual amounts of 
commitments to extend credit at December 31, 2020 were 
$344.2 billion. The Company also issues and confirms various 
types of letters of credit, including standby and commercial. Total 
contractual amounts of letters of credit at December 31, 2020 
were $10.4 billion. For more information on the Company’s 
commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, refer to 
Note 22 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
The Company’s off-balance sheet arrangements with 
unconsolidated entities primarily consist of private investment 
funds or partnerships that make equity investments, provide debt 
financing or support community-based investments in 
tax-advantaged projects. In addition to providing investment 
returns, these arrangements in many cases assist the Company in 
complying with requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act. 
The investments in these entities generate a return primarily 
through the realization of federal and state income tax credits and 
other tax benefits, such as tax deductions from operating losses of 
the investments, over specified time periods. The entities in which 
the Company invests are generally considered variable interest 
entities (“VIEs”). The Company’s recorded net investment in these 
entities as of December 31, 2020 was approximately $3.0 billion. 
The Company also has non-controlling financial investments in 
private funds and partnerships considered VIEs. The Company’s 
recorded investment in these entities was approximately $35 million 
at December 31, 2020, and the Company had unfunded 
commitments to invest an additional $22 million. For more 
information on the Company’s interests in unconsolidated VIEs, refer 
to Note 7 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Guarantees are contingent commitments issued by the 

Company to customers or other third parties requiring the Company 
to perform if certain conditions exist or upon the occurrence or 
nonoccurrence of a specified event, such as a scheduled payment 
to be made under contract. The Company’s primary guarantees 
include commitments from securities lending activities in which 
indemnifications are provided to customers; indemnification or 

56 

buy-back provisions related to sales of loans and tax credit 
investments; and merchant charge-back guarantees through the 
Company’s involvement in providing merchant processing services. 
For certain guarantees, the Company may have access to collateral 
to support the guarantee, or through the exercise of other recourse 
provisions, be able to offset some or all of any payments made 
under these guarantees. 

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries, along with other 

Visa U.S.A. Inc. member banks, have a contingent guarantee 
obligation to indemnify Visa Inc. for potential losses arising from 
antitrust lawsuits challenging the practices of Visa U.S.A. Inc. and 
MasterCard International. The indemnification by the Company 
and other Visa U.S.A. Inc. member banks has no maximum 
amount. Refer to Note 22 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements for further details regarding guarantees, other 
commitments, and contingent liabilities, including maximum 
potential future payments and current carrying amounts. 

Capital Management The Company is committed to managing 
capital to maintain strong protection for depositors and creditors 
and for maximum shareholder benefit. The Company continually 
assesses its business risks and capital position. The Company 
also manages its capital to exceed regulatory capital requirements 
for banking organizations. To achieve its capital goals, the 
Company employs a variety of capital management tools, 
including dividends, common share repurchases, and the 
issuance of subordinated debt, non-cumulative perpetual 
preferred stock, common stock and other capital instruments. 

The Company repurchased approximately 31 million shares of its 

common stock in 2020, compared with approximately 81 million 
shares in 2019. The average price paid for the shares repurchased 
in 2020 was $53.32 per share, compared with $55.88 per share in 
2019. Beginning in March and continuing through the remainder of 
2020, the Company suspended all common stock repurchases 
except for those done exclusively in connection with its stock-based 
compensation programs. This action was initially taken by the 
Company to maintain strong capital levels given the impact and 
uncertainties of COVID-19 on the economy and global markets. Due 
to continued economic uncertainty, the Federal Reserve Board 
implemented measures beginning in the third quarter of 2020 and 
extending through the first quarter of 2021, restricting capital 
distributions of all large bank holding companies, including the 
Company. These restrictions initially included capping common 
stock dividends at existing rates and restricting share repurchases, 
and currently limit the aggregate amount of common stock 
dividends and share repurchases to an amount that does not 
exceed the average net income of the four preceding calendar 
quarters. On December 22, 2020, the Company announced that it 
had received its results on the December 2020 Stress Test from the 
Federal Reserve Board. Based on those results, the Company 
announced that its Board of Directors had approved an 
authorization to repurchase $3.0 billion of its common stock 
beginning January 1, 2021. The Company will continue to monitor 
the economic environment and will adjust its capital distributions as 
circumstances warrant. Additional capital distributions are subject to 
the approval of the Company’s Board of Directors, and will be 

consistent with regulatory requirements. For a more complete 
analysis of activities impacting shareholders’ equity and capital 
management programs, refer to Note 14 of the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Total U.S. Bancorp shareholders’ equity was $53.1 billion at 

December 31, 2020, compared with $51.9 billion at 
December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily the result of 
corporate earnings and changes in unrealized gains and losses 
on available-for-sale investment securities included in other 
comprehensive income (loss), partially offset by a reduction to 
retained earnings due to the January 1, 2020 adoption of 
accounting guidance related to the impairment of financial 
instruments, dividends and common share repurchases. 

The regulatory capital requirements effective for the Company 
follow Basel III, with the Company being subject to calculating its 
capital adequacy as a percentage of risk-weighted assets under 
the standardized approach. Under Basel III, banking regulators 
define minimum capital requirements for banks and financial 
services holding companies. These requirements are expressed in 
the form of a minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio, tier 1 
capital ratio, total risk-based capital ratio, tier 1 leverage ratio and 
a tier 1 total leverage exposure, or supplementary leverage, ratio. 
The Company’s minimum required level for these ratios at 
December 31, 2020, which include a stress capital buffer of 
2.5 percent for the common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital and 
total capital ratios, was 7.0 percent, 8.5 percent, 10.5 percent, 
4.0 percent, and 3.0 percent, respectively. The Company targets 
its regulatory capital levels, at both the bank and bank holding 
company level, to exceed the “well-capitalized” threshold for these 
ratios under the FDIC Improvement Act prompt corrective action 
provisions that are applicable to all banks. At December 31, 2020, 
the minimum “well-capitalized” thresholds under the prompt 
corrective action framework for the common equity tier 1 capital 
ratio, tier 1 capital ratio, total risk-based capital ratio, tier 1 
leverage ratio, and tier 1 total leverage exposure ratio 
was 6.5 percent, 8.0 percent, 10.0 percent, 5.0 percent, and 
3.0 percent, respectively. During 2020, the Company elected to 
adopt a rule issued during 2020 by its regulators which permits 
banking organizations who adopt accounting guidance related to 
the impairment of financial instruments based on the current 
expected credit losses (“CECL”) methodology during 2020, the 
option to defer the impact of the effect of that guidance at 
adoption plus 25 percent of its quarterly credit reserve increases 
over the next two years on its regulatory capital requirements, 
followed by a three-year transition period to phase in the 
cumulative deferred impact. As of December 31, 2020, the 
Company’s bank subsidiary met all regulatory capital ratios to be 
considered “well-capitalized”. There are no conditions or events 
since December 31, 2020 that management believes have 
changed the risk-based category of its covered subsidiary bank. 

As an approved mortgage seller and servicer, U.S. Bank National 

Association, through its mortgage banking division, is required to 
maintain various levels of shareholder’s equity, as specified by 
various agencies, including the United States Department of

Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the

U.S. Bank National Association met these requirements. 

Table 23 provides a summary of statutory regulatory capital 
ratios in effect for the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019. 
All regulatory ratios exceeded regulatory “well-capitalized” 
requirements. 

The Company believes certain other capital ratios are useful in 

evaluating its capital adequacy. At December 31, 2020, the 
Company’s tangible common equity, as a percent of tangible 
assets and as a percent of risk-weighted assets determined in 
accordance with transitional regulatory capital requirements 
related to the CECL methodology under the standardized 
approach, was 6.9 percent and 9.5 percent, respectively. This 
compares to the Company’s tangible common equity, as a 
percent of tangible assets and as a percent of risk-weighted 
assets under the standardized approach, of 7.5 percent and 
9.3 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2019. In addition, the 
Company’s common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 
ratio, reflecting the full implementation of the CECL methodology 
was 9.3 percent at December 31, 2020. Refer to “Non-GAAP 
Financial Measures” beginning on page 64 for further information 
on these other capital ratios. 

Fourth Quarter Summary 
The Company reported net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp 
of $1.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020, or $0.95 per diluted 
common share, compared with $1.5 billion, or $0.90 per diluted 
common share, for the fourth quarter of 2019. Return on average 
assets and return on average common equity were 1.10 percent 
and 12.1 percent, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2020, 
compared with 1.21 percent and 11.8 percent, respectively, for 
the fourth quarter of 2019. 

Total net revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020, was 

$84 million (1.5 percent) higher than the fourth quarter of 2019, 
reflecting a 4.7 percent increase in noninterest income, partially 
offset by a 1.0 percent decrease in net interest income 
(0.9 percent on a taxable-equivalent basis). The decrease in net 

interest income from the fourth quarter of 2019 was primarily due 
to the impact of lower interest rates from a year ago, partially 
offset by changes in deposit and funding mix, loan growth and 
higher loan fees. The noninterest income increase was driven by 
significant growth in mortgage banking revenue due to 
refinancing production, growth in commercial products revenue 
primarily due to commitment fees on unused lines and higher 
other noninterest income. Growth in these fee categories was 
partially offset by a decline in payment services revenue and 
deposit service charges related to lower consumer and business 
spending. 

Noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2020 was 
$37 million (1.1 percent) lower than the fourth quarter of 2019, 
reflecting the impact of severance charges and other accruals 
recorded in 2019, partially offset by business investments, costs 
related to COVID-19 and an increase in revenue-related 
production expenses in the fourth quarter of 2020. 

Fourth quarter 2020 net interest income, on a taxable-
equivalent basis, was $3.2 billion, representing a decrease of 
$30 million (0.9 percent) compared with the fourth quarter of 
2019. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of lower 
interest rates from the prior year, partially offset by changes in 
deposit and funding mix, loan growth and higher loan fees. The 
Company expects net interest income to decline slightly in the 
first quarter of 2021 in part due to seasonally fewer days. 
Average earning assets were $57.7 billion (13.1 percent) higher in 
the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with the fourth quarter of 
2019, reflecting increases of $7.4 billion (2.5 percent) in average 
loans, $11.8 billion (9.7 percent) in average investment securities 
and $34.9 billion in average other earning assets including cash 
balances being maintained for liquidity given the current 
economic environment. The net interest margin, on a taxable-
equivalent basis, in the fourth quarter of 2020 was 2.57 percent, 
compared with 2.92 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019. The 
decrease in net interest margin was primarily due to the impact of 
a lower yield curve and decisions to maintain higher cash 
balances for liquidity, partially offset by changes in deposit and 
funding mix. The Company expects its net interest margin to be 
relatively stable in the first quarter of 2021.

Noninterest income in the fourth quarter of 2020 was 

$2.6 billion, representing an increase of $114 million (4.7 percent) 
from the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase reflected higher 
mortgage banking revenue, commercial products revenue and 
other noninterest income, partially offset by lower payment 
services revenue and deposit service charges. Mortgage banking 
revenue increased $224 million (91.8 percent) due to higher 
mortgage loan production driven by refinancing activities and 
stronger gain on sale margins, partially offset by declines in the 
valuations of MSRs, net of hedging activities. The Company 
expects mortgage banking revenue to decline in the first quarter of 
2021, as compared with the fourth quarter of 2020, in line with the 
industry, as refinancing activity continues to moderate. 
Commercial products revenue increased $13 million (5.8 percent) 
primarily due to higher commercial loan and commercial leasing 
fees. Other noninterest income increased $73 million (52.9 
percent) in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with the same 
period of the prior year, reflecting higher retail leasing end of term 
residual gains, higher tax-advantaged investment syndication 
revenue and the impact of the fourth quarter of 2019 charge for 
the increased derivative liability related to Visa shares previously 
sold by the Company, partially offset by lower equity investment 
income. The decrease in payment services revenue reflected 

lower merchant processing services revenue of $98 million 
(24.0 percent), lower corporate payment products revenue of 
$32 million (20.3 percent) and lower credit and debit card revenue of 
$16 million (4.2 percent), all driven by lower sales volume due to the 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer and business 
spending. The decrease in credit and debit card revenue was 
partially offset by higher prepaid card fees as a result of government 
stimulus programs in 2020. Merchant processing services revenue 
and corporate payments products revenue are expected to decline 
in the first quarter of 2021, as compared with the first quarter of 
2020, reflecting lower travel and hospitality activity due to 
COVID-19. However, sales volume trends, excluding travel and 
hospitality, are expected to continue to improve compared to the 
fourth quarter of 2020, in line with consumer and business spending 
activity. Credit and debit card revenue is expected to increase in the 
first quarter of 2021, compared to the first quarter of 2020, as 
overall increases in sales volume are expected to more than offset 
lower travel and hospitality activity, and prepaid debit card volumes 
are expected to be higher due to the impact of government stimulus 
programs. Deposit service charges decreased $66 million (28.6 
percent) primarily due to lower consumer spending activities. 
Noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2020 was 
$3.4 billion, representing a decrease of $37 million (1.1 percent) 

59 

compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. The fourth quarter of 
2020 included incremental costs related to the prepaid card 
business, expenses related to COVID-19, and revenue-related 
expenses primarily due to higher mortgage production in addition 
to business investments, including those related to increased 
digital capabilities. The decrease in noninterest expense in the 
fourth quarter of 2020, as compared with the same period of the 
prior year, reflected lower other noninterest expense, net 
occupancy and equipment expense, professional services 
expense and marketing and business development expense, 
partially offset by higher technology and communications 
expense and compensation expense. Other noninterest expense 
decreased $102 million (18.9 percent), reflecting the impact of 
severance charges and other accruals recorded in the fourth 
quarter of 2019, along with lower costs related to tax-advantaged 
projects. These decreases in other noninterest expense were 
partially offset by higher expenses for revenue-related costs and 
COVID-19, merger-related costs related to acquired deposits and 
higher state franchise taxes. Net occupancy and equipment 
expense decreased $17 million (5.9 percent) due to expected 
branch closures, while professional services expense decreased 
$16 million (11.5 percent) primarily due to fewer initiatives in 
2020. Marketing and business development expense decreased 
$12 million (10.3 percent) due to a reduction in travel as a result 
of COVID-19. Technology and communications expense 
increased $71 million (24.4 percent) primarily due to the impact of 
increased call center volume related to prepaid cards and capital 
expenditures supporting business technology investments. 
Compensation expense in the fourth quarter of 2020 increased 
$46 million (2.9 percent) over the same period of the prior year, 
due to merit increases and higher variable compensation related 
to business production within mortgage banking. The Company 
expects its noninterest expenses to be relatively stable in the first 
quarter of 2021, as compared with the fourth quarter of 2020. 
The provision for credit losses for the fourth quarter of 2020 
was $441 million, an increase of $46 million (11.6 percent) from 
the same period of 2019. Net charge-offs were $441 million in 
the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with $385 million in the 
fourth quarter of 2019. The net charge-off ratio was 0.58 percent 
in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with 0.52 percent in the 
fourth quarter of 2019. 

The provision for income taxes was $395 million (an effective 

rate of 20.6 percent) for the fourth quarter of 2020, compared 
with $354 million (an effective rate of 19.2 percent) for the same 
period of 2019. 

Line of Business Financial Review 
The Company’s major lines of business are Corporate and 
Commercial Banking, Consumer and Business Banking, Wealth 
Management and Investment Services, Payment Services, and 
Treasury and Corporate Support. These operating segments are 
components of the Company about which financial information is 
prepared and is evaluated regularly by management in deciding 
how to allocate resources and assess performance. 

Basis for Financial Presentation Business line results are 
derived from the Company’s business unit profitability reporting 
systems by specifically attributing managed balance sheet assets, 
deposits and other liabilities and their related income or expense. 
Refer to Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements for further information on the business lines’ basis for 
financial presentation. 

Designations, assignments and allocations change from time 

to time as management systems are enhanced, methods of 
evaluating performance or product lines change or business 
segments are realigned to better respond to the Company’s 
diverse customer base. During 2020, certain organization and 
methodology changes were made and, accordingly, 2019 results 
were restated and presented on a comparable basis. 

Corporate and Commercial Banking Corporate and 
Commercial Banking offers lending, equipment finance and small-
ticket leasing, depository services, treasury management, capital 
markets services, international trade services and other financial 
services to middle market, large corporate, commercial real 
estate, financial institution, non-profit and public sector clients. 
Corporate and Commercial Banking contributed $1.6 billion of 
the Company’s net income in 2020, or a decrease of $122 million 
(7.2 percent), compared with 2019. 

Net revenue increased $375 million (9.5 percent) in 2020, 

compared with 2019. Net interest income, on a taxable-
equivalent basis, increased $158 million (5.1 percent) in 2020, 
compared with 2019, primarily due to higher noninterest-bearing 
and interest-bearing deposits and strong loan growth, partially 
offset by the impact of declining interest rates on the margin 
benefit from deposits, changes in loan mix and lower spreads on 
loans. Noninterest income increased $217 million (25.2 percent) 
in 2020, compared with 2019, primarily due to higher corporate 
bond issuance fees and trading revenue as corporate customers 
accessed the fixed income capital markets for bond issuances, 
as well as higher commercial loan and commercial leasing fees. 
Noninterest expense increased $52 million (3.2 percent) in 

2020, compared with 2019, primarily driven by higher 
compensation expense due to merit increases and variable 
compensation related to fixed income capital markets business 
production, higher FDIC insurance expense and higher other 
noninterest expense driven by legal costs, partially offset by a 
reduction in travel as a result of COVID-19. The provision for 
credit losses increased $486 million in 2020, compared with 
2019, primarily due to higher net charge-offs, along with an 
unfavorable change in the reserve allocation based on economic 
risks related to COVID-19 in the portfolio. 

Consumer and Business Banking Consumer and Business 
Banking delivers products and services through banking offices, 
telephone servicing and sales, on-line services, direct mail, ATM 
processing and mobile devices. It encompasses community 
banking, metropolitan banking and indirect lending, as well as 
mortgage banking. Consumer and Business Banking contributed 
$2.8 billion of the Company’s net income in 2020, or an increase 
of $424 million (18.0 percent), compared with 2019. 

60 

Net revenue increased $887 million (10.2 percent) in 2020, 

compared with 2019. Net interest income, on a taxable-
equivalent basis, decreased $88 million (1.4 percent) in 2020, 
compared with 2019, reflecting the impact of declining interest 
rates on the margin benefit from deposits, partially offset by 
higher noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposit balances, 
loan growth and higher loan fees driven in part by loans made 
under the SBA’s Paycheck Protection Program and higher 
GNMA buybacks, in addition to favorable loan spreads. 
Noninterest income increased $975 million (40.9 percent) in 
2020, compared with 2019, primarily due to higher mortgage 
banking revenue driven by higher mortgage loan production and 
stronger gain on sale margins, partially offset by declines in the 
valuation of MSRs, net of hedging activities. Other noninterest 
income increased primarily due to higher retail leasing end of term 
residual gains. The increases in noninterest income were partially 
offset by lower deposit service charges due to lower volume. 

Noninterest expense increased $312 million (5.9 percent) in 
2020, compared with 2019, primarily due to higher net shared 
services expense reflecting the impact of investment in 
infrastructure supporting business growth, higher variable 
compensation related to strong mortgage banking origination 
activities and higher other noninterest expense due to increased 
mortgage loan processing costs, partially offset by a reduction in 
travel as a result of COVID-19. The provision for credit losses 
increased $11 million (3.5 percent) in 2020, compared with 2019, 
due to higher net charge-offs. 

Wealth Management and Investment Services Wealth 
Management and Investment Services provides private banking, 
financial advisory services, investment management, retail 
brokerage services, insurance, trust, custody and fund servicing 
through four businesses: Wealth Management, Global Corporate 
Trust & Custody, U.S. Bancorp Asset Management and 
Fund Services. Wealth Management and Investment Services 
contributed $714 million of the Company’s net income in 2020, 
or a decrease of $177 million (19.9 percent), compared with 
2019. 

Net revenue decreased $102 million (3.4 percent) in 2020, 

compared with 2019. Net interest income, on a taxable-
equivalent basis, decreased $176 million (15.0 percent) in 2020, 
compared with 2019, primarily due to the impact of declining 
interest rates on the margin benefit from deposits, partially offset 
by higher interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposit 
balances, and changes in deposit mix. Noninterest income 
increased $74 million (4.1 percent) in 2020, compared with 2019, 
primarily due to the impact of favorable market conditions and 
business growth on trust and investment management fees, 

partially offset by higher fee waivers related to the money market 
funds. 

Noninterest expense increased $95 million (5.3 percent) in 

2020, compared with 2019, reflecting increased net shared 
services expense due to technology development and higher 
compensation expense due to the impact of merit increases. In 
addition, other noninterest expense was higher due to litigation 
settlements, partially offset by a reduction in travel as a result of 
COVID-19. The provision for credit losses increased $41 million in 
2020, compared with 2019, reflecting an unfavorable change in 
the reserve allocation driven by downgrades within the loan 
portfolio. 

Payment Services Payment Services includes consumer and 
business credit cards, stored-value cards, debit cards, corporate, 
government and purchasing card services, consumer lines of 
credit and merchant processing. Payment Services contributed 
$1.3 billion of the Company’s net income in 2020, or a decrease 
of $185 million (12.7 percent), compared with 2019. 

Net revenue decreased $531 million (8.6 percent) in 2020, 

compared with 2019. Net interest income, on a taxable-
equivalent basis, increased $56 million (2.3 percent) in 2020, 
compared with 2019, primarily due to favorable loan spreads and 
higher deposit balances as a result of state unemployment 
distributions on prepaid debit cards, partially offset by lower loan 
volume and loan fees. Noninterest income decreased 
$587 million (15.8 percent) in 2020, compared with 2019, mainly 
due to the impacts of COVID-19 on consumer and business 
spending volume in all payments businesses including merchant 
processing services, corporate payment products, and credit and 
debit card revenue. The decrease in credit and debit card 
revenue due to lower spending volume was partially offset by 
higher prepaid card fees as a result of government stimulus 
programs in 2020. 

Noninterest expense increased $145 million (4.6 percent) in 
2020, compared with 2019, reflecting incremental costs related 
to the prepaid card business and higher software expense due to 
capital expenditures and acquisitions, partially offset by lower 
marketing and business development expense due to the timing 
of marketing campaigns. The provision for credit losses 
decreased $428 million (38.6 percent) in 2020, compared with 
2019, reflecting a favorable change in the reserve allocation 
driven by lower outstanding loan balances and lower net charge-
offs, partially offset by the impact on the allowance for credit 
losses to recognize the expected losses within the acquired State 
Farm Bank credit card portfolio.

Treasury and Corporate Support Treasury and Corporate 
Support includes the Company’s investment portfolios, funding, 
capital management, interest rate risk management, income 
taxes not allocated to the business lines, including most 
investments in tax-advantaged projects, and the residual 
aggregate of those expenses associated with corporate activities 
that are managed on a consolidated basis. Treasury and 
Corporate Support recorded a net loss of $1.4 billion in 2020, 
compared with net income of $527 million in 2019. 

Net revenue decreased $290 million (25.7 percent) in 2020, 

compared with 2019. Net interest income, on a taxable-
equivalent basis, decreased $181 million in 2020, compared with 
2019, primarily due to higher prepayment amortization and lower 
reinvestment yields within the investment portfolio compared with 
the prior year. Noninterest income decreased $109 million 
(10.2 percent) in 2020, compared with 2019, primarily due to 
lower equity investment income, and certain 2020 asset 
impairments as a result of expected branch closures and 
property damage from civil unrest that occurred during the year. 
These decreases in noninterest income were partially offset by 
gains on the sale of certain businesses in 2020, higher investment 
securities gains and the impact of a 2019 charge for an increased 
derivative liability related to Visa shares previously sold by the 
Company. 

Noninterest expense decreased $20 million (2.1 percent) in 
2020, compared with 2019, primarily due to lower net shared 
services expense, lower costs related to tax-advantaged projects 
and the impact of severance charges and asset impairment 
accruals recorded in 2019. These decreases in noninterest 
expense were partially offset by the recognition of liabilities related 
to airline exposure and COVID-related expenses in 2020, higher 
compensation expense reflecting merit increases and stock-
based compensation, higher implementation costs of capital 
investments to support business growth, higher state franchise 
taxes and higher merger-related costs. The provision for credit 
losses was $2.2 billion higher in 2020, compared with 2019, 
reflecting the residual impact of changes in the allowance for 
credit losses being impacted by adverse economic conditions 
and the expected impact to credit losses within the Company’s 
loan portfolios due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Income taxes are assessed to each line of business at a 
managerial tax rate of 25.0 percent with the residual tax expense 
or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included 
in Treasury and Corporate Support. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
In addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the 
Company considers various other measures when evaluating 
capital utilization and adequacy, including: 

– Tangible common equity to tangible assets, 
– Tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets, and 
– Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, reflecting 

the full implementation of the CECL methodology. 

These capital measures are viewed by management as useful 
additional methods of evaluating the Company’s utilization of its 
capital held and the level of capital available to withstand 
unexpected negative market or economic conditions. 
Additionally, presentation of these measures allows investors, 
analysts and banking regulators to assess the Company’s capital 
position relative to other financial services companies. These 
capital measures are not defined in generally accepted 
accounting principles (“GAAP”), or are not currently effective or 
defined in banking regulations. In addition, certain of these 
measures differ from currently effective capital ratios defined by 
banking regulations principally in that the currently effective ratios, 
which are subject to certain transitional provisions, temporarily 
exclude the impact of the 2020 adoption of accounting guidance 
related to impairment of financial instruments based on the CECL 
methodology. As a result, these capital measures disclosed by 
the Company may be considered non-GAAP financial measures. 
Management believes this information helps investors assess 
trends in the Company’s capital adequacy. 

The Company also discloses net interest income and related 
ratios and analysis on a taxable-equivalent basis, which may also 
be considered non-GAAP financial measures. The Company 
believes this presentation to be the preferred industry 
measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant 
comparison of net interest income arising from taxable and 
tax-exempt sources. In addition, certain performance measures, 
including the efficiency ratio and net interest margin utilize net 
interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis. 

There may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to 

investors. As a result, the Company encourages readers to 
consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial 
information contained in this report in their entirety, and not to rely 
on any single financial measure.

Accounting Changes 

Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
discusses accounting standards recently issued but not yet 
required to be adopted and the expected impact of these 
changes in accounting standards. To the extent the adoption of 
new accounting standards materially affects the Company’s 
financial condition or results of operations, the impacts are 
discussed in the applicable section(s) of the Management’s 
Discussion and Analysis and the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The accounting and reporting policies of the Company comply 
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States 
and conform to general practices within the banking industry. The 
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP 
requires management to make estimates and assumptions. The 
Company’s financial position and results of operations can be 
affected by these estimates and assumptions, which are integral 
to understanding the Company’s financial statements. Critical 
accounting policies are those policies management believes are 
the most important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial 
condition and results, and require management to make 
estimates that are difficult, subjective or complex. Most 
accounting policies are not considered by management to be 
critical accounting policies. Several factors are considered in 
determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of 
financial statements. These factors include, among other things, 
whether the estimates are significant to the financial statements, 
the nature of the estimates, the ability to readily validate the 
estimates with other information (including third-party sources or 
available prices), sensitivity of the estimates to changes in 
economic conditions and whether alternative accounting 
methods may be utilized under GAAP. Management has 
discussed the development and the selection of critical 
accounting policies with the Company’s Audit Committee. 

Significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 of the 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Those policies 
considered to be critical accounting policies are described below. 

Allowance for Credit Losses Management’s evaluation of the 
appropriate allowance for credit losses is often the most critical of 
all the accounting estimates for a banking institution. It is an 
inherently subjective process impacted by many factors as 
discussed throughout the Management’s Discussion and 
Analysis section of the Annual Report. 

The methods utilized to estimate the allowance for credit 

losses, key assumptions and quantitative and qualitative 
information considered by management in determining the 
appropriate allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2020 are 
discussed in the “Credit Risk Management” section. Although 
methodologies utilized to determine each element of the 
allowance reflect management’s assessment of credit risk as 
identified through assessments completed of individual credits 

and of homogenous pools affected by material credit events, 
degrees of imprecision exist in these measurement tools due in 
part to subjective judgments involved and an inherent lag in the 
data available to quantify current conditions and events that affect 
credit loss reserve estimates. As discussed in the “Analysis and 
Determination of Allowance for Credit Losses” section, 
management considered the effect of changes in economic 
conditions, risk management practices, and other factors that 
contributed to imprecision of loss estimates in determining the 
allowance for credit losses. If not considered, expected losses in 
the credit portfolio related to imprecision and other subjective 
factors could have a dramatic adverse impact on the liquidity and 
financial viability of a banking institution. 

Given the many quantitative variables and subjective factors 
affecting the credit portfolio, changes in the allowance for credit 
losses may not directly coincide with changes in the risk ratings 
of the credit portfolio reflected in the risk rating process. This is in 
part due to the timing of the risk rating process in relation to 
changes in the business cycle, the exposure and mix of loans 
within risk rating categories, levels of nonperforming loans and 
the timing of charge-offs and expected recoveries. The allowance 
for credit losses on commercial lending segment loans measures 
the expected loss content on the remaining portfolio exposure, 
while nonperforming loans and net charge-offs are measures of 
specific impairment events that have already been confirmed. 
Therefore, the degree of change in the forward-looking expected 
loss in the commercial lending allowance may differ from the level 
of changes in nonperforming loans and net charge-offs. 
Management maintains an appropriate allowance for credit losses 
by updating allowance rates to reflect changes in expected 
losses, including expected changes in economic or business 
cycle conditions. 

Some factors considered in determining the appropriate 
allowance for credit losses are more readily quantifiable while 
other factors require extensive qualitative judgment. Management 
conducts an analysis with respect to the accuracy of risk ratings 
and the volatility of expected losses, and utilizes this analysis 
along with qualitative factors that can affect the precision of credit 
loss estimates, including economic conditions, such as changes 
in gross domestic product, unemployment or bankruptcy rates, 
and concentration risks, such as risks associated with specific 
industries, collateral valuations, and loans to highly leveraged 
enterprises, in determining the overall level of the allowance for 
credit losses. 

The Company considers a range of economic scenarios in its 
determination of the allowance for credit losses. These scenarios 
are constructed with interrelated projections of multiple economic 
variables, and loss estimates are produced that consider the 
historical correlation of those economic variables with credit 
losses, and also the expectation that conditions will eventually 
normalize over the longer run. Scenarios worse than the 
Company’s expected outcome at December 31, 2020 include 
risks that government stimulus in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic is less broad or less effective than expected, or that a 
longer or more severe health crisis prolongs the downturn in

recorded on the balance sheet for a particular asset or liability 
with related impacts to earnings or other comprehensive income 
(loss). 

When available, trading and available-for-sale securities are 

valued based on quoted market prices. However, certain 
securities are traded less actively and, therefore, quoted market 
prices may not be available. The determination of fair value may 
require benchmarking to similar instruments or performing a 
discounted cash flow analysis using estimates of future cash 
flows and prepayment, interest and default rates. For more 
information on investment securities, refer to Note 4 of the Notes 
to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

As few derivative contracts are listed on an exchange, the 
majority of the Company’s derivative positions are valued using 
valuation techniques that use readily observable market inputs. 
Certain derivatives, however, must be valued using techniques 
that include unobservable inputs. For these instruments, the 
significant assumptions must be estimated and, therefore, are 
subject to judgment. Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements provides a summary of the Company’s 
derivative positions. 

Refer to Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 

Statements for additional information regarding estimations of fair 
value. 

Mortgage Servicing Rights MSRs are capitalized as separate 
assets when loans are sold and servicing is retained, or may be 
purchased from others. The Company records MSRs at fair 
value. Because MSRs do not trade in an active market with 
readily observable prices, the Company determines the fair value 
by estimating the present value of the asset’s future cash flows 
utilizing market-based prepayment rates, option adjusted spread, 
and other assumptions validated through comparison to trade 
information, industry surveys and independent third-party 
valuations. Changes in the fair value of MSRs are recorded in 
earnings during the period in which they occur. Risks inherent in 
the valuation of MSRs include higher than expected prepayment 
rates and/or delayed receipt of cash flows. The Company utilizes 
derivatives, including interest rate swaps, swaptions, forward 
commitments to buy TBAs, U.S. Treasury and Eurodollar futures 
and options on U.S. Treasury futures, to mitigate the valuation 
risk. Refer to Notes 9 and 21 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements for additional information on the 
assumptions used in determining the fair value of MSRs and an 
analysis of the sensitivity to changes in interest rates of the fair 
value of the MSRs portfolio and the related derivative instruments 
used to mitigate the valuation risk. 

economic activity, reducing the number of businesses that are 
ultimately able to resume operations after the crisis has passed. 
Under the range of economic scenarios considered, the 

allowance for credit losses would have been lower by 
$538 million or higher by $1.2 billion. This range reflects the 
sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses specifically related to 
the scenarios and weights considered as of December 31, 2020, 
and does not consider other potential adjustments that could 
increase or decrease loss estimates calculated using alternative 
economic scenarios. 

Because several quantitative and qualitative factors are 
considered in determining the allowance for credit losses, these 
sensitivity analyses do not necessarily reflect the nature and 
extent of future changes in the allowance for credit losses. They 
are intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse 
changes in the economy on the Company’s modeled loss 
estimates for the loan portfolio and do not imply any expectation 
of future deterioration in the risk rating or loss rates. Given current 
processes employed by the Company, management believes the 
risk ratings and loss model estimates currently assigned are 
appropriate. It is possible that others, given the same information, 
may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions 
that could be significant to the Company’s financial statements. 
Refer to the “Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for 
Credit Losses” section for further information. 

Fair Value Estimates A portion of the Company’s assets and 
liabilities are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet, with changes in fair value recorded either through earnings 
or other comprehensive income (loss) in accordance with 
applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States. These include all of the Company’s available-for-sale 
investment securities, derivatives and other trading instruments, 
MSRs and MLHFS. The estimation of fair value also affects other 
loans held for sale, which are recorded at the lower-of-cost-or-fair 
value. The determination of fair value is important for certain other 
assets that are periodically evaluated for impairment using fair 
value estimates, including goodwill and other intangible assets, 
impaired loans, OREO and other repossessed assets. 

Fair value is generally defined as the exit price at which an 
asset or liability could be exchanged in a current transaction 
between willing, unrelated parties, other than in a forced or 
liquidation sale. Fair value is based on quoted market prices in an 
active market, or if market prices are not available, is estimated 
using models employing techniques such as matrix pricing or 
discounting expected cash flows. The significant assumptions 
used in the models, which include assumptions for interest rates, 
discount rates, prepayments and credit losses, are independently 
verified against observable market data where possible. Where 
observable market data is not available, the estimate of fair value 
becomes more subjective and involves a high degree of 
judgment. In this circumstance, fair value is estimated based on 
management’s judgment regarding the value that market 
participants would assign to the asset or liability. This valuation 
process takes into consideration factors such as market illiquidity. 
Imprecision in estimating these factors can impact the amount 

67 

Income Taxes The Company estimates income tax expense 
based on amounts expected to be owed to the various tax 
jurisdictions in which it operates, including federal, state and local 
domestic jurisdictions, and an insignificant amount to foreign 
jurisdictions. The estimated income tax expense is reported in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income. Accrued taxes are reported 
in other assets or other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet and represent the net estimated amount due to or to be 
received from taxing jurisdictions either currently or deferred to 
future periods. Deferred taxes arise from differences between 
assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes 
versus income tax reporting purposes. Deferred tax assets are 
recognized if, in management’s judgment, their realizability is 
determined to be more likely than not. Uncertain tax positions 
that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are 
measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An 
uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of 
benefit management believes is more likely than not to be realized 
upon settlement. In estimating accrued taxes, the Company 
assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax 
treatment considering statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance 
in the context of the tax position. Because of the complexity of 
tax laws and regulations, interpretation can be difficult and 
subject to legal judgment given specific facts and circumstances. 
It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any 
point in time reach different reasonable conclusions regarding the 
estimated amounts of accrued taxes. 

Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically 
due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws, the status 

of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities, 
and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance that 
impacts the relative merits and risks of tax positions. These 
changes, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be 
significant to the operating results of the Company. Refer to 
Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for 
additional information regarding income taxes. 

Controls and Procedures 
Under the supervision and with the participation of the 
Company’s management, including its principal executive officer 
and principal financial officer, the Company has evaluated the 
effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure 
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 
15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
“Exchange Act”)). Based upon this evaluation, the principal 
executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded 
that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the 
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
During the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there was 
no change made in the Company’s internal control over financial 
reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the 
Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely 
to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial 
reporting. 

The annual report of the Company’s management on internal 
control over financial reporting is provided on page 69. The audit 
report of Ernst & Young LLP, the Company’s independent 
accountants, regarding the Company’s internal control over 
financial reporting is provided on page 72.
