Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Performance Summary

BOK Financial Corporation (“the Company”) reported net income of $166.4 million or $2.40 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2021. Net income was
$64.7 million or $0.92 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2020 and $146.1 million or $2.10 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2021. Forecasts for
improving macroeconomic factors, including stabilizing energy prices, and improving credit quality metrics resulted in a negative provision for expected credit
losses of $35.0 million and $25.0 million in the second quarter of 2021 and first quarter of 2021, respectively. A provision for expected credit losses of $135.3
million was recorded in the second quarter of 2020.

Pre-provision net revenue ("PPNR"), a non-GAAP measure, was $179.9 million for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $215.8 million for the second quarter
of 2020. The decrease in PPNR was due to lower combined net interest revenue and fees and commission revenue. This was largely driven by lower average loan
balances due to customer deleveraging during the current economic uncertainty, narrowing net interest margin and compressed margins from our mortgage
banking activities. PPNR improved $16.5 million over the first quarter of 2021. Growth in much of our fee-based business, led by brokerage and trading and
fiduciary and asset management revenues, was partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenue.

Highlights of the second quarter of 2021 included:

•

•

Net interest revenue totaled $280.3 million, an increase of $2.2 million over the second quarter of 2020. Average earning assets were $43.9 billion for the
second quarter of 2021 compared to $40.3 billion for the second quarter of 2020, largely driven by growth in trading securities. Net interest margin was
2.60 percent for the second quarter of 2021 compared to 2.83 percent for the second quarter of 2020. The Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds rate
to near zero in March 2020. Other short-term market interest rates followed, reducing the yield on floating-rate assets by more than the amount by which
funding costs could be reduced, compressing the margin. Net interest revenue was consistent with the first quarter of 2021. Net interest margin decreased
2 basis points.

Fees and commissions revenue totaled $169.4 million, a decrease of $44.3 million compared to the second quarter of 2020. Mortgage banking revenue
decreased $32.7 million due to a combination of lower mortgage production volume and margin compression. Brokerage and trading revenue decreased
$32.6 million, largely due to a shift from trading revenue to net interest revenue on trading securities. These decreases were partially offset by higher
operating revenue from repossessed oil and gas assets and smaller increases in deposit service charges revenue, fiduciary and asset management fees, and
transaction card revenue. Fees and commissions revenue increased $7.3 million compared to the first quarter of 2021, including a $9.3 million increase in
trading revenue due to an increase in higher margin residential mortgage trading volume.

• Other operating expense totaled $291.2 million, a decrease of $4.8 million compared to the second quarter of 2020. Personnel expense decreased $4.2

million, due to decreases in regular compensation expense, incentive compensation expense and deferred compensation costs. These decreases were
partially offset by an increase in employee insurance costs. Non-personnel expense was relatively consistent compared to the second quarter of 2020.
Operating expense decreased $4.6 million compared to the first quarter of 2021. The first quarter of 2021 included a $4.0 million charitable contribution
to the BOKF Foundation that did not recur in the second quarter.

•

•

Period-end outstanding loan balances totaled $21.4 billion at June 30, 2021, a decrease of $1.1 billion compared to March 31, 2021. Loans originated as
part of the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP") decreased $727 million to $1.1 billion. Paydowns of energy loans and
commercial real estate loans were partially offset by an increase in healthcare and personal loans. Average loan balances decreased $590 million to $22.2
billion compared to the previous quarter.

The combined allowance for credit losses totaled $336 million or 1.66 percent of outstanding loans, excluding PPP loans, at June 30, 2021. The combined
allowance for credit losses was $385 million or 1.86 percent of outstanding loans, excluding PPP loans, at March 31, 2021.

Nonperforming assets not guaranteed by U.S. government agencies decreased $51 million compared to March 31, 2021. Potential problem loans
decreased $38 million while other loans especially mentioned decreased $134 million. Net charge-offs were $15.4 million or 0.30 percent of average
loans on an annualized basis for the second quarter of 2021, excluding PPP loans. Net charge-offs were 0.32 percent of average loans, excluding PPP
loans, over the last four quarters. Net charge-offs were $14.5 million or 0.28 percent of average loans on an annualized basis for the first quarter of 2021,
excluding PPP loans.

Period-end deposits were $37.4 billion at June 30, 2021, a $413 million decrease compared to March 31, 2021. Average deposits increased $968 million,
including an $877 million increase in demand deposits. Clients across all of our business segments continued to maintain higher deposit balances during
this period of economic uncertainty, supplemented by inflows from government stimulus.

The common equity Tier 1 capital ratio at June 30, 2021 was 11.95 percent. Other regulatory capital ratios were Tier 1 capital ratio, 12.01 percent, total
capital ratio, 13.61 percent, and leverage ratio, 8.58 percent. At March 31, 2021, the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.14 percent, the Tier 1
capital ratio was 12.21 percent, total capital ratio was 13.98 percent, and leverage ratio was 8.42 percent.

The Company repurchased 492,994 shares of common stock at an average price of $88.84 per share in the second quarter of 2021 and 260,000 shares at
an average price of $77.20 in the first quarter of 2021. We view share buybacks opportunistically but within the context of maintaining our strong capital
position.

On July 23, 2021, the Company notified holders that it will exercise its option to redeem all $150 million of its 5.375 percent Subordinated Notes on
August 23, 2021. The Company will use existing capital for the redemption. The Notes carried an unamortized discount at June 30, 2021 of $4.0 million
which will be recognized at redemption. Redemption of the Notes will reduce annual interest expense by approximately $8.0 million.

The Company paid a regular cash dividend of $35.9 million or $0.52 per common share during the second quarter of 2021. On August 3, 2021, the board
of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.52 per common share payable on or about August 26, 2021 to shareholders of record as of August
16, 2021.

Results of Operations

Net Interest Revenue and Net Interest Margin

Net interest revenue is the interest earned on debt securities, loans and other interest-earning assets less interest paid for interest-bearing deposits and other
borrowings. The net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax-equivalent net interest revenue by average interest-earning assets. Net interest spread is the
difference between the average rate earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is typically greater
than net interest spread due to interest income earned on assets funded by non-interest bearing liabilities such as demand deposits and equity.

Tax-equivalent net interest revenue totaled $282.6 million for the second quarter of 2021 and $280.7 million for the second quarter of 2020. Net interest revenue
increased $13.9 million from growth in average earning assets and decreased $12.0 million due to changes in interest rates. An increase in trading securities
balances was partially offset by a decrease in loan balances. Table 1 shows the effect on net interest revenue from changes in average balances and interest rates for
various types of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.

Net interest margin was 2.60 percent for the second quarter of 2021, compared to 2.83 percent for the second quarter of 2020. In response to the anticipated impact
to the economy from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds rate to near zero in March, 2020. Other short-term market interest
rates followed, reducing the yield on floating-rate assets by more than the amount by which funding costs could be reduced, compressing the margin. The tax-
equivalent yield on earning assets was 2.75 percent, a decrease of 37 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2020. The available for sale securities portfolio
yield decreased 44 basis points to 1.85 percent as principal cash flows received from maturities of the available for sale securities portfolio continue to be
reinvested at lower rates. Loan yields decreased 9 basis points to 3.54 percent, largely due to the decrease in short-term interest rates partially offset by the addition
of PPP loan fees. PPP loan fees of $11.1 million were recognized in the second quarter of 2021. As discussed in the Management's Discussion and Analysis - Loan
section following, $27.8 million of deferred loans fees remain to be recognized in future periods, including $3.8 million related to loans originated in 2020 that
mature in 2022. The yield on trading securities decreased 51 basis points to 1.95 percent.

Funding costs decreased 16 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2020. The cost of other borrowed funds decreased 2 basis points and the cost of interest-
bearing deposits decreased 20 basis points. The benefit to net interest margin from earning assets funded by non-interest bearing liabilities was 6 basis points for
the second quarter of 2021, a decrease of 2 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2020.
Average earning assets for the second quarter of 2021 increased $3.5 billion or 9 percent over the second quarter of 2020. This increase was largely due to growth
in our trading of U.S. government issued mortgage-backed securities and the expansion of the available for sale securities portfolio, partially offset by a decrease in
loans and fair value option securities. Average trading securities increased $5.6 billion. The average balance of available for sale securities, which consists largely
of residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, increased $763 million. We purchase securities to supplement
earnings and to manage interest rate risk. Average loans, net of allowance for loan losses, decreased $1.9 billion, largely due to purposeful deleveraging by our
customers as borrowers continue to pay down during this time of economic uncertainty. Fair value option securities that we hold as an economic hedge against
changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights decreased $722 million.

Average deposits increased $4.8 billion compared to the second quarter of 2020. Deposit growth is largely due to customers retaining elevated balances in the
current economic environment, supplemented by the most recent government stimulus payments. Interest-bearing deposits increased $3.1 billion while demand
deposit balances increased $1.7 billion. Other borrowed funds decreased $3.9 billion.

Tax-equivalent net interest revenue was $282.6 million, largely unchanged compared to the first quarter of 2021. Net interest margin was 2.60 percent compared to
2.62 percent in the first quarter of 2021.

Average earning assets decreased $354 million compared to the first quarter of 2021. Average loan balances decreased $590 million, primarily from energy and
commercial real estate loan paydowns. Available for sale securities decreased $190 million. Average trading securities grew by $467 million. Other borrowed
funds decreased $824 million.

- 3 -

The yield on average earning assets was 2.75 percent, a 3 basis point decrease from the prior quarter. The yield on the available for sale securities portfolio
increased 1 basis point to 1.85 percent and the loan portfolio yield decreased 1 basis point to 3.54 percent.

Funding costs were 0.21 percent, down 3 basis points. The cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased 3 basis points to 0.14 percent. The cost of other borrowed
funds was down 2 basis points to 0.28 percent. The benefit to net interest margin from assets funded by non-interest liabilities was 6 basis points for the second
quarter of 2021, a decrease of 2 basis points compared to the prior quarter.

Our overall objective is to manage the Company’s balance sheet to be relatively neutral to changes in interest rates as is further described in the Market Risk
section of this report. Approximately 75% of our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios are either variable rate or fixed rate that will reprice within
one year. These loans are funded primarily by deposit accounts that are either non-interest bearing, or that reprice more slowly than the loans. The result is a
balance sheet that would be asset sensitive, which means that assets generally reprice more quickly than liabilities. One of the strategies that we use to manage
toward a relative rate-neutral position is to purchase fixed rate residential mortgage-backed securities issued primarily by U.S. government agencies and fund them
with market-rate-sensitive liabilities. The liability-sensitive nature of this strategy provides an offset to the asset-sensitive characteristics of our loan portfolio. We
also may use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risk. 

The effectiveness of these strategies is reflected in the overall change in net interest revenue due to changes in interest rates as shown in Table 1 and in the interest
rate sensitivity projections as shown in the Market Risk section of this report.

Other Operating Revenue

Other operating revenue was $191.4 million for the second quarter of 2021, a decrease of $41.8 million compared to the second quarter of 2020. Mortgage
production revenue was negatively impacted by a decline in mortgage production volumes and margin compression. Brokerage and trading revenue decreased
largely due to a shift of trading revenue to interest income from trading securities.

Other operating revenue increased $14.4 million compared to the first quarter of 2021. Brokerage and trading revenue increased $8.6 million. An increase in
agency residential mortgage trading volumes and higher margin market opportunities combined to grow trading revenue.

Certain percentage increases (decreases) in non-fees and commissions revenue are not meaningful for comparison purposes based on the nature of the item.

Fees and commissions revenue

Diversified sources of fees and commissions revenue are a significant part of our business strategy and represented 38 percent of total revenue for the second
quarter of 2021, excluding provision for credit losses and gains and losses on other assets, securities and derivatives and the change in the fair value of mortgage
servicing rights. We believe that a variety of fee revenue sources provides an offset to changes in interest rates, values in the equity markets, commodity prices and
consumer spending, all of which can be volatile. As an example of this strength, many of the economic factors such as rising interest rates resulting in growth in
net interest revenue or fiduciary and asset management revenue may also decrease mortgage banking production volumes and related trading. We expect growth in
other operating revenue to come through offering new products and services and by further development of our presence in other markets. However, current and
future economic conditions, including the recent impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory constraints, increased competition and saturation in our existing
markets could affect the rate of future increases.

Brokerage and Trading Revenue

Brokerage and trading revenue, which includes revenues from trading, customer hedging, retail brokerage and investment banking, decreased $32.6 million or 53
percent compared to the second quarter of 2020.

- 5 -

 
 
Trading revenue includes net realized and unrealized gains and losses primarily related to sales of residential mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by U.S.
government agencies and related derivative instruments that enable our mortgage banking customers to manage their production risk. Trading revenue also
includes net realized and unrealized gains and losses on municipal securities and other financial instruments that we sell to institutional customers, along with
changes in the fair value of financial instruments we hold as economic hedges against market risk of our trading securities. Trading revenue was $13.0 million for
the second quarter of 2021, a $30.9 million or 70 percent decrease compared to the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to a shift from fee revenue to net interest
revenue on trading securities. See additional discussion in "Lines of Business" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis.

Customer hedging revenue is based primarily on realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of derivative contracts held for customer risk management
programs. As more fully discussed under Customer Derivative Programs in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, we offer commodity, interest rate,
foreign exchange and equity derivatives to our customers. Customer hedging revenue totaled $1.8 million for the second quarter of 2021, a $4.4 million or 71
percent decrease compared to the second quarter of 2020, primarily attributed to energy customers. Customer hedging revenue includes credit valuation
adjustments of the fair value of derivatives to reflect the risk of counterparty default.

Revenue earned from retail brokerage transactions totaled $4.5 million for the second quarter of 2021, an increase of $1.1 million compared to the second quarter
of 2020 due to increased trading activity.

Investment banking, which includes fees earned upon completion of underwriting, financial advisory services and loan syndication fees, totaled $7.1 million for the
second quarter of 2021, an increase of $1.8 million or 33 percent compared to the second quarter of 2020, related to the timing and volume of completed
transactions.

Brokerage and trading revenue increased $8.6 million compared to the previous quarter, including a $9.3 million increase in trading revenue, primarily due to the
combination of an increase in agency residential mortgage trading volumes and higher margin market opportunities.

Transaction Card Revenue

Transaction card revenue increased $2.0 million over the second quarter of 2020 and $2.5 million over the previous quarter, largely due to stimulus measures and
the broader reopening of the U.S. economy, as we saw both merchant and ATM transaction volume increase this quarter.

Fiduciary and Asset Management Revenue

Fiduciary and asset management revenue is earned through managing or holding of assets for customers and executing transactions or providing related services.
Approximately 90 percent of fiduciary and asset management revenue is primarily based on the fair value of assets. Rates applied to asset values vary based on the
nature of the relationship. Fiduciary relationships and managed asset relationships generally have higher fee rates than non-fiduciary and/or managed relationships.
Fiduciary and asset management revenue increased $3.6 million or 9 percent compared to the second quarter of 2020. An increase in trust and managed account
fees from higher client asset balances was partially offset by a decrease in mutual fund fees as the low rate environment has put pressure on our mutual fund
revenue streams. We had approximately $2.9 million in fee waivers during the second quarter of 2021 compared to approximately $1.1 million in the second
quarter of 2020. We have voluntarily waived certain administration fees on the Cavanal Hill money market funds in order to maintain positive yields on these
funds in the current short-term interest rate environment.

Fiduciary and asset management revenue increased $3.5 million or 8 percent compared to the first quarter of 2021 due to seasonal tax preparation fees collected in
the second quarter and higher client asset balances. A distribution of assets under management or administration and related fiduciary and asset management
revenue follows:

Deposit service charges and fees increased $3.8 million compared to the second quarter of 2020 and $1.7 million over the first quarter of 2021. This increase was
primarily due to commercial accounts where lower earnings credit rates caused by the low interest rate environment have resulted in higher service charges.

Mortgage Banking Revenue

Mortgage banking revenue decreased $32.7 million or 61 percent compared to the second quarter of 2020 and $15.9 million or 43 percent compared to the first
quarter of 2021. Mortgage loan production volume decreased $429 million or 40 percent compared to second quarter of 2020 and decreased $206 million or 24
percent compared to first quarter of 2021. The decline in mortgage production volume was largely due to industry-wide housing inventory constraints, changes to
government-sponsored entity delivery limits on second homes and investment properties, and overall market conditions. The realized margin on funded mortgage
loans decreased 35 basis points to 2.75 percent compared to first quarter of 2021 while the gain on sale margin, which includes unrealized gains and losses on our
mortgage commitment pipeline and related hedges, decreased 143 basis points to 1.55 percent. Margins were compressed largely due to competitive pricing
pressure and timing of settlements.

Other Revenue

Other revenue increased $11.7 million over the second quarter of 2020 and $6.9 million compared to the first quarter of 2021. The increase was primarily due to
higher production revenue from repossessed oil and gas properties; however, this is partially offset by increased operating expenses on these properties. Revenue
and expense from repossessed oil and gas properties will decrease as the properties are sold.

Net gains on other assets, securities and derivatives

Other net gains totaled $16.4 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $7.3 million in the second quarter of 2020. The fluctuation is related to increased
gains on alternative investments and sales of repossessed assets. Other net gains totaled $10.1 million in the first quarter of 2021. Increases in gains on alternative
investments and the sale of fixed assets were partially offset by a decrease in gains on sales of repossessed assets.

As discussed in the Market Risk section following, the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights ("MSRs") changes in response to changes in primary mortgage
loan rates and other assumptions. We attempt to mitigate the earnings volatility caused by changes in the fair value of MSRs by designating certain financial
instruments as an economic hedge. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are generally expected to partially offset changes in the fair value of MSRs.

Historically low mortgage rates in 2020 and early 2021 resulted in a favorable risk profile for our MSRs that supported hedge performance during that time period.
Increases in longer-term interest rates during 2021 has returned the risk profile of our MSRs to a more balanced profile, as can be seen in Table 25 of the Market
Risk section.

Certain percentage increases (decreases) are not meaningful for comparison purposes.

Personnel expense

Personnel expense decreased $4.2 million compared to the second quarter of 2020. Incentive compensation decreased $6.1 million. Share-based compensation
expense decreased $3.2 million based on changes in assumptions of certain performance-based equity awards. Deferred compensation expense decreased $2.0
million; however, this is largely offset by a decrease in the value of related investments included in Other gains (losses), net. Regular compensation expense
decreased $3.2 million as we have managed personnel costs by challenging the need to fill open positions and add new positions. These decreases were partially
offset by an increase of $5.1 million in employee benefits expense due to increased healthcare costs as healthcare spending returned to normal levels following the
earlier months of the pandemic.

Personnel expense decreased $1.0 million compared to the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to a decrease of $1.1 million in regular compensation expense. A
$3.0 million seasonal decrease in payroll tax expense was almost fully offset by a $2.8 million increase in employee healthcare costs, which reflects more normal
pre-pandemic healthcare levels.

- 10 -

 
Non-personnel operating expense

Non-personnel operating expense was relatively consistent with the second quarter of 2020. Mortgage banking costs decreased $4.5 million, substantially due to a
decrease in accruals related to default servicing and loss mitigation costs on loans serviced for others. Occupancy and equipment expenses decreased $4.0 million
as the second quarter of 2020 included impairment of two leases where assumptions regarding subleasing changed due to deteriorating economic conditions. Also,
a $3.0 million charitable contribution was made to the BOKF Foundation in the second quarter of 2020. These expense decreases were almost entirely offset by an
increase of $7.7 million in other expense, largely due to increased operating expenses on repossessed oil and gas properties, and a $3.5 million increase in data
processing and communications expense, primarily due to continued investment in technology upgrades.

Non-personnel expense decreased $3.7 million compared to the first quarter of 2021. The first quarter of 2021 included a $4.0 million charitable donation to the
BOKF Foundation. Mortgage banking costs decreased $2.8 million due to a decrease in prepayments combined with lower accruals related to default servicing and
loss mitigation costs on loans serviced for others. Data processing and communications expense decreased $1.0 million as a result of a reduction of system
conversion expenses. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $3.6 million in other expense, primarily due to increased operating expenses on
repossessed assets.

Income Taxes

The effective tax rate was 22.5 percent for the second quarter of 2021, 19.7 percent for the second quarter of 2020 and 22.7 percent for the first quarter of 2021.
The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2020 was lower compared the second quarter of 2021, primarily due to lower forecasted pre-tax income for 2020.
The lower forecasted pre-tax income for 2020 was primarily due to the larger provision for credit losses. Income tax expense for the second quarter of 2021
increased $6.1 million compared to the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to the increase in net income before tax for the second quarter of 2021.

Lines of Business

We operate three principal lines of business: Commercial Banking, Consumer Banking and Wealth Management. Commercial Banking includes lending, treasury
and cash management services and customer risk management products for small businesses, middle market and larger commercial customers. Commercial
Banking also includes the TransFund EFT network. Consumer Banking includes retail lending and deposit services, lending and deposit services to small business
customers served through our consumer branch network and all mortgage banking activities. Wealth Management provides fiduciary services, private banking
services, insurance and investment advisory services in all markets. Wealth Management also underwrites state and municipal securities and engages in brokerage
and trading activities.

In addition to our lines of business, we have a Funds Management unit. The primary purpose of this unit is to manage our overall liquidity needs and interest rate
risk. Each line of business borrows funds from and provides funds to the Funds Management unit as needed to support their operations. Operating results for Funds
Management and other include the effect of interest rate risk positions and risk management activities, securities gains and losses including impairment charges,
the provision for credit losses in excess of net loans charged off, tax planning strategies and certain executive compensation costs that are not attributed to the lines
of business.

We allocate resources and evaluate the performance of our lines of business using the net direct contribution, which includes the allocation of funds, actual net
credit losses and capital costs. In addition, we measure the performance of our business lines after allocation of certain indirect expenses and taxes based on
statutory rates.

The cost of funds borrowed from the Funds Management unit by the operating lines of business is updated annually at the beginning of the year and transfer priced
at rates that approximate market rates for funds with similar repricing and cash flow characteristics. Market rates are generally based on the applicable LIBOR or
interest rate swap rates, adjusted for prepayment and liquidity risk. This method of transfer-pricing funds that supports assets of the operating lines of business
tends to insulate them from interest rate risk.

- 11 -

The value of funds provided by the operating lines of business to the Funds Management unit is updated annually at the beginning of the year and is based on rates
that approximate wholesale market rates for funds with similar repricing and cash flow characteristics. Market rates are generally based on LIBOR or interest rate
swap rates. The funds credit formula applied to deposit products with indeterminate maturities is established based on their repricing characteristics reflected in a
combination of the short-term LIBOR rate and a moving average of an intermediate-term swap rate, with an appropriate spread applied to both. Shorter duration
products are weighted towards the short-term LIBOR rate and longer duration products are weighted towards the intermediate-term swap rates. The expected
duration ranges from 30 days for certain rate-sensitive deposits to five years.

Economic capital is assigned to the business units by a capital allocation model that reflects management’s assessment of risk. This model assigns capital based
upon credit, operating, interest rate and other market risk inherent in our business lines and recognizes the diversification benefits among the units. The level of
assigned economic capital is a combination of the risk taken by each business line, based on its actual exposures and calibrated to its own loss history where
possible. Average invested capital includes economic capital and amounts we have invested in the lines of business.

As shown in Table 8, net income attributable to our lines of business decreased $41.5 million compared to the second quarter of 2020. Net interest revenue
decreased by $3.1 million compared to the prior year, primarily driven by lower average outstanding loan balances. Net charge-offs increased $2.4 million
compared to the second quarter of 2020. Other operating revenue decreased by $39.6 million due to a combination of inventory constraints and compressed
margins that negatively impacted mortgage banking revenue and a shift from trading revenue from our agency residential mortgage trading activities to net interest
revenue. Operating expense increased $1.5 million compared to the second quarter of 2020, primarily in Commercial Banking.

Net interest revenue increased $8.8 million compared to the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to higher earnings from deposits sold to the Funds Management
unit. Other operating revenue increased $17.1 million. Growth in our fee-based business, led by brokerage and trading and fiduciary and asset management
revenues, were partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenue. Higher operating revenue from repossessed oil and gas assets also contributed to the increase.
Other operating expense increased $2.1 million.

Net income attributable to our Funds Management unit was impacted by the negative provision for credit losses in the second quarter of 2021, compared to a
provision for credit losses in excess of charge-offs in the second quarter of 2020.

Certain percentage increases (decreases) in non-fees and commissions revenue are not meaningful for comparison purposes based on the nature of the item.

Net interest revenue decreased $14.2 million compared to the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to reduced loan balances coupled with a reduction in the
spread on deposits sold to our Funds Management unit. This was partially offset by increased deposit balances. Growth in average deposits and decreases in
average loans caused Commercial Banking to be a net provider of funds to Funds Management in the second quarter of 2021 compared to a net user of funds in the
second quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021. Net loans charged-off increased $2.5 million.

Fees and commissions revenue increased $16.9 million or 36 percent while operating expenses increased $8.4 million or 13 percent. An increase in production
revenue from repossessed oil and gas properties was partially offset by an increase in related operating expenses. Deposit service charges and fees, syndication
fees, and transaction card revenues were also up over the second quarter of 2020.

- 13 -

 
 
During the second quarter of 2021, a gain of $7.3 million was realized on the sale of repossessed assets, which was partially offset by impairment taken on a
certain repossessed oil and gas property. Corporate expense allocations increased $7.1 million or 130 percent compared to the prior year. The Commercial team
provided resources to originate and service the PPP loan activity outside of the Commercial Banking segment throughout 2020, which lowered allocations to
Commercial Banking in the prior year.

The average outstanding balance of loans attributed to Commercial Banking decreased $2.3 billion or 12 percent to $17.0 billion compared to the second quarter of
2020. See the Loans section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition following for additional discussion of changes in commercial and
commercial real estate loans, which are primarily attributed to the Commercial Banking segment. 

Average deposits attributed to Commercial Banking were $17.0 billion for the second quarter of 2021, a $2.5 billion or 17 percent increase over the second quarter
of 2020. Continued deposit growth is primarily due to higher balance retention by customers in the current economic environment. See Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital for further discussion of change.

Net interest revenue was relatively consistent with first quarter of 2021. Fees and commissions revenue increased $13.5 million over the first quarter of 2021.
Operating expense increased $4.4 million or 7 percent compared to the first quarter of 2021. Both increases were primarily due to the operation of repossessed oil
and gas properties. Net gain on repossessed assets also decreased $9.2 million as first quarter of 2021 included a $14.1 million gain on the sale of repossessed oil
and gas assets.

Average loan balances decreased $541 million or 3 percent and average customer deposits increased $920 million or 6 percent over the first quarter of 2021.

Consumer Banking

Consumer Banking provides retail banking services through four primary distribution channels: traditional branches, the 24-hour ExpressBank call center, Internet
banking and mobile banking. Consumer Banking also conducts mortgage banking activities through offices located outside of our Consumer Banking markets.

Consumer Banking contributed $1.7 million to consolidated net income for the second quarter of 2021, a decrease of $30.8 million compared to the second quarter
of 2020, largely due to lower mortgage production volumes combined with lower spreads on deposits sold to our Funds Management unit.

Net interest revenue from Consumer Banking activities declined by $14.3 million or 36 percent compared to the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to a
decrease in the spread on deposits sold to our Funds Management unit and a decrease in volume of securities held as an economic hedge of our mortgage servicing
rights. Average consumer deposits grew $882 million over the second quarter of 2020 with interest-bearing transaction deposit balances increasing $471 million or
14 percent and demand deposit balances increasing $405 million or 15 percent.

Fees and commissions revenue decreased $29.5 million or 44 percent compared to the second quarter of 2020. Mortgage banking revenue decreased $32.7 million
from the first quarter of 2020 due to lower mortgage production volume and gain on sale margin compression. Deposit service charges increased $2.2 million.
Customer spending levels increased with the broader reopening of the U.S. economy, which resulted in increased overdraft fees and check card revenue compared
to the prior year. Operating expense decreased $5.8 million due to a decrease in mortgage banking costs and personnel expense. Corporate expense allocations
were consistent with the second quarter of 2020.

Changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, net of economic hedges, increased pre-tax net income for the second quarter of 2021 by $4.1 million
compared to a $6.6 million increase in pre-tax net income in the second quarter of 2020.

Net interest revenue from Consumer Banking activities increased $4.0 million or 19 percent compared to the first quarter of 2021, mainly due to favorable spreads
on deposits sold to our Funds Management unit. Operating revenue decreased $14.6 million compared to the first quarter of 2021 as mortgage production volume
declined and margins compressed. Operating expense decreased $3.2 million, primarily due to a decrease mortgage banking costs.

Average consumer loans decreased $37 million or 2 percent. Average deposits increased $387 million or 5 percent.

Wealth Management

Wealth Management contributed $31.1 million to consolidated net income in the second quarter of 2021, a decrease of $2.3 million or 7 percent compared to the
second quarter of 2020. Revenue attributed to the Wealth Management segment totaled $131.1 million for the second quarter of 2021, a $2.5 million or 2 percent
decrease compared to the second quarter of 2020. A seasonal increase in fiduciary and asset management revenue was offset by decreased revenue related to
agency mortgage-backed trading activities.

Combined net interest revenue and fee revenue from our agency mortgage-backed securities trading activities decreased by $2.6 million or 4 percent compared to
the prior year. Fiduciary and asset management revenue increased $3.7 million. Growth in trust fees and managed account fees as a result of higher client asset
balances, was partially offset by a combination of lower mutual fund fees and increased fee waivers. Other Wealth Management revenue decreased primarily
related to a decrease in the spread on deposits sold to our Funds Management unit, partially offset by growth in private banking average loan balances.

Operating expense decreased $1.1 million as a $3.2 million decrease in personnel expense was partially offset by a $2.1 million increase in non-personnel expense.
Corporate expense allocations increased $2.1 million compared to the second quarter of 2020.

- 17 -

 
 
Average loans attributed to the Wealth Management segment increased $259 million or 15 percent. Average deposits increased $1.3 billion or 16 percent, largely
due to core growth as customers are retaining higher balances in the current economic environment.

Net income for Wealth Management increased $11.7 million or 60 percent compared to the first quarter of 2021. Combined net interest revenue and fee revenue
increased $17.1 million. Brokerage and trading revenue and related net interest revenue increased $10.5 million to $62.2 million due to growth in agency
residential mortgage trading volumes and higher margin market opportunities. Fiduciary and asset management fees grew as a result of higher client asset balances.
Assets under management were $96.6 billion, an increase of $4.7 billion compared to the prior quarter.

Average loans grew 3 percent to $2.0 billion and average deposits were consistent with prior quarter.

Financial Condition

Securities

We maintain a securities portfolio to enhance profitability, manage interest rate risk, provide liquidity and comply with regulatory requirements. Securities are
classified as trading, held for investment, or available for sale. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the composition of the securities portfolio
as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

We hold an inventory of trading securities in support of sales to a variety of customers, including banks, corporations, insurance companies, money managers and
others. Trading securities increased $613 million to $5.7 billion during the second quarter of 2021. As discussed in the Market Risk section of this report, trading
activities involve risk of loss from adverse price movement. We mitigate this risk within board-approved limits through the use of derivative contracts, short-sales
and other techniques. These limits remain relatively unchanged from levels set before our expanded trading activities.

At June 30, 2021, the carrying value of investment (held-to-maturity) securities was $221 million, including a $493 thousand allowance for expected credit losses
compared to $226 million at March 31, 2021 with a $617 thousand allowance for expected credit losses. The fair value of investment securities was $246 million at
June 30, 2021 and $253 million at March 31, 2021. Investment securities consist primarily of residential mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government
agencies, long-term, fixed rate Oklahoma and Texas municipal bonds, and taxable Texas school construction bonds.

Available for sale securities, which may be sold prior to maturity, are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains or losses, net of deferred taxes, are recorded as
accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity. The amortized cost of available for sale securities totaled $13.0 billion at June 30, 2021, a $99
million decrease compared to March 31, 2021. At June 30, 2021, the available for sale securities portfolio consisted primarily of U.S. government agency
residential mortgage-backed securities and U.S. government agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. Both residential and commercial mortgage-backed
securities have credit risk from delinquency or default of the underlying loans. We mitigate this risk by primarily investing in securities issued by U.S. government
agencies. Principal and interest payments on the underlying loans are fully guaranteed. Commercial mortgage-backed securities have prepayment penalties similar
to commercial loans.

A primary risk of holding residential mortgage-backed securities comes from extension during periods of rising interest rates or prepayment during periods of
falling interest rates. We evaluate this risk through extensive modeling of risk both before making an investment and throughout the life of the security. Our best
estimate of the duration of the combined residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio held in investment and available for sale securities at June 30, 2021 is 2.7
years. Management estimates the duration extends to 4.1 years assuming an immediate 200 basis point upward shock. The estimated duration contracts to 1.8 years
assuming a 100 basis point decline in the current low rate environment.

Loans

The aggregate loan portfolio before allowance for loan losses totaled $21.4 billion at June 30, 2021, a $1.1 billion decrease compared to March 31, 2021, primarily
due to a decrease in PPP loan balances. Paydowns of energy and commercial real estate portfolios, were partially offset by an increase in healthcare and personal
loans.

Commercial loans represent loans for working capital, facilities acquisition or expansion, purchases of equipment and other needs of commercial customers
primarily located within our geographical footprint. These loans are underwritten individually and represent ongoing relationships based on a thorough knowledge
of the customer, the customer’s industry and market. While commercial loans are generally secured by the customer’s assets including real property, inventory,
accounts receivable, operating equipment, interests in mineral rights and other property and may also include personal guarantees of the owners and related parties,
the primary source of repayment of the loans is the ongoing cash flow from operations of the customer’s business. In addition, revolving lines of credit are
generally governed by a borrowing base. Inherent lending risks are centrally monitored on a continuous basis from underwriting throughout the life of the loan for
compliance with commercial lending policies.

Commercial loans totaled $12.5 billion or 58 percent of the loan portfolio at June 30, 2021, a $185 million decrease compared to March 31, 2021, primarily due to
paydowns in the energy loan portfolio.

- 19 -

 
 
Approximately 76 percent of loans in this segment are located within our geographic footprint, based on collateral location. Loans for which the collateral location
is less relevant, such as unsecured loans and reserve-based energy loans are categorized by the borrower's primary operating location. The largest concentration of
loans in this segment outside of our footprint is California, totaling 5 percent of the segment.

Supporting the energy industry with loans to producers and other energy-related entities has been a hallmark of the Company since its founding and represents a
large portion of our commercial loan portfolio. In addition, energy production and related industries have a significant impact on the economy in our primary
markets. Loans collateralized by oil and gas properties are subject to a semi-annual engineering review by our internal staff of petroleum engineers. This review is
used as the basis for developing the expected cash flows supporting the loan amount. The projected cash flows are discounted according to risk characteristics of
the underlying oil and gas properties. Loans are evaluated to demonstrate with reasonable certainty that crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids can be
recovered from known oil and gas reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions at current pricing levels and with existing conventional equipment
and operating methods and costs. As part of our evaluation of credit quality, we analyze rigorous stress tests over a range of commodity prices and take proactive
steps to mitigate risk when appropriate.

Outstanding energy loans totaled $3.0 billion or 14 percent of total loans at June 30, 2021, a $191 million decrease compared to March 31, 2021. Approximately
$2.2 billion of energy loans were to oil and gas producers, a $148 million decrease compared to March 31, 2021. While commodity prices have continued to
improve and stabilize, sourcing new loans sufficient to offset paydowns remains a challenge as existing borrowers continue to reduce leverage. The majority of this
portfolio is first lien, senior secured, reserve-based lending, which we believe is the lowest risk form of energy lending. Approximately 66 percent of the
committed production loans are secured by properties primarily producing oil and 34 percent of the committed production loans are secured by properties primarily
producing natural gas.

Loans to midstream oil and gas companies totaled $645 million at June 30, 2021, largely unchanged compared to March 31, 2021. Loans to borrowers that provide
services to the energy industry totaled $103 million at June 30, 2021, a decrease of $33 million. Loans to other energy borrowers, including those engaged in
wholesale or retail energy sales, totaled $27 million, a $7.0 million decrease compared to the prior quarter.

Unfunded energy loan commitments were $2.6 billion at June 30, 2021, a $247 million increase over March 31, 2021.

The healthcare sector of the loan portfolio totaled $3.4 billion or 16 percent of total loans. Healthcare loans grew by $91 million over March 31, 2021, primarily
driven by our senior housing sector. Balances to hospital systems were also up over the prior quarter. Healthcare sector loans consist primarily of loans for the
development and operation of senior housing and care facilities, including independent living, assisted living and skilled nursing. Generally we loan to borrowers
with a portfolio of multiple facilities that serves to help diversify risks specific to a single facility.
The services sector of the loan portfolio totaled $3.4 billion or 16 percent of total loans, largely unchanged compared to the prior quarter. Service sector loans
consist of a large number of loans to a variety of businesses, including Native American tribal and state and local governments, Native American tribal casino
operations, foundations and not-for-profit organizations, educational services and specialty trade contractors. Approximately $1.7 billion of the services category is
made up of loans with individual balances of less than $10 million. Services sector loans are generally secured by the assets of the borrower with repayment
coming from the cash flows of ongoing operations of the customer’s business. 

General business loans decreased $52 million to $2.7 billion or 13 percent of total loans. General business loans consist of $1.4 billion of wholesale/retail loans and
$1.3 billion of loans from other commercial industries.

We participate in shared national credits when appropriate to obtain or maintain business relationships with local customers. Shared national credits are defined by
banking regulators as credits of $100 million or more and with three or more non-affiliated banks as participants. At June 30, 2021, the outstanding principal
balance of these loans totaled $3.8 billion, including $1.6 billion of energy loans. Substantially all of these loans are to borrowers with local market
relationships. We serve as the agent lender in approximately 22 percent of our shared national credits, based on dollars committed. We hold shared national credits
to the same standard of analysis and perform the same level of review as internally originated credits. Our lending policies generally avoid loans in which we do
not have the opportunity to maintain or achieve other business relationships with the customer. In addition to management’s quarterly assessment of credit risk,
banking regulators annually review a sample of shared national credits for proper risk grading.

Commercial real estate represents loans for the construction of buildings or other improvements to real estate and property held by borrowers for investment
purposes generally within our geographical footprint. We require collateral values in excess of the loan amounts, demonstrated cash flows in excess of expected
debt service requirements, equity investment in the project and a portion of the project already sold, leased or permanent financing already secured. The expected
cash flows from all significant new or renewed income producing property commitments are stress tested to reflect the risks in varying interest rates, vacancy rates
and rental rates. As with commercial loans, inherent lending risks are centrally monitored on a continuous basis from underwriting throughout the life of the loan
for compliance with applicable lending policies.

The commercial real estate loan balance as a percentage of our total loan portfolio has ranged from 20 percent to 22 percent over the past five years. The
outstanding balance of commercial real estate loans decreased $256 million compared to March 31, 2021. Borrowers continue to use this low interest rate
environment to refinance to long-term, non-recourse markets. Multifamily residential loans decreased $263 million to $965 million at June 30, 2021. Loans
secured by office buildings decreased $21 million to $1.1 billion. Loans secured by other commercial real estate properties decreased $14 million to $471 million.
Loans secured by industrial facilities increased $35 million to $825 million. Loans secured by retail facilities were largely unchanged compared to March 31, 2021.

Approximately 69 percent of loans in this segment are in our geographic footprint based on collateral location. The largest concentration of loans in this segment
outside our footprint is Utah, totaling 9 percent of the segment, followed by California at 5 percent. All other states represent less than 5 percent individually.

Paycheck Protection Program

We actively participate in programs initiated by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act"), including the Small Business
Administration's ("SBA") Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP") that began on April 3, 2020. PPP provides fully forgivable loans when utilized for qualified
expenditures, including to help small businesses maintain payrolls during the COVID-19 pandemic. These loans have a contractual term of two years, though most
are expected to be forgiven prior to maturity after completion of a compliance period. Loans are guaranteed and amounts forgiven will be reimbursed to the
Company by the SBA. The loans carry a fixed interest rate of 1 percent. Interest plus loan fees, which vary depending on loan size, are accrued over the contractual
life of the loan. Any unaccreted origination fees will be recognized when the loan is paid. The pace of forgiveness activity for the initial rounds of PPP loans has
been slower than initially anticipated. At June 30, 2021, approximately $461 million of PPP loans from the initial rounds remains, with an unaccreted origination
fee balance of $3.8 million.

The Company also participated in the most recent round of PPP, originating $661 million of new PPP loans during this year, maintaining a focus on our existing
client base to timely support their needs. The newest round of loans have a fixed interest rate of 1 percent and a contractual term of five years, but are expected to
be forgiven prior to maturity. Unaccreted origination fees related to the 2021 vintage of PPP loans totaled $24 million at June 30, 2021.

Loans to Individuals

Loans to individuals include residential mortgage and personal loans. Residential mortgage loans provide funds for our customers to purchase or refinance their
primary residence or to borrow against the equity in their home. These loans are secured by a first or second mortgage on the customer's primary residence. These
loans are made in accordance with underwriting policies we believe to be conservative and are fully documented. Loans may be individually underwritten or credit
scored based on size and other criteria. Credit scoring is assessed based on significant credit characteristics including credit history, residential and employment
stability.

In general, we sell the majority of our conforming fixed rate loan originations in the secondary market and retain the majority of our non-conforming and
adjustable-rate mortgage loans. Our mortgage loan portfolio does not include payment option adjustable rate mortgage loans or adjustable rate mortgage loans with
initial rates that are below market. Home equity loans are primarily first-lien and fully amortizing.

Residential mortgage, which includes home equity loans, and personal loans are made in accordance with underwriting policies we believe to be conservative and
are fully documented. Loans may be individually underwritten or credit scored based on size and other criteria. Credit scoring is assessed based on significant
credit characteristics including credit history, residential and employment stability.

- 21 -

Personal loans consist primarily of loans to Wealth Management clients secured by the cash surrender value of insurance policies and marketable securities. It also
includes direct loans secured by and for the purchase of automobiles, recreational and marine equipment as well as unsecured loans.

Approximately 90 percent of the loans in this segment are secured by collateral located within our geographical footprint. Loans for which the collateral location is
less relevant, such as unsecured loans are categorized by the borrower’s primary operating location.

Residential mortgage loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies have limited credit exposure because of the agency guarantee. This amount includes
residential mortgage loans previously sold into GNMA mortgage pools that the Company may repurchase when certain defined delinquency criteria are met.
Because of this repurchase right, the Company is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans and must include them on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet.

The Company secondarily evaluates loan portfolio performance based on the primary geographical market managing the loan. Loans attributed to a geographical
market may not represent the location of the borrower or the collateral. All permanent mortgage loans serviced by our mortgage banking unit and held for
investment by the Company are centrally managed by the Oklahoma market.

Off-Balance Sheet Commitments

We enter into certain off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business as shown in Table 14. Loan commitments may be unconditional obligations
to provide financing or conditional obligations that depend on the borrower’s financial condition, collateral value or other factors. Standby letters of credit are
unconditional commitments to guarantee the performance of our customer to a third party. Since some of these commitments are expected to expire before being
drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.

We have off-balance sheet commitments related to certain residential mortgage loans sold into mortgage-backed securities as part of our mortgage banking
activities. We retain off-balance sheet credit risk related to losses in excess of amounts guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veteran's Affairs ("VA").

We also have off-balance sheet credit risk related to certain residential mortgage loans primarily originated under community development loan programs that were
sold to a U.S. government agency with full recourse prior to 2007. We are obligated to repurchase these loans for the life of these loans in the event of foreclosure
for the unpaid principal and interest at the time of foreclosure. The majority of our conforming fixed rate loan originations are sold in the secondary market and we
only retain repurchase obligations under standard underwriting representations and warranties.

We offer programs that permit our customers to hedge various risks, including fluctuations in energy, cattle and other agricultural product prices, interest rates and
foreign exchange rates. Each of these programs work essentially the same way. Derivative contracts are executed between the customers and the
Company. Offsetting contracts are executed between the Company and selected counterparties to minimize market risk due to changes in commodity prices,
interest rates or foreign exchange rates. The counterparty contracts are identical to the customer contracts, except for a fixed pricing spread or a fee paid to us as
compensation for administrative costs, credit risk and profit.

The customer derivative programs create credit risk for potential amounts due to the Company from our customers and from the counterparties. Customer credit
risk is monitored through existing credit policies and procedures. The effects of changes in commodity prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates are evaluated
across a range of possible scenarios to determine the maximum exposure we are willing to have individually to any customer. Customers may also be required to
provide cash margin or other collateral in conjunction with our credit agreements to further limit our credit risk.

Counterparty credit risk is evaluated through existing policies and procedures. This evaluation considers the total relationship between BOK Financial and each of
the counterparties. Individual limits are established by management, approved by Credit Administration and reviewed by the Asset/Liability Committee. Margin
collateral is required if the exposure between the Company and any counterparty exceeds established limits. Based on declines in the counterparties’ credit ratings,
these limits may be reduced and additional margin collateral may be required.

A deterioration of the credit standing of one or more of the customers or counterparties to these contracts may result in BOK Financial recognizing a loss as the fair
value of the affected contracts may no longer move in tandem with the offsetting contracts. This occurs if the credit standing of the customer or counterparty
deteriorated such that either the fair value of underlying collateral no longer supported the contract or the customer or the counterparty’s ability to provide margin
collateral was impaired. Credit losses on customer derivatives reduce brokerage and trading revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Derivative contracts are carried at fair value. At June 30, 2021, the net fair values of derivative contracts, before consideration of cash margin, reported as assets
under these programs totaled $1.6 billion compared to $880 million at March 31, 2021. At June 30, 2021, the net fair value of our derivative contracts included
$992 million for energy contracts, $569 million for foreign exchange contracts and $72 million for interest rate swaps. The aggregate net fair value of derivative
contracts, before consideration of cash margin, held under these programs reported as liabilities totaled $1.6 billion at June 30, 2021 and $865 million at March 31,
2021.

At June 30, 2021, total derivative assets were reduced by $1.2 million of cash collateral received from counterparties and total derivative liabilities were reduced
by $1.0 billion of cash collateral paid to counterparties related to instruments executed with the same counterparty under a master netting agreement. Derivative
contracts executed with customers may be secured by non-cash collateral in conjunction with a credit agreement with that customer, such as proven producing oil
and gas properties. Access to this collateral in event of default is reasonably assured.

A table showing the notional and fair value of derivative assets and liabilities on both a gross and net basis is presented in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

The fair value of derivative contracts reported as assets under these programs, net of cash margin held by the Company, by category of debtor at June 30, 2021
follows in Table 15.

At June 30, 2021, our largest derivative exposure was to an energy customer for $82 million.

Our customer derivative program also introduces liquidity and capital risk. We are required to provide cash margin to certain counterparties when the net negative
fair value of the contracts exceeds established limits. Also, changes in commodity prices affect the amount of regulatory capital we are required to hold as support
for the fair value of our derivative assets. These risks are modeled as part of the management of these programs. Based on current prices, a decrease in market
prices equivalent to $58.86 per barrel of oil would decrease the fair value of derivative assets by $447 million, with dealer counterparties comprising the bulk of the
assets. An increase in prices equivalent to $87.10 per barrel of oil would increase the fair value of derivative assets by $373 million as margin received falls faster
than the asset values. Liquidity requirements of this program may also be affected by our credit rating. At June 30, 2021, a decrease in our credit rating to below
investment grade would increase our obligation to post cash margin on existing contracts by approximately $10 million. The fair value of our to-be-announced
residential mortgage-backed securities and interest rate swap derivative contracts is affected by changes in interest rates. Based on our assessment as of June 30,
2021, changes in interest rates would not materially impact regulatory capital or liquidity needed to support this portion of our customer derivative program.

Allowance for Loan Losses and Accrual for Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk from Unfunded Loan Commitments

Expected credit losses on assets carried at amortized cost are recognized over their expected lives based on models that measure the probability of default and loss
given default over a 12-month reasonable and supportable forecast period. Models incorporate base case, downside and upside macroeconomic variables such as
real gross domestic product ("GDP") growth, civilian unemployment rate and West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") oil prices on a probability weighted basis. See
Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of methodology of allowance for loan losses.

A $35.0 million negative provision for credit losses was recorded the second quarter of 2021, primarily due to changes in our reasonable and supportable forecasts
of macroeconomic variables as a result of continued improvement in the economic outlook related to the anticipated impact of the on-going COVID-19 pandemic
and improving credit quality metrics. Decreased allowance due to lower loan balances and decreased specific impairment were offset by charge-offs during the
quarter.

- 27 -

Our reasonable and supportable forecast of macroeconomic variables are significantly influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic developments and related
government stimulus policies, which remain highly uncertain. A summary of macroeconomic variables considered in developing our estimate of expected credit
losses at June 30, 2021 follows:

Base
70%

Scenario probability
weighting
COVID-19 trajectory COVID-19 case levels continue to improve
and normalize as virus immunity becomes
increasingly widespread and proves effective
against new virus strains.

Economic recovery
(driven by COVID-19
trajectory)

Continued easing of restrictions and the
release of pent-up consumer demand results
in GDP growth above historical averages
through 2021, but begins to moderate in
2022.

Macro-economic
factors

– GDP is forecasted to grow by 4.8
percent over the next 12 months.

– Civilian unemployment rate of 5.5
percent in the third quarter of 2021
improves to 4.7 percent by the
second quarter of 2022.

– WTI oil prices are projected to
generally follow the NYMEX
forward curve that existed at the end
of June 2021 and are expected to
average $67.04 per barrel over the
next 12 months.

Downside
20%

Upside
10%

Trajectory of COVID-19 pandemic worsens
as additional surges stemming from new virus
strains in areas of the country with lower
vaccination rates as the U.S. enters the fall
and winters months. The severity of the
situation is compounded by uncertainty
around vaccine durability and many
states/regions are forced to reinstate
restrictions.
Deteriorated COVID-19 situation, slow
vaccine distribution and lack of
Congressional support for additional fiscal
stimulus results in a mild recession with
conditions beginning to improve in the spring
of 2022.

– GDP is forecasted to grow 1.3

percent over the next 12 months.

– Civilian unemployment rate of 5.7
percent in the third quarter of 2021
increases in the next two quarters
then levels off at 7.6 percent in the
second quarter of 2022.

– WTI oil prices are projected to

average $52.58 over the next 12
months.

COVID-19 case levels continue to improve
and normalize as virus immunity becomes
increasingly widespread and proves effective
against new virus strains.

Continued easing of restrictions, the release
of pent-up consumer demand and prolonged
spending of excess savings results in GDP
growth above historical averages for 2021
and 2022.

– GDP is forecasted to grow by 6.4
percent over the next 12 months.

– Civilian unemployment rate of 5.1
percent in the third quarter of 2021
improves to 4.0 percent by the
second quarter of 2022.

– WTI oil prices are projected to

average $72.28 per barrel over the
next 12 months.

Net charge-offs and changes in specific impairments attributed to certain credits required a $9.2 million provision during the second quarter of 2021. This
provision was offset primarily by a decrease in allowance related to lower outstanding loan balances and changes in payment profile. There was a slight decrease in
the provision for credit losses related to improved risk grading during the quarter. Significant improvement in energy loans credit risk grading was partially offset
by credit risk grade migration in commercial real estate and residential mortgage loans. A summary of outstanding loan balances by risk grade is included in Note
4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Non-pass grade loans include other loans especially mentioned, defined by regulatory guidelines as loans that are
currently performing in compliance with original terms but may have a potential weakness that deserves management’s close attention, accruing substandard loans,
and nonaccruing loans. Non-pass grade loans totaled $652 million at June 30, 2021, a $208 million decrease compared to March 31. Non-pass graded loans were
primarily composed of $325 million or 11 percent of energy loans, $117 million or 3 percent of services loans, $62 million or 2 percent of general business loans
and $59 million or 1 percent of commercial real estate loans.

The allowance for loan losses totaled $312 million or 1.46 percent of outstanding loans and 183 percent of nonaccruing loans at June 30, 2021, excluding
residential mortgage loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. The combined allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from
unfunded loan commitments was $336 million or 1.57 percent of outstanding loans and 197 percent of nonaccruing loans at June 30, 2021. Excluding PPP loans,
the allowance for loan losses was 1.54 percent of outstanding loans and the combined allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from
unfunded loan commitments was 1.66 percent.

The allowance for credit losses attributed to energy was 2.68 percent of outstanding energy loans at June 30, 2021. Our semi-annual borrowing base
redeterminations during the second quarter of 2021 were based on forward pricing curves that existed at that time and resulted in improved credit risk grading in
our energy loan portfolio. Although energy prices have continued to improve, the pricing environment remains fragile and tied to the continued economic recovery
from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Company recorded a $25.0 million negative provision for credit losses in the first quarter of 2021. The allowance for loan losses was $352 million or 1.56
percent of outstanding loans and 170 percent of nonaccruing loans, excluding loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies at March 31, 2021. The combined
allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments was $385 million or 1.71 percent of outstanding loans and
186 percent of nonaccruing loans. Excluding PPP loans, the allowance for loan losses was 1.70 percent of outstanding loans and the combined allowance for loan
losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments was 1.86 percent.

Net Loans Charged Off

Net charge-offs of commercial loans were $14.6 million in the second quarter of 2021, primarily related to three energy production borrowers. Net commercial real
estate loan charge-offs were $624 thousand and net charge-offs of loans to individuals were $197 thousand. Net charge-offs of loans to individuals include deposit
account overdraft losses.

Accrual for Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk Associated with Mortgage Banking Activities

The accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk associated with mortgage banking activities includes consideration of credit risk related to certain residential mortgage
loans sold into mortgage-backed securities in excess of amounts guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veteran's Affairs ("VA") and mortgage loans originated
under community development loan programs that were sold to a U.S. government agency with full recourse.

We use publicly available long-term national data to estimate total loss given default for our off-balance sheet credit risk related to losses in excess of amounts
guaranteed by the VA. This result is combined with probability of default output from our mortgage servicing rights model to estimate total expected loss. Then,
we estimate the VA's guarantee percentage to determine our portion of the credit risk. Qualitative adjustment may be used, if necessary.

Allowance for Credit Losses Related to Held-to-Maturity (Investment) Securities

The expected credit losses principles apply to all financial assets measured at cost, including our held-to-maturity (investment) debt securities portfolio. Our
investment portfolio includes municipal and other tax-exempt securities and other debt securities. Expected credit losses for these assets is based on probability of
default and loss given default assumptions that align with similarly graded loans. Qualitative adjustment may be used, if necessary.

Nonperforming Assets

As more fully described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, loans are generally classified as nonaccruing when it becomes probable that we will
not collect the full contractual principal and interest. Accruing renegotiated loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies represent residential mortgage loans
that have been modified in troubled debt restructurings. Interest continues to accrue based on the modified terms of the loan and loans may be sold once they
become eligible according to U.S. government agency guidelines. Real estate and other repossessed assets are assets acquired in partial or total forgiveness of
loans. The assets are carried at the lower of cost as determined by fair value at the date of foreclosure or current fair value, less estimated selling costs. A summary
of nonperforming assets follows in Table 17:

Excluding assets guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, nonperforming assets decreased $51 million from March 31, 2021, primarily due to a $31 million
decrease in nonaccruing energy loans and a $14 million decrease in real estate and other repossessed assets. Newly identified nonaccruing loans totaled $13
million, offset by $31 million of payments and $18 million of charge-offs. The Company generally retains nonperforming assets to maximize potential recovery,
which may cause future nonperforming assets to decrease more slowly.

A rollforward of nonperforming assets for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 follows in Table 18.

We foreclose on loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies in accordance with agency guidelines. Generally these loans are not eligible for modification
programs or have failed to comply with modified loan terms. Principal is guaranteed by agencies of the U.S. government, subject to limitations and credit risk is
limited. At foreclosure, these amounts are transferred to claims receivable accounts. These properties will be conveyed to the agencies once applicable criteria have
been met.

Real Estate and Other Repossessed Assets

Real estate and other repossessed assets totaled $57 million at June 30, 2021, composed primarily of $36 million of oil and gas properties, including a consolidated
limited liability corporation that is 60% owned by the Company and 40% owned by an unrelated financial institution. The remaining balance of real estate and
repossessed assets included $18 million of developed commercial real estate, $1.7 million of equipment, $1.6 million of undeveloped land primarily zoned for
commercial development and $374 thousand of 1-4 family residential properties. Real estate and other repossessed assets totaled $71 million at March 31, 2021.
The decrease compared to March 31 was primarily due to the sale of certain repossessed oil and gas properties.

Liquidity and Capital

Based on the average balances for the second quarter of 2021, approximately 75 percent of our funding was provided by deposit accounts, 11 percent from
borrowed funds, less than 1 percent from long-term subordinated debt and 11 percent from equity. Our funding sources, which primarily include deposits and
borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Banks and other banks, provide adequate liquidity to meet our operating needs.

Subsidiary Bank

Deposits and borrowed funds are the primary sources of liquidity for BOKF, NA, the wholly owned subsidiary bank of BOK Financial. We compete for retail and
commercial deposits by offering a broad range of products and services and focusing on customer convenience. Retail deposit growth is supported through
personal and small business checking, online bill paying services, mobile banking services, an extensive network of branch locations and ATMs and our
ExpressBank call center. Commercial deposit growth is supported by offering treasury management and lockbox services. We also acquire brokered deposits when
the cost of funds is advantageous to other funding sources.

Average deposits for the second quarter of 2021 totaled $37.5 billion, a $968 million increase over the first quarter of 2021. Continued deposit growth was
primarily due to customers maintaining higher balances in the current economic environment, supplemented by inflows from government stimulus payments.
Interest-bearing transaction account balances increased $58 million. Demand deposits grew by $877 million and savings account balances were up $83 million.
Interest-bearing transaction account balances increased $58 million while certificate of deposit balances decreased $50 million.

Average Commercial Banking deposit balances increased $920 million over the first quarter of 2021. Demand deposit balances were up $517 million. Interest-
bearing transaction account balances increased $390 million. Time deposits increased $11 million compared to the prior quarter. Commercial customers continue
to retain large cash reserves primarily due to a combination of factors including uncertainty about the economic environment and potential for growth, lack of
preferable liquid alternatives and a desire to minimize deposit service charges through the earnings credit. The earnings credit is a non-cash method that enables
commercial customers to offset deposit service charges based on account balances. Commercial deposit balances may decrease as the economic outlook improves
and if short-term rates move higher, enhancing their investment alternatives.

Average Consumer Banking deposit balances increased $387 million over the prior quarter. Demand deposit balances grew by $188 million. A $145 million
increase in interest-bearing transaction deposit balances and an $80 million increase in savings account balances were partially offset by a $25 million decrease in
time deposit balances.

Average Wealth Management deposits decreased $11 million compared to the first quarter of 2021. A $179 million increase in demand deposit balances was offset
by a $158 million decrease in interest-bearing transaction accounts and a $33 million decrease in time deposit balances.

Average time deposits for the second quarter of 2021 included $67 million of brokered deposits, a $25 million decrease compared to the first quarter of 2021.
Average interest-bearing transaction accounts for the second quarter included $2.0 billion of brokered deposits, a $323 million decrease compared to the first
quarter of 2021.

In addition to deposits, liquidity is provided primarily by federal funds purchased, securities repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank
borrowings. Federal funds purchased consist primarily of unsecured, overnight funds acquired from other financial institutions. Funds are primarily purchased from
bankers’ banks and Federal Home Loan banks from across the country. The Company has no wholesale federal funds purchased at June 30, 2021. Securities
repurchase agreements generally mature within 90 days and are secured by certain available for sale and trading securities. Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings
are generally short-term and are secured by a blanket pledge of eligible collateral (generally unencumbered U.S. Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities,
1-4 family residential mortgage loans, multifamily and other qualifying commercial real estate loans). Amounts borrowed from the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Topeka averaged $2.1 billion during the quarter, compared to $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2021.

On April 13, 2020, the banking agencies published an interim final rule which permits banking organizations to exclude from regulatory capital requirements PPP
covered loans pledged to the Federal Reserve's Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility ("PPLF"). The Company initially funded PPP loans from deposits
and Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, but transitioned to the PPLF in June 2020 in order to realize this regulatory capital relief.

At June 30, 2021, the estimated unused credit available to BOKF, NA from collateralized sources was approximately $16.9 billion.

BOKF, NA also has a liability related to the repurchase of certain delinquent residential mortgage loans previously sold in GNMA mortgage pools. Interest is
payable monthly at rates contractually due to investors.

Parent Company

At June 30, 2021, cash and interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents held by the parent company totaled $168 million. The primary sources of liquidity for BOK
Financial are cash on hand and dividends from BOKF, NA. Dividends from the bank are limited by various banking regulations to net profits, as defined, for the
year plus retained profits for the two preceding years. Dividends are further restricted by minimum capital requirements. At June 30, 2021, based upon the most
restrictive limitations as well as management's internal capital policy, BOKF, NA could declare up to $504 million of dividends without regulatory approval.
Dividend constraints may be alleviated through increases in retained earnings, capital issuances or changes in risk weighted assets. Future losses or increases in
required regulatory capital at the bank could affect its ability to pay dividends to the parent company.

Our equity capital at June 30, 2021 was $5.4 billion, a $92 million increase compared to March 31, 2021. Net income less cash dividends paid increased equity
$131 million during the second quarter of 2021. Changes in interest rates resulted in a $5.4 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive gain compared to
March 31, 2021. We also repurchased $44 million of common stock during the second quarter of 2021. Capital is managed to maximize long-term value to the
shareholders. Factors considered in managing capital include projections of future earnings including expected benefits from lower federal income tax rates, asset
growth and acquisition strategies, and regulatory and debt covenant requirements. Capital management may include subordinated debt or perpetual preferred stock
issuance, share repurchase and stock and cash dividends.

On April 30, 2019, the board of directors authorized the Company to purchase up to five million common shares, subject to market conditions, securities law and
other regulatory compliance limitations. As of June 30, 2021, 2,726,807 shares have been repurchased under this authorization. The Company repurchased 492,994
shares of common stock at an average price of $88.84 a share in the second quarter of 2021. We view share buybacks opportunistically, but within the context of
maintaining our strong capital position.

BOK Financial and BOKF, NA are subject to various capital requirements administered by federal agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can
result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that could have a material impact on operations. These capital requirements
include quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items. The capital standards are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators.

A summary of minimum capital requirements, including capital conservation buffer follows in Table 22. A bank which falls below these levels, including the
capital conservation buffer, would be subject to regulatory restrictions on capital distributions (including but not limited to dividends and share repurchases) and
executive bonus payments.

In March 2020, in response to the impact on the financial markets by the COVID-19 pandemic, the banking agencies issued an interim final rule permitting
banking organizations that implement CECL the option to delay for two years an estimate of the CECL methodology's effect on regulatory capital, followed by a
three-year transition period. The estimate includes the implementation date adjustment as of January 1, 2020 plus an estimate of the impact of the change for a two
year period following implementation of CECL. We have elected to delay the regulatory capital impact of the transition in accordance with the interim final rule.
Deferral of the impact of CECL added 19 basis points to the Company's Common equity Tier 1 capital at June 30, 2021.

The capital ratios for BOK Financial on a consolidated basis are presented in Table 22.

Capital resources of financial institutions are also regularly measured by the tangible common shareholders’ equity ratio. Tangible common shareholders’ equity is
shareholders’ equity as defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) less intangible assets and equity which does
not benefit common shareholders. Equity that does not benefit common shareholders includes preferred equity. This non-GAAP measure is a valuable indicator of
a financial institution’s capital strength since it eliminates intangible assets from shareholders’ equity and retains the effect of unrealized losses on securities and
other components of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity.

Table 23 provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures with financial measures defined by GAAP.

Pre-provision net revenue is a measure of revenue less expenses, and is calculated before provision for credit losses and income tax expense. This financial
measure is frequently used by investors and analysts to enable them to assess a company's ability to generate earnings to cover credit losses through a credit cycle.
It also provides an additional basis for comparing the results of operations between periods by isolating the impact of the provision for credit losses, which can
vary significantly between periods.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the Company’s significant off-balance sheet commitments.
