Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Performance Summary

BOK Financial Corporation (“the Company”) reported net income of $146.1 million or $2.10 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2021. Net income was $62.1
million or $0.88 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2020 and $154.2 million or $2.21 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2020. Forecasts for improving
macroeconomic factors as the pace of COVID-19 vaccinations accelerates and energy prices stabilize resulted in a negative provision for expected credit losses of
$25.0 million and $6.5 million in the first quarter of 2021 and fourth quarter of 2020, respectively. A provision for expected credit losses of $93.8 million was
recorded in the first quarter of 2020.

Pre-provision net revenue ("PPNR"), a non-GAAP measure, was $163.4 million for the first quarter of 2021, $173.2 million for the first quarter of 2020, and
$192.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2020. The decrease in PPNR for the first quarter of 2021 compared to the previous periods was due to lower combined net
interest revenue and fees and commission revenue. This was largely driven by a shift in average earning assets from loans to trading securities, narrowing net
interest margin, and compressed margins on mortgage loans and mortgage-backed trading assets.

Highlights of the first quarter of 2021 included:

Net interest revenue totaled $280.4 million, an increase of $19.1 million over the first quarter of 2020. Average earning assets were $44.2 billion for the
first quarter of 2021 compared to $38.4 billion for the first quarter of 2020, largely driven by growth in trading securities. Net interest margin was 2.62
percent for the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2.80 percent for the first quarter of 2020. The Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds rate to near zero
in March 2020. Other short-term market interest rates followed, reducing the yield on floating-rate assets by more than the amount by which funding costs
could be reduced, compressing the margin. Net interest revenue decreased $16.8 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Net interest margin
decreased 10 basis points.

Fees and commissions revenue totaled $162.2 million, a decrease of $30.6 million compared to the first quarter of 2020. Brokerage and trading revenue
decreased $30.0 million, largely due to a shift from trading revenue to net interest revenue on trading securities. Fees and commissions revenue decreased
$18.9 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, including a $15.4 million reduction in trading revenue due to lower volumes and margin
compression.

Other operating expense totaled $282.6 million, an increase of $14.0 million over the first quarter of 2020. Personnel expense increased $16.8 million due
to growth in incentive compensation expense and deferred compensation costs. Non-personnel expense decreased $2.8 million compared to the first
quarter of 2020. A gain on the sale of repossessed oil and gas assets and lower business promotion costs were largely offset by an increase in charitable
contributions, data processing and mortgage banking expenses. Operating expense decreased $18.0 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.
Personnel expense decreased $3.2 million, primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs, partially offset by a seasonal increase in employee
benefits expense. Non-personnel expense decreased $14.8 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, primarily due to the $14.1 million gain on the
sale of repossessed oil and gas assets.

Period-end outstanding loan balances totaled $22.5 billion at March 31, 2021, a decrease of $474 million compared to December 31, 2020, largely due to
paydowns of energy loans and commercial real estate loans. Loans originated as part of the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program
("PPP") increased $166 million to $1.8 billion. Average loan balances decreased $691 million to $22.8 billion compared to December 31, 2020.

The allowance for loan losses totaled $352 million or 1.70 percent of outstanding loans, excluding PPP loans, at March 31, 2021. The allowance for loan
losses was $389 million or 1.82 percent of outstanding loans, excluding PPP loans, at December 31, 2020.

Nonperforming assets not guaranteed by U.S. government agencies decreased $39 million compared to December 31, 2020. Potential problem loans
decreased $55 million while other loans especially mentioned decreased $90 million. Net charge-offs were $14.5 million or 0.28 percent of average loans
on an annualized basis for the first quarter of 2021, excluding PPP loans. Net charge-offs were 0.31 percent of average loans, excluding PPP loans, over
the last four quarters. Net charge-offs were $16.7 million or 0.31 percent of average loans on an annualized basis for the fourth quarter of 2020, excluding
PPP loans.

Period-end deposits were $37.9 billion at March 31, 2021, a $1.7 billion increase compared to December 31, 2020, largely due to growth in commercial
balances. Average deposits increased $1.0 billion, including a $715 million increase in interest-bearing transaction deposits. Clients across all of our
business segments continued to maintain higher deposit balances during this period of economic uncertainty, supplemented by inflows from government
stimulus.

The common equity Tier 1 capital ratio at March 31, 2021 was 12.14 percent. Other regulatory capital ratios were Tier 1 capital ratio, 12.21 percent, total
capital ratio, 13.98 percent, and leverage ratio, 8.42 percent. At December 31, 2020, the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.95 percent, the Tier 1
capital ratio was 11.95 percent, total capital ratio was 13.82 percent, and leverage ratio was 8.28 percent.

The Company repurchased 260,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $77.20 per share in the first quarter of 2021 and 665,100 shares at an
average price of $63.82 in the fourth quarter of 2020. We view share buybacks opportunistically but within the context of maintaining our strong capital
position.

The Company paid a regular cash dividend of $36.0 million or $0.52 per common share during the first quarter of 2021. On May 4, 2021, the board of
directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.52 per common share payable on or about May 27, 2021 to shareholders of record as of May 17, 2021.

Results of Operations

Net Interest Revenue and Net Interest Margin

Net interest revenue is the interest earned on debt securities, loans and other interest-earning assets less interest paid for interest-bearing deposits and other
borrowings. The net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax-equivalent net interest revenue by average interest-earning assets. Net interest spread is the
difference between the average rate earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is typically greater
than net interest spread due to interest income earned on assets funded by non-interest bearing liabilities such as demand deposits and equity.

Tax-equivalent net interest revenue totaled $282.7 million for the first quarter of 2021 and $264.1 million in the first quarter of 2020. Net interest revenue
decreased $20.7 million due to changes in interest rates and increased $39.3 million from growth in earning assets, largely due to the increase in trading securities
balances. Table 1 shows the effect on net interest revenue from changes in average balances and interest rates for various types of earning assets and interest-
bearing liabilities.

Net interest margin was 2.62 percent for the first quarter of 2021, compared to 2.80 percent for the first quarter of 2020. In response to the anticipated impact to the
economy from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds rate to near zero in March, 2020. Other short-term market interest rates
followed, reducing the yield on floating-rate assets by more than the amount by which funding costs could be reduced, compressing the margin. The tax-equivalent
yield on earning assets was 2.78 percent, a decrease of 95 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2020. Loan yields decreased 95 basis points to 3.55 percent,
largely due to the decrease in short-term interest rates partially offset by the addition of PPP loan fees. PPP loan fees of $11.2 million were recognized in the first
quarter of 2021 and $34.2 million remains to be recognized in future periods. The available for sale securities portfolio yield decreased 64 basis points to 1.84
percent as principal cash flows received from maturities of the available for sale securities portfolio continue to be reinvested at lower rates. Cash flows received
from these securities are currently being reinvested at 95-105 basis points. The yield on trading securities decreased 83 basis points to 2.06 percent.

Funding costs decreased 95 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2020. The cost of other borrowed funds decreased 117 basis points and the cost of interest-
bearing deposits decreased 81 basis points. The benefit to net interest margin from earning assets funded by non-interest bearing liabilities was 8 basis points for
the first quarter of 2021, a decrease of 18 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2020.
Average earning assets for the first quarter of 2021 increased $5.8 billion or 15 percent over the first quarter of 2020, largely due to an increase in our trading of
U.S. government issued mortgage-backed securities, the expansion of the available for sale securities portfolio, and PPP loans. Average trading securities increased
$5.3 billion.The average balance of available for sale securities, which consists largely of residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by
U.S. government agencies, increased $1.8 billion. We purchase securities to supplement earnings and to manage interest rate risk. Average loans, net of allowance
for loan losses, increased $682 million, largely due to the inflow of PPP loans, partially offset by purposeful deleveraging by our customers as borrowers continue
to pay down during this time of economic uncertainty. Fair vale option securities that we hold as an economic hedge against changes in the fair value of mortgage
servicing rights decreased $1.7 billion.

Average deposits increased $8.3 billion compared to the first quarter of 2020. Deposit growth is largely due to customers retaining elevated balances in the current
economic environment, supplemented by the most recent government stimulus payments. Interest-bearing deposits increased $5.2 billion while demand deposit
balances increased $3.1 billion.

Tax-equivalent net interest revenue decreased $16.9 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Net interest margin was 2.62 percent compared to 2.72 percent
in the fourth quarter of 2020. The decrease in net interest revenue was primarily driven by lower average outstanding loan balances. Reinvestment of cash flows
from the available for sale securities portfolio to current interest rates and timing of PPP and other loan fees also contributed to a decrease in net interest revenue
and net interest margin in the first quarter.

Average earning assets decreased $178 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Average loan balances decreased $691 million, primarily from commercial
and commercial real estate loan pay downs. Available for sale securities increased $484 million. Average interest-bearing deposits grew by $823 million, primarily
due to higher interest-bearing transaction deposits in the wake of the most recent government stimulus program. Other borrowings decreased $1.8 billion while
funds purchased and repurchase agreements increased $677 million.

The yield on average earning assets was 2.78 percent, a 14 basis point decrease from the prior quarter. The yield on the available for sale securities portfolio
decreased 14 basis points to 1.84 percent and the loan portfolio yield decreased 13 basis points to 3.55 percent.

Funding costs were 0.24 percent, down 4 basis points. The cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased 2 basis points to 0.17 percent. The cost of other borrowed
funds was down 8 basis points to 0.30 percent. The benefit to net interest margin from assets funded by non-interest liabilities was 8 basis points for the first
quarter of 2021, consistent with the prior quarter.

Our overall objective is to manage the Company’s balance sheet to be relatively neutral to changes in interest rates as is further described in the Market Risk
section of this report. Approximately 76% of our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios are either variable rate or fixed rate that will reprice within
one year. These loans are funded primarily by deposit accounts that are either non-interest bearing, or that reprice more slowly than the loans. The result is a
balance sheet that would be asset sensitive, which means that assets generally reprice more quickly than liabilities. One of the strategies that we use to manage
toward a relative rate-neutral position is to purchase fixed rate residential mortgage-backed securities issued primarily by U.S. government agencies and fund them
with market-rate-sensitive liabilities. The liability-sensitive nature of this strategy provides an offset to the asset-sensitive characteristics of our loan portfolio. We
also may use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risk. 

The effectiveness of these strategies is reflected in the overall change in net interest revenue due to changes in interest rates as shown in Table 1 and in the interest
rate sensitivity projections as shown in the Market Risk section of this report.

Other Operating Revenue

Other operating revenue was $163.9 million for the first quarter of 2021, a decrease of $16.4 million compared to the first quarter of 2020, largely due to a shift of
trading revenue to interest income from trading securities.

Other operating revenue decreased $32.9 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Brokerage and trading revenue decreased $18.7 million. Margin
compression and reduced residential mortgage-backed securities trading volumes have negatively affected our brokerage and trading revenue.

Certain percentage increases (decreases) in non-fees and commissions revenue are not meaningful for comparison purposes based on the nature of the item.

Fees and commissions revenue

Diversified sources of fees and commissions revenue are a significant part of our business strategy and represented 37 percent of total revenue for the first quarter
of 2021, excluding provision for credit losses and gains and losses on other assets, securities and derivatives and the change in the fair value of mortgage servicing
rights. We believe that a variety of fee revenue sources provides an offset to changes in interest rates, values in the equity markets, commodity prices and consumer
spending, all of which can be volatile. As an example of this strength, many of the economic factors such as rising interest rates resulting in growth in net interest
revenue or fiduciary and asset management revenue may also decrease mortgage banking production volumes and related trading. We expect growth in other
operating revenue to come through offering new products and services and by further development of our presence in other markets. However, current and future
economic conditions, including the recent impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory constraints, increased competition and saturation in our existing markets
could affect the rate of future increases.

Brokerage and Trading Revenue

Brokerage and trading revenue, which includes revenues from trading, customer hedging, retail brokerage and investment banking, decreased $30.0 million or 59
percent compared to the first quarter of 2020.

- 5 -

 
 
Trading revenue includes net realized and unrealized gains and losses primarily related to sales of residential mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by U.S.
government agencies and related derivative instruments that enable our mortgage banking customers to manage their production risk. Trading revenue also
includes net realized and unrealized gains and losses on municipal securities and other financial instruments that we sell to institutional customers, along with
changes in the fair value of financial instruments we hold as economic hedges against market risk of our trading securities. Trading revenue was $3.7 million for
the first quarter of 2021, a $30.7 million or 89 percent decrease compared to the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to a shift from fee revenue to net interest
revenue on trading securities. See additional discussion in "Lines of Business" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis.

Customer hedging revenue is based primarily on realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of derivative contracts held for customer risk management
programs. As more fully discussed under Customer Derivative Programs in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, we offer commodity, interest rate,
foreign exchange and equity derivatives to our customers. Customer hedging revenue totaled $2.6 million for the first quarter of 2021, a $631 thousand or 20
percent decrease compared to the first quarter of 2020.

Investment banking, which includes fees earned upon completion of underwriting, financial advisory services and loan syndication fees, totaled $6.8 million for the
first quarter of 2021, an increase of $1.8 million or 35 percent compared to the first quarter of 2020, related to timing and volume of completed transactions.

Brokerage and trading revenue decreased $18.7 million compared to the previous quarter, including a $15.4 million decrease in trading revenue, largely due to
margin compression and reduction of residential mortgage-backed securities trading volumes from record levels in the fourth quarter of 2020. Customer hedging
revenue also decreased $2.1 million as energy customers decreased hedging activities. Investment banking revenue decreased $2.1 million mainly due to timing of
loan syndication activity.

Fiduciary and Asset Management Revenue

Fiduciary and asset management revenue is earned through managing or holding of assets for customers and executing transactions or providing related services.
Approximately 90 percent of fiduciary and asset management revenue is primarily based on the fair value of assets. Rates applied to asset values vary based on the
nature of the relationship. Fiduciary relationships and managed asset relationships generally have higher fee rates than non-fiduciary and/or managed relationships.
Fiduciary and asset management revenue decreased $3.1 million or 7 percent compared to the first quarter of 2020. The low rate environment has put pressure on
our mutual fund revenue streams. We also had approximately $2.8 million in fee waivers during the first quarter of 2021 that did not exist in the first quarter of
2020. We have voluntarily waived certain administration fees on the Cavanal Hill money market funds in order to maintain positive yields on these funds in the
current short-term interest rate environment. These decreases were partially offset by increased trust and managed account fees from higher client asset balances. A
distribution of assets under management or administration and related fiduciary and asset management revenue follows:

Mortgage banking revenue was consistent with the first quarter of 2020. Mortgage loan production volumes decreased $198 million or 19 percent as average
primary mortgage interest rates began to increase in the first quarter of 2021. The gain on sale margin was 2.98 percent in the first quarter of 2021, 92 basis points
higher than first quarter of 2020.

Mortgage banking revenue decreased $2.2 million or 6 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. While mortgage production volume remained consistent
with prior quarter, mortgage interest rates began to increase and margins compressed. While still elevated, industry-wide capacity constraint is beginning to wane,
which is putting pressure on margin.

Deposit Service Charges and Fees

Deposit service charges and fees decreased $1.9 million compared to the first quarter of 2020.The stimulus programs enacted as a result of the pandemic have led
to customers retaining higher cash balances. This, combined with lower levels of spending during the pandemic, has resulted in decreased overdraft fees compared
to the prior year. Deposit service charges were relatively consistent with the fourth quarter of 2020.

Net gains on other assets, securities and derivatives

Other net losses totaled $3.0 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to other net losses of $10.7 million in the first quarter of 2020 and other net gains of $5.4
million in the fourth quarter of 2020. These fluctuations are primarily related to changes in the fair value of investments related to deferred compensation that are
largely offset in deferred compensation expense. The first quarter of 2021 included a $3.6 million impairment of a merchant banking investment. The first quarter
of 2020 included a $3.1 million impairment of an energy fund investment.

As discussed in the Market Risk section following, the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights ("MSRs") changes in response to changes in primary mortgage
loan rates and other assumptions. We attempt to mitigate the earnings volatility caused by changes in the fair value of MSRs by designating certain financial
instruments as an economic hedge. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are generally expected to partially offset changes in the fair value of MSRs.

Historically low mortgage rates in 2020 and early 2021 resulted in a favorable risk profile for our MSRs that supported hedge performance during that time period.
A sharp increase in longer-term interest rates during the first quarter has returned the risk profile of our MSRs to a more balanced profile, as can be seen in Table
25 of the Market Risk section.

Certain percentage increases (decreases) are not meaningful for comparison purposes.

Personnel expense

Personnel expense increased $16.8 million compared to the first quarter of 2020. Incentive compensation increased $15.5 million. Cash based incentive
compensation expense increased $5.8 million, largely attributed to incentives on lending and trading activity. Deferred compensation expense increased $7.9
million; however, this is largely offset by an increase in the value of related investments included in Other gains (losses), net. Employee benefits increased $1.9
million primarily due to increased healthcare costs. Regular compensation was relatively consistent with the first quarter of 2020 as the impact of annual standard
merit increases was dampened by a decrease in the number of employees.

Personnel expense decreased $3.2 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Cash based incentive compensation expense decreased $9.1 million, primarily in
relation to decreased trading activity. Deferred compensation, which is largely offset by a decrease in the value of related investments included in Other gains
(losses), net, decreased $3.4 million. Employee benefits increased $6.4 million as a seasonal increase in payroll taxes and retirement plan expenses was partially
offset by a decrease in employee healthcare costs.

- 10 -

 
Non-personnel operating expense

Non-personnel operating expense decreased $2.8 million compared to the first quarter of 2020. Net losses and expenses on repossessed assets decreased $8.1
million due to a $14.1 million gain on the sale of an equity interest received as part of the workout of a defaulted energy loan, partially offset by additional
operating expenses and a write-down of a repossessed oil and gas property. Business promotion expense decreased $4.1 million primarily related to decreased
travel and entertainment expense due to the pandemic. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $4.7 million in data processing and communications
expense, primarily due to technology project costs, and a $3.4 million increase in mortgage banking costs due to an increase in prepayments.

Non-personnel expense decreased $14.8 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Net losses and expenses of repossessed assets decreased $7.8 million due
to a gain on sale of repossessed oil and gas assets, partially offset by additional expenses and a write-down on repossessed oil and gas properties. Smaller
reductions in expenses in professional fees and services, business promotion, and occupancy and equipment were partially offset by an increase in data processing
and communications expense as we continue to invest in technology. We also made a charitable contribution of $4.0 million in the first quarter of 2021 and a
contribution of $6.0 million in the prior quarter to the BOKF Foundation.

Income Taxes

The effective tax rate was 22.7 percent for the first quarter of 2021, 21.8 percent for the first quarter of 2020 and 22.6 percent for the fourth quarter of
2020. Income tax expense for the first quarter of 2021 decreased $2.8 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, primarily due to the decrease in net income
before tax for the first quarter of 2021.

Lines of Business

We operate three principal lines of business: Commercial Banking, Consumer Banking and Wealth Management. Commercial Banking includes lending, treasury
and cash management services and customer risk management products for small businesses, middle market and larger commercial customers. Commercial
Banking also includes the TransFund EFT network. Consumer Banking includes retail lending and deposit services, lending and deposit services to small business
customers served through our consumer branch network and all mortgage banking activities. Wealth Management provides fiduciary services, private banking
services, insurance and investment advisory services in all markets. Wealth Management also underwrites state and municipal securities and engages in brokerage
and trading activities.

In addition to our lines of business, we have a Funds Management unit. The primary purpose of this unit is to manage our overall liquidity needs and interest rate
risk. Each line of business borrows funds from and provides funds to the Funds Management unit as needed to support their operations. Operating results for Funds
Management and other include the effect of interest rate risk positions and risk management activities, securities gains and losses including impairment charges,
the provision for credit losses in excess of net loans charged off, tax planning strategies and certain executive compensation costs that are not attributed to the lines
of business.

We allocate resources and evaluate the performance of our lines of business using the net direct contribution, which includes the allocation of funds, actual net
credit losses and capital costs. In addition, we measure the performance of our business lines after allocation of certain indirect expenses and taxes based on
statutory rates.

The cost of funds borrowed from the Funds Management unit by the operating lines of business is updated annually at the beginning of the year and transfer priced
at rates that approximate market rates for funds with similar repricing and cash flow characteristics. Market rates are generally based on the applicable LIBOR or
interest rate swap rates, adjusted for prepayment and liquidity risk. This method of transfer-pricing funds that supports assets of the operating lines of business
tends to insulate them from interest rate risk.

- 11 -

The value of funds provided by the operating lines of business to the Funds Management unit is also updated annually at the beginning of the year and is based on
rates that approximate wholesale market rates for funds with similar repricing and cash flow characteristics. Market rates are generally based on LIBOR or interest
rate swap rates. The funds credit formula applied to deposit products with indeterminate maturities is established based on their repricing characteristics reflected
in a combination of the short-term LIBOR rate and a moving average of an intermediate-term swap rate, with an appropriate spread applied to both. Shorter
duration products are weighted towards the short-term LIBOR rate and longer duration products are weighted towards the intermediate-term swap rates. The
expected duration ranges from 30 days for certain rate-sensitive deposits to five years.

Economic capital is assigned to the business units by a capital allocation model that reflects management’s assessment of risk. This model assigns capital based
upon credit, operating, interest rate and other market risk inherent in our business lines and recognizes the diversification benefits among the units. The level of
assigned economic capital is a combination of the risk taken by each business line, based on its actual exposures and calibrated to its own loss history where
possible. Average invested capital includes economic capital and amounts we have invested in the lines of business.

As shown in Table 8, net income attributable to our lines of business decreased $25.3 million compared to the first quarter of 2020. Net interest revenue decreased
by $14.9 million compared to the prior year, primarily driven by lower average outstanding loan balances and lower yields on deposits sold to the Funds
Management unit. Net charge-offs decreased $3.0 million compared to the first quarter of 2020. Other operating revenue decreased by $26.2 million primarily due
to a shift from trading revenue from our agency residential mortgage trading activities to net interest revenue. Operating expense increased $8.5 million compared
to the first quarter of 2020, primarily in Commercial Banking.

Net interest revenue decreased $21.9 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, primarily due to lower loan balances and lower earnings from deposits sold to
the Funds Management unit. Other operating revenue decreased $21.0 million primarily related to a reversion of our agency mortgage trading volumes from
elevated levels experienced in the fourth quarter of 2020 and narrowing margins. Other operating expense decreased $10.4 million.

Net income attributable to our Funds Management unit was impacted by the negative provision for credit losses in the first quarter of 2021, compared to a
provision for credit losses in excess of charge-offs in the first quarter of 2020.

Certain percentage increases (decreases) in non-fees and commissions revenue are not meaningful for comparison purposes based on the nature of the item.

Net interest revenue decreased $21.4 million compared to the first quarter of 2020. Net interest revenue from external sources decreased due to a reduction in loan
volumes and lower loan yields. Net interest expense from internal sources decreased due to the impact of deposit growth, partially offset by lower yields paid for
deposits sold to the Funds Management unit. Net loans charged-off decreased $2.9 million.

Fees and commissions revenue increased $8.4 million or 20 percent while operating expenses increased $6.2 million or 10 percent. An increase in production
revenue from repossessed assets was largely offset by higher operating expenses on those assets. Customer hedging revenue and incentive compensation expense
were also up over the first quarter of 2020.

During first quarter of 2021, a gain of $14.1 million was realized on the sale of an equity interest received as part of the workout of a defaulted energy loan.
Corporate expense allocations increased $3.8 million or 43 percent compared to the prior year primarily due to PPP loan activity.

- 13 -

 
 
The average outstanding balance of loans attributed to Commercial Banking decreased $1.3 billion or 7 percent to $17.5 billion compared to the first quarter of
2020. See the Loans section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition following for additional discussion of changes in commercial and
commercial real estate loans, which are primarily attributed to the Commercial Banking segment. 

Average deposits attributed to Commercial Banking were $16.1 billion for the first quarter of 2021, a $4.2 billion or 35 percent increase over the first quarter of
2020. Continued deposit growth is primarily due to higher balance retention by customers in the current economic environment. See Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital for further discussion of change.

Net interest revenue decreased $12.0 million or 8 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, largely due to a reduction in loan volumes and lower loan yields.
Fees and commissions revenue was relatively consistent with fourth quarter of 2020. Operating expense decreased $1.4 million or 2 percent compared to the fourth
quarter of 2020, primarily due to incentive compensation costs. Net gain on repossessed assets also increased $11.3 million due to the gain on sale of repossessed
oil and gas assets.

Average loan balances decreased $578 million or 3 percent and average customer deposits increased $756 million or 5 percent over the fourth quarter of 2020.

Consumer Banking

Consumer Banking provides retail banking services through four primary distribution channels: traditional branches, the 24-hour ExpressBank call center, Internet
banking and mobile banking. Consumer Banking also conducts mortgage banking activities through offices located outside of our Consumer Banking markets.

Consumer Banking contributed $6.8 million to consolidated net income for the first quarter of 2021, a decrease of $16.9 million compared to the first quarter of
2020. Net interest revenue decreased by $23.0 million.

Certain percentage increases (decreases) in non-fees and commissions revenue are not meaningful for comparison purposes based on the nature of the item.

Net interest revenue from Consumer Banking activities declined by $23.0 million or 52 percent compared to the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to a decrease in
the yield on deposits sold to our Funds Management unit and a decrease in volume of securities held as an economic hedge of our mortgage servicing rights.
Average consumer deposits grew $1.2 billion over the first quarter of 2020 with demand deposit balances increasing $720 million or 34 percent.

Fees and commissions revenue decreased $2.8 million or 5 percent compared to the first quarter of 2020. Mortgage banking revenue was unchanged from the first
quarter of 2020. Production revenue increased due to widened gain on sale margins due to industry-wide capacity constraints. Servicing revenue was lower due to a
decrease in servicing volume. The outstanding principal balance of loans serviced was lower due to increased prepayment rates and the impact of servicing rights
sold last summer. Deposit service charges decreased $2.7 million. The stimulus programs enacted as a result of the pandemic have led to customers retaining
higher cash levels. This, combined with lower spending levels, has decreased overdraft fees compared to the prior year. Operating expense increased $1.9 million
due to increased mortgage banking costs, partially offset by lower personnel expense. Corporate expense allocations were $1.1 million or 11 percent higher than
the prior year.

Changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, net of economic hedges, increased pre-tax net income for the first quarter of 2021 by $4.3 million compared
to a $1.7 million decrease in pre-tax net income in the first quarter of 2020.

Net interest revenue from Consumer Banking activities decreased $9.7 million or 32 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, largely due to lower yields on
deposits sold to our Funds Management unit. Operating revenue decreased $1.4 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. A decrease in mortgage banking
revenue was partially offset by an increase in other income. Operating expense decreased $3.6 million, primarily due to decreases in regular compensation expense,
business promotion expense and mortgage banking costs.

Average consumer loans decreased $17 million or 1 percent. Average deposits increased $88 million or 1 percent.

Wealth Management

Wealth Management contributed $19.4 million to consolidated net income in the first quarter of 2021, a decrease of $3.2 million or 14 percent compared to the first
quarter of 2020. Revenue attributed to the Wealth Management segment totaled $114.5 million for the first quarter of 2021, a $2.3 million or 2 percent decrease
compared to the first quarter of 2020. Revenue from our agency mortgage trading activities grew by $5.2 million or 15 percent over the prior year. This growth was
offset by lower revenue from deposits sold to our Funds Management unit, loan yields and decreased fiduciary and asset management revenue.

Net interest revenue increased $29.5 million, largely due to growth in U.S. agency mortgage-backed trading volumes. The growth in net interest revenue due to
increased earning assets was muted by a reduction in the value of deposits sold to our Funds Management unit. Fees and commissions revenue decreased $32.2
million. Trading revenue decreased $30.7 million, largely due to a shift in the timing of settlements, which results in more interest revenue, but less fee revenue,
accompanied by margin compression.

Fiduciary and asset management revenue declined $3.2 million related to a combination of lower mutual fund fees and $2.8 million in waived administration fees
on the Cavanal Hill money market funds as a result of the significant decline in short-term interest rates. These were partially offset by increases in trust fees and
managed account fees from high client asset balances.
Operating expense and corporate expense allocations were relatively consistent compared to the first quarter of 2020.

- 17 -

 
 
Average loans attributed to the Wealth Management segment increased $212 million or 12 percent. Average deposits increased $2.1 billion or 27 percent, largely
due to core growth as customers are retaining higher balances in the current economic environment.

Net income for Wealth Management decreased $9.1 million or 32 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Combined net interest revenue and fee revenue
decreased $17.4 million. Net interest revenue was relatively consistent with the previous quarter. However, brokerage and trading revenue decreased $15.0 million
due to narrowing margins and a reduction in trading volumes.

Average loans grew 4 percent to $1.9 billion and average deposits increased $116 million or 1 percent to $9.7 billion.

Financial Condition

Securities

We maintain a securities portfolio to enhance profitability, manage interest rate risk, provide liquidity and comply with regulatory requirements. Securities are
classified as trading, held for investment, or available for sale. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the composition of the securities portfolio
as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

We hold an inventory of trading securities in support of sales to a variety of customers, including banks, corporations, insurance companies, money managers and
others. Trading securities increased $378 million to $5.1 billion during the first quarter of 2021. As discussed in the Market Risk section of this report, trading
activities involve risk of loss from adverse price movement. We mitigate this risk within board-approved limits through the use of derivative contracts, short-sales
and other techniques. These limits remain relatively unchanged from levels set before our expanded trading activities.

At March 31, 2021, the carrying value of investment (held-to-maturity) securities was $226 million, including a $617 thousand allowance for expected credit losses
compared to $245 million at December 31, 2020 with a $688 thousand allowance for expected credit losses. The fair value of investment securities was $253
million at March 31, 2021 and $272 million at December 31, 2020. Investment securities consist primarily of residential mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S.
government agencies, long-term, fixed rate Oklahoma and Texas municipal bonds, and taxable Texas school construction bonds.

Available for sale securities, which may be sold prior to maturity, are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains or losses, net of deferred taxes, are recorded as
accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity. The amortized cost of available for sale securities totaled $13.1 billion at March 31, 2021, a
$510 million increase compared to December 31, 2020. At March 31, 2021, the available for sale securities portfolio consisted primarily of U.S. government
agency residential mortgage-backed securities and U.S. government agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. Both residential and commercial mortgage-
backed securities have credit risk from delinquency or default of the underlying loans. We mitigate this risk by primarily investing in securities issued by U.S.
government agencies. Principal and interest payments on the underlying loans are fully guaranteed. Commercial mortgage-backed securities have prepayment
penalties similar to commercial loans.

A primary risk of holding residential mortgage-backed securities comes from extension during periods of rising interest rates or prepayment during periods of
falling interest rates. We evaluate this risk through extensive modeling of risk both before making an investment and throughout the life of the security. Our best
estimate of the duration of the combined residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio held in investment and available for sale securities at March 31, 2021 is
3.3 years. Management estimates the duration extends to 4.5 years assuming an immediate 200 basis point upward shock. The estimated duration contracts to 2.3
years assuming a 100 basis point decline in the current low rate environment.

Loans

The aggregate loan portfolio before allowance for loan losses totaled $22.5 billion at March 31, 2021, a $474 million decrease compared to December 31, 2020,
primarily due to paydowns in the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios, partially offset by an increase in PPP loans.

Commercial loans represent loans for working capital, facilities acquisition or expansion, purchases of equipment and other needs of commercial customers
primarily located within our geographical footprint. These loans are underwritten individually and represent ongoing relationships based on a thorough knowledge
of the customer, the customer’s industry and market. While commercial loans are generally secured by the customer’s assets including real property, inventory,
accounts receivable, operating equipment, interests in mineral rights and other property and may also include personal guarantees of the owners and related parties,
the primary source of repayment of the loans is the ongoing cash flow from operations of the customer’s business. In addition, revolving lines of credit are
generally governed by a borrowing base. Inherent lending risks are centrally monitored on a continuous basis from underwriting throughout the life of the loan for
compliance with commercial lending policies.

Commercial loans totaled $12.7 billion or 56 percent of the loan portfolio at March 31, 2021, a $420 million decrease compared to December 31, 2020, primarily
due to continued paydowns as borrowers continue to reduce leverage in this time of economic uncertainty.

- 19 -

 
 
Approximately 77 percent of loans in this segment are located within our geographic footprint, based on collateral location. Loans for which the collateral location
is less relevant, such as unsecured loans and reserve-based energy loans are categorized by the borrower's primary operating location. The largest concentration of
loans in this segment outside of our footprint is California, totaling 5 percent of the segment.

Supporting the energy industry with loans to producers and other energy-related entities has been a hallmark of the Company since its founding and represents a
large portion of our commercial loan portfolio. In addition, energy production and related industries have a significant impact on the economy in our primary
markets. Loans collateralized by oil and gas properties are subject to a semi-annual engineering review by our internal staff of petroleum engineers. This review is
used as the basis for developing the expected cash flows supporting the loan amount. The projected cash flows are discounted according to risk characteristics of
the underlying oil and gas properties. Loans are evaluated to demonstrate with reasonable certainty that crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids can be
recovered from known oil and gas reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions at current pricing levels and with existing conventional equipment
and operating methods and costs. As part of our evaluation of credit quality, we analyze rigorous stress tests over a range of commodity prices and take proactive
steps to mitigate risk when appropriate.

Outstanding energy loans totaled $3.2 billion or 14 percent of total loans at March 31, 2021, a $267 million decrease compared to December 31, 2020.
Approximately $2.4 billion of energy loans were to oil and gas producers, a $239 million decrease compared to December 31, 2020. While commodity prices have
continued to improve and stabilize, sourcing new loans sufficient to offset paydowns remains a challenge as existing borrowers continue to reduce leverage. The
majority of this portfolio is first lien, senior secured, reserve-based lending, which we believe is the lowest risk form of energy lending. Approximately 66 percent
of the committed production loans are secured by properties primarily producing oil and 34 percent of the committed production loans are secured by properties
primarily producing natural gas.

Loans to midstream oil and gas companies totaled $648 million at March 31, 2021, a decrease of $52 million compared to December 31, 2020. Loans to borrowers
that provide services to the energy industry totaled $135 million at March 31, 2021, an increase of $26 million. Loans to other energy borrowers, including those
engaged in wholesale or retail energy sales, totaled $34 million, a $1.7 million decrease compared to the prior quarter.

Unfunded energy loan commitments were $2.4 billion at March 31, 2021, a $34 million decrease compared to December 31, 2020.

The healthcare sector of the loan portfolio totaled $3.3 billion or 15 percent of total loans. Healthcare loans decreased $15 million compared to December 31, 2020.
Healthcare sector loans consist primarily of loans for the development and operation of senior housing and care facilities, including independent living, assisted
living and skilled nursing. Generally we loan to borrowers with a portfolio of multiple facilities that serves to help diversify risks specific to a single facility.
Healthcare also includes loans to hospitals and other medical service providers impacted by a deferral of elective procedures. The CARES Act includes multiple
revenue enhancement measures for both hospitals and skilled nursing facilities as they manage through the risks of the virus.
The services sector of the loan portfolio decreased $87 million to $3.4 billion or 15 percent of total loans. Service sector loans consist of a large number of loans to
a variety of businesses, including Native American tribal and state and local governments, Native American tribal casino operations, foundations and not-for-profit
organizations, educational services and specialty trade contractors. Approximately $1.8 billion of the services category is made up of loans with individual
balances of less than $10 million. Services sector loans are generally secured by the assets of the borrower with repayment coming from the cash flows of ongoing
operations of the customer’s business. 

General business loans decreased $51 million to $2.7 billion or 12 percent of total loans. General business loans consist of $1.5 billion of wholesale/retail loans and
$1.2 billion of loans from other commercial industries.

- 20 -

We participate in shared national credits when appropriate to obtain or maintain business relationships with local customers. Shared national credits are defined by
banking regulators as credits of $100 million or more and with three or more non-affiliated banks as participants. At March 31, 2021, the outstanding principal
balance of these loans totaled $3.8 billion, including $1.6 billion of energy loans. Substantially all of these loans are to borrowers with local market
relationships. We serve as the agent lender in approximately 20 percent of our shared national credits, based on dollars committed. We hold shared national credits
to the same standard of analysis and perform the same level of review as internally originated credits. Our lending policies generally avoid loans in which we do
not have the opportunity to maintain or achieve other business relationships with the customer. In addition to management’s quarterly assessment of credit risk,
banking regulators annually review a sample of shared national credits for proper risk grading.

Commercial Real Estate

Commercial real estate represents loans for the construction of buildings or other improvements to real estate and property held by borrowers for investment
purposes generally within our geographical footprint. We require collateral values in excess of the loan amounts, demonstrated cash flows in excess of expected
debt service requirements, equity investment in the project and a portion of the project already sold, leased or permanent financing already secured. The expected
cash flows from all significant new or renewed income producing property commitments are stress tested to reflect the risks in varying interest rates, vacancy rates
and rental rates. As with commercial loans, inherent lending risks are centrally monitored on a continuous basis from underwriting throughout the life of the loan
for compliance with applicable lending policies.

The commercial real estate loan balance as a percentage of our total loan portfolio has ranged from 20 percent to 22 percent over the past five years. The
outstanding balance of commercial real estate loans decreased $195 million compared to December 31, 2020. Multifamily residential loans, our largest exposure in
commercial real estate, decreased $100 million to $1.2 billion at March 31, 2021. Loans secured by other commercial real estate properties decreased $74 million
to $485 million. Loans secured by industrial facilities decreased $21 million to $789 million. Loans secured by retail facilities and office buildings were largely
unchanged compared to December 31, 2020.

Approximately 68 percent of loans in this segment are in our geographic footprint based on collateral location. The largest concentration of loans in this segment
outside our footprint is Utah, totaling 8 percent of the segment, followed by California at 6 percent. All other states represent less than 5 percent individually.

Paycheck Protection Program

We are actively participating in programs initiated by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act"), including the Small Business
Administration's ("SBA") Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP") that began on April 3, 2020. PPP provided fully forgivable loans when utilized for qualified
expenditures, including to help small businesses maintain payrolls during the COVID-19 pandemic. These loans have a contractual term of two years, though most
are expected to be forgiven prior to maturity after completion of a compliance period. Loans are guaranteed and amounts forgiven will be reimbursed to the
Company by the SBA. The loans carry a rate of 1 percent. Interest plus loan fees, which vary depending on loan size, are accrued over the contractual life of the
loan. Any unaccreted origination fees will be recognized when the loan is paid. The pace of forgiveness activity has been slower than initially anticipated.

The Company participated in the current round of PPP, originating $544 million of new PPP loans this quarter, maintaining a focus on our existing client base to
timely support their needs. The newest round of loans has a contractual term of five years, but are expected to be forgiven prior to maturity.

Loans to Individuals

Loans to individuals include residential mortgage and personal loans. Residential mortgage loans provide funds for our customers to purchase or refinance their
primary residence or to borrow against the equity in their home. These loans are secured by a first or second mortgage on the customer's primary residence. These
loans are made in accordance with underwriting policies we believe to be conservative and are fully documented. Loans may be individually underwritten or credit
scored based on size and other criteria. Credit scoring is assessed based on significant credit characteristics including credit history, residential and employment
stability.

In general, we sell the majority of our conforming fixed rate loan originations in the secondary market and retain the majority of our non-conforming and
adjustable-rate mortgage loans. Our mortgage loan portfolio does not include payment option adjustable rate mortgage loans or adjustable rate mortgage loans with
initial rates that are below market. Home equity loans are primarily first-lien and fully amortizing.

Residential mortgage, which includes home equity loans, and personal loans are made in accordance with underwriting policies we believe to be conservative and
are fully documented. Loans may be individually underwritten or credit scored based on size and other criteria. Credit scoring is assessed based on significant
credit characteristics including credit history, residential and employment stability.

Personal loans consist primarily of loans to Wealth Management clients secured by the cash surrender value of insurance policies and marketable securities. It also
includes direct loans secured by and for the purchase of automobiles, recreational and marine equipment as well as unsecured loans.

Approximately 91 percent of the loans in this segment are secured by collateral located within our geographical footprint. Loans for which the collateral location is
less relevant, such as unsecured loans are categorized by the borrower’s primary operating location.

Residential mortgage loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies have limited credit exposure because of the agency guarantee. This amount includes
residential mortgage loans previously sold into GNMA mortgage pools that the Company may repurchase when certain defined delinquency criteria are met.
Because of this repurchase right, the Company is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans and must include them on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet.

The Company secondarily evaluates loan portfolio performance based on the primary geographical market managing the loan. Loans attributed to a geographical
market may not represent the location of the borrower or the collateral. All permanent mortgage loans serviced by our mortgage banking unit and held for
investment by the Company are centrally managed by the Oklahoma market.

Off-Balance Sheet Commitments

We enter into certain off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business as shown in Table 14. Loan commitments may be unconditional obligations
to provide financing or conditional obligations that depend on the borrower’s financial condition, collateral value or other factors. Standby letters of credit are
unconditional commitments to guarantee the performance of our customer to a third party. Since some of these commitments are expected to expire before being
drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.

We have off-balance sheet commitments related to certain residential mortgage loans sold into mortgage-backed securities as part of our mortgage banking
activities. We retain off-balance sheet credit risk related to losses in excess of amounts guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veteran's Affairs ("VA").

We also have off-balance sheet credit risk related to certain residential mortgage loans primarily originated under community development loan programs that were
sold to a U.S. government agency with full recourse prior to 2007. We are obligated to repurchase these loans for the life of these loans in the event of foreclosure
for the unpaid principal and interest at the time of foreclosure. The majority of our conforming fixed rate loan originations are sold in the secondary market and we
only retain repurchase obligations under standard underwriting representations and warranties.

We offer programs that permit our customers to hedge various risks, including fluctuations in energy, cattle and other agricultural product prices, interest rates and
foreign exchange rates. Each of these programs work essentially the same way. Derivative contracts are executed between the customers and the
Company. Offsetting contracts are executed between the Company and selected counterparties to minimize market risk due to changes in commodity prices,
interest rates or foreign exchange rates. The counterparty contracts are identical to the customer contracts, except for a fixed pricing spread or a fee paid to us as
compensation for administrative costs, credit risk and profit.

The customer derivative programs create credit risk for potential amounts due to the Company from our customers and from the counterparties. Customer credit
risk is monitored through existing credit policies and procedures. The effects of changes in commodity prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates are evaluated
across a range of possible scenarios to determine the maximum exposure we are willing to have individually to any customer. Customers may also be required to
provide cash margin or other collateral in conjunction with our credit agreements to further limit our credit risk.

Counterparty credit risk is evaluated through existing policies and procedures. This evaluation considers the total relationship between BOK Financial and each of
the counterparties. Individual limits are established by management, approved by Credit Administration and reviewed by the Asset/Liability Committee. Margin
collateral is required if the exposure between the Company and any counterparty exceeds established limits. Based on declines in the counterparties’ credit ratings,
these limits may be reduced and additional margin collateral may be required.

A deterioration of the credit standing of one or more of the customers or counterparties to these contracts may result in BOK Financial recognizing a loss as the fair
value of the affected contracts may no longer move in tandem with the offsetting contracts. This occurs if the credit standing of the customer or counterparty
deteriorated such that either the fair value of underlying collateral no longer supported the contract or the customer or the counterparty’s ability to provide margin
collateral was impaired. Credit losses on customer derivatives reduce brokerage and trading revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

- 24 -

 
 
Derivative contracts are carried at fair value. At March 31, 2021, the net fair values of derivative contracts, before consideration of cash margin, reported as assets
under these programs totaled $880 million compared to $625 million at December 31, 2020. At March 31, 2021, the net fair value of our derivative contracts
included $466 million for energy contracts, $343 million for foreign exchange contracts and $70 million for interest rate swaps. The aggregate net fair value of
derivative contracts, before consideration of cash margin, held under these programs reported as liabilities totaled $865 million at March 31, 2021 and $600 million
at December 31, 2020.

At March 31, 2021, total derivative assets were reduced by $840 thousand of cash collateral received from counterparties and total derivative liabilities were
reduced by $504 million of cash collateral paid to counterparties related to instruments executed with the same counterparty under a master netting agreement.

A table showing the notional and fair value of derivative assets and liabilities on both a gross and net basis is presented in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

The fair value of derivative contracts reported as assets under these programs, net of cash margin held by the Company, by category of debtor at March 31, 2021
follows in Table 15.

At March 31, 2021, our largest derivative exposure was to a customer for an energy contract of $56 million.

Our customer derivative program also introduces liquidity and capital risk. We are required to provide cash margin to certain counterparties when the net negative
fair value of the contracts exceeds established limits. Also, changes in commodity prices affect the amount of regulatory capital we are required to hold as support
for the fair value of our derivative assets. These risks are modeled as part of the management of these programs. Based on current prices, a decrease in market
prices equivalent to $47.17 per barrel of oil would decrease the fair value of derivative assets by $230 million, with dealer counterparties comprising the bulk of the
assets. An increase in prices equivalent to $73.93 per barrel of oil would increase the fair value of derivative assets by $711 million as margin received falls faster
than the asset values. Liquidity requirements of this program may also be affected by our credit rating. At March 31, 2021, a decrease in our credit rating to below
investment grade would increase our obligation to post cash margin on existing contracts by approximately $10 million. The fair value of our to-be-announced
residential mortgage-backed securities and interest rate swap derivative contracts is affected by changes in interest rates. Based on our assessment as of March 31,
2021, changes in interest rates would not materially impact regulatory capital or liquidity needed to support this portion of our customer derivative program.

Allowance for Loan Losses and Accrual for Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk from Unfunded Loan Commitments

Expected credit losses on assets carried at amortized cost are recognized over their expected lives based on models that measure the probability of default and loss
given default over a 12-month reasonable and supportable forecast period. Models incorporate base case, downside and upside macroeconomic variables such as
real gross domestic product ("GDP") growth, civilian unemployment rate and West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") oil prices on a probability weighted basis. See
Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of methodology of allowance for loan losses.

A $25.0 million negative provision for credit losses was recorded the first quarter of 2021. Changes in our reasonable and supportable forecasts of macroeconomic
variables, primarily due to an improved economic outlook related to the anticipated impact of the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, and other assumptions, resulted
in a $31.1 million decrease in the allowance for credit losses from lending activities. Changes in the loan portfolio characteristics, including specific impairment
and losses, loan balances and risk grading resulted in a $5.2 million increase in the allowance for credit losses from lending activities.

- 27 -

Our reasonable and supportable forecast of macroeconomic variables are significantly influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic developments and related
government stimulus policies, which remain highly uncertain. A summary of macroeconomic variables considered in developing our estimate of expected credit
losses at March 31, 2021 follows:

Trajectory of COVID-19 pandemic worsens
as country experiences additional surges
stemming from new virus strains; hotspots
emerge throughout the second and third
quarter of 2021 resulting in state/regional
shutdowns, though a nation-wide shutdown is
not re-implemented. The pace of vaccine
distribution slows from current levels with
widespread vaccination in the U.S. by the end
of 2021.
Deteriorated COVID-19 situation, slow
vaccine distribution and lack of additional
fiscal stimulus in 2021 cause the economy to
fall back into recession. GDP does not
recover to pre-COVID-19 levels until second
quarter of 2022.

Net charge-offs and changes in specific impairments attributed to certain credits required a $12.1 million provision during the first quarter of 2021. This provision
was partially offset by a decrease in allowance related to lower outstanding loan balances. There was a slight increase in the provision for credit losses related to
risk grading during the quarter. A summary of outstanding loan balances by risk grade is included in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Non-pass
grade loans include other loans especially mentioned, defined by regulatory guidelines as loans that are currently performing in compliance with original terms but
may have a potential weakness that deserves management’s close attention, accruing substandard loans, and nonaccruing loans. Non-pass grade loans totaled $860
million at March 31, a $164 million decrease from December 31. Non-pass graded loans were primarily composed of $524 million or 16 percent of energy loans,
$108 million or 3 percent of services loans, $76 million or 3 percent of general business loans and $60 million or 1 percent of commercial real state loans.

The allowance for loan losses totaled $352 million or 1.56 percent of outstanding loans and 170 percent of nonaccruing loans at March 31, 2021, excluding
residential mortgage loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. The combined allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from
unfunded loan commitments was $385 million or 1.71 percent of outstanding loans and 186 percent of nonaccruing loans at March 31, 2021. Excluding PPP loans,
the allowance for loan losses was 1.70 percent of outstanding loans and the combined allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from
unfunded loan commitments was 1.86 percent.

The allowance for credit losses attributed to energy was 3.29 percent of outstanding energy loans at March 31. Our semi-annual borrowing base redeterminations
during the fourth quarter of 2020 were based on forward pricing curves that existed at that time, which resulted in credit quality migration at that time. While
forward prices subsequently improved, the pricing environment remains fragile and tied to the continued economic recovery from the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic. We believe the duration of the downturn is a more significant factor affecting performance than the level of prices.

The company recorded a $6.5 million negative provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter of 2020. The allowance for loan losses was $389 million or 1.69
percent of outstanding loans and 171 percent of nonaccruing loans, excluding loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies at December 31, 2020. The combined
allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments was $426 million or 1.85 percent of outstanding loans and
188 percent of nonaccruing loans. Excluding PPP loans, the allowance for loan losses was 1.82 percent of outstanding loans and the combined allowance for loan
losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments was 2.00 percent.

Net Loans Charged Off

Net charge-offs of commercial loans were $13.7 million in the first quarter of 2021, primarily related to two energy production borrowers. Net commercial real
estate loan charge-offs were $233 thousand and net charge-offs of loans to individuals were $566 thousand. Net charge-offs of loans to individuals include deposit
account overdraft losses.

Accrual for Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk Associated with Mortgage Banking Activities

The accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk associated with mortgage banking activities includes consideration of credit risk related to certain residential mortgage
loans sold into mortgage-backed securities in excess of amounts guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veteran's Affairs ("VA") and mortgage loans originated
under community development loan programs that were sold to a U.S. government agency with full recourse.

We use publicly available long-term national data to estimate total loss given default for our off-balance sheet credit risk related to losses in excess of amounts
guaranteed by the VA. This result is combined with probability of default output from our mortgage servicing rights model to estimate total expected loss. Then,
we estimate the VA's guarantee percentage to determine our portion of the credit risk. Qualitative adjustment may be used, if necessary.

Allowance for Credit Losses Related to Held-to-Maturity (Investment) Securities

The expected credit losses principles apply to all financial assets measured at cost, including our held-to-maturity (investment) debt securities portfolio. Our
investment portfolio includes municipal and other tax-exempt securities and other debt securities. Expected credit losses for these assets is based on probability of
default and loss given default assumptions that align with similarly graded loans. Qualitative adjustment may be used, if necessary.

Nonperforming Assets

As more fully described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, loans are generally classified as nonaccruing when it becomes probable that we will
not collect the full contractual principal and interest. Accruing renegotiated loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies represent residential mortgage loans
that have been modified in troubled debt restructurings. Interest continues to accrue based on the modified terms of the loan and loans may be sold once they
become eligible according to U.S. government agency guidelines. Real estate and other repossessed assets are assets acquired in partial or total forgiveness of
loans. The assets are carried at the lower of cost as determined by fair value at the date of foreclosure or current fair value, less estimated selling costs. A summary
of nonperforming assets follows in Table 17:

Excluding assets guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, nonperforming assets decreased $39 million from December 31, 2020, primarily due to a $23 million
decrease in nonaccruing energy loans and a $20 million decrease in real estate and other repossessed assets. Newly identified nonaccruing loans totaled $25
million, offset by $26 million of payments and $17 million of charge-offs. The Company generally retains nonperforming assets to maximize potential recovery,
which may cause future nonperforming assets to decrease more slowly.

We foreclose on loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies in accordance with agency guidelines. Generally these loans are not eligible for modification
programs or have failed to comply with modified loan terms. Principal is guaranteed by agencies of the U.S. government, subject to limitations and credit risk is
limited. At foreclosure, these amounts are transferred to claims receivable accounts. These properties will be conveyed to the agencies once applicable criteria have
been met. 

Real Estate and Other Repossessed Assets

Real estate and other repossessed assets totaled $71 million at March 31, 2021, composed primarily of $48 million of oil and gas properties, including a
consolidated limited liability corporation that is 60% owned by the Company and 40% owned by an unrelated financial institution. The remaining balance of real
estate and repossessed assets included $18 million of developed commercial real estate, $2.4 million of undeveloped land primarily zoned for commercial
development, $1.7 million of equipment and $498 thousand of 1-4 family residential properties. Real estate and other repossessed assets totaled $91 million at
December 31, 2020. The decrease compared to December 31 was primarily due to the sale of certain repossessed oil and gas properties.

Liquidity and Capital

Based on the average balances for the first quarter of 2021, approximately 73 percent of our funding was provided by deposit accounts, 12 percent from borrowed
funds, less than 1 percent from long-term subordinated debt and 10 percent from equity. Our funding sources, which primarily include deposits and borrowings
from the Federal Home Loan Banks and other banks, provide adequate liquidity to meet our operating needs.

Subsidiary Bank

Deposits and borrowed funds are the primary sources of liquidity for BOKF, NA, the wholly owned subsidiary bank of BOK Financial. We compete for retail and
commercial deposits by offering a broad range of products and services and focusing on customer convenience. Retail deposit growth is supported through
personal and small business checking, online bill paying services, mobile banking services, an extensive network of branch locations and ATMs and our
ExpressBank call center. Commercial deposit growth is supported by offering treasury management and lockbox services. We also acquire brokered deposits when
the cost of funds is advantageous to other funding sources.

Average deposits for the first quarter of 2021 totaled $36.5 billion, a $1.0 billion increase over the fourth quarter of 2020. Continued deposit growth was primarily
due to customers maintaining higher balances in the current economic environment, supplemented by inflows from government stimulus payments. Interest-
bearing transaction account balances increased $715 million. Demand deposits increased $177 million while certificate of deposit balances increased $56 million.

Average Commercial Banking deposit balances increased $756 million over the fourth quarter of 2020. Interest-bearing transaction account balances increased
$472 million. Demand deposit balances were up $134 million. Time deposits increased $152 million compared to the prior quarter. Commercial customers
continue to retain large cash reserves primarily due to a combination of factors including uncertainty about the economic environment and potential for growth,
lack of preferable liquid alternatives and a desire to minimize deposit service charges through the earnings credit. The earnings credit is a non-cash method that
enables commercial customers to offset deposit service charges based on account balances. Commercial deposit balances may decrease as the economic outlook
improves and if short-term rates move higher, enhancing their investment alternatives.

Average Consumer Banking deposit balances increased $88 million over the prior quarter. A $64 million increase in interest-bearing transaction deposit balances
and a $52 million increase in savings account balances were partially offset by a $31 million decrease in time deposit balances. Demand deposit balances were
largely unchanged compared to the prior quarter.

Average Wealth Management deposits increased $116 million over the fourth quarter of 2020, primarily due to interest-bearing transaction accounts. Demand
deposit balances were also up, offset by lower time deposit balances.

Average time deposits for the first quarter of 2021 included $91 million of brokered deposits, an $8.4 million increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.
Average interest-bearing transaction accounts for the first quarter included $2.3 billion of brokered deposits, a $37 million decrease compared to the fourth quarter
of 2020.

In addition to deposits, liquidity is provided primarily by federal funds purchased, securities repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank
borrowings. Federal funds purchased consist primarily of unsecured, overnight funds acquired from other financial institutions. Funds are primarily purchased from
bankers’ banks and Federal Home Loan banks from across the country. The Company has no wholesale federal funds purchased at March 31, 2021. Securities
repurchase agreements generally mature within 90 days and are secured by certain available for sale and trading securities. Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings
are generally short-term and are secured by a blanket pledge of eligible collateral (generally unencumbered U.S. Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities,
1-4 family residential mortgage loans, multifamily and other qualifying commercial real estate loans). Amounts borrowed from the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Topeka averaged $1.8 billion during the quarter, compared to $3.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020.

On April 13, 2020, the banking agencies published an interim final rule which permits banking organizations to exclude from regulatory capital requirements PPP
covered loans pledged to the Federal Reserve's Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility ("PPLF"). The Company initially funded PPP loans from deposits
and Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, but transitioned to the PPLF in June 2020 in order to realize this regulatory capital relief.

At March 31, 2021, the estimated unused credit available to BOKF, NA from collateralized sources was approximately $17.6 billion.

BOKF, NA also has a liability related to the repurchase of certain delinquent residential mortgage loans previously sold in GNMA mortgage pools. Interest is
payable monthly at rates contractually due to investors.

Parent Company

At March 31, 2021, cash and interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents held by the parent company totaled $140 million. The primary sources of liquidity for
BOK Financial are cash on hand and dividends from BOKF, NA. Dividends from the bank are limited by various banking regulations to net profits, as defined, for
the year plus retained profits for the two preceding years. Dividends are further restricted by minimum capital requirements. At March 31, 2021, based upon the
most restrictive limitations as well as management's internal capital policy, BOKF, NA could declare up to $474 million of dividends without regulatory approval.
Dividend constraints may be alleviated through increases in retained earnings, capital issuances or changes in risk weighted assets. Future losses or increases in
required regulatory capital at the bank could affect its ability to pay dividends to the parent company.

Our equity capital at March 31, 2021 was $5.3 billion, a $29 million decrease compared to December 31, 2020. Net income less cash dividends paid increased
equity $110 million during the first quarter of 2021. Changes in interest rates resulted in a $114 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive gain
compared to December 31, 2020. We also repurchased $20 million of common stock during the first quarter of 2021. Capital is managed to maximize long-term
value to the shareholders. Factors considered in managing capital include projections of future earnings including expected benefits from lower federal income tax
rates, asset growth and acquisition strategies, and regulatory and debt covenant requirements. Capital management may include subordinated debt or perpetual
preferred stock issuance, share repurchase and stock and cash dividends.

On April 30, 2019, the board of directors authorized the Company to purchase up to five million common shares, subject to market conditions, securities law and
other regulatory compliance limitations. As of March 31, 2021, 2,233,813 shares have been repurchased under this authorization. The Company repurchased
260,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $77.20 a share in the first quarter of 2021. We view share buybacks opportunistically, but within the
context of maintaining our strong capital position.

BOK Financial and BOKF, NA are subject to various capital requirements administered by federal agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can
result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that could have a material impact on operations. These capital requirements
include quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items. The capital standards are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators.

A summary of minimum capital requirements, including capital conservation buffer follows in Table 22. A bank which falls below these levels, including the
capital conservation buffer, would be subject to regulatory restrictions on capital distributions (including but not limited to dividends and share repurchases) and
executive bonus payments.

In March 2020, in response to the impact on the financial markets by the COVID-19 pandemic, the banking agencies issued an interim final rule permitting
banking organizations that implement CECL the option to delay for two years an estimate of the CECL methodology's effect on regulatory capital, followed by a
three-year transition period. The estimate includes the implementation date adjustment as of January 1, 2020 plus an estimate of the impact of the change for a two
year period following implementation of CECL. We have elected to delay the regulatory capital impact of the transition in accordance with the interim final rule.
Deferral of the impact of CECL added 23 basis points to the Company's Common equity Tier 1 capital at March 31, 2021.

The capital ratios for BOK Financial on a consolidated basis are presented in Table 22.

Capital resources of financial institutions are also regularly measured by the tangible common shareholders’ equity ratio. Tangible common shareholders’ equity is
shareholders’ equity as defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) less intangible assets and equity which does
not benefit common shareholders. Equity that does not benefit common shareholders includes preferred equity. This non-GAAP measure is a valuable indicator of
a financial institution’s capital strength since it eliminates intangible assets from shareholders’ equity and retains the effect of unrealized losses on securities and
other components of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity.

Table 23 provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures with financial measures defined by GAAP.

Pre-provision net revenue is a measure of revenue less expenses, and is calculated before provision for credit losses and income tax expense. This financial
measure is frequently used by investors and analysts to enable them to assess a company's ability to generate earnings to cover credit losses through a credit cycle.
It also provides an additional basis for comparing the results of operations between periods by isolating the impact of the provision for credit losses, which can
vary significantly between periods.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
