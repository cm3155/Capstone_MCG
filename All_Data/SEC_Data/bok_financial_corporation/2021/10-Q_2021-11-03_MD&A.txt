Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Performance Summary

BOK Financial Corporation (“the Company”) reported net income of $188.3 million or $2.74 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2021. Net income was
$154.0 million or $2.19 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2020 and $166.4 million or $2.40 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2021. Continued
improvement in credit quality metrics and lower loan balances coupled with strength in commodity prices and a continued optimistic outlook for growth in gross
domestic product and the labor markets resulted in a $23.0 million negative provision for expected credit losses in the third quarter of 2021. A $35.0 million
negative provision for expected credit losses was recorded in the second quarter of 2021 and no provision for expected credit losses was recorded in the third
quarter of 2020.

Pre-provision net revenue ("PPNR"), a non-GAAP measure, was $219.4 million for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $204.6 million for the third quarter of
2020. A $31.1 million gain on sale of an alternative investment and reduced operating expenses during the third quarter of 2021 were partially offset by a $25.7
million decrease in mortgage banking revenue. PPNR improved $39.5 million over the second quarter of 2021 largely due to growth in much of our fee-based
business, led by brokerage and trading and mortgage banking revenues.

Highlights of the third quarter of 2021 included:

•

•

•

•

•

Net interest revenue totaled $280.2 million, an increase of $8.5 million over the third quarter of 2020. Average earning assets were $43.0 billion for the
third quarter of 2021 compared to $39.6 billion for the third quarter of 2020, largely driven by growth in trading securities. Net interest margin was 2.66
percent for the third quarter of 2021 compared to 2.81 percent for the third quarter of 2020, largely due to a shift in earning asset mix and investment of
cash flows received from maturities in the available for sale securities portfolio at lower current market rates. Net interest revenue was consistent with the
second quarter of 2021. Net interest margin increased 6 basis points.

Fees and commissions revenue totaled $190.4 million, a decrease of $32.4 million compared to the third quarter of 2020. Mortgage banking revenue
decreased $25.7 million due to a combination of lower mortgage production volume and margin compression. Brokerage and trading revenue decreased
$21.6 million, largely due to a shift from trading revenue to net interest revenue on trading securities. These decreases were partially offset by growth in
fiduciary and asset management revenue, operating revenue from repossessed oil and gas assets and deposit service charges. Fees and commissions
revenue increased $21.0 million compared to the second quarter of 2021, including an $11.1 million increase in trading revenue due to higher margin
market opportunities and a $5.1 million increase in customer hedging revenue, primarily attributed to energy customers. Mortgage banking revenue also
increased $5.1 million.

Other operating expense totaled $291.3 million, a decrease of $5.8 million compared to the third quarter of 2020. Personnel expense decreased $4.0
million, due to a reduction in incentive compensation expense. Non-personnel expense decreased $1.8 million compared to the third quarter of 2020 as
lower mortgage banking costs and FDIC insurance expense were largely offset by increased data processing and communications expense and operating
expenses on repossessed oil and gas properties. Operating expense was consistent with the second quarter of 2021 as a $3.8 million increase in personnel
expense was offset by a $3.7 million decrease in non-personnel expense, primarily due to a reduction of expenses related to oil and gas properties sold
during the quarter.

Period-end outstanding loan balances totaled $20.3 billion at September 30, 2021, a decrease of $1.1 billion compared to June 30, 2021. Loans originated
as part of the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP") decreased $586 million to $536 million. The remaining decrease
was primarily attributed to paydowns of commercial energy loans and commercial real estate loans. Average loan balances decreased $1.3 billion
compared to the prior quarter to $20.8 billion.

The combined allowance for credit losses totaled $306 million or 1.54 percent of outstanding loans, excluding PPP loans, at September 30, 2021. The
combined allowance for credit losses was $336 million or 1.66 percent of outstanding loans, excluding PPP loans, at June 30, 2021.

Nonperforming assets not guaranteed by U.S. government agencies decreased $66 million compared to June 30, 2021. Potential problem loans decreased
$51 million while other loans especially mentioned increased $4.6 million. Net charge-offs were $7.8 million or 0.16 percent of average loans on an
annualized basis for the third quarter of 2021, excluding PPP loans. Net charge-offs were 0.26 percent of average loans, excluding PPP loans, over the last
four quarters. Net charge-offs were $15.4 million or 0.30 percent of average loans on an annualized basis for the second quarter of 2021, excluding PPP
loans.

Period-end deposits were $38.5 billion at September 30, 2021, a $1.1 billion increase compared to June 30, 2021. Average deposits increased $344
million, including a $481 million increase in demand deposits and a $137 million decrease in interest bearing deposits. Clients continued to maintain
higher deposit balances during this period of economic uncertainty.

The common equity Tier 1 capital ratio at September 30, 2021 was 12.26 percent. Other regulatory capital ratios were Tier 1 capital ratio, 12.29 percent,
total capital ratio, 13.38 percent, and leverage ratio, 8.77 percent. At June 30, 2021, the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.95 percent, the Tier 1
capital ratio was 12.01 percent, total capital ratio was 13.61 percent, and leverage ratio was 8.58 percent.

The Company repurchased 478,141 shares of common stock at an average price of $85.00 per share in the third quarter of 2021 and 492,994 shares at an
average price of $88.84 in the second quarter of 2021. We view share buybacks opportunistically, but within the context of maintaining our strong capital
position.

On August 23, 2021, the Company exercised its option to redeem all $150 million of its 5.375 percent Subordinated Notes using existing capital. The
repayment of the Notes resulted in a realized loss on extinguishment of debt of $5.2 million. Redemption of the Notes will reduce annual interest expense
by approximately $8.0 million.

The Company paid a regular cash dividend of $35.7 million or $0.52 per common share during the third quarter of 2021. On November 2, 2021, the board
of directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.53 per common share payable on or about November 24, 2021 to shareholders of
record as of November 15, 2021.

Results of Operations

Net Interest Revenue and Net Interest Margin

Net interest revenue is the interest earned on debt securities, loans and other interest-earning assets less interest paid for interest-bearing deposits and other
borrowings. The net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax-equivalent net interest revenue by average interest-earning assets. Net interest spread is the
difference between the average rate earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is typically greater
than net interest spread due to interest income earned on assets funded by non-interest bearing liabilities such as demand deposits and equity.

Tax-equivalent net interest revenue totaled $282.4 million for the third quarter of 2021 and $274.2 million for the third quarter of 2020. Net interest revenue
increased $4.0 million from growth in average earning assets and $4.2 million from changes in interest rates. Table 1 shows the effect on net interest revenue from
changes in average balances and interest rates for various types of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.

Net interest margin was 2.66 percent for the third quarter of 2021, compared to 2.81 percent for the third quarter of 2020. The tax-equivalent yield on earning
assets was 2.78 percent, a decrease of 26 basis points. The available for sale securities portfolio yield decreased 31 basis points to 1.80 percent as principal cash
flows received from maturities of the available for sale securities portfolio continue to be reinvested at lower current market rates. Loan yields increased 8 basis
points to 3.68 percent, largely due to increased non-use fees related to lower credit line utilization. As discussed in the Management's Discussion and Analysis -
Loan section following, $15.1 million of deferred PPP loans fees remain to be recognized in future periods. The yield on trading securities increased 12 basis
points to 2.04 percent. The yield on fair value option securities was up 70 basis points to 2.62 percent.

Funding costs decreased 12 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2020. The cost of other borrowed funds decreased 1 basis point and the cost of interest-
bearing deposits decreased 13 basis points. The benefit to net interest margin from earning assets funded by non-interest bearing liabilities was 7 basis points for
the third quarter of 2021, a decrease of 1 basis point compared to the third quarter of 2020.
Average earning assets for the third quarter of 2021 increased $3.3 billion or 8 percent over the third quarter of 2020. This increase was largely due to growth in
our trading of U.S. government issued mortgage-backed securities and the expansion of the available for sale securities portfolio, partially offset by a decrease in
loans and fair value option securities. Average trading securities increased $5.8 billion. The average balance of available for sale securities, which consists largely
of residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, increased $865 million. We purchase securities to supplement
earnings and to manage interest rate risk. Average loans, net of allowance for loan losses, decreased $3.3 billion, largely due to purposeful deleveraging by our
customers as borrowers continue to pay down during this time of economic uncertainty combined with the reduction in PPP loans. Fair value option securities that
we hold as an economic hedge against changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights decreased $331 million.

Average deposits increased $3.2 billion compared to the third quarter of 2020. Deposit growth is largely due to customers retaining elevated balances in the current
economic environment, supplemented by the most recent government stimulus payments. Interest-bearing deposits increased $1.5 billion while demand deposit
balances increased $1.7 billion. Other borrowed funds decreased $2.2 billion.

Tax-equivalent net interest revenue was $282.4 million, largely unchanged compared to the second quarter of 2021. Net interest margin was 2.66 percent compared
to 2.60 percent in the second quarter of 2021.

Average earning assets decreased $892 million compared to the second quarter of 2021. Average loan balances decreased $1.3 billion, primarily from the payoff of
PPP loans combined with energy and commercial real estate loan paydowns. Available for sale securities increased $203 million. Average trading securities grew
by $187 million. Other borrowed funds decreased $1.4 billion.

The yield on average earning assets was 2.78 percent, a 3 basis point increase from the prior quarter. The loan portfolio yield increased 14 basis points to 3.68
percent, largely due to non-use fees related to lower credit line utilization. The yield on the available for sale securities portfolio decreased 5 basis points to 1.80
percent.

Funding costs were 0.19 percent, down 2 basis points. The cost of interest bearing deposits decreased 1 basis point to 0.13 percent. The cost of other borrowed
funds was down 2 basis points to 0.30 percent. The cost of subordinated debentures decreased 24 basis points due to the redemption of $150 million in the third
quarter. The benefit to net interest margin from assets funded by non-interest liabilities was 7 basis points for the third quarter of 2021, an increase of 1 basis point
compared to the prior quarter.

Our overall objective is to manage the Company’s balance sheet to be relatively neutral to changes in interest rates as is further described in the Market Risk
section of this report. Approximately 74% of our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios are either variable rate or fixed rate that will reprice within
one year. These loans are funded primarily by deposit accounts that are either non-interest bearing, or that reprice more slowly than the loans. The result is a
balance sheet that would be asset sensitive, which means that assets generally reprice more quickly than liabilities. One of the strategies that we use to manage
toward a relative rate-neutral position is to purchase fixed rate residential mortgage-backed securities issued primarily by U.S. government agencies and fund them
with market-rate-sensitive liabilities. The liability-sensitive nature of this strategy provides an offset to the asset-sensitive characteristics of our loan portfolio. We
also may use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risk. 

The effectiveness of these strategies is reflected in the overall change in net interest revenue due to changes in interest rates as shown in Table 1 and in the interest
rate sensitivity projections as shown in the Market Risk section of this report.

Other Operating Revenue

Other operating revenue was $229.8 million for the third quarter of 2021, consistent with the third quarter of 2020. Mortgage production revenue was negatively
impacted by a decline in mortgage production volumes and margin compression. Brokerage and trading revenue decreased, largely due to a shift from trading
revenue to interest income from trading securities.

Other operating revenue increased $38.4 million compared to the second quarter of 2021. Higher margin market opportunities and increased customer hedging
combined to grow brokerage and trading revenue by $18.5 million. Other gains, net, which consist primarily of gains and losses on repossessed assets and
alternative investments, increased $14.6 million over the previous quarter. A gain on sale of an alternative investment was partially offset by subordinated debt
extinguishment costs and a loss on the sale of a repossessed oil and gas property.

Certain percentage increases (decreases) in non-fees and commissions revenue are not meaningful for comparison purposes based on the nature of the item.

Fees and commissions revenue

Diversified sources of fees and commissions revenue are a significant part of our business strategy and represented 40 percent of total revenue for the third quarter
of 2021, excluding provision for credit losses and gains and losses on other assets, securities and derivatives and the change in the fair value of mortgage servicing
rights. We believe that a variety of fee revenue sources provides an offset to changes in interest rates, values in the equity markets, commodity prices and consumer
spending, all of which can be volatile. As an example of this strength, many of the economic factors such as rising interest rates resulting in growth in net interest
revenue or fiduciary and asset management revenue may also decrease mortgage banking production volumes and related trading. We expect growth in other
operating revenue to come through offering new products and services and by further development of our presence in other markets. However, current and future
economic conditions, including the recent impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory constraints, increased competition and saturation in our existing markets
could affect the rate of future increases.

Brokerage and Trading Revenue

Brokerage and trading revenue, which includes revenues from trading, customer hedging, retail brokerage and investment banking, decreased $21.6 million or 31
percent compared to the third quarter of 2020.

- 5 -

 
 
Trading revenue includes net realized and unrealized gains and losses primarily related to sales of residential mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by U.S.
government agencies and related derivative instruments that enable our mortgage banking customers to manage their production risk. Trading revenue also
includes net realized and unrealized gains and losses on municipal securities and other financial instruments that we sell to institutional customers, along with
changes in the fair value of financial instruments we hold as economic hedges against market risk of our trading securities. Trading revenue was $24.1 million for
the third quarter of 2021, a $22.8 million or 49 percent decrease compared to the third quarter of 2020, primarily due to a shift from fee revenue to net interest
revenue on trading securities. See additional discussion in "Lines of Business" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis.

Customer hedging revenue is based primarily on realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of derivative contracts held for customer risk management
programs. As more fully discussed under Customer Derivative Programs in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, we offer commodity, interest rate,
foreign exchange and equity derivatives to our customers. Customer hedging revenue totaled $6.9 million for the third quarter of 2021, a $1.7 million or 20 percent
decrease compared to the third quarter of 2020, primarily attributed to energy customers. Customer hedging revenue includes credit valuation adjustments of the
fair value of derivatives to reflect the risk of counterparty default.

Revenue earned from retail brokerage transactions totaled $4.9 million for the third quarter of 2021, an increase of $1.1 million compared to the third quarter of
2020 due to increased trading activity.

Investment banking, which includes fees earned upon completion of underwriting, financial advisory services and loan syndication fees, totaled $9.0 million for the
third quarter of 2021, an increase of $1.9 million or 27 percent compared to the third quarter of 2020, related to the timing and volume of completed transactions.

Brokerage and trading revenue increased $18.5 million compared to the previous quarter. Higher margin market opportunities led to an $11.1 million increase in
trading revenue. Customer hedging revenue increased $5.1 million, primarily attributed to energy customers. Investment banking revenue increased $1.9 million,
largely due to the timing of financial advisory fees.

Transaction Card Revenue

Transaction card revenue totaled $24.6 million for the third quarter of 2021, an increase of $1.2 million over the third quarter of 2020, largely due to stimulus
measures and the broader reopening of the U.S. economy. Transaction card revenue for the third quarter of 2021 was relatively consistent with the prior quarter.
Fiduciary and Asset Management Revenue

Fiduciary and asset management revenue is earned through managing or holding of assets for customers and executing transactions or providing related services.
Approximately 90 percent of fiduciary and asset management revenue is primarily based on the fair value of assets. Rates applied to asset values vary based on the
nature of the relationship. Fiduciary relationships and managed asset relationships generally have higher fee rates than non-fiduciary and/or managed relationships.
Fiduciary and asset management revenue increased $5.3 million or 13 percent compared to the third quarter of 2020. An increase in trust and managed account fees
from higher client asset balances was partially offset by a decrease in mutual fund fees as the low rate environment has put pressure on our mutual fund revenue
streams. We had approximately $2.9 million in fee waivers during the third quarter of 2021 compared to approximately $1.7 million in the third quarter of 2020.
We have voluntarily waived certain administration fees on the Cavanal Hill money market funds in order to maintain positive yields on these funds in the current
short-term interest rate environment. Fiduciary and asset management revenue was up slightly compared to the second quarter of 2021 as growth in trust and
managed account fees from higher client asset balances more than offset the decrease from seasonal tax preparation fees earned in the second quarter.

Deposit Service Charges and Fees

Deposit service charges and fees increased $3.1 million compared to the third quarter of 2020 and $1.6 million over the second quarter of 2021. Commercial
accounts where lower earnings credit rates caused by the low interest rate environment have resulted in higher service charges and consumer activity has increased
following the pandemic shut downs.

Mortgage Banking Revenue

Mortgage banking revenue decreased $25.7 million or 49 percent compared to the third quarter of 2020. Mortgage loan production volume decreased $431 million
or 41 percent largely due to industry-wide housing inventory constraints and overall market conditions. Production revenue as a percentage of production volume,
which includes unrealized gains and losses on our mortgage commitment pipeline and related hedges, was 2.50 percent in the third quarter of 2021, 117 basis
points lower than the third quarter of 2020.

Mortgage banking revenue increased $5.1 million or 24 percent over the second quarter of 2021. While mortgage production volume decreased $28 million to
$615 million, production revenue as a percentage of production volume increased 95 basis points.

Other Revenue

Other revenue increased $5.2 million over the third quarter of 2020, primarily due to higher production revenue from repossessed oil and gas properties; however,
this was partially offset by increased operating expenses on these properties. Other revenue decreased $4.3 million compared to the second quarter of 2021 due to
the sale of a repossessed oil and gas property which resulted in lower operating revenue and expenses.

Net gains on other assets, securities and derivatives

Other gains, net increased $29.0 million compared to the third quarter of 2020 and $14.6 million over the second quarter of 2021. The sale of an alternative
investment resulted in a $31.1 million gain, net of non-controlling interest, which was partially offset by a $5.2 million loss on the extinguishment of subordinated
debentures and a $3.9 million loss on the sale of a repossessed oil and gas asset. The prior quarter included net gain on oil and gas repossessed assets.

As discussed in the Market Risk section following, the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights ("MSRs") changes in response to changes in primary mortgage
loan rates and other assumptions. We attempt to mitigate the earnings volatility caused by changes in the fair value of MSRs by designating certain financial
instruments as an economic hedge. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are generally expected to partially offset changes in the fair value of MSRs.

Certain percentage increases (decreases) are not meaningful for comparison purposes.

Personnel expense

Personnel expense decreased $4.0 million compared to the third quarter of 2020. Incentive compensation decreased $4.3 million. Share-based compensation
expense decreased $8.3 million based on changes in assumptions of certain performance-based equity awards. This was partially offset by a $5.0 million increase
in cash based incentive compensation expense related to strong revenue growth. Employee benefits increased $1.2 million primarily due to increased healthcare
costs.

Personnel expense increased $3.8 million over the second quarter of 2021. Cash based incentive compensation expense increased $8.8 million, primarily in relation
to increased trading revenue. Deferred compensation expense, which is largely offset by a decrease in the value of related investments included in Other gains
(losses), net, decreased $2.4 million. Employee benefits expense decreased $3.3 million due to reduced payroll taxes and employee healthcare costs.

- 10 -

 
Non-personnel operating expense

Non-personnel operating expense decreased $1.8 million compared to the third quarter of 2020. Mortgage banking costs decreased $6.8 million, due to a decrease
in accruals related to default servicing and loss mitigation costs on loans serviced for others combined with a decrease in prepayments. Expense associated with
FDIC insurance decreased $2.1 million as the Company's risk profile and liquidity improved. Professional fees and services expense decreased $1.6 million. These
expense decreases were offset by a $3.6 million increase in data processing and communications expense, primarily due to continued investment in technology
upgrades, an increase of $3.1 million in other expense, largely due to operating expenses on repossessed oil and gas properties, and a $2.3 million increase in
business promotion expense.

Non-personnel expense decreased $3.7 million compared to the second quarter of 2021. Other expense decreased $6.8 million as a result of lower operating
expenses on repossessed assets. Mortgage banking costs decreased $2.2 million due to slower repayments. These decreases were partially offset by a $2.2 million
increase in business promotion costs, a $2.0 million increase in data processing and communications expense and a $1.8 million increase in occupancy and
equipment expense.

Income Taxes

The effective tax rate was 22.4 percent for the third quarter of 2021, 24.7 percent for the third quarter of 2020 and 22.5 percent for the second quarter of 2021. The
effective rate for the third quarter of 2020 was higher compared to third quarter of 2021, primarily due to an increase in forecasted pre-tax income for third quarter
of 2020 and the completion of 2019 tax returns. Income tax expense for the third quarter of 2021 increased $5.6 million compared to the second quarter of 2021,
primarily due to the increase in net income before tax for the third quarter of 2021.

Lines of Business

We operate three principal lines of business: Commercial Banking, Consumer Banking and Wealth Management. Commercial Banking includes lending, treasury
and cash management services and customer risk management products for small businesses, middle market and larger commercial customers. Commercial
Banking also includes the TransFund EFT network. Consumer Banking includes retail lending and deposit services, lending and deposit services to small business
customers served through our consumer branch network and all mortgage banking activities. Wealth Management provides fiduciary services, private banking
services, insurance and investment advisory services in all markets. Wealth Management also underwrites state and municipal securities and engages in brokerage
and trading activities.

In addition to our lines of business, we have a Funds Management unit. The primary purpose of this unit is to manage our overall liquidity needs and interest rate
risk. Each line of business borrows funds from and provides funds to the Funds Management unit as needed to support their operations. Operating results for Funds
Management and other include the effect of interest rate risk positions and risk management activities, securities gains and losses including impairment charges,
the provision for credit losses in excess of net loans charged off, tax planning strategies and certain executive compensation costs that are not attributed to the lines
of business.

We allocate resources and evaluate the performance of our lines of business using the net direct contribution, which includes the allocation of funds, actual net
credit losses and capital costs. In addition, we measure the performance of our business lines after allocation of certain indirect expenses and taxes based on
statutory rates.

The cost of funds borrowed from the Funds Management unit by the operating lines of business is updated annually at the beginning of the year and transfer priced
at rates that approximate market rates for funds with similar repricing and cash flow characteristics. Market rates are generally based on the applicable LIBOR or
interest rate swap rates, adjusted for prepayment and liquidity risk. This method of transfer-pricing funds that supports assets of the operating lines of business
tends to insulate them from interest rate risk.

The value of funds provided by the operating lines of business to the Funds Management unit is updated annually at the beginning of the year and is based on rates
that approximate wholesale market rates for funds with similar repricing and cash flow characteristics. Market rates are generally based on LIBOR or interest rate
swap rates. The funds credit formula applied to deposit products with indeterminate maturities is established based on their repricing characteristics reflected in a
combination of the short-term LIBOR rate and a moving average of an intermediate-term swap rate, with an appropriate spread applied to both. Shorter duration
products are weighted towards the short-term LIBOR rate and longer duration products are weighted towards the intermediate-term swap rates. The expected
duration ranges from 30 days for certain rate-sensitive deposits to five years.

- 11 -

Economic capital is assigned to the business units by a capital allocation model that reflects management’s assessment of risk. This model assigns capital based
upon credit, operating, interest rate and other market risk inherent in our business lines and recognizes the diversification benefits among the units. The level of
assigned economic capital is a combination of the risk taken by each business line, based on its actual exposures and calibrated to its own loss history where
possible. Average invested capital includes economic capital and amounts we have invested in the lines of business.

As shown in Table 8, net income attributable to our lines of business increased $23.4 million compared to the third quarter of 2020. Net interest revenue increased
by $10.5 million compared to the prior year, primarily driven by the shift from fee revenue to net interest revenue on trading securities. Net charge-offs decreased
$19.0 million compared to the third quarter of 2020. Other operating revenue increased by $3.8 million. An increase in other gains (losses), net, primarily from the
$31.1 million gain recognized on the sale of an alternative investment, positively impacted other operating revenue. This was partially offset by a $25.6 million
decrease in mortgage banking revenue. Operating expense decreased $3.7 million compared to the third quarter of 2020, mainly from reduced mortgage banking
costs in Consumer Banking.

Net interest revenue increased $8.4 million compared to the second quarter of 2021, primarily due to favorable costs on funds borrowed from the Funds
Management unit. Other operating revenue increased $52.7 million. Growth in our fee-based business, led by brokerage and trading and mortgage banking
revenues, was supplemented by the gain on sale of a merchant banking alternative investment in the third quarter of 2021. Net income attributable to our Funds
Management unit was positively impacted by lower interest rates on the transfer pricing of funds provided by the operating segments.

Certain percentage increases (decreases) in non-fees and commissions revenue are not meaningful for comparison purposes based on the nature of the item.

Net interest revenue decreased $15.8 million compared to the third quarter of 2020, primarily due to reduced loan balances. Net loans charged-off decreased $19.8
million.

Fees and commissions revenue increased $6.4 million or 13 percent while operating expenses increased $1.5 million or 2 percent. An increase in production
revenue from repossessed oil and gas properties of $2.8 million was partially offset by an increase in related operating expenses. Deposit service charges and fees
and transaction card revenues were also up over the third quarter of 2020. Corporate expense allocations increased $6.6 million or 128 percent compared to the
prior year.

The average outstanding balance of loans attributed to Commercial Banking decreased $2.1 billion or 11 percent compared to the third quarter of 2020 to $16.6
billion. See the Loans section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition following for additional discussion of changes in commercial and
commercial real estate loans, which are primarily attributed to the Commercial Banking segment. 

- 13 -

 
 
 
Average deposits attributed to Commercial Banking were $17.9 billion for the third quarter of 2021, a $2.5 billion or 16 percent increase over the third quarter of
2020. Continued deposit growth is primarily due to higher balance retention by customers in the current economic environment. See Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital for further discussion of change.

Net interest revenue increased $3.2 million over the second quarter of 2021, primarily due to favorable yields on deposits sold to our Funds Management unit. Fees
and commissions revenue decreased $6.9 million and operating expense decreased $3.1 million or 4 percent compared to the second quarter of 2021. A decrease in
operating revenue from repossessed oil and gas assets due to the sale of a property was partially offset by a decrease in related operating expenses. The property
sale resulted in a net loss on repossessed assets of $3.9 million in the third quarter of 2021. Net gain (loss) on repossessed assets in the second quarter of 2021
included a $7.3 million gain on sale of repossessed oil and gas assets, partially offset by an impairment of an oil and gas property.

Average loan balances decreased $393 million or 2 percent and average customer deposits increased $832 million or 5 percent over the second quarter of 2021.

Consumer Banking

Consumer Banking provides retail banking services through four primary distribution channels: traditional branches, the 24-hour ExpressBank call center, Internet
banking and mobile banking. Consumer Banking also conducts mortgage banking activities through offices located outside of our Consumer Banking markets.

Consumer Banking contributed $12.4 million to consolidated net income for the third quarter of 2021, a decrease of $14.4 million compared to the third quarter of
2020, largely due to lower mortgage production volumes and compression of production revenue as a percentage of production volume combined with lower
spreads on deposits sold to our Funds Management unit.

Net interest revenue from Consumer Banking activities declined by $5.9 million or 18 percent compared to the third quarter of 2020, primarily due to a decrease in
the spread on deposits sold to our Funds Management unit. Average consumer deposits grew $576 million over the third quarter of 2020 with interest-bearing
transaction deposit balances increasing $378 million or 11 percent and demand deposit balances increasing $193 million or 7 percent.

Fees and commissions revenue decreased $23.6 million or 35 percent compared to the third quarter of 2020. Mortgage banking revenue decreased $25.6 million
due to lower mortgage production volume and compression in production revenue as a percentage of production volume. Deposit service charges increased $1.5
million. Customer spending levels increased with the broader reopening of the U.S. economy, which resulted in increased overdraft fees and check card revenue
compared to the prior year. Operating expense decreased $9.7 million due to a decrease in mortgage banking costs and personnel expense. Corporate expense
allocations were consistent with the third quarter of 2020.

Changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, net of economic hedges, increased pre-tax net income for the third quarter of 2021 by $7.0 million
compared to a $5.0 million increase in pre-tax net income in the third quarter of 2020.

Net interest revenue from Consumer Banking activities increased $2.3 million or 9 percent compared to the second quarter of 2021, mainly due to favorable
spreads on deposits sold to our Funds Management unit. Operating revenue increased $6.7 million compared the second quarter of 2021. While mortgage
production volume decreased $28 million to $615 million, production revenue as a percentage of production volumes increased 95 basis points resulting in a $5.1
million increase in mortgage banking revenues. Operating expense decreased $3.0 million, primarily due to a decrease in mortgage banking costs.

Wealth Management

Wealth Management contributed a record $41.4 million to consolidated net income in the third quarter of 2021, an increase of $10.2 million or 33 percent over the
third quarter of 2020. Revenue attributed to the Wealth Management segment totaled $153.2 million for the third quarter of 2021, an $18.5 million or 14 percent
increase compared to the third quarter of 2020. Growth in agency residential mortgage trading volumes and higher margin market opportunities led to an increase
in trading related revenue.

Combined net interest revenue and fee revenue from our agency mortgage-backed securities trading activities increased by $9.7 million or 14 percent compared to
the prior year. Fiduciary and asset management revenue increased $5.3 million. Growth in trust fees and managed account fees as a result of higher client asset
balances, was partially offset by a combination of lower mutual fund fees and increased fee waivers. Operating expense increased $4.5 million largely due to
higher trading related incentive compensation expense.

Average loans attributed to the Wealth Management segment increased $194 million or 11 percent.

Net income for Wealth Management increased $10.3 million or 33 percent compared to the second quarter of 2021. Combined net interest revenue and fee revenue
increased $22.0 million. Revenue primarily from agency residential mortgage trading activity increased $15.4 million to $77.3 million due to higher margin market
opportunities. Operating expense increased $8.0 million, primarily due to incentive compensation costs related to increased trading activity.

Average loans were consistent compared to the prior quarter and average deposits decreased $575 million or 6 percent.

Financial Condition

Securities

We maintain a securities portfolio to enhance profitability, manage interest rate risk, provide liquidity and comply with regulatory requirements. Securities are
classified as trading, held for investment, or available for sale. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the composition of the securities portfolio
as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

We hold an inventory of trading securities in support of sales to a variety of customers, including banks, corporations, insurance companies, money managers and
others. Trading securities decreased $145 million to $5.6 billion during the third quarter of 2021. As discussed in the Market Risk section of this report, trading
activities involve risk of loss from adverse price movement. We mitigate this risk within board-approved limits through the use of derivative contracts, short-sales
and other techniques. These limits remain relatively unchanged from levels set before our expanded trading activities.

At September 30, 2021, the carrying value of investment (held-to-maturity) securities was $216 million, including a $470 thousand allowance for expected credit
losses compared to $221 million at June 30, 2021 with a $493 thousand allowance for expected credit losses. The fair value of investment securities was $238
million at September 30, 2021 and $246 million at June 30, 2021. Investment securities consist primarily of residential mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S.
government agencies, long-term, fixed rate Oklahoma and Texas municipal bonds, and taxable Texas school construction bonds.

Available for sale securities, which may be sold prior to maturity, are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains or losses, net of deferred taxes, are recorded as
accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity. The amortized cost of available for sale securities totaled $13.1 billion at September 30, 2021, a
$100 million increase compared to June 30, 2021. At September 30, 2021, the available for sale securities portfolio consisted primarily of U.S. government agency
residential mortgage-backed securities and U.S. government agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. Both residential and commercial mortgage-backed
securities have credit risk from delinquency or default of the underlying loans. We mitigate this risk by primarily investing in securities issued by U.S. government
agencies. Principal and interest payments on the underlying loans are fully guaranteed. Commercial mortgage-backed securities have prepayment penalties similar
to commercial loans.

A primary risk of holding residential mortgage-backed securities comes from extension during periods of rising interest rates or prepayment during periods of
falling interest rates. We evaluate this risk through extensive modeling of risk both before making an investment and throughout the life of the security. Our best
estimate of the duration of the combined residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio held in investment and available for sale securities at September 30, 2021
is 3.0 years. Management estimates the duration extends to 4.0 years assuming an immediate 200 basis point upward shock. The estimated duration contracts to 2.0
years assuming a 100 basis point decline in the current low rate environment.

Loans

The aggregate loan portfolio before allowance for loan losses totaled $20.3 billion at September 30, 2021, a $1.1 billion decrease compared to June 30, 2021,
primarily due to a decrease in PPP loan balances and to a lesser extent, paydowns of energy and commercial real estate loans.

Commercial loans represent loans for working capital, facilities acquisition or expansion, purchases of equipment and other needs of commercial customers
primarily located within our geographical footprint. These loans are underwritten individually and represent ongoing relationships based on a thorough knowledge
of the customer, the customer’s industry and market. While commercial loans are generally secured by the customer’s assets including real property, inventory,
accounts receivable, operating equipment, interests in mineral rights and other property and may also include personal guarantees of the owners and related parties,
the primary source of repayment of the loans is the ongoing cash flow from operations of the customer’s business. In addition, revolving lines of credit are
generally governed by a borrowing base. Inherent lending risks are centrally monitored on a continuous basis from underwriting throughout the life of the loan for
compliance with commercial lending policies.

Commercial loans totaled $12.2 billion or 60 percent of the loan portfolio at September 30, 2021, a $298 million decrease compared to June 30, 2021, primarily
due to paydowns in the energy loan portfolio. Services and healthcare loan balances also decreased while general business loans were largely unchanged.

- 19 -

 
 
Approximately 76 percent of loans in this segment are located within our geographic footprint, based on collateral location. Loans for which the collateral location
is less relevant, such as unsecured loans and reserve-based energy loans are categorized by the borrower's primary operating location. The largest concentration of
loans in this segment outside of our footprint is California, totaling 4 percent of the segment.

Supporting the energy industry with loans to producers and other energy-related entities has been a hallmark of the Company since its founding and represents a
large portion of our commercial loan portfolio. In addition, energy production and related industries have a significant impact on the economy in our primary
markets. Loans collateralized by oil and gas properties are subject to a semi-annual engineering review by our internal staff of petroleum engineers. This review is
used as the basis for developing the expected cash flows supporting the loan amount. The projected cash flows are discounted according to risk characteristics of
the underlying oil and gas properties. Loans are evaluated to demonstrate with reasonable certainty that crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids can be
recovered from known oil and gas reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions at current pricing levels and with existing conventional equipment
and operating methods and costs. As part of our evaluation of credit quality, we analyze rigorous stress tests over a range of commodity prices and take proactive
steps to mitigate risk when appropriate.

Outstanding energy loans totaled $2.8 billion or 14 percent of total loans at September 30, 2021, a $197 million decrease compared to June 30, 2021.
Approximately $2.0 billion of energy loans were to oil and gas producers, a $192 million decrease compared to June 30, 2021. While commodity prices have
continued to improve, sourcing new loans sufficient to offset paydowns remains a challenge as existing borrowers continue to reduce leverage. The majority of this
portfolio is first lien, senior secured, reserve-based lending, which we believe is the lowest risk form of energy lending. Approximately 67 percent of the
committed production loans are secured by properties primarily producing oil and 33 percent of the committed production loans are secured by properties primarily
producing natural gas.

Loans to midstream oil and gas companies totaled $613 million at September 30, 2021, a $32 million decrease compared to June 30, 2021. Loans to borrowers that
provide services to the energy industry totaled $129 million at September 30, 2021, an increase of $26 million. Loans to other energy borrowers, including those
engaged in wholesale or retail energy sales, totaled $27 million, largely unchanged compared to the prior quarter.

Unfunded energy loan commitments were $2.8 billion at September 30, 2021, a $109 million increase over June 30, 2021.

The healthcare sector of the loan portfolio totaled $3.3 billion or 16 percent of total loans. Healthcare loans decreased $34 million compared to June 30, 2021,
primarily driven by our senior housing sector. This was partially offset by growth in balances to hospital systems and other medical practices over the prior quarter.
Healthcare sector loans consist primarily of loans for the development and operation of senior housing and care facilities, including independent living, assisted
living and skilled nursing. Generally we loan to borrowers with a portfolio of multiple facilities that serves to help diversify risks specific to a single facility.
The services sector of the loan portfolio totaled $3.3 billion or 16 percent of total loans, a $66 million decrease compared to the prior quarter. Service sector loans
consist of a large number of loans to a variety of businesses, including Native American tribal and state and local governments, Native American tribal casino
operations, foundations and not-for-profit organizations, educational services and specialty trade contractors. Approximately $1.7 billion of the services category is
made up of loans with individual balances of less than $10 million. Services sector loans are generally secured by the assets of the borrower with repayment
coming from the cash flows of ongoing operations of the customer’s business. 

General business loans totaled $2.7 billion or 13 percent of total loans, largely unchanged compared to the prior quarter. General business loans consist of $1.4
billion of wholesale/retail loans and $1.3 billion of loans from other commercial industries.

We participate in shared national credits when appropriate to obtain or maintain business relationships with local customers. Shared national credits are defined by
banking regulators as credits of $100 million or more and with three or more non-affiliated banks as participants. At September 30, 2021, the outstanding principal
balance of these loans totaled $3.5 billion, including $1.4 billion of energy loans. Substantially all of these loans are to borrowers with local market
relationships. We serve as the agent lender in approximately 22 percent of our shared national credits, based on dollars committed. We hold shared national credits
to the same standard of analysis and perform the same level of review as internally originated credits. Our lending policies generally avoid loans in which we do
not have the opportunity to maintain or achieve other business relationships with the customer. In addition to management’s quarterly assessment of credit risk,
banking regulators annually review a sample of shared national credits for proper risk grading.

Commercial Real Estate

Commercial real estate represents loans for the construction of buildings or other improvements to real estate and property held by borrowers for investment
purposes generally within our geographical footprint. We require collateral values in excess of the loan amounts, demonstrated cash flows in excess of expected
debt service requirements, equity investment in the project and a portion of the project already sold, leased or permanent financing already secured. The expected
cash flows from all significant new or renewed income producing property commitments are stress tested to reflect the risks in varying interest rates, vacancy rates
and rental rates. As with commercial loans, inherent lending risks are centrally monitored on a continuous basis from underwriting throughout the life of the loan
for compliance with applicable lending policies.

The commercial real estate loan balance as a percentage of our total loan portfolio has ranged from 20 percent to 22 percent over the past five years. The
outstanding balance of commercial real estate loans decreased $130 million compared to June 30, 2021. Borrowers continue to use this low interest rate
environment to refinance to long-term, non-recourse markets. Multifamily residential loans, decreased $89 million to $876 million at September 30, 2021. Loans
secured by office facilities decreased $43 million to $1.0 billion. Loans secured by other commercial real estate properties decreased $35 million to $435 million.
Loans secured by industrial facilities increased $66 million to $890 million.

Approximately 69 percent of loans in this segment are in our geographic footprint based on collateral location. The largest concentration of loans in this segment
outside our footprint is Utah, totaling 7 percent of the segment, followed by California at 5 percent. All other states represent less than 5 percent individually.

Paycheck Protection Program

We actively participate in programs initiated by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act"), including the Small Business
Administration's ("SBA") Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP") that began on April 3, 2020. PPP provides fully forgivable loans when utilized for qualified
expenditures, including to help small businesses maintain payrolls during the COVID-19 pandemic. These loans have a contractual term of two years, though most
are expected to be forgiven prior to maturity after completion of a compliance period. Loans are guaranteed and amounts forgiven will be reimbursed to the
Company by the SBA. The loans carry a fixed interest rate of 1 percent. Interest plus loan fees, which vary depending on loan size, are accrued over the contractual
life of the loan. Any unaccreted origination fees will be recognized when the loan is paid. The pace of forgiveness activity for the initial rounds of PPP loans has
been slower than initially anticipated. At September 30, 2021, approximately $85 million of PPP loans from the initial rounds remain outstanding, with an
unaccreted origination fee balance of $480 thousand.

The Company also participated in the most recent round of PPP. Approximately $451 million of PPP loans from this round remain outstanding. The newest round
of loans have a fixed interest rate of 1 percent and a contractual term of five years, but are expected to be forgiven prior to maturity. Unaccreted origination fees
related to the 2021 vintage of PPP loans totaled $15 million at September 30, 2021.

Loans to Individuals

Loans to individuals include residential mortgage and personal loans. Residential mortgage loans provide funds for our customers to purchase or refinance their
primary residence or to borrow against the equity in their home. These loans are secured by a first or second mortgage on the customer's primary residence. These
loans are made in accordance with underwriting policies we believe to be conservative and are fully documented. Loans may be individually underwritten or credit
scored based on size and other criteria. Credit scoring is assessed based on significant credit characteristics including credit history, residential and employment
stability.

In general, we sell the majority of our conforming fixed rate loan originations in the secondary market and retain the majority of our non-conforming and
adjustable-rate mortgage loans. Our mortgage loan portfolio does not include payment option adjustable rate mortgage loans or adjustable rate mortgage loans with
initial rates that are below market. Home equity loans are primarily first-lien and fully amortizing.

Residential mortgage, which includes home equity loans, and personal loans are made in accordance with underwriting policies we believe to be conservative and
are fully documented. Loans may be individually underwritten or credit scored based on size and other criteria. Credit scoring is assessed based on significant
credit characteristics including credit history, residential and employment stability.

Personal loans consist primarily of loans to Wealth Management clients secured by the cash surrender value of insurance policies and marketable securities. It also
includes direct loans secured by and for the purchase of automobiles, recreational and marine equipment as well as unsecured loans.

Approximately 91 percent of the loans in this segment are secured by collateral located within our geographical footprint. Loans for which the collateral location is
less relevant, such as unsecured loans are categorized by the borrower’s primary operating location.

Residential mortgage loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies have limited credit exposure because of the agency guarantee. This amount includes
residential mortgage loans previously sold into GNMA mortgage pools that the Company may repurchase when certain defined delinquency criteria are met.
Because of this repurchase right, the Company is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans and must include them on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet.

The Company secondarily evaluates loan portfolio performance based on the primary geographical market managing the loan. Loans attributed to a geographical
market may not represent the location of the borrower or the collateral. All permanent mortgage loans serviced by our mortgage banking unit and held for
investment by the Company are centrally managed by the Oklahoma market.

Off-Balance Sheet Commitments

We enter into certain off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business as shown in Table 14. Loan commitments may be unconditional obligations
to provide financing or conditional obligations that depend on the borrower’s financial condition, collateral value or other factors. Standby letters of credit are
unconditional commitments to guarantee the performance of our customer to a third party. Since some of these commitments are expected to expire before being
drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.

We have off-balance sheet commitments related to certain residential mortgage loans sold into mortgage-backed securities as part of our mortgage banking
activities. We retain off-balance sheet credit risk related to losses in excess of amounts guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veteran's Affairs ("VA").

We also have off-balance sheet credit risk related to certain residential mortgage loans primarily originated under community development loan programs that were
sold to a U.S. government agency with full recourse prior to 2007. We are obligated to repurchase these loans for the life of these loans in the event of foreclosure
for the unpaid principal and interest at the time of foreclosure. The majority of our conforming fixed rate loan originations are sold in the secondary market and we
only retain repurchase obligations under standard underwriting representations and warranties.

We offer programs that permit our customers to hedge various risks, including fluctuations in energy, cattle and other agricultural product prices, interest rates and
foreign exchange rates. Each of these programs work essentially the same way. Derivative contracts are executed between the customers and the
Company. Offsetting contracts are executed between the Company and selected counterparties to minimize market risk due to changes in commodity prices,
interest rates or foreign exchange rates. The counterparty contracts are identical to the customer contracts, except for a fixed pricing spread or a fee paid to us as
compensation for administrative costs, credit risk and profit.

The customer derivative programs create credit risk for potential amounts due to the Company from our customers and from the counterparties. Customer credit
risk is monitored through existing credit policies and procedures. The effects of changes in commodity prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates are evaluated
across a range of possible scenarios to determine the maximum exposure we are willing to have individually to any customer. Customers may also be required to
provide cash margin or other collateral in conjunction with our credit agreements to further limit our credit risk.

Counterparty credit risk is evaluated through existing policies and procedures. This evaluation considers the total relationship between BOK Financial and each of
the counterparties. Individual limits are established by management, approved by Credit Administration and reviewed by the Asset/Liability Committee. Margin
collateral is required if the exposure between the Company and any counterparty exceeds established limits. Based on declines in the counterparties’ credit ratings,
these limits may be reduced and additional margin collateral may be required.

A deterioration of the credit standing of one or more of the customers or counterparties to these contracts may result in BOK Financial recognizing a loss as the fair
value of the affected contracts may no longer move in tandem with the offsetting contracts. This occurs if the credit standing of the customer or counterparty
deteriorated such that either the fair value of underlying collateral no longer supported the contract or the customer or the counterparty’s ability to provide margin
collateral was impaired. Credit losses on customer derivatives reduce brokerage and trading revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Derivative contracts are carried at fair value. At September 30, 2021, the net fair values of derivative contracts, before consideration of cash margin, reported as
assets under these programs totaled $1.7 billion compared to $1.6 billion at June 30, 2021. At September 30, 2021, the net fair value of our derivative contracts
included $1.3 billion for energy contracts, $299 million for foreign exchange contracts and $63 million for interest rate swaps. The aggregate net fair value of
derivative contracts, before consideration of cash margin, held under these programs reported as liabilities totaled $1.7 billion at September 30, 2021 and $1.6
billion at June 30, 2021.

At September 30, 2021, total derivative assets were reduced by $932 thousand of cash collateral received from counterparties and total derivative liabilities were
reduced by $1.2 billion of cash collateral paid to counterparties related to instruments executed with the same counterparty under a master netting agreement.
Derivative contracts executed with customers may be secured by non-cash collateral in conjunction with a credit agreement with that customer, such as proven
producing oil and gas properties. Access to this collateral in event of default is reasonably assured.

A table showing the notional and fair value of derivative assets and liabilities on both a gross and net basis is presented in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

The fair value of derivative contracts reported as assets under these programs, net of cash margin held by the Company, by category of debtor at September 30,
2021 follows in Table 15.

At September 30, 2021, our largest derivative exposure was to an energy customer for $90 million.

Our customer derivative program also introduces liquidity and capital risk. We are required to provide cash margin to certain counterparties when the net negative
fair value of the contracts exceeds established limits. Also, changes in commodity prices affect the amount of regulatory capital we are required to hold as support
for the fair value of our derivative assets. These risks are modeled as part of the management of these programs. Based on current prices, a decrease in market
prices equivalent to $60.83 per barrel of oil would decrease the fair value of derivative assets by $494 million, with energy producers comprising the bulk of the
assets. An increase in prices equivalent to $88.83 per barrel of oil would increase the fair value of derivative assets by $304 million as margin received falls faster
than the asset values. Liquidity requirements of this program may also be affected by our credit rating. At September 30, 2021, a decrease in our credit rating to
below investment grade would increase our obligation to post cash margin on existing contracts by approximately $10 million. The fair value of our to-be-
announced residential mortgage-backed securities and interest rate swap derivative contracts is affected by changes in interest rates. Based on our assessment as of
September 30, 2021, changes in interest rates would not materially impact regulatory capital or liquidity needed to support this portion of our customer derivative
program.

Allowance for Loan Losses and Accrual for Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk from Unfunded Loan Commitments

Expected credit losses on assets carried at amortized cost are recognized over their expected lives based on models that measure the probability of default and loss
given default over a 12-month reasonable and supportable forecast period. Models incorporate base case, downside and upside macroeconomic variables such as
real gross domestic product ("GDP") growth, civilian unemployment rate and West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") oil prices on a probability weighted basis. See
Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of methodology of allowance for loan losses.

A $23.0 million negative provision for credit losses was recorded in the third quarter of 2021. Changes in our reasonable and supportable forecasts of
macroeconomic variables, primarily due to strength in commodity prices and a continued optimistic outlook for growth in gross domestic product and the labor
markets resulted in a $12.3 million decrease in the allowance for credit losses related to lending activities. Changes in loan portfolio characteristics, primarily
related to improving credit quality metrics and lower loan balances resulted in a $10.1 million decrease in the allowance for credit losses related to lending
activities.

- 27 -

The probability weighting of our base case reasonable and supportable forecast decreased to 65 percent in the third quarter of 2021 compared to 70 percent in the
second quarter of 2021 as the level of uncertainty in the current economic outlook worsened slightly. Our reasonable and supportable forecast of macroeconomic
variables is significantly influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic developments, which remains highly uncertain. A summary of macroeconomic variables
considered in developing our estimate of expected credit losses at September 30, 2021 follows:

Increased labor participation, elevated
consumer consumption and the need for
inventory restocking produces above
historical average GDP growth through mid-
2022, but begins to moderate thereafter.

Macro-economic
factors

– GDP is forecasted to grow by 4.1
percent over the next 12 months.

– Civilian unemployment rate of 4.9

percent in the fourth quarter of 2021
improves to 4.5 percent by the third
quarter of 2022.

– WTI oil prices are projected to
generally follow the NYMEX

of September 2021 and are expected
to average $68.38 per barrel over the
next 12 months.

New COVID-19 variants such as the recent
Delta variant continue to emerge and spread
in areas of the country with lower vaccination
rates as the U.S. enters the fall and winter
months. The severity of the situation is
compounded by uncertainty around vaccine
durability and many states/regions are forced
to reinstate restrictions.
Deteriorated COVID-19 situation, slow
vaccine distribution and lack of
Congressional support for additional fiscal
stimulus results in a mild recession with
conditions beginning to improve in the
summer of 2022.

– GDP is forecasted to grow 2.0
percent in the fourth quarter of
2021, then contract in the first and
second quarters of 2022 and return
to growth of 1.0 percent in the third
quarter of 2022.

– Civilian unemployment rate of 5.6

percent in the fourth quarter of 2021
increases in the next two quarters
then levels off at 6.9 percent in the
third quarter of 2022.

– WTI oil prices are projected to

average $54.12 over the next 12
months.

COVID-19 case levels continue to improve
from Delta variant wave as global virus
immunity becomes more widespread and
proves effective against severe virus
outcomes as well as new virus strains.

Increased labor participation, elevated
consumer consumption and the need for
inventory restocking produces above
historical average GDP growth through late
2022, but begins to moderate thereafter.

– GDP is forecasted to grow by 4.8
percent over the next 12 months.

– Civilian unemployment rate of 4.6

percent in the fourth quarter of 2021
improves to 4.0 percent by the third
quarter of 2022.

– WTI oil prices are projected to

average $74.28 per barrel over the
next 12 months.

Net charge-offs and changes in specific impairments attributed to certain credits required a $4.2 million provision during the third quarter of 2021. This provision
was offset primarily by a $5.6 million decrease in allowance related to lower outstanding loan balances. Improved risk grading during the quarter resulted in a $9.6
million decrease in the allowance for lending activities. Significant improvement in energy loans credit risk grading, as well as improvements in risk grading in
services and residential mortgage and commercial real estate loans was partially offset by credit risk grade migration in the healthcare loan portfolio. A summary
of outstanding loan balances by risk grade is included in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Non-pass grade loans include other loans especially
mentioned, defined by regulatory guidelines as loans that are currently performing in compliance with original terms but may have a potential weakness that
deserves management’s close attention, accruing substandard loans, and nonaccruing loans. Non-pass grade loans totaled $568 million at September 30, 2021, an
$84 million decrease compared to June 30. Non-pass graded loans were primarily composed of $242 million or 9 percent of energy loans, $86 million or 3 percent
of services loans, $74 million or 2 percent of healthcare loans, $68 million or 2 percent of commercial real estate loans and $55 million or 2 percent of general
business loans.

The allowance for loan losses totaled $277 million or 1.36 percent of outstanding loans and 208 percent of nonaccruing loans at September 30, 2021, excluding
residential mortgage loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. The combined allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from
unfunded loan commitments was $306 million or 1.50 percent of outstanding loans and 230 percent of nonaccruing loans at September 30, 2021. Excluding PPP
loans, the allowance for loan losses was 1.40 percent of outstanding loans and the combined allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk
from unfunded loan commitments was 1.54 percent.

The allowance for credit losses attributed to energy was 2.51 percent of outstanding energy loans at September 30, 2021. Our semi-annual borrowing base
redeterminations during the second quarter of 2021 were based on forward pricing curves that existed at that time and resulted in improved credit risk grading in
our energy loan portfolio. Although energy prices have continued to improve, the pricing environment remains sensitive and tied to the continued economic
recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors.

The Company recorded a $35.0 million negative provision for credit losses in the second quarter of 2021. The allowance for loan losses was $312 million or 1.46
percent of outstanding loans and 183 percent of nonaccruing loans, excluding loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies at June 30, 2021. The combined
allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments was $336 million or 1.57 percent of outstanding loans and
197 percent of nonaccruing loans. Excluding PPP loans, the allowance for loan losses was 1.54 percent of outstanding loans and the combined allowance for loan
losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments was 1.66 percent.

Net Loans Charged Off

Net charge-offs of commercial loans were $6.1 million in the third quarter of 2021, primarily related to two general business borrowers and a single energy
production borrower. Net commercial real estate loan charge-offs were $1.2 million and net charge-offs of loans to individuals were $474 thousand. Net charge-
offs of loans to individuals include deposit account overdraft losses.

Accrual for Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk Associated with Mortgage Banking Activities

The accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk associated with mortgage banking activities includes consideration of credit risk related to certain residential mortgage
loans sold into mortgage-backed securities in excess of amounts guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veteran's Affairs ("VA") and mortgage loans originated
under community development loan programs that were sold to a U.S. government agency with full recourse.

We use publicly available long-term national data to estimate total loss given default for our off-balance sheet credit risk related to losses in excess of amounts
guaranteed by the VA. This result is combined with probability of default output from our mortgage servicing rights model to estimate total expected loss. Then,
we estimate the VA's guarantee percentage to determine our portion of the credit risk. Qualitative adjustment may be used, if necessary.

Allowance for Credit Losses Related to Held-to-Maturity (Investment) Securities

The expected credit losses principles apply to all financial assets measured at cost, including our held-to-maturity (investment) debt securities portfolio. Our
investment portfolio includes municipal and other tax-exempt securities and other debt securities. Expected credit losses for these assets is based on probability of
default and loss given default assumptions that align with similarly graded loans. Qualitative adjustment may be used, if necessary.

Nonperforming Assets

As more fully described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, loans are generally classified as nonaccruing when it becomes probable that we will
not collect the full contractual principal and interest. Accruing renegotiated loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies represent residential mortgage loans
that have been modified in troubled debt restructurings. Interest continues to accrue based on the modified terms of the loan and loans may be sold once they
become eligible according to U.S. government agency guidelines. Real estate and other repossessed assets are assets acquired in partial or total forgiveness of
loans. The assets are carried at the lower of cost as determined by fair value at the date of foreclosure or current fair value, less estimated selling costs. A summary
of nonperforming assets follows in Table 17:

     Excludes residential mortgages guaranteed by U.S. government agencies.
     Excludes residential mortgage and PPP loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies.

Excluding assets guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, nonperforming assets decreased $66 million from June 30, 2021, primarily due to a $25 million
decrease in nonaccruing energy loans and a $29 million decrease in real estate and other repossessed assets. Newly identified nonaccruing loans totaled $21
million, offset by $42 million of payments and $10 million of charge-offs. The Company generally retains nonperforming assets to maximize potential recovery,
which may cause future nonperforming assets to decrease more slowly.

We foreclose on loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies in accordance with agency guidelines. Generally these loans are not eligible for modification
programs or have failed to comply with modified loan terms. Principal is guaranteed by agencies of the U.S. government, subject to limitations and credit risk is
limited. At foreclosure, these amounts are transferred to claims receivable accounts. These properties will be conveyed to the agencies once applicable criteria have
been met. 

Real Estate and Other Repossessed Assets

Real estate and other repossessed assets totaled $29 million at September 30, 2021, composed primarily of $17 million of developed commercial real estate, $7.1
million of oil and gas properties, $1.9 million of undeveloped land primarily zoned for commercial development and $1.7 million of equipment. Real estate and
other repossessed assets totaled $57 million at June 30, 2021. The decrease compared to June 30 was primarily due to the sale of certain repossessed oil and gas
properties.

Liquidity and Capital

Based on the average balances for the third quarter of 2021, approximately 76 percent of our funding was provided by deposit accounts, 8 percent from borrowed
funds, less than 1 percent from long-term subordinated debt and 11 percent from equity. Our funding sources, which primarily include deposits and borrowings
from the Federal Home Loan Banks and other banks, provide adequate liquidity to meet our operating needs.

Subsidiary Bank

Deposits and borrowed funds are the primary sources of liquidity for BOKF, NA, the wholly owned subsidiary bank of BOK Financial. We compete for retail and
commercial deposits by offering a broad range of products and services and focusing on customer convenience. Retail deposit growth is supported through
personal and small business checking, online bill paying services, mobile banking services, an extensive network of branch locations and ATMs and our
ExpressBank call center. Commercial deposit growth is supported by offering treasury management and lockbox services. We also acquire brokered deposits when
the cost of funds is advantageous to other funding sources.

Average deposits for the third quarter of 2021 totaled $37.8 billion, a $344 million increase over the second quarter of 2021. Continued deposit growth was
primarily due to customers maintaining higher balances in the current economic environment, supplemented by inflows from government stimulus payments.
Demand deposits grew by $481 million and savings account balances were up $15 million. Interest-bearing transaction account balances decreased $55 million
while certificate of deposit balances decreased $97 million.

Average Commercial Banking deposit balances increased $832 million over the second quarter of 2021. Demand deposit balances were up $395 million. Interest-
bearing transaction account balances increased $443 million. Commercial customers continue to retain large cash reserves due to a combination of factors
including uncertainty about the economic environment and potential for growth, lack of preferable liquid alternatives and a desire to minimize deposit service
charges through the earnings credit. The earnings credit is a non-cash method that enables commercial customers to offset deposit service charges based on account
balances. Commercial deposit balances may decrease as the economic outlook improves and if short-term rates move higher, enhancing their investment
alternatives.

Average Consumer Banking deposit balances increased $48 million over the prior quarter. A $58 million increase in interest-bearing transaction deposit balances
and a $14 million increase in savings account balances were partially offset by a $31 million decrease in time deposit balances. Demand deposit balances were
largely unchanged compared to prior quarter.

Average Wealth Management deposits decreased $575 million compared to the second quarter of 2021. A $561 million decrease in interest bearing transaction
accounts and a $58 million decrease in time deposit balances was partially offset by a $43 million increase in demand deposit balances.

Average time deposits for the third quarter of 2021 included $56 million of brokered deposits, a $10 million decrease compared to the second quarter of 2021.
Average interest-bearing transaction accounts for the third quarter included $2.0 billion of brokered deposits, a $48 million increase over the second quarter of
2021.

In addition to deposits, liquidity is provided primarily by federal funds purchased, securities repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank
borrowings. Federal funds purchased consist primarily of unsecured, overnight funds acquired from other financial institutions. Funds are primarily purchased from
bankers’ banks and Federal Home Loan banks from across the country. The Company has no wholesale federal funds purchased at September 30, 2021. Securities
repurchase agreements generally mature within 90 days and are secured by certain available for sale and trading securities. Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings
are generally short-term and are secured by a blanket pledge of eligible collateral (generally unencumbered U.S. Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities,
1-4 family residential mortgage loans, multifamily and other qualifying commercial real estate loans). Amounts borrowed from the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Topeka averaged $1.9 billion during the quarter, compared to $2.1 billion in the second quarter of 2021.

At September 30, 2021, the estimated unused credit available to BOKF, NA from collateralized sources was approximately $17.4 billion.

A summary of other borrowings for BOK Financial on a consolidated basis follows in Table 21.

BOKF, NA also has a liability related to the repurchase of certain delinquent residential mortgage loans previously sold in GNMA mortgage pools. Interest is
payable monthly at rates contractually due to investors.

Parent Company

At September 30, 2021, cash and interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents held by the parent company totaled $159 million. The primary sources of liquidity for
BOK Financial are cash on hand and dividends from BOKF, NA. Dividends from the bank are limited by various banking regulations to net profits, as defined, for
the year plus retained profits for the two preceding years. Dividends are further restricted by minimum capital requirements. At September 30, 2021, based upon
the most restrictive limitations as well as management's internal capital policy, BOKF, NA could declare up to $401 million of dividends without regulatory
approval. Dividend constraints may be alleviated through increases in retained earnings, capital issuances or changes in risk weighted assets. Future losses or
increases in required regulatory capital at the bank could affect its ability to pay dividends to the parent company.

Our equity capital at September 30, 2021 was $5.4 billion, a $42 million increase over June 30, 2021. Net income less cash dividends paid increased equity $153
million during the third quarter of 2021. Changes in interest rates resulted in a $58 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive gain compared to June 30,
2021. We also repurchased $41 million of common stock during the third quarter of 2021. Capital is managed to maximize long-term value to the
shareholders. Factors considered in managing capital include projections of future earnings including expected benefits from lower federal income tax rates, asset
growth and acquisition strategies, and regulatory and debt covenant requirements. Capital management may include subordinated debt or perpetual preferred stock
issuance, share repurchase and stock and cash dividends.

On April 30, 2019, the board of directors authorized the Company to purchase up to five million common shares, subject to market conditions, securities law and
other regulatory compliance limitations. As of September 30, 2021, 3,204,948 shares have been repurchased under this authorization. The Company repurchased
478,141 shares of common stock at an average price of $85.00 a share in the third quarter of 2021. We view share buybacks opportunistically, but within the
context of maintaining our strong capital position.

BOK Financial and BOKF, NA are subject to various capital requirements administered by federal agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can
result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that could have a material impact on operations. These capital requirements
include quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items. The capital standards are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators.

A summary of minimum capital requirements, including capital conservation buffer follows in Table 22. A bank which falls below these levels, including the
capital conservation buffer, would be subject to regulatory restrictions on capital distributions (including but not limited to dividends and share repurchases) and
executive bonus payments.

In March 2020, in response to the impact on the financial markets by the COVID-19 pandemic, the banking agencies issued an interim final rule permitting
banking organizations that implement CECL the option to delay for two years an estimate of the CECL methodology's effect on regulatory capital, followed by a
three-year transition period. The estimate includes the implementation date adjustment as of January 1, 2020 plus an estimate of the impact of the change for a two
year period following implementation of CECL. We have elected to delay the regulatory capital impact of the transition in accordance with the interim final rule.
Deferral of the impact of CECL added 20 basis points to the Company's Common equity Tier 1 capital at September 30, 2021.

The capital ratios for BOK Financial on a consolidated basis are presented in Table 22.

Capital resources of financial institutions are also regularly measured by the tangible common shareholders’ equity ratio. Tangible common shareholders’ equity is
shareholders’ equity as defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) less intangible assets and equity which does
not benefit common shareholders. Equity that does not benefit common shareholders includes preferred equity. This non-GAAP measure is a valuable indicator of
a financial institution’s capital strength since it eliminates intangible assets from shareholders’ equity and retains the effect of unrealized losses on securities and
other components of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity.

Table 23 provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures with financial measures defined by GAAP.

Pre-provision net revenue is a measure of revenue less expenses, and is calculated before provision for credit losses and income tax expense. This financial
measure is frequently used by investors and analysts to enable them to assess a company's ability to generate earnings to cover credit losses through a credit cycle.
It also provides an additional basis for comparing the results of operations between periods by isolating the impact of the provision for credit losses, which can
vary significantly between periods.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the Company’s significant off-balance sheet commitments.
