Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Performance Summary

BOK Financial Corporation (“the Company”) reported net income of $62.1 million or $0.88 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2020. Net income was $110.6
million or $1.54 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2019 and $110.4 million or $1.56 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2019. The Company recorded a
pre-tax provision for expected credit losses of $93.8 million in the first quarter of 2020. Pre-tax provisions for incurred losses of $19.0 million and $8.0 million
were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2019, respectively. The Company adopted the current expected credit loss ("CECL") model on
January 1, 2020.

We incurred $12.7 million of CoBiz integration costs in the first quarter of 2019 resulting in a 13 cent per share reduction. The discussion below excludes the
impact of these costs. Highlights of the first quarter of 2020 included:

COVID-19 Coronavirus Pandemic Response

• We implemented our cross-functional crisis management team led by our Chief Human Resources Officer and Chief Risk Officer. This team has focused

on ensuring employee and customer safety while continuing to meet customer needs. We have implemented social distancing measures within our internal
and external operations. Employees are working from home as able, we have split remaining employees across multiple locations, and we have closed
banking center lobbies and converted to drive-thru and by appointment only.

• We have implemented programs to help our customers through this uncertain time. We are actively participating in programs initiated by the Coronavirus

Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act"), including the Small Business Administration's ("SBA") Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP")
that began on April 3, 2020 and Mortgage Forbearance program. As of April 17, 2020, we have processed approximately 4,700 PPP applications and
currently have SBA approval for $1.8 billion. We have the ability to fund PPP loans through the Federal Reserve's PPP liquidity facility. We are also
evaluating participating in the Main Street Lending Program. We are waiving fees on excessive savings and money market account withdrawals as well as
overdraft protection transfer fees for automatic transfers between linked accounts at BOKF through May 31, 2020. Further, we waived loan payment late
fees on consumer loan payments, mortgage accounts and small business loans in April 2020.

• We have enhanced our benefits to support our employees as they navigate changes in their working environment. We are providing a temporary child care
reimbursement program for those employees that need assistance because of school closures and have also added incremental paid time off hours for
employees. We expanded our telemedicine options to deliver medical and behavioral health services at no cost. Further, we have enacted premium pay for
certain non-exempt employees who must remain in the office.

• We are closely monitoring our loan portfolio for effects related to COVID-19. Exposure to highly affected industries include, but are not limited to, oil

and gas, entertainment and leisure, and senior housing. Energy loan balances comprise 18 percent of total loans, senior housing comprises 11 percent, and
entertainment and leisure comprises approximately 8 percent. While our liquidity remains strong, given the extraordinary impact of the pandemic on the
capital markets, we've taken a number of precautionary measures to ensure it remains so, including enhanced daily monitoring of liquidity by tracking
deposit inflows and outflows by customer, analyzing loan advances by segment, optimizing our borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank, and
increasing our collateral at the Federal Reserve Discount Window, among other things.

Fees and commissions revenue totaled $192.7 million, an increase of $32.2 million over the first quarter of 2019. Brokerage and trading revenue
increased $19.2 million and mortgage banking revenue increased $13.3 million as lower mortgage interest rates have increased mortgage production and
related trading activity. Fees and commissions revenue increased $13.3 million over the fourth quarter of 2019, largely due to increases in brokerage and
trading and mortgage banking revenue.

Other operating expense totaled $268.6 million, a $5.8 million decrease compared to the first quarter of 2019. Personnel expense decreased $9.8 million,
largely due to a decrease in deferred compensation costs. Non-personnel expense increased $4.0 million over the first quarter of 2019, primarily due to
increases in data processing and communications expense and professional fees and services. Operating expense decreased $20.2 million compared to the
fourth quarter of 2019. Personnel expense decreased $12.2 million with a decrease in deferred compensation and incentive compensation partially offset
by a seasonal increase in employee benefits. Non-personnel expense decreased $7.9 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, led by decreases in
mortgage banking and business promotion expenses.

The allowance for loan losses totaled $315 million or 1.40 percent of outstanding loans and 199 percent of nonaccruing loans at March 31, 2020,
excluding residential mortgage loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. The combined allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet
credit risk from unfunded loan commitments was $344 million or 1.53 percent of outstanding loans at March 31, 2020. At December 31, 2019, the
allowance for loan losses was $211 million or 0.97 percent of outstanding loans and 121 percent of nonaccruing loans, excluding loans guaranteed by
U.S. government agencies. The combined allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments was
$212 million or 0.98 percent of outstanding loans.

Nonperforming assets not guaranteed by U.S. government agencies were relatively consistent compared to December 31, 2019. Potential problem loans
increased $132 million while other loans especially mentioned increased $56 million. Net charge-offs were $17.2 million or 0.31 percent of average loans
on an annualized basis for the first quarter of 2020, compared to $12.5 million or 0.22 percent of average loans on an annualized basis for the fourth
quarter of 2019.

Period-end outstanding loan balances totaled $22.5 billion at March 31, 2020, an increase of $713 million over December 31, 2019. Average loan
balances decreased $293 million to $21.9 billion at March 31, 2020.

Period-end deposits were $29.2 billion at March 31, 2020, a $1.6 billion increase compared to December 31, 2019. Interest-bearing transaction deposits
increased $1.2 billion while demand deposit balances increased $360 million. Average deposits increased $1.1 billion, including a $1.5 billion increase in
interest-bearing deposits partially offset by a $380 million decrease in demand deposits. Strong deposit growth was driven by a combination of our
continued focus on growing core customer deposits, inflows from external money funds and seasonal inflows.

The common equity Tier 1 capital ratio at March 31, 2020 was 10.98 percent. Other regulatory capital ratios were Tier 1 capital ratio, 10.98 percent, total
capital ratio, 12.65 percent, and leverage ratio, 8.15 percent. We have elected to implement relief afforded by the CARES Act, which allows us to defer a
portion of the impact to regulatory capital impact resulting from our adoption of CECL over the next two years, followed by a phase out of that deferral
over the following three years. At December 31, 2019, the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.39 percent, the Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.39
percent, total capital ratio was 12.94 percent, and leverage ratio was 8.40 percent.

The company repurchased 442,000 shares at an average price of $75.52 per share in the first quarter of 2020 and 280,000 shares at an average price of
$81.59 in the fourth quarter of 2019. We view share buybacks opportunistically, but within the context of maintaining our strong capital position.

The Company paid a regular cash dividend of $35.9 million or $0.51 per common share during the first quarter of 2020. On April 28, 2020, the board of
directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.51 per common share payable on or about May 27, 2020 to shareholders of record as of May 11, 2020.

Critical Accounting Policies & Estimates

The Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
America (“GAAP”). The Company's accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2019 Form
10-K. Management makes significant assumptions and estimates in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes in
conformity with GAAP that may be highly subjective, complex and subject to variability. Actual results could differ significantly from these assumptions and
estimates. The following discussion represents significant changes to critical accounting policies and estimates during 2020 in the most critical areas where these
assumptions and estimates could affect the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company. Significant changes to critical accounting
policies and estimates have been discussed with the appropriate committees of the Board of Directors.

Allowance for Loan Losses and Accrual for Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk from Loan Commitments

The allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments represent the portion of amortized cost basis of loans
and related unfunded commitments we do not expect to collect over the asset’s contractual life, considering past events, current conditions, as well as reasonable
and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. Determining appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk
from unfunded loan commitments requires management judgment about effects of uncertain matters, resulting in a subjective calculation which contains a certain
amount of imprecision. Because of the subjective forward-looking nature of the calculation, changes in these measures may not directly correlate with actual
economic events. In future periods, management judgment may consider new or changed information which may cause significant changes in these allowances in
those future periods.

As of January 1, 2020 BOK Financial’s accounting policies have changed significantly with the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")
Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Assets Measured at Amortized Cost ("ASU 2016-13" or "CECL").
Prior years are not restated. Prior to January 1, 2020, general allowances and nonspecific allowances were based on incurred credit losses. See Note 4 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for the description of the expected credit losses calculation of the allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet
credit risk from unfunded loan commitments.

For the majority of risk-graded loans, the accruing loan’s expected credit loss estimate is sensitive to management judgment, particularly probability of default and
loss given default assumptions, changes in specific macroeconomic factor forecasts, the probability weight assigned to each economic scenario, and judgmental
allocations for risks otherwise not captured in the calculation.

Probability of default and loss given default measurements are based on historical data that may not be a good predictor of future performance or actual losses.
Probability of default is based on risk grades, a subjective measurement of the risk of a loan. This subjective assessment of risk may not reflect actual risk of loss.

Other subjective measures include the forecast for each relevant economic loss driver and the probability weighting of economic scenarios, both of which are
overseen by a senior management committee with members independent of the allowance process. Determining appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses
and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments requires management judgment about effects of uncertain matters which may be
reflected as industry or product judgmental allocations or nonspecific allowances. This results in a subjective calculation which is inherently imprecise.

Although the resulting expected credit loss estimate represents management’s best estimates at the time, actual credit losses will differ from management’s
estimate. Portfolio composition will change over time, actual economic conditions will differ from probability-weighted assumptions, borrower-specific
circumstances will change, as well as other factors. Differences between actual losses and management's estimates may materially affect the Company's results of
operations.

Results of Operations

Net Interest Revenue and Net Interest Margin

Net interest revenue is the interest earned on debt securities, loans and other interest-earning assets less interest paid for interest-bearing deposits and other
borrowings. The net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax-equivalent net interest revenue by average interest-earning assets. Net interest spread is the
difference between the average rate earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is typically greater
than net interest spread due to interest income earned on assets funded by non-interest bearing liabilities such as demand deposits and equity.

Tax-equivalent net interest revenue totaled $264.1 million for the first quarter of 2020 and $280.6 million in the first quarter of 2019. Net purchase accounting
discount accretion was $4.1 million in the first quarter of 2020 and $7.8 million in the first quarter of 2019. Table 1 shows the effect on net interest revenue from
changes in average balances and interest rates for various types of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.

Net interest margin was 2.80 percent for the first quarter of 2020, compared to 3.30 percent for the first quarter of 2019. The tax-equivalent yield on earning assets
was 3.73 percent, a decrease of 73 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2019. The Federal Reserve decreased the federal funds rate a total of 225 basis
points since the middle of 2019. Three 25 basis point cuts were made in the second half of 2019 and an additional 150 basis points in emergency cuts were made in
March 2020 in response to the economic environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The latest reductions reduced the federal funds rate to nearly zero.
The impact from these latest cuts will more fully be felt in the second quarter. Loan yields decreased 76 basis points to 4.50 percent, primarily as a result of the
decrease in short-term interest rates. The yield on trading securities decreased 99 basis points to 2.89 percent. The yield on interest-bearing cash and cash
equivalents decreased 123 basis points to 1.33 percent. The available for sale securities portfolio yield decreased 9 basis points to 2.48 percent and the yield on fair
value option securities decreased 95 basis points to 2.67 percent.

Funding costs decreased 47 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2019. The cost of other borrowed funds decreased 107 basis points and the cost of interest-
bearing deposits decreased 6 basis points. The benefit to net interest margin from earning assets funded by non-interest bearing liabilities was 26 basis points for
the first quarter of 2020, a decrease of 24 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2019.

Average earning assets for the first quarter of 2020 increased $4.0 billion or 12 percent over the first quarter of 2019. The average balance of available for sale
securities, which consists largely of residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, increased $2.8 billion. We
purchase securities to supplement earnings and to manage interest rate risk. We have increased the size of our bond portfolio in order to reduce our exposure to
falling short-term interest rates. Fair value option securities, which we hold as an economic hedge against changes in the fair value of our mortgage servicing
rights, increased $1.2 billion. Average loans, net of allowance for loan losses, increased $133 million. Interest-bearing cash and cash equivalent balances increased
$184 million. Trading securities balances decreased $278 million. Receivables from unsettled securities sales, primarily related to our U.S. agency residential
mortgage-backed trading operations, increased $1.8 billion. Growth in average earning assets and non-interest bearing receivables was primarily funded by an
increase in average deposits and other borrowed funds.

Average deposits increased $3.6 billion compared to the first quarter of 2019 as we have focused on acquiring and growing deposits to enhance liquidity and
support balance sheet growth. Interest-bearing deposits increased $4.3 billion while demand deposit balances decreased $755 million. Average borrowed funds
increased $1.3 billion over the first quarter of 2019, primarily from federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements.

Tax-equivalent net interest revenue decreased $8.9 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. The first quarter of 2020 included $4.1 million of purchase
accounting discount accretion while the fourth quarter of 2019 included $5.8 million.

Average earning assets increased $291 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Average available for sale securities increased $331 million as we
repositioned the balance sheet for the current rate environment. Fair value option securities balances increased $272 million. Interest-bearing cash and cash
equivalents increased $148 million. Average loan balances decreased $293 million. In addition, receivables from unsettled securities sales that support our
mortgage trading activities increased $1.1 billion. Growth in average earning assets and non-interest bearing receivables was largely funded by a $1.5 billion
increase in average interest-bearing deposits.

Net interest margin was 2.80 percent compared to 2.88 percent in the previous quarter. While the Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds rate in multiple rates
cuts in the latter half of 2019 and first quarter of 2020, LIBOR has remained elevated relative to the rate cuts. This, combined with our ability to move deposits
costs down, preserved a large portion of our margin.

The yield on average earning assets decreased 20 basis points and the yield on the loan portfolio decreased 25 basis points. The yield on the available for sale
securities portfolio decreased 4 basis points and the yield on interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents was down 29 basis points.

Funding costs decreased 21 basis points. The cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased 11 basis points and the cost of other borrowed funds decreased 36 basis
points. The benefit to net interest margin from assets funded by non-interest bearing liabilities decreased 9 basis points to 26 basis points, which is the primary
component of the 8 basis point decline in net interest margin from the prior quarter.

Our overall objective is to manage the Company’s balance sheet to be relatively neutral to changes in interest rates as is further described in the Market Risk
section of this report. Approximately 78% of our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios are either variable rate or fixed rate that will reprice within
one year. These loans are funded primarily by deposit accounts that are either non-interest bearing, or that reprice more slowly than the loans. The result is a
balance sheet that would be asset sensitive, which means that assets generally reprice more quickly than liabilities. One of the strategies that we use to manage
toward a relative rate-neutral position is to purchase fixed-rate residential mortgage-backed securities issued primarily by U.S. government agencies and fund them
with market-rate-sensitive liabilities. The liability-sensitive nature of this strategy provides an offset to the asset-sensitive characteristics of our loan portfolio. We
also may use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risk. 

The effectiveness of these strategies is reflected in the overall change in net interest revenue due to changes in interest rates as shown in Table 1 and in the interest
rate sensitivity projections as shown in the Market Risk section of this report.

Other operating revenue was $180.3 million for the first quarter of 2020, a $23.0 million increase over the first quarter of 2019 and a $1.7 million increase over the
fourth quarter of 2019. Lower mortgage interest rates have positively affected both our brokerage and trading and mortgage banking revenue, leading to increases
of $19.2 million and $13.3 million over the first quarter of 2019, respectively, and $6.9 million and $11.8 million over the fourth quarter of 2019, respectively.

Certain percentage increases (decreases) in non-fees and commissions revenue are not meaningful for comparison purposes based on the nature of the item.

Fees and commissions revenue

Diversified sources of fees and commissions revenue are a significant part of our business strategy and represented 42 percent of total revenue for the first quarter
of 2020, excluding provision for credit losses and gains and losses on other assets, securities and derivatives and the change in the fair value of mortgage servicing
rights. We believe that a variety of fee revenue sources provides an offset to changes in interest rates, values in the equity markets, commodity prices and consumer
spending, all of which can be volatile. As an example of this strength, many of the economic factors such as falling interest rates resulting in compression in net
interest revenue or fiduciary and asset management revenue, may also increase mortgage related trading activities and mortgage production volumes. We expect
growth in other operating revenue to come through offering new products and services and by further development of our presence in other markets. However,
current and future economic conditions, including the recent impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory constraints, increased competition and saturation in
our existing markets could affect the rate of future increases.

Brokerage and Trading Revenue

Brokerage and trading revenue, which includes revenues from trading, customer hedging, retail brokerage and investment banking, increased $19.2 million or 61
percent compared to the first quarter of 2019.

Trading revenue includes net realized and unrealized gains and losses primarily related to sales of residential mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by U.S.
government agencies and related derivative instruments that enable our mortgage-banking customers to manage their market risk. Trading revenue also includes
net realized and unrealized gains and losses on municipal securities, asset-backed securities and other financial instruments that we sell to institutional customers,
along with changes in the fair value of financial instruments we hold as economic hedges against market risk of our trading securities. Trading revenue was $34.4
million for the first quarter of 2020, a $21.5 million or 166 percent increase compared to the first quarter of 2019. Lower mortgage interest rates increased
customer mortgage-backed trading activities. In addition, trading revenue growth reflects a shift in the mix of our to-be-announced residential mortgage-backed
securities contracts from our customer hedging program to our trading program.

Customer hedging revenue is based primarily on realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of derivative contracts held for customer risk management
programs. As more fully discussed under Customer Derivative Programs in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, we offer commodity, interest rate,
foreign exchange and equity derivatives to our customers. Customer hedging revenue totaled $3.2 million for the first quarter of 2020, a $3.5 million or 52 percent
decrease compared to the first quarter of 2019.

Investment banking revenue, which includes fees earned upon completion of underwriting and financial advisory services and loan syndication fees, totaled $5.0
million, a $1.2 million increase compared to the first quarter of 2019. Changes in investment banking revenue are primarily related to the timing and volume of
completed transactions.

Brokerage and trading revenue increased $6.9 million compared to the previous quarter. Increased revenue of $15.0 million from mortgage trading activity was
partially offset by a decrease in the fair value of asset-backed and municipal securities due to widened spreads.

Fiduciary and Asset Management Revenue

Fiduciary and asset management revenue is earned through managing or holding of assets for customers and executing transactions or providing related services.
Approximately 90 percent of fiduciary and asset management revenue is primarily based on the fair value of assets. Rates applied to asset values vary based on the
nature of the relationship. Fiduciary relationships and managed asset relationships generally have higher fee rates than non-fiduciary and/or managed relationships.
Fiduciary and asset management revenue increased $1.1 million or 3 percent compared to the first quarter of 2019. Fiduciary and asset management revenue was
relatively consistent with the fourth quarter of 2019. The decline in the fair value of assets was primarily related to the final month in the quarter. As a result,
revenues remained strong relative to the decrease in assets. Further, there has been a change in mix from corporate trust to a greater percentage invested in
retirement plans, which yields higher margins.

Mortgage banking revenue increased $13.3 million or 56 percent compared to the first quarter of 2019. Mortgage loan production volumes increased $435 million
or 71 percent as average primary mortgage interest rates have decreased. The gain on sale margin increased 77 basis points to 2.06 percent in the first quarter of
2020 as a rapid decrease in interest rates has led to increased application demand and industry-wide capacity constraints.

Mortgage banking revenue increased $11.8 million or 46 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Lower mortgage interest rates during the quarter led to an
increase in mortgage production of 65 percent. Gain on sale margin improved 61 basis points over the prior quarter.

Primary rates disclosed in Table 5 above represent rates generally available to borrowers on 30 year conforming mortgage loans.

Net gains on other assets, securities and derivatives

Other net losses totaled $10.7 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared to other net gains of $3.0 million in the first quarter of 2019. Other net losses were $1.6
million for the fourth quarter of 2019. These fluctuations are primarily related to changes in the fair value of investments related to deferred compensation of $8.5
million that are largely offset by a decrease in deferred compensation expense. The first quarter of 2020 also included a $3.1 million impairment of an energy fund
investment.

As discussed in the Market Risk section following, the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights ("MSRs") changes in response to changes in primary mortgage
loan rates and other assumptions. We attempt to mitigate the earnings volatility caused by changes in the fair value of MSRs by designating certain financial
instruments as an economic hedge. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are generally expected to partially offset changes in the fair value of MSRs.

Certain percentage increases (decreases) are not meaningful for comparison purposes.

Personnel expense

Personnel expense decreased $9.8 million compared to the first quarter of 2019. Regular compensation decreased $2.3 million while we were still working to fully
integrate CoBiz in the first quarter of 2019. Incentive compensation decreased $5.5 million. Deferred compensation decreased $9.6 million; however, this is largely
offset by a decrease in the value of related investments included in Other gains (losses). Cash based incentive compensation increased $6.1 million due to increased
sales activity.

Personnel expense decreased $12.2 million compared the fourth quarter of 2019. Incentive compensation decreased $13.6 million, led by a decrease in deferred
compensation. Cash based incentive compensation decreased $4.7 million, primarily due to annual incentives incurred in the fourth quarter of 2019. Regular
compensation decreased $2.2 million. The fourth quarter included approximately $2.0 million in severance costs due to realignment of personnel. Employee
benefits increased $3.6 million as a seasonal increase in payroll taxes and retirement plan expenses was partially offset by a decrease in employee healthcare costs.

Non-personnel operating expense

Non-personnel operating expense increased $4.0 million over the first quarter of 2019. Data processing and communications expense increased $2.3 million,
primarily due to technology project costs. Increases in professional fees and services and other expense were partially offset by a decrease in occupancy and
equipment expense.

Non-personnel expense decreased $7.9 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Mortgage banking costs decreased $3.7 million. Decreases in the fair value
of mortgage servicing assets reduced the costs of actual payoffs. Business promotion expense decreased $2.6 million due to a seasonal decrease in advertising costs
combined with reduced travel costs largely as a result of the current pandemic. The fourth quarter of 2019 included a $2.0 million charitable contribution to the
BOKF Foundation, which provides support to many nonprofit partners in our communities.

Income Taxes

The effective tax rate was 21.8 percent for the first quarter of 2020, 21.4 percent for the first quarter of 2019 and 21.5 percent for the fourth quarter of
2019. Income tax expense decreased $13.0 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 primarily due to the decrease in net income before tax for the quarter.

Lines of Business

We operate three principal lines of business: Commercial Banking, Consumer Banking and Wealth Management. Commercial Banking includes lending, treasury
and cash management services and customer risk management products for small businesses, middle market and larger commercial customers. Commercial
Banking also includes the TransFund EFT network. Consumer Banking includes retail lending and deposit services, lending and deposit services to small business
customers served through our consumer branch network and all mortgage banking activities. Wealth Management provides fiduciary services, private banking
services, insurance and investment advisory services in all markets. Wealth Management also underwrites state and municipal securities and engages in brokerage
and trading activities.

In addition to our lines of business, we have a Funds Management unit. The primary purpose of this unit is to manage our overall liquidity needs and interest rate
risk. Each line of business borrows funds from and provides funds to the Funds Management unit as needed to support their operations. Operating results for Funds
Management and other include the effect of interest rate risk positions and risk management activities, securities gains and losses including impairment charges,
the provision for credit losses in excess of net loans charged off, tax planning strategies and certain executive compensation costs that are not attributed to the lines
of business.

The operations of CoBiz were allocated to the operating segments in the second quarter of 2019. Prior to April 1, 2019, CoBiz operations were included in Funds
Management and other.

We allocate resources and evaluate the performance of our lines of business using the net direct contribution, which includes the allocation of funds, actual net
credit losses and capital costs. In addition, we measure the performance of our business lines after allocation of certain indirect expenses and taxes based on
statutory rates.

The cost of funds borrowed from the Funds Management unit by the operating lines of business is transfer priced at rates that approximate market rates for funds
with similar repricing and cash flow characteristics. Market rates are generally based on the applicable LIBOR or interest rate swap rates, adjusted for prepayment
and liquidity risk. This method of transfer-pricing funds that supports assets of the operating lines of business tends to insulate them from interest rate risk.

The value of funds provided by the operating lines of business to the Funds Management unit is also based on rates that approximate wholesale market rates for
funds with similar repricing and cash flow characteristics. Market rates are generally based on LIBOR or interest rate swap rates. The funds credit formula applied
to deposit products with indeterminate maturities is established based on their repricing characteristics reflected in a combination of the short-term LIBOR rate and
a moving average of an intermediate-term swap rate, with an appropriate spread applied to both. Shorter duration products are weighted towards the short-term
LIBOR rate and longer duration products are weighted towards the intermediate-term swap rates. The expected duration ranges from 30 days for certain rate-
sensitive deposits to five years.

Economic capital is assigned to the business units by a capital allocation model that reflects management’s assessment of risk. This model assigns capital based
upon credit, operating, interest rate and other market risk inherent in our business lines and recognizes the diversification benefits among the units. The level of
assigned economic capital is a combination of the risk taken by each business line, based on its actual exposures and calibrated to its own loss history where
possible. Average invested capital includes economic capital and amounts we have invested in the lines of business.

As shown in Table 8, net income attributable to our lines of business decreased $4.1 million compared to the first quarter of 2019. Net interest revenue decreased
by $15.7 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to decreases in the federal funds rate by the Federal Reserve. Other operating revenue increased by
$37.4 million and operating expense increased by $27.8 million compared to the first quarter of 2019. Net income attributed to Funds Management and other was
affected by the provision for expected credit losses in excess of net charge-offs of $76.6 million in the first quarter of 2020.

Net interest revenue was relatively consistent compared to the prior year. Net interest revenue increased as a result of higher loan volumes, largely from acquired
loans. This was partially offset by a decrease in deposit related net interest revenue as the value of deposits was impacted by falling interest rates. Non-earning
assets also increased with the allocation of CoBiz goodwill in the second quarter of 2019, further reducing net interest revenue. Net loans charged-off increased
$5.6 million.

Fees and commissions revenue increased $3.4 million or 9 percent largely due to an increase in loan syndication fees and deposit services charges. Other losses
included an energy fund impairment charge recognized in the first quarter of 2020. Operating expense increased $10.1 million or 20 percent compared to the first
quarter of 2019. Personnel expense increased $5.5 million and non-personnel expense increased $4.7 million, primarily due to the allocation of CoBiz operations
beginning the second quarter of 2019. Corporate expense allocations decreased $550 thousand or 6 percent compared to the prior year.

The average outstanding balance of loans attributed to Commercial Banking was up $2.8 billion or 18 percent over the first quarter of 2019 to $18.8 billion, largely
related to allocation of CoBiz loans to the segments in the second quarter of 2019. See the Loans section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition following for additional discussion of changes in commercial and commercial real estate loans, which are primarily attributed to the Commercial
Banking segment. 

Average deposits attributed to Commercial Banking were $11.9 billion for the first quarter of 2020, a $3.6 billion or 44 percent increase over the first quarter of
2019, primarily related to the allocation of CoBiz deposits to the segments in the second quarter of 2019. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital for further discussion of change.

Net interest revenue decreased $10.8 million or 7 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 largely due to a decrease in loan volumes combined with a decline
in the value of deposits, as short term rates fell, from the Funds Management unit compared to the prior quarter. Fees and commissions revenue decreased $1.9
million, largely due to lower revenue from repossessed oil and gas properties. Operating expense decreased $8.5 million or 12 percent compared to the fourth
quarter of 2019 primarily due to a $7.9 million decrease in personnel expense largely due to annual incentive compensation occurring in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Non-personnel expense was relatively consistent with the fourth quarter of 2019.

Average loan balances decreased $288 million or 2 percent and average customer deposits increased $488 million or 4 percent over the fourth quarter of 2019.

Consumer Banking

Consumer Banking provides retail banking services through four primary distribution channels: traditional branches, the 24-hour ExpressBank call center, Internet
banking and mobile banking. Consumer Banking also conducts mortgage banking activities through offices located outside of our Consumer Banking markets.

Consumer Banking contributed $22.9 million to consolidated net income for the first quarter of 2020, an increase of $7.6 million over the first quarter of 2019.
Improved performance by Consumer Banking was largely due to the effect of lower mortgage interest rates, which has increased mortgage banking activity and
related revenue. Further, increased effectiveness of the economic hedge of the fair value of mortgage servicing rights improved income before taxes by $4.9
million.

Net interest revenue from Consumer Banking activities declined by $7.2 million or 14 percent compared to the the first quarter of 2019. A decrease in the yield on
deposits sold to our Funds Management unit was partially offset by an increase in the volume of securities used as an economic hedge of the fair value of mortgage
servicing rights. Average consumer deposits grew $325 million over the first quarter of 2019 with demand deposit balances increasing $218 million or 11 percent,
largely due to the allocation of acquired deposits.

Fees and commissions revenue increased $12.2 million or 29 percent over the first quarter of 2019. Lower mortgage interest rates increased mortgage loan
origination volumes. Mortgage production volume increased $435 million or 71 percent and gain on sale margin increased 77 basis points. Operating expense
increased by $972 thousand or 2 percent. Corporate expense allocations were $1.4 million or 12 percent lower than the prior year.

Changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, net of economic hedges, decreased pre-tax net income for the first quarter of 2020 by $1.7 million compared
to a $6.6 million decrease in pre-tax net income in the first quarter of 2019.

Net interest revenue from Consumer Banking activities increased $756 thousand or 2 percent over the fourth quarter of 2019. Operating revenue increased $10.3
million or 23 percent over the fourth quarter of 2019. Revenues from mortgage banking activities increased $11.8 million. Mortgage production volume increased
$413 million or 65 percent as a result of lower interest rates. Gain on sale margins climbed to 2.06 percent from 1.44 percent.

Operating expenses decreased $4.9 million, nearly all related to non-personnel expenses. Mortgage banking costs decreased $3.7 million due to lower amortization
of mortgage servicing rights. A decrease in professional fees and services was mostly offset by an increase in occupancy and equipment expense.

Average consumer loans decreased $19 million or 1 percent. Average deposits decreased $105 million or 2 percent.

Wealth Management

Wealth Management contributed $22.6 million to consolidated net income in the first quarter of 2020, a decrease of $1.1 million or 5 percent compared to the first
quarter of 2019. Increased fees and commissions revenue, primarily from mortgage-backed securities trading, was largely offset by increased operating expenses
and decreased net interest revenue.

Net interest revenue decreased $9.4 million or 33 percent compared to the first quarter of 2019, largely due to a decrease in the yield earned on deposits sold to the
Funds Management unit. Further, Wealth Management incurred additional funding costs for non-interest bearing receivables related to unsettled securities sales.
Average loans attributed to the Wealth Management segment increased $257 million or 18 percent and average deposits increased $2.0 billion or 35 percent,
largely due to the allocation of acquired loans and deposits.

Fees and commissions revenue increased $24.6 million or 34 percent over the first quarter of 2019. Brokerage and trading revenue increased $20.2 million due to
increased trading activity as a result of lower mortgage interest rates. Trust fees and commissions also increased $2.8 million. Operating expense increased $16.7
million or 27 percent compared to the first quarter of 2019. Personnel expense increased $12.5 million, primarily due to the increase of incentive compensation as a
result of higher trading activity. Non-personnel expense increased $4.2 million or 24 percent over the first quarter of 2019, largely related to occupancy and
equipment and data processing expenses. Corporate expense allocations decreased $95 thousand or 1 percent compared to the prior year.

Net income for Wealth Management decreased $290 thousand or 1 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. An increase in brokerage and trading revenue
was partially offset by a decrease in net interest revenue and an increase in operating expenses.

Net interest revenue decreased $2.9 million primarily due to lower yields on deposits sold to our Funds Management unit combined with the increased carrying
cost on larger unsettled securities receivables. Brokerage and trading revenue increased $5.7 million due to an increase in trading activity and volumes due to
favorable interest rate changes. Trading revenue related to mortgage banking activities increased $15.0 and was partially offset by widened spreads in asset-backed
and municipal securities. Operating expenses increased $3.5 million, largely due to variable incentive compensation related to revenue growth and an increase in
occupancy allocations.

Average loans increased $38 million or 2 percent to $1.7 billion and average deposits increased $323 million or 4 percent to $7.6 billion.

Financial Condition

Securities

We maintain a securities portfolio to enhance profitability, manage interest rate risk, provide liquidity and comply with regulatory requirements. Securities are
classified as trading, held for investment, or available for sale. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the composition of the securities portfolio
as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

We hold an inventory of trading securities in support of sales to a variety of customers, including banks, corporations, insurance companies, money managers and
others. Trading securities increased $487 million to $2.1 billion during the first quarter of 2020. As discussed in the Market Risk section of this report, trading
activities involve risk of loss from adverse price movement. We mitigate this risk within board-approved limits through the use of derivative contracts, short-sales
and other techniques. These limits remain relatively unchanged from levels set before our expanded trading activities.

At March 31, 2020, the carrying value of investment (held-to-maturity) securities was $273 million, including a $1.5 million allowance for expected credit losses.
The fair value of investment securities was $296 million at March 31, 2020. Investment securities consist primarily of residential mortgage-backed securities
issued by U.S. government agencies, long-term, fixed rate Oklahoma and Texas municipal bonds, and taxable Texas school construction bonds.

Available for sale securities, which may be sold prior to maturity, are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains or losses, net of deferred taxes, are recorded as
accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity. The amortized cost of available for sale securities totaled $12.3 billion at March 31, 2020, a $1.1
billion increase compared to December 31, 2019 as a measure to protect for a down rate environment. At March 31, 2020, the available for sale securities portfolio
consisted primarily of U.S. government agency residential mortgage-backed securities and U.S. government agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. Both
residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities have credit risk from delinquency or default of the underlying loans. We mitigate this risk by primarily
investing in securities issued by U.S. government agencies. Principal and interest payments on the underlying loans are fully guaranteed. Commercial mortgage-
backed securities have prepayment penalties similar to commercial loans.

A primary risk of holding residential mortgage-backed securities comes from extension during periods of rising interest rates or prepayment during periods of
falling interest rates. We evaluate this risk through extensive modeling of risk both before making an investment and throughout the life of the security. Our best
estimate of the duration of the combined residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio held in investment and available for sale securities at March 31, 2020 is
2.4 years. Management estimates the duration extends to 3.7 years assuming an immediate 200 basis point upward shock. The estimated duration contracts to 2.2
years assuming a 100 basis point decline in the current low rate environment.

Loans

The aggregate loan portfolio before allowance for loan losses totaled $22.5 billion at March 31, 2020, up $713 million over December 31, 2019. Growth in
commercial loan balances during the first quarter was partially offset by a decrease in loans to individuals.

Commercial

Commercial loans represent loans for working capital, facilities acquisition or expansion, purchases of equipment and other needs of commercial customers
primarily located within our geographical footprint. These loans are underwritten individually and represent ongoing relationships based on a thorough knowledge
of the customer, the customer’s industry and market. While commercial loans are generally secured by the customer’s assets including real property, inventory,
accounts receivable, operating equipment, interests in mineral rights and other property and may also include personal guarantees of the owners and related parties,
the primary source of repayment of the loans is the ongoing cash flow from operations of the customer’s business. Inherent lending risks are centrally monitored on
a continuous basis from underwriting throughout the life of the loan for compliance with commercial lending policies.

Commercial loans totaled $14.8 billion or 66 percent of the loan portfolio at March 31, 2020, a $764 million increase over December 31, 2019. Advances on
existing commercial revolving lines of credit represented $751 million of this increase during the first quarter, due to both seasonal factors and customer responses
to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to being collateralized by customer's assets, revolving lines of credit are generally governed by a borrowing base.

Approximately 79 percent of loans in this segment are located within our geographic footprint, based on collateral location. Loans for which the collateral location
is less relevant, such as unsecured loans and reserve-based energy loans are categorized by the borrower's primary operating location. The largest concentration of
loans in this segment outside of our footprint is California, totaling 4 percent of the segment.

Supporting the energy industry with loans to producers and other energy-related entities has been a hallmark of the Company since its founding and represents a
large portion of our commercial loan portfolio. In addition, energy production and related industries have a significant impact on the economy in our primary
markets. Loans collateralized by oil and gas properties are subject to a semi-annual engineering review by our internal staff of petroleum engineers. This review is
used as the basis for developing the expected cash flows supporting the loan amount. The projected cash flows are discounted according to risk characteristics of
the underlying oil and gas properties. Loans are evaluated to demonstrate with reasonable certainty that crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids can be
recovered from known oil and gas reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions at current pricing levels and with existing conventional equipment
and operating methods and costs. As part of our evaluation of credit quality, we analyze rigorous stress tests over a range of commodity prices and take proactive
steps to mitigate risk when appropriate.

Outstanding energy loans totaled $4.1 billion or 18 percent of total loans at March 31, 2020, up $138 million over December 31, 2019. Approximately $3.2 billion
of energy loans were to oil and gas producers, growing $65 million over December 31, 2019. The majority of this portfolio is first lien, senior secured, reserve-
based lending, which we believe is the lowest risk form of energy lending. Approximately 62 percent of the committed production loans are secured by properties
primarily producing oil and 38 percent of the committed production loans are secured by properties primarily producing natural gas.

Loans to midstream oil and gas companies totaled $672 million at March 31, 2020, up $63 million over December 31, 2019. Loans to borrowers that provide
services to the energy industry totaled $184 million at March 31, 2020, an increase of $6.4 million. Loans to other energy borrowers, including those engaged in
wholesale or retail energy sales, totaled $71 million, a $3.7 million increase over the prior quarter.

Unfunded energy loan commitments were $2.6 billion at March 31, 2020, a $386 million decrease compared to December 31, 2019 primarily due to increased
utilization in the first quarter.

The healthcare sector of the loan portfolio totaled $3.2 billion or 14 percent of total loans. Healthcare loans increased $131 million over December 31, 2019.
Healthcare sector loans consist primarily of loans for the development and operation of senior housing and care facilities, including independent living, assisted
living and skilled nursing. Generally we loan to borrowers with a portfolio of multiple facilities that serves to help diversify risks specific to a single facility.
Healthcare also includes loans to hospitals and other medical service providers impacted by a deferral of elective procedures to ensure adequate protective
equipment and ventilators for those providing acute care to virus patients. The CARES Act does include multiple revenue enhancement measures for both hospitals
and skilled nursing facilities as they manage through the risks of the virus.

The services sector of the loan portfolio increased $124 million to $4.0 billion or 18 percent of total loans. Service sector loans consist of a large number of loans
to a variety of businesses, including Native American tribal and state and local governments, Native American tribal casino operations, educational services,
consumer services and commercial services. Approximately $2.0 billion of the services category is made up of loans with individual balances of less than $10
million. Services sector loans are generally secured by the assets of the borrower with repayment coming from the cash flows of ongoing operations of the
customer’s business. 

General business loans increased $371 million to $3.6 billion or 16 percent of total loans. General business loans consist of $2.0 billion of wholesale/retail loans,
$698 million of manufacturing loans, and remainder from other industries.

Our services and general business loans include areas we consider to be more exposed to the economic slowdown as a result of the social distancing measures in
place to combat the COVID-19 pandemic such as entertainment and recreation, retail, hotels, churches, airline travel, and higher education that are dependent on
large social gatherings to remain profitable. This represents approximately 8 percent of our total portfolio. This risk may be further mitigated as some of these
borrowers participate in the Payroll Protection Program and we will continue to monitor these areas closely in the coming months.

- 21 -

 
We participate in shared national credits when appropriate to obtain or maintain business relationships with local customers. Shared national credits are defined by
banking regulators as credits of more than $100 million and with three or more non-affiliated banks as participants. At March 31, 2020, the outstanding principal
balance of these loans totaled $5.0 billion, including $2.3 billion of energy loans. Substantially all of these loans are to borrowers with local market
relationships. We serve as the agent lender in approximately 18 percent of our shared national credits, based on dollars committed. We hold shared national credits
to the same standard of analysis and perform the same level of review as internally originated credits. Our lending policies generally avoid loans in which we do
not have the opportunity to maintain or achieve other business relationships with the customer. In addition to management’s quarterly assessment of credit risk,
banking regulators annually review a sample of shared national credits for proper risk grading.

Commercial Real Estate

Commercial real estate represents loans for the construction of buildings or other improvements to real estate and property held by borrowers for investment
purposes generally within our geographical footprint. We require collateral values in excess of the loan amounts, demonstrated cash flows in excess of expected
debt service requirements, equity investment in the project and a portion of the project already sold, leased or permanent financing already secured. The expected
cash flows from all significant new or renewed income producing property commitments are stress tested to reflect the risks in varying interest rates, vacancy rates
and rental rates. As with commercial loans, inherent lending risks are centrally monitored on a continuous basis from underwriting throughout the life of the loan
for compliance with applicable lending policies.

The commercial real estate loan balance as a percentage of our total loan portfolio has ranged from 20 percent to 22 percent over the past five years. The
outstanding balance of commercial real estate loans increased $16 million over December 31, 2019.

Approximately 70 percent of loans in this segment are in our geographic footprint based on collateral location. The largest concentration of loans in this segment
outside our footprint is Utah, totaling 6.8 percent of the segment, followed by California at 5.9 percent. All other states represent less than 4% individually.

Loans secured by retail facilities are clearly the most vulnerable to the impacts of measures being taken to hinder the spread of the virus, the extent of which is
dependent upon the duration of various governmental orders and adjustments in consumer behavior after these orders are lifted. While office and multifamily may
also be impacted, we believe our geographic footprint will help in the long term because of strong in-migration over time.

Loans to individuals

Loans to individuals include residential mortgage and personal loans. Residential mortgage loans provide funds for our customers to purchase or refinance their
primary residence or to borrow against the equity in their home. These loans are secured by a first or second mortgage on the customer's primary residence. These
loans are made in accordance with underwriting policies we believe to be conservative and are fully documented. Loans may be individually underwritten or credit
scored based on size and other criteria. Credit scoring is assessed based on significant credit characteristics including credit history, residential and employment
stability.

In general, we sell the majority of our conforming fixed rate loan originations in the secondary market and retain the majority of our non-conforming and
adjustable-rate mortgage loans. We have no concentration in sub-prime residential mortgage loans. Our mortgage loan portfolio does not include payment option
adjustable rate mortgage loans or adjustable rate mortgage loans with initial rates that are below market. Home equity loans are primarily first-lien and fully
amortizing.

Residential mortgage, which includes home equity loans, and personal loans are made in accordance with underwriting policies we believe to be conservative and
are fully documented. Loans may be individually underwritten or credit scored based on size and other criteria. Credit scoring is assessed based on significant
credit characteristics including credit history, residential and employment stability.

Personal loans consist primarily of loans to Wealth Management clients secured by the cash surrender value of insurance policies and marketable securities. It also
includes direct loans secured by and for the purchase of automobiles, recreational and marine equipment as well as unsecured loans.

Approximately 94 percent of the loans in this segment are secured by collateral located within our geographical footprint. Loans for which the collateral location is
less relevant, such as unsecured loans are categorized by the borrower’s primary operating location.

- 22 -

Residential mortgage loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies have limited credit exposure because of the agency guarantee. This amount includes
residential mortgage loans previously sold into GNMA mortgage pools that the Company may repurchase when certain defined delinquency criteria are met.
Because of this repurchase right, the Company is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans and must include them on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet.

The Company secondarily evaluates loan portfolio performance based on the primary geographical market managing the loan. Loans attributed to a geographical
market may not represent the location of the borrower or the collateral. All permanent mortgage loans serviced by our mortgage banking unit and held for
investment by the Company are centrally managed by the Oklahoma market.

Off-Balance Sheet Commitments

We enter into certain off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business as shown in Table 14. Loan commitments may be unconditional obligations
to provide financing or conditional obligations that depend on the borrower’s financial condition, collateral value or other factors. Standby letters of credit are
unconditional commitments to guarantee the performance of our customer to a third party. Since some of these commitments are expected to expire before being
drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.

We have off-balance sheet commitments related to certain residential mortgage loans sold into mortgage-backed securities as part of our mortgage banking
activities. We retain off-balance sheet credit risk related to losses in excess of amounts guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veteran's Affairs ("VA"). We also
have off-balance sheet credit risk related to certain residential mortgage loans primarily originated under community development loan programs that were sold to
a U.S. government agency with full recourse prior to 2007. We are obligated to repurchase these loans for the life of these loans in the event of foreclosure for the
unpaid principal and interest at the time of foreclosure. The majority of our conforming fixed rate loan originations are sold in the secondary market and we only
retain repurchase obligations under standard underwriting representations and warranties.

We offer programs that permit our customers to hedge various risks, including fluctuations in energy, cattle and other agricultural product prices, interest rates and
foreign exchange rates. Each of these programs work essentially the same way. Derivative contracts are executed between the customers and the
Company. Offsetting contracts are executed between the Company and selected counterparties to minimize market risk due to changes in commodity prices,
interest rates or foreign exchange rates. The counterparty contracts are identical to the customer contracts, except for a fixed pricing spread or a fee paid to us as
compensation for administrative costs, credit risk and profit.

The customer derivative programs create credit risk for potential amounts due to the Company from our customers and from the counterparties. Customer credit
risk is monitored through existing credit policies and procedures. The effects of changes in commodity prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates are evaluated
across a range of possible scenarios to determine the maximum exposure we are willing to have individually to any customer. Customers may also be required to
provide cash margin or other collateral in conjunction with our credit agreements to further limit our credit risk.

Counterparty credit risk is evaluated through existing policies and procedures. This evaluation considers the total relationship between BOK Financial and each of
the counterparties. Individual limits are established by management, approved by Credit Administration and reviewed by the Asset/Liability Committee. Margin
collateral is required if the exposure between the Company and any counterparty exceeds established limits. Based on declines in the counterparties’ credit ratings,
these limits may be reduced and additional margin collateral may be required.

A deterioration of the credit standing of one or more of the customers or counterparties to these contracts may result in BOK Financial recognizing a loss as the fair
value of the affected contracts may no longer move in tandem with the offsetting contracts. This occurs if the credit standing of the customer or counterparty
deteriorated such that either the fair value of underlying collateral no longer supported the contract or the customer or the counterparty’s ability to provide margin
collateral was impaired. Credit losses on customer derivatives reduce brokerage and trading revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Derivative contracts are carried at fair value. At March 31, 2020, the net fair values of derivative contracts, before consideration of cash margin, reported as assets
under these programs totaled $929 million compared to $302 million at December 31, 2019. At March 31, 2020, the net fair value of our derivative contracts
included $482 million for energy contracts, $313 million for foreign exchange contracts and $132 million for interest rate swaps. The aggregate net fair value of
derivative contracts, before consideration of cash margin, held under these programs reported as liabilities totaled $893 million at March 31, 2020 and $291 million
at December 31, 2019.

At March 31, 2020, total derivative assets were reduced by $414 million of cash collateral received from counterparties and total derivative liabilities were reduced
by $123 million of cash collateral paid to counterparties related to instruments executed with the same counterparty under a master netting agreement.

A table showing the notional and fair value of derivative assets and liabilities on both a gross and net basis is presented in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

The fair value of derivative contracts reported as assets under these programs, net of cash margin held by the Company, by category of debtor at March 31, 2020
follows in Table 15.

At March 31, 2020, our largest derivative exposure was to a clearing organization for energy contracts, net of cash margin, of $53 million.

Our customer derivative program also introduces liquidity and capital risk. We are required to provide cash margin to certain counterparties when the net negative
fair value of the contracts exceeds established limits. Also, changes in commodity prices affect the amount of regulatory capital we are required to hold as support
for the fair value of our derivative assets. These risks are modeled as part of the management of these programs. Based on current prices, a decrease in market
prices equivalent to $8.52 per barrel of oil would not be great enough to create a scenario in which we are owed by our customers. This is due to the price of oil
being within the weighted average fixed price of the portfolio. Rather, we would be owed by the counterparties, however, due to our margining status with
counterparties, one would not see any impact here. An increase in prices equivalent to $31.66 per barrel of oil would not yet create a scenario in which we are
owed by customers as the price of oil would still be within the weighted average fixed price of the portfolio. Further increases in price to the equivalent of $45.95
per barrel of oil would increase the fair value of our derivative assets by $148 million with lending customers comprising the bulk of the assets. Liquidity
requirements of this program may also be affected by our credit rating. At March 31, 2020, a decrease in our credit rating to below investment grade would
increase our obligation to post cash margin on existing contracts by approximately $10 million. The fair value of our to-be-announced residential mortgage-backed
securities and interest rate swap derivative contracts is affected by changes in interest rates. Based on our assessment as of March 31, 2020, changes in interest
rates would not materially impact regulatory capital or liquidity needed to support this portion of our customer derivative program.

Allowance for Loan Losses and Accrual for Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk from Unfunded Loan Commitments

The Company adopted FASB Accounting Standard Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Assets Measured at Amortized Cost
("CECL") on January 1, 2020 through a pre-tax cumulative-effect adjustment to equity of $61.4 million. CECL requires recognition of expected credit losses on
assets carried at amortized cost over their expected lives. The previous incurred loss model incorporated only known information as of the balance sheet date. Prior
years reported under the incurred loss model have not been restated. CECL uses models to measure the probability of default and loss given default over a 12-
month reasonable and supportable forecast period. Models incorporate base case, downside and upside macroeconomic variables such as real gross domestic
product ("GDP") growth, civilian unemployment rate and West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") oil prices on a probability weighted basis. See Note 4 to the
consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of methodology of allowance for loan losses.

The provision for credit losses was $93.8 million for the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to $99.3 million related to lending activity. Changes in our reasonable
and supportable forecasts of macroeconomic variables, primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, oil price declines, and other assumptions, required
a provision of $66.2 million. All other changes totaled $33.1 million, which included $7.5 million related to loan growth, $8.4 million related to changes in
impairment, risk grading and other portfolio changes, and net charge-offs of $17.2 million.

Our base case reasonable and supportable forecast includes a 20 percent decrease in GDP and an 8.3 percent civilian unemployment rate in the second quarter of
2020. Our forward twelve month forecast through the first quarter of 2021 assumes a 4.6 percent decrease in GDP and a 6.5 percent civilian unemployment rate.
WTI oil prices are projected to generally follow the NYMEX forward curve that existed at the end of March 2020, $25.10 per barrel for delivery in the second
quarter of 2020 and increasing to $34.73 per barrel for delivery in the first quarter of 2021. This scenario is consistent with data and other industry forecasts
available during the last week of March 2020.

Our downside reasonable and supportable forecast reflects a more severe and prolonged disruption in economic activity than the base case and includes a 30
percent decrease in GDP and a 9.5 percent civilian unemployment rate in the second quarter of 2020. Our forward twelve month forecast through the first quarter
of 2021 assumes a 10.9 percent decrease in GDP and an 8.0 percent civilian unemployment rate. WTI oil prices are projected to range from $19.10 per barrel for
delivery in the second quarter of 2020 to $31.73 per barrel for delivery in the first quarter of 2021.

The upside case reflects a more mild and abbreviated disruption in economic activity than the base case, with real GDP declining by 1.6 percent from the second
quarter of 2020 to the first quarter of 2021. Other macroeconomic factors in this scenario also reflect this outlook compared to the base case with the civilian
unemployment rate reaching a lower peak in the second quarter of 2020 and then recovering more quickly and WTI prices being less adverse.

The allowance for loan losses under CECL totaled $315 million or 1.40 percent of outstanding loans and 199 percent of nonaccruing loans at March 31, 2020,
excluding residential mortgage loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. The combined allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit
risk from unfunded loan commitments was $344 million or 1.53 percent of outstanding loans and 217 percent of nonaccruing loans at March 31, 2020.

The allowance for credit losses attributed to energy was 2.43 percent of outstanding energy loans at March 31. Demand declines in the first quarter related to the
COVID-19 pandemic coupled with the OPEC Plus production conflict have led to price declines of current spot and future oil prices. Natural gas prices have not
been as significantly impacted with the recent price declines in oil. As we have said in the past, the duration of the downturn is a more significant factor affecting
performance than the level of prices. Although current spot and future oil prices have been volatile, if drivers of this decline are short term, meaning less than
twelve months, then expected losses in the portfolio will not be overly impactful to the Company.

We also conduct quarterly stress tests of our energy borrowers with more than 50 percent funding on their lines of credit and all criticized loans using a price deck
discounted at 20 percent. This stress test helps us identify potential issues, although the most recent test resulted in no surprises once hedging was taken into
consideration. Of all the energy customers that we stress test, which makes up 92 percent of production loans outstanding, 95 percent of our customers have some
level of hedging in the 12-month range and many of them carry into the 24-month range.

The company recorded a $19.0 million provision for credit losses under the previous incurred loss model in the fourth quarter of 2019. The allowance for loan
losses under the incurred loss model was $211 million or 0.97 percent of outstanding loans and 121 percent of nonaccruing loans, excluding loans guaranteed by
U.S. government agencies at December 31, 2019. The combined allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan
commitments was $212 million or 0.98 percent of outstanding loans and 121 percent of nonaccruing loans.

Net Loans Charged Off

Net charge-offs of commercial loans were $16.2 million in the first quarter of 2020, primarily related to two previously impaired energy production loans. Net
commercial real estate loan charge-offs were $839 thousand and net charge-offs of loans to individuals were $229 thousand. Net charge-offs of loans to individuals
include deposit account overdraft losses.

Accrual for Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk Associated with Mortgage Banking Activities

The accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk associated with mortgage banking activities includes consideration of credit risk related to certain residential mortgage
loans sold into mortgage-backed securities in excess of amounts guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veteran's Affairs ("VA") and mortgage loans originated
under community development loan programs that were sold to a U.S. government agency with full recourse.

We use publicly available long-term national data to estimate total loss given default for our off-balance sheet credit risk related to losses in excess of amounts
guaranteed by the VA. This result is combined with probability of default output from our mortgage servicing rights model to estimate total expected loss. Then,
we estimate the VA's guarantee percentage to determine our portion of the credit risk. Qualitative adjustment may be used, if necessary.

The accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk associated with mortgage banking activities decreased $6.0 million during the first quarter primarily due to a
shortening of the expected life of loans due to increased prepayment speeds as a result of decreased mortgage interest rates.

- 29 -

Allowance for Credit Losses Related to Held-to-Maturity (Investment) Securities

The expected credit losses principles apply to all financial assets measured at cost, including our held-to-maturity (investment) debt securities portfolio. Our
investment portfolio includes municipal and other tax-exempt securities and other debt securities. Expected credit losses for these assets is based on probability of
default and loss given default assumptions that align with similarly graded loans. Qualitative adjustment may be used, if necessary.

- 30 -

Nonperforming Assets

As more fully described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, loans are generally classified as nonaccruing when it becomes probable that we will
not collect the full contractual principal and interest. Accruing renegotiated loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies represent residential mortgage loans
that have been modified in troubled debt restructurings. Interest continues to accrue based on the modified terms of the loan and loans may be sold once they
become eligible according to U.S. government agency guidelines. Real estate and other repossessed assets are assets acquired in partial or total forgiveness of
loans. The assets are carried at the lower of cost as determined by fair value at the date of foreclosure or current fair value, less estimated selling costs. A summary
of nonperforming assets follows in Table 17:

Excluding assets guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, nonperforming assets were largely unchanged compared to December 31, 2019. Newly identified
nonaccruing loans totaled $30 million, primarily related to a single energy borrower, offset by $8.9 million of payments, $19 million of charge-offs and $18 million
of foreclosures, primarily related to single commercial real estate borrower. The Company generally retains nonperforming assets to maximize potential recovery,
which may cause future nonperforming assets to decrease more slowly.

We foreclose on loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies in accordance with agency guidelines. Generally these loans are not eligible for modification
programs or have failed to comply with modified loan terms. Principal is guaranteed by agencies of the U.S. government, subject to limitations and credit risk is
limited. At foreclosure, these amounts are transferred to claims receivable accounts. These properties will be conveyed to the agencies once applicable criteria have
been met. 

Real Estate and Other Repossessed Assets

Real estate and other repossessed assets totaled $37 million at March 31, 2020, composed primarily of $23 million of developed commercial real estate, $5.6
million of undeveloped land primarily zoned for commercial development, $5.3 million of oil and gas properties and $2.9 million of 1-4 family residential
properties. Real estate and other repossessed assets totaled $20 million at December 31, 2019.

Liquidity and Capital

Based on the average balances for the first quarter of 2020, approximately 62 percent of our funding was provided by deposit accounts, 23 percent from borrowed
funds, less than 1 percent from long-term subordinated debt and 11 percent from equity. Our funding sources, which primarily include deposits and borrowings
from the Federal Home Loan Banks and other banks, provide adequate liquidity to meet our operating needs.

Subsidiary Bank

Deposits and borrowed funds are the primary sources of liquidity for BOKF, NA, the wholly owned subsidiary bank of BOK Financial. We compete for retail and
commercial deposits by offering a broad range of products and services and focusing on customer convenience. Retail deposit growth is supported through
personal and small business checking, online bill paying services, mobile banking services, an extensive network of branch locations and ATMs and our
ExpressBank call center. Commercial deposit growth is supported by offering treasury management and lockbox services. We also acquire brokered deposits when
the cost of funds is advantageous to other funding sources.

Average deposits for the first quarter of 2020 totaled $28.2 billion, a $1.1 billion increase over the fourth quarter of 2019. Strong deposit growth was driven by a
combination of our continued focus on growing core customer deposits, inflows from external money funds, and seasonal inflows. Interest-bearing transaction
account balances increased $1.5 billion and demand deposits decreased $380 million.

Acquired deposits were allocated to the lines of business from funds management and other in the second quarter of 2019. Average Commercial Banking deposit
balances increased $488 million over the fourth quarter of 2019. Interest-bearing transaction account balances increased $646 million and demand deposit balances
decreased $165 million. Commercial customers continue to retain large cash reserves primarily due to a combination of factors including uncertainty about the
economic environment and potential for growth, lack of preferable liquid alternatives and a desire to minimize deposit service charges through the earnings credit.
The earnings credit is a non-cash method that enables commercial customers to offset deposit service charges based on account balances. Commercial deposit
balances may decrease as the economic outlook improves and if short-term rates move higher, enhancing their investment alternatives.

Average Consumer Banking deposit balances decreased $105 million compared to the prior quarter. An $83 million decrease in demand deposit balances and a $55
million decrease in interest-bearing transaction deposit balances was partially offset by a $19 million increase in time deposit balances and a $14 million increase
in savings account balances.

Average Wealth Management deposits increased $323 million over the fourth quarter of 2019. Interest-bearing transaction account balances were up $432 million.
Demand deposit balances decreased $73 million. Time deposit balances decreased $34 million.

Average time deposits for the first quarter of 2020 included $247 million of brokered deposits, a $9.5 million increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.
Average interest-bearing transaction accounts for the first quarter included $1.3 billion of brokered deposits, a $75 million increase compared to the fourth quarter
of 2019.

In addition to deposits, liquidity is provided primarily by federal funds purchased, securities repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank
borrowings. Federal funds purchased consist primarily of unsecured, overnight funds acquired from other financial institutions. Funds are primarily purchased from
bankers’ banks and Federal Home Loan banks from across the country. The largest single source of wholesale federal funds purchased totaled $550 million at
March 31, 2020. Securities repurchase agreements generally mature within 90 days and are secured by certain available for sale and trading securities. Federal
Home Loan Bank borrowings are generally short-term and are secured by a blanket pledge of eligible collateral (generally unencumbered U.S. Treasury and
agency mortgage-backed securities, 1-4 family residential mortgage loans, multifamily and other qualifying commercial real estate loans). Amounts borrowed from
the Federal Home Loan Bank of Topeka averaged $6.5 billion during the quarter, compared to $6.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. On March 15, 2020, the
Federal Reserve announced changes to the Discount Window, including narrowing the spread of the primary credit rate relative to the general level of overnight
interest to help encourage more active use of the Discount Window by depository institutions. We did increase our collateral at the Discount Window and
maintained a modest amount of borrowings in late March.

At March 31, 2020, the estimated unused credit available to BOKF, NA from collateralized sources was approximately $11.4 billion.

A summary of other borrowings for BOK Financial on a consolidated basis follows in Table 21.

1 Parent Company only.

BOKF, NA also has a liability related to the repurchase of certain delinquent residential mortgage loans previously sold in GNMA mortgage pools. Interest is
payable monthly at rates contractually due to investors.

Parent Company

At March 31, 2020, cash and interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents held by the parent company totaled $170 million. The primary sources of liquidity for
BOK Financial are cash on hand and dividends from BOKF, NA. Dividends from the bank are limited by various banking regulations to net profits, as defined, for
the year plus retained profits for the two preceding years. Dividends are further restricted by minimum capital requirements. At March 31, 2020, based upon the
most restrictive limitations as well as management's internal capital policy, BOKF, NA could declare up to $181 million of dividends without regulatory approval.
Dividend constraints may be alleviated through increases in retained earnings, capital issuances or changes in risk weighted assets. Future losses or increases in
required regulatory capital at the bank could affect its ability to pay dividends to the parent company.

Our equity capital at March 31, 2020 was $5.0 billion, a $170 million increase over December 31, 2019. Net income less cash dividends paid increased equity $26
million during the first quarter of 2020. The transition adjustment related to the implementation of CECL decreased equity by $47 million. Changes in interest rates
resulted in a $226 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive gain over December 31, 2019. Capital is managed to maximize long-term value to the
shareholders. Factors considered in managing capital include projections of future earnings including expected benefits from lower federal income tax rates, asset
growth and acquisition strategies, and regulatory and debt covenant requirements. Capital management may include subordinated debt or perpetual preferred stock
issuance, share repurchase and stock and cash dividends.

On April 30, 2019, the board of directors authorized the Company to purchase up to five million common shares, subject to market conditions, securities law and
other regulatory compliance limitations. As of March 31, 2020, 1,308,713 shares have been repurchased under this authorization. The Company repurchased
442,000 shares during the first quarter of 2020 at an average price of $75.52 per share. We view share buybacks opportunistically, but within the context of
maintaining our strong capital position.

BOK Financial and BOKF, NA are subject to various capital requirements administered by federal agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can
result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that could have a material impact on operations. These capital requirements
include quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items. The capital standards are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators.

A summary of minimum capital requirements, including capital conservation buffer follows in Table 22. A bank which falls below these levels, including the
capital conservation buffer, would be subject to regulatory restrictions on capital distributions (including but not limited to dividends and share repurchases) and
executive bonus payments.

In March 2020, in response to the impact on the financial markets by the COVID-19 pandemic, the banking agencies issued an interim final rule permitting
banking organizations that implement CECL the option to delay for two years an estimate of the CECL methodology's effect on regulatory capital, followed by a
three-year transition period. The estimate includes the implementation date adjustment as of January 1, 2020 plus an estimate of the impact of the change for a two
year period following implementation of CECL. We have elected to delay the regulatory capital impact of the transition in accordance with the interim final rule as
of March 31, 2020.

The capital ratios for BOK Financial on a consolidated basis are presented in Table 22.

Capital resources of financial institutions are also regularly measured by the tangible common shareholders’ equity ratio. Tangible common shareholders’ equity is
shareholders’ equity as defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) less intangible assets and equity which does
not benefit common shareholders. Equity that does not benefit common shareholders includes preferred equity. This non-GAAP measure is a valuable indicator of
a financial institution’s capital strength since it eliminates intangible assets from shareholders’ equity and retains the effect of unrealized losses on securities and
other components of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity.

Table 23 provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures with financial measures defined by GAAP.
