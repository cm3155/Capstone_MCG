Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Performance Summary

BOK Financial Corporation (“the Company”) reported net income of $156.5 million or $2.32 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2022 compared to $132.8
million or $1.96 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2022. Pre-provision net revenue ("PPNR"), a non-GAAP measure, increased $42.2 million to $211.2
million over the second quarter of 2022 as we grew core loans, experienced significant margin expansion and improved fee income.

Highlights of the third quarter of 2022 included:

•

•

•

•

Net interest revenue totaled $316.3 million, an increase of $42.3 million compared to the second quarter of 2022. Net interest margin was 3.24 percent
for the third quarter of 2022 compared to 2.76 percent for the prior quarter. In response to rising inflation, the Federal Reserve increased the federal
funds rate an additional 150 basis points in the third quarter following a 150 basis point increase in the first half of 2022. The resulting impact on
market interest rates has increased net interest margin.

Fees and commissions revenue totaled $192.6 million, an increase of $19.3 million. Brokerage and trading revenue increased $17.0 million, led by
higher margins on trading activity and record quarterly investment banking revenue.

The net cost of the changes in fair value of mortgage servicing rights and related economic hedges was $4.8 million for the third quarter of 2022
compared to a net benefit of $1.9 million for the second quarter of 2022 due to increased market volatility in the third quarter.

Other operating expense totaled $294.8 million, an increase of $21.1 million. Personnel expense increased $15.4 million, largely driven by higher
incentive compensation costs. Non-personnel expense increased $5.7 million, primarily related to an increase in seasonal occupancy expenses and
project-related professional fees and services.

Period-end outstanding loan balances totaled $21.8 billion at September 30, 2022, growing $499 million compared to June 30, 2022, largely due to
growth in commercial real estate loans and loans to individuals. Unfunded loan commitments also grew by $1.1 billion during the third quarter.
Average loan balances increased $542 million to $21.6 billion.

A $15.0 million provision for expected credit losses was recorded in the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to loan growth and increased uncertainty
in the economic outlook, partially offset by improving credit quality metrics. No provision for expected credit losses was necessary for the second
quarter of 2022. The combined allowance for credit losses totaled $298.1 million or 1.37 percent of outstanding loans at September 30, 2022. The
combined allowance for credit losses was $283.4 million or 1.33 percent of outstanding loans at June 30, 2022.

Nonperforming assets not guaranteed by U.S. government agencies increased $25 million compared to June 30, 2022. Potential problem loans
decreased $36 million while other loans especially mentioned decreased $13 million. Net charge-offs were $457 thousand or 0.01 percent of average
loans on an annualized basis for the third quarter of 2022. Net charge-offs were 0.02 percent of average loans over the last four quarters. Net charge-
offs were $799 thousand or 0.02 percent of average loans on an annualized basis for the second quarter of 2022.

Period-end deposits were $36.4 billion at September 30, 2022, a $2.2 billion decrease compared to June 30, 2022, consistent with industry trends as
customers redeploy resources following the savings trend during the height of the pandemic. Average deposits decreased $1.5 billion, including a $1.4
billion decrease in interest-bearing deposits.

The common equity Tier 1 capital ratio at September 30, 2022 was 11.80 percent. Other regulatory capital ratios included the Tier 1 capital ratio at
11.82 percent, total capital ratio at 12.81 percent, and leverage ratio at 9.76 percent. At June 30, 2022, the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was
11.61 percent, the Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.63 percent, total capital ratio was 12.59 percent, and leverage ratio was 9.12 percent.

The Company repurchased 548,034 shares of common stock at an average price of $91.20 per share in the third quarter of 2022 and 294,084 shares at
an average price of $82.98 in the second quarter of 2022. We view share buybacks opportunistically, but within the context of maintaining our strong
capital position. On November 1, 2022, the board of directors authorized the Company to purchase up to five million additional common shares,
subject to market conditions, securities law and other regulatory compliance limitations. This authorization replaces the existing board authorization
for the purchase of five million common shares, under which 4,651,465 shares were repurchased.

The Company paid a regular cash dividend of $35.7 million or $0.53 per common share during the third quarter of 2022. On November 1, 2022, the
board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.54 per common share payable on or about November 25, 2022 to shareholders of record as
of November 15, 2022.

Highlights of the nine months ended September 30, 2022 included:

•

•

•

•

•

Tax-equivalent net interest revenue totaled $864.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and $847.8 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2021. Net interest revenue decreased $13.5 million from changes in earning assets and increased $30.6 million from changes in
interest rates. Net interest margin was 2.80 percent compared to 2.63 percent. Average earning assets decreased $3.3 billion to $40.3 billion, primarily
due to a reduction in trading securities and loan balances, largely related to PPP loans. In response to rising inflation, the Federal Reserve increased
the federal funds rate 300 basis points since the beginning of 2022, which led to a 55 basis point increase in loan yields while funding costs only
increased 21 basis points. PPP loan fees totaled $7.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and $35.0 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2021. Remaining unaccreted PPP loan fees are not significant.

Fees and commissions revenue totaled $463.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, a $58.3 million decrease compared to the nine
months ended September 30, 2021. Mortgage banking revenue decreased $45.3 million as rapidly rising mortgage interest rates and continued
inventory shortages have adversely affected both loan production volume and margins. A $56.4 million decrease in trading revenue, due to disruption
in the fixed income markets related to economic uncertainty, primarily in the first quarter of 2022, was partially offset by a $25.9 million increase in
customer hedging revenue and $10.9 million increase in investment banking revenue. Fiduciary and asset management revenue increased $15.0
million, led by growth in mutual fund fees and Cavanal Hill fund fees. Other revenue decreased $19.8 million as a result of lower operating revenue
from repossessed oil and gas assets due to the sale of properties in the third quarter of 2021.

Other gains and losses, net decreased $66.0 million. The prior year included gains on alternative investments and sales of repossessed assets while the
current year included the write-down of a repossessed equity interest in a midstream entity and changes in the value of deferred compensation
investments, which are held to offset the cost of various employee benefit programs.

Total operating expense was $846.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, a decrease of $32.2 million compared to the nine months
ended September 30, 2021. Personnel expense decreased $36.4 million, primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs related to reduced cash-
based incentives resulting from lower loan and trading volume and deferred compensation expense. Non-personnel expense increased $4.2 million to
$361.5 million. Increased data processing, business promotion and occupancy and equipment costs were partially offset by lower mortgage banking
expense. Other expense decreased $11.5 million, largely due to lower expenses on repossessed oil and gas assets sold in the third quarter of 2021.

A $15.0 million provision for credit losses was recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to loan growth and increased
uncertainty in the economic outlook, partially offset by improving credit quality metrics. An $83.0 million negative provision for credit losses was
recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 due to forecasts for improving macroeconomic factors, including stabilizing energy prices,
and improving credit quality metrics.

Results of Operations

Net Interest Revenue and Net Interest Margin

Net interest revenue is the interest earned on debt securities, loans and other interest-earning assets less interest paid for interest-bearing deposits and other
borrowings. The net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax-equivalent net interest revenue by average interest-earning assets. Net interest spread is the
difference between the average rate earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is typically
greater than net interest spread due to interest income earned on assets funded by non-interest bearing liabilities such as demand deposits and equity.

Tax-equivalent net interest revenue totaled $318.5 million for the third quarter of 2022 and $276.1 million for the second quarter of 2022. Compared to the
second quarter of 2022, net interest revenue increased $43.9 million from changes in interest rates and decreased $1.5 million from changes in earning assets.
Table 1 shows the effect on net interest revenue from changes in average balances and interest rates for various types of earning assets and interest-bearing
liabilities.

Average earning assets decreased $534 million compared to the second quarter of 2022. Average trading securities were reduced by $989 million in response to
lower origination volumes in the residential mortgage industry driven by increases in interest rates. Average loan balances increased $542 million, largely due
to growth in commercial real estate loans and loans to individuals. The average balance of available for sale securities, which consists largely of residential and
commercial mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, decreased $2.0 billion while investment securities increased $2.0 billion.
This change reflects the full-quarter impact of the transfer of $2.4 billion of U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities from available for sale to the
investment securities portfolio late in the second quarter. We purchase securities to supplement earnings and to manage interest rate risk. Interest-bearing cash
and cash equivalents decreased $95 million.

Total average deposits were reduced by $1.5 billion compared to the second quarter of 2022 as customers deploy cash resources into higher yielding
alternatives. Funds purchased and repurchase agreements decreased $423 million while other borrowings increased $228 million.

Net interest margin was 3.24 percent compared to 2.76 percent in the second quarter of 2022. In response to rising inflation, the Federal Reserve increased the
federal funds rate 150 basis points in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total rate increases to 300 basis points. The resulting impact on market interest
rates increased net interest margin as our earning assets, led by variable-rate loans, reprice at a higher rate and faster pace than our interest-bearing liabilities.
The tax-equivalent yield on earning assets was 3.71 percent, an increase of 75 basis points. Loan yields increased 97 basis points to 4.89 percent. The yield on
trading securities was up 72 basis points to 2.72 percent. The available for sale securities portfolio yield increased 37 basis points to 2.21 percent. The yield on
investment securities decreased 93 basis points due to the transfer of securities from the available for sale portfolio to the investment portfolio. The yield on
interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents increased 104 basis points.

Funding costs were 0.76 percent, a 45 basis point increase. The cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 39 basis points to 0.63 percent. The cost of other
borrowings increased 132 basis points to 2.33 percent while the cost of funds purchased and repurchase agreements increased 19 basis points to 0.72 percent.
The benefit to net interest margin from assets funded by non-interest liabilities was 29 basis points, an increase of 18 basis points.

Our overall objective is to manage the Company’s balance sheet for changes in interest rates as is further described in the Market Risk section of this report.
Approximately 79 percent of our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios are either variable rate or fixed rate that will reprice within one
year. These loans are funded primarily by deposit accounts that are either non-interest bearing, or that reprice more slowly than the loans. The result is a
balance sheet that would be asset sensitive, which means that assets generally reprice more quickly than liabilities. One of the strategies that we use to manage
toward a relative rate-neutral position is to purchase fixed rate residential mortgage-backed securities issued primarily by U.S. government agencies and fund
them with market-rate-sensitive liabilities. The liability-sensitive nature of this strategy provides an offset to the asset-sensitive characteristics of our loan
portfolio. We also may use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risk. 

The effectiveness of these strategies is reflected in the overall change in net interest revenue due to changes in interest rates as shown in Table 1 and in the
interest rate sensitivity projections as shown in the Market Risk section of this report.

Other Operating Revenue

Other operating revenue was $189.7 million for the third quarter of 2022 and $168.6 million for the second quarter of 2022, driven largely by an increase in
brokerage and trading revenue related to higher margins on trading activity and growth in investment banking revenue.

Certain percentage increases (decreases) in non-fees and commissions revenue are not meaningful for comparison purposes based on the nature of the item.

Fees and commissions revenue

Diversified sources of fees and commissions revenue are a significant part of our business strategy and represented 38 percent of total revenue for the third
quarter of 2022, excluding provision for credit losses and gains and losses on other assets, securities and derivatives and the change in the fair value of
mortgage servicing rights. We believe that a variety of fee revenue sources provides an offset to changes in interest rates, values in the equity markets,
commodity prices and consumer spending, all of which can be volatile. Many of the economic factors such as rising interest rates that we expect will result in
growth in net interest revenue or fiduciary and asset management revenue may also decrease mortgage banking production volumes and related trading. The
velocity of changes in market conditions and interest rates may result in timing differences between when offsetting impacts and benefits are realized. As
interest rates are expected to move higher, we expect to experience increased benefits to our net interest margin which provides an offset to reduced mortgage-
related fee income. Generally, for operating revenues not as directly related to movement in interest rates, we expect growth to come through offering new
products and services and by further development of our presence in other markets. However, current and future economic conditions, including the recent
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory constraints, increased competition and saturation in our existing markets could affect the rate of future
increases.

Brokerage and Trading Revenue

Brokerage and trading revenue, which includes revenues from trading, customer hedging, retail brokerage and investment banking, increased $17.0 million or
39 percent compared to the second quarter of 2022.

- 5 -

 
 
Trading revenue includes net realized and unrealized gains and losses primarily related to residential mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by U.S.
government agencies and related derivative instruments that enable our mortgage banking customers to manage their production risk. Trading revenue also
includes net realized and unrealized gains and losses on municipal securities and other financial instruments that we sell to institutional customers, along with
changes in the fair value of financial instruments we hold as economic hedges against market risk of our trading securities. Trading revenue increased $14.5
million compared to the prior quarter. Higher margins on residential mortgage-backed securities trading activity were driven by favorable market conditions
and increased market volatility..

Investment banking, which includes fees earned upon completion of underwriting, financial advisory services and loan syndication fees, totaled $14.3 million
for the third quarter of 2022, an increase of $2.4 million compared to the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to growth in the size and number of municipal
bond transactions.

Customer hedging revenue is based primarily on realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of derivative contracts held for customer risk management
programs. As more fully discussed under Customer Derivative Programs in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, we offer commodity, interest rate,
foreign exchange and equity derivatives to our customers. Customer hedging revenue totaled $13.2 million for the third quarter of 2022, consistent with the
prior quarter. Customer hedging revenue includes credit valuation adjustments of the fair value of derivatives to reflect the risk of counterparty default.

Transaction Card Revenue

Transaction card revenue totaled $26.0 million for the third quarter of 2022, relatively consistent with the second quarter of 2022. , largely due to stimulus
measures and the broader reopening of the U.S. economy.
Fiduciary and Asset Management Revenue

Fiduciary and asset management revenue is earned through managing or holding of assets for customers and executing transactions or providing related
services. Approximately 90 percent of fiduciary and asset management revenue is primarily based on the fair value of assets. Rates applied to asset values vary
based on the nature of the relationship. Fiduciary relationships and managed asset relationships generally have higher fee rates than non-fiduciary and/or
managed relationships. Fiduciary and asset management revenue was relatively unchanged compared to the second quarter of 2022. Increased Cavanal Hill
money market fund fees and trust business line fees were offset by lower mutual fund fees and seasonal tax preparation fees.

Deposit Service Charges and Fees

Deposit service charges and fees were consistent with the second quarter of 2022. Overdraft and non-sufficient funds fees earned primarily on consumer
deposit accounts totaled $7.0 million for the third quarter of 2022, largely unchanged from the prior quarter. We are implementing changes in the fourth quarter
to eliminate non-sufficient funds fees and reduce consumer overdraft fees, which will result in lower total deposit service charges of approximately $2.5
million per quarter.

Mortgage Banking Revenue

Mortgage banking was unchanged compared to the second quarter of 2022. Growth in mortgage servicing revenue offset a reduction in mortgage production
revenue. Two acquisitions of mortgage servicing rights at the end of the second quarter led to an increase in mortgage servicing revenue of $1.8 million.
Mortgage production revenue decreased $1.9 million. Rising mortgage interest rates, low inventory, and home price affordability continue to place pressure on
mortgage loan originations. Mortgage production volume decreased $76 million to $230 million. Production revenue as a percentage of production volume,
which includes unrealized gains and losses on our mortgage commitment pipeline and related hedges, decreased 89 basis points to (1.05) percent, a result of
increased market competition and our securitization of loans previously repurchased from GNMA pools.

Net gains on other assets, securities and derivatives

Net gains on other assets were $979 thousand for the third quarter of 2022 compared to net losses of $7.6 million in the second quarter of 2022. The prior
quarter included a write-down of a repossessed equity interest in a midstream entity. This, combined with a change in the value of deferred compensation
investments, which are held to offset the cost of various employee benefit programs, resulted in the net gain on other assets in the current quarter.

As discussed in the Market Risk section following, the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights ("MSRs") changes in response to changes in primary
mortgage loan rates and other assumptions. We attempt to mitigate the earnings volatility caused by changes in the fair value of MSRs by designating certain
financial instruments as an economic hedge. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are generally expected to partially offset changes in the fair value of
MSRs.

Certain percentage increases (decreases) are not meaningful for comparison purposes.

Personnel expense

Personnel expense increased $15.4 million compared to the second quarter of 2022. Deferred compensation expense, which is largely offset by changes in the
value of related deferred compensation investments, increased $6.0 million. Growth in commercial lending, private wealth activity, and wealth municipal
underwriting activity led to a $4.9 million increase in cash-based incentive compensation. Share-based compensation expense increased $4.3 million due to the
benefit of changes in vesting assumptions in the second quarter. Higher regular compensation expense was offset by a decrease in employee benefit costs.

Non-personnel operating expense

Non-personnel expense totaled $124.4 million for the third quarter of 2022, an increase of $5.7 million compared to the second quarter of 2022. Higher
operating costs on leases led to a $1.8 million increase in net occupancy and equipment expenses while project-related professional fees led to a $1.6 million
increase in professional fees and services.

Income Taxes

The effective tax rate was 20.2 percent for the third quarter of 2022 and 21.4 percent for the second quarter of 2022. The effective tax rate for the third quarter
of 2022 decreased primarily due to a decrease in uncertain tax positions from lapses of applicable statutes of limitations. The effective tax rates for the nine
months ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 were 20.7 percent and 22.5 percent, respectively. The effective tax rate decreased primarily due to a
decrease in forecasted pre-tax income, a decrease in the Oklahoma tax rate, and a decrease in uncertain tax positions.

Lines of Business

We operate three principal lines of business: Commercial Banking, Consumer Banking and Wealth Management. Commercial Banking includes lending,
treasury and cash management services and customer risk management products for small businesses, middle market and larger commercial
customers. Commercial Banking also includes the TransFund EFT network. Consumer Banking includes retail lending and deposit services, lending and
deposit services to small business customers served through our consumer branch network and all mortgage banking activities. Wealth Management provides
fiduciary services, private banking services, insurance and investment advisory services in all markets. Wealth Management also underwrites state and
municipal securities and engages in brokerage and trading activities.

In addition to our lines of business, we have a Funds Management unit. The primary purpose of this unit is to manage our overall liquidity needs and interest
rate risk. Each line of business borrows funds from and provides funds to the Funds Management unit as needed to support their operations. Operating results
for Funds Management and other include the effect of interest rate risk positions and risk management activities, securities gains and losses including
impairment charges, the provision for credit losses in excess of net loans charged off, tax planning strategies and certain executive compensation costs that are
not attributed to the lines of business.

We allocate resources and evaluate the performance of our lines of business using the net direct contribution which includes the allocation of funds and capital
costs. Credit costs are attributed to the lines of business based on net loans charged off or recovered. The difference between credit costs attributed to the lines
of business and the consolidated provision for credit losses is attributed to Funds Management. In addition, we measure the performance of our business lines
after allocations of certain indirect expenses and taxes based on statutory rates.

The cost of funds borrowed from the Funds Management unit by the operating lines of business is transfer priced at rates that approximate market rates for
funds with similar repricing and cash flow characteristics. Market rates are generally based on the applicable wholesale borrowing rates or interest rate swap
rates, adjusted for prepayment risk and liquidity risk. This method of transfer-pricing funds that support assets of the operating lines of business tends to
insulate them from interest rate risk.

The value of funds provided by the operating lines of business to the Funds Management unit is also based on rates that approximate wholesale market rates for
funds with similar repricing and cash flow characteristics. Market rates are generally based on a proxy of wholesale borrowing rates or interest rate swap
rates. The funds credit formula applied to deposit products with indeterminate maturities is established based on their repricing characteristics reflected in a
combination of the short-term wholesale funding rate and a moving average of an intermediate term swap rate, with an appropriate spread applied to
both. Shorter duration products are weighted towards the short term wholesale funding rates and longer duration products are weighted towards the
intermediate swap rates. The expected duration ranges from 30 days for certain rate-sensitive deposits to five years.

Economic capital is assigned to the business units by a capital allocation model that reflects management’s assessment of risk. This model assigns capital based
upon credit, operating, interest rate and other market risk inherent in our business lines and recognizes the diversification benefits among the units. The level of
assigned economic capital is a combination of the risk taken by each business line based on its actual exposures and calibrated to its own loss history where
possible. Average invested capital includes economic capital and amounts we have invested in the lines of business.

As shown in Table 8, net income attributable to our lines of business increased $44.4 million compared to the second quarter of 2022. Net interest revenue
increased $46.4 million, primarily due to loan growth and changes in interest rates. Net charge-offs increased $1.2 million. Other operating revenue increased
$25.1 million, largely due to higher margins on residential mortgage-backed securities trading activity driven by favorable market conditions and increased
market volatility. Operating expense increased $9.2 million due to a combination of increased incentive compensation expense largely related to growing
commercial lending, private wealth and municipal underwriting activity, and increased project-related professional fees. The decrease in net income attributed
to Funds Management and other is largely due to the provision for credit losses in excess of net charge-offs.

Net interest revenue increased $40.4 million or 24 percent over the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to loan growth and increased interest rates.

Fees and commissions revenue decreased $1.7 million or 3 percent. Operating expense increased $5.9 million or 8 percent compared to the second quarter of
2022, primarily due to increased incentive compensation costs with growth in loans. The second quarter also included a $5.8 million write-down of a
repossessed equity interest in a midstream energy entity. Corporate expense allocations were consistent with the prior quarter.

Average outstanding balance of loans attributed to Commercial Banking increased $568 million or 3 percent over the second quarter of 2022 to $17.9 billion.
See the Loans section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition following for additional discussion of changes in commercial and
commercial real estate loans, which are primarily attributed to the Commercial Banking segment. 

Average deposits attributed to Commercial Banking were $18.0 billion for third quarter of 2022, a $967 million decrease compared to the second quarter of
2022. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital for further discussion of changes.

Consumer Banking

Consumer Banking provides retail banking services through four primary distribution channels: traditional branches, the 24-hour ExpressBank call center,
Internet banking and mobile banking. Consumer Banking also conducts mortgage banking activities through offices located outside of our Consumer Banking
markets.

Consumer Banking contributed $3.0 million to consolidated net income for the third quarter of 2022, an increase of $1.7 million or 140 percent over the prior
quarter. Growth in net interest revenue due to an increase in the spread on deposits sold to our Funds Management unit was partially offset by changes in the
fair value of mortgage servicing rights, net of economic hedges.

Certain percentage increases (decreases) in non-fees and commissions revenue are not meaningful for comparison purposes based on the nature of the item.

Net interest revenue from Consumer Banking activities increased $10.2 million or 30 percent compared to the second quarter of 2022, mainly due to an
increase in the spread on deposits sold to our Funds Management unit and increased interest rates.

- 16 -

 
 
Operating revenue and operating expense were consistent with the prior quarter. The net cost of the changes in fair value of mortgage servicing rights and
related economic hedges was $4.8 million for the third quarter of 2022 compared to a net benefit of $1.9 million for the second quarter of 2022. Corporate
expense allocations were consistent with the second quarter of 2022.

Both average loans and average deposits attributed to the Consumer Banking segment were relatively consistent with the previous quarter.

Wealth Management

Wealth Management contributed $41.8 million to consolidated net income in the third quarter of 2022, an increase of $14.5 million or 53 percent over the
second quarter of 2022, largely due to higher margins on trading activity and record quarterly investment banking revenue.

Certain percentage increases (decreases) in non-fees and commissions revenue are not meaningful for comparison purposes based on the nature of the item.

Combined net interest revenue and fee revenue increased $22.2 million or 18 percent. Total revenue from trading activities increased $5.0 million over the
second quarter of 2022, primarily due to higher margins on U.S. agency residential mortgage-backed securities trading activity. Investment banking revenue
grew $3.2 million due to growth in the size and number of municipal bonds underwritten. Other revenue increased $8.3 million, primarily due to an increase in
derivative margin use fees. Operating expense increased $2.8 million or 4 percent, largely due to increased volume-driven incentive compensation costs.

Average outstanding loans attributed to the Wealth Management segment were consistent with the prior quarter. Average Wealth Management deposits
decreased $484 million or 6 percent to $8.0 billion. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity
and Capital for further discussion of changes.

Financial Condition

Securities

We maintain a securities portfolio to enhance profitability, manage interest rate risk, provide liquidity and comply with regulatory requirements. Securities are
classified as trading, held for investment, or available for sale. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the composition of the securities
portfolio as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

We hold an inventory of trading securities in support of sales to a variety of customers, including banks, corporations, insurance companies, money managers
and others. Trading securities decreased $665 million to $2.2 billion during the third quarter of 2022 in response to lower origination volumes in the residential
mortgage industry driven by increases in interest rates. As discussed in the Market Risk section of this report, trading activities involve risk of loss from
adverse price movement. We mitigate this risk within board-approved limits through the use of derivative contracts, short-sales and other techniques.

At September 30, 2022, the carrying value of investment (held-to-maturity) securities was $2.6 billion, including a $612 thousand allowance for expected
credit losses compared to $2.6 billion at June 30, 2022 with a $717 thousand allowance for expected credit losses. The fair value of investment securities was
$2.4 billion at September 30, 2022 and $2.6 billion at June 30, 2022. Investment securities consist primarily of residential mortgage-backed securities issued by
U.S. government agencies, intermediate and long-term, fixed rate Oklahoma and Texas municipal bonds, and taxable Texas school construction bonds. During
the second quarter of 2022, the Company transferred certain U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities from the available for sale portfolio to the
investment securities portfolio to limit the effect of future rate increases on the tangible common equity ratio. No gains or losses were recognized in the
Consolidated Statements of Earnings at the time of the transfer. At the time of transfer, the fair value totaled $2.4 billion, amortized cost totaled $2.7 billion and
the pretax unrealized loss totaled $268 million. Transfers of debt securities into the investment securities portfolio are made at fair value at the date of transfer.
The unrealized holding gain or loss at the date of transfer is retained in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and in the carrying value of the investment
securities portfolio. Such amounts are amortized over the estimated remaining life of the security as an adjustment to yield, offsetting the related amortization
of the premium or accretion of the discount on the transferred securities.

Available for sale securities, which may be sold prior to maturity, are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains or losses, net of deferred taxes, are recorded as
accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity. The amortized cost of available for sale securities totaled $11.0 billion at September 30,
2022, a $301 million increase compared to June 30, 2022. At September 30, 2022, the available for sale securities portfolio consisted primarily of U.S.
government agency residential mortgage-backed securities and U.S. government agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. Both residential and
commercial mortgage-backed securities have credit risk from delinquency or default of the underlying loans. We mitigate this risk by primarily investing in
securities issued by U.S. government agencies. Principal and interest payments on the underlying loans are fully guaranteed. Commercial mortgage-backed
securities have prepayment penalties similar to commercial loans.

A primary risk of holding residential mortgage-backed securities comes from extension during periods of rising interest rates or prepayment during periods of
falling interest rates. We evaluate this risk through extensive modeling of risk both before making an investment and throughout the life of the security. Our
best estimate of the duration of the combined residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio held in investment and available for sale securities at September
30, 2022 is 3.4 years. Management estimates the duration extends to 3.7 years assuming an immediate 200 basis point upward shock. The estimated duration
contracts to 3.2 years assuming a 100 basis point decline in the current low-rate environment. Management also regularly monitors the impact of interest rate
risk on the available for sale securities portfolio on our tangible equity ratio under various shock scenarios. Throughout the third quarter of 2022, this exposure
was reported and monitored by management, and the portfolio's actual performance remained within expectations.

- 19 -

Bank-Owned Life Insurance

We have approximately $408 million of bank-owned life insurance at September 30, 2022. This investment is expected to provide a long-term source of
earnings to support existing employee benefit programs. Approximately $313 million is held in separate accounts and $95 million represents the cash surrender
value of policies held in general accounts and other amounts due from various insurance companies. Our separate account holdings are invested in diversified
portfolios of investment-grade fixed income securities and cash equivalents, including U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, residential mortgage-backed
securities, corporate debt, asset-backed and commercial mortgage-backed securities. The portfolios are managed by unaffiliated professional managers within
parameters established in the portfolio’s investment guidelines. The cash surrender value of certain life insurance policies is further supported by a stable value
wrap, which protects against changes in the fair value of the investments. As of September 30, 2022, the fair value of investments held in separate accounts
covered by the stable value wrap was approximately $277 million. Since the underlying fair value of the investments held in separate accounts at September
30, 2022 was below the net book value of the investments, $34 million of cash surrender value was supported by the stable value wrap. The remaining $2
million of fair value held in separate accounts is not supported by the stable value wrap. During the third quarter of 2022, the fair value of this portfolio
declined, driven by continued increases in interest rates, and exceeded the maximum support from the stable value wrap. A $4.5 million write-down was
recognized. Future rate increases may cause additional write-downs in the short-term. Write-downs driven by market interest rate increases are expected to
benefit portfolio returns over the life of the program. The stable value wrap is provided by a domestic financial institution.

Loans

The aggregate loan portfolio before allowance for loan losses totaled $21.8 billion at September 30, 2022, a $499 million increase over June 30, 2022. Core
loans, which exclude paycheck protection program loans, grew by $522 million, primarily due to growth in commercial real estate loans and loans to
individuals. Unfunded loan commitments also grew by $1.1 billion during the third quarter.

Commercial loans represent loans for working capital, facilities acquisition or expansion, purchases of equipment and other needs of commercial customers
primarily located within our geographical footprint. These loans are underwritten individually and represent ongoing relationships based on a thorough
knowledge of the customer, the customer’s industry and market. While commercial loans are generally secured by the customer’s assets including real property,
inventory, accounts receivable, operating equipment, interests in mineral rights and other property and may also include personal guarantees of the owners and
related parties, the primary source of repayment of the loans is the ongoing cash flow from operations of the customer’s business. In addition, revolving lines of
credit are generally governed by a borrowing base. Inherent lending risks are centrally monitored on a continuous basis from underwriting throughout the life
of the loan for compliance with commercial lending policies.

Commercial loans totaled $13.6 billion or 62 percent of the loan portfolio at September 30, 2022, largely unchanged compared to June 30, 2022. Growth in
healthcare and general business loans were offset by a decrease in services and energy loan balances.

- 21 -

 
 
Approximately 74 percent of loans in this segment are located within our geographic footprint based on collateral location. Loans for which the collateral
location is less relevant, such as unsecured loans and reserve-based energy loans are categorized by the borrower's primary operating location. The largest
concentration of loans in this segment outside of our footprint is California, totaling 5 percent of the segment.

Supporting the energy industry with loans to producers and other energy-related entities has been a hallmark of the Company since its founding and represents
a large portion of our commercial loan portfolio. In addition, energy production and related industries have a significant impact on the economy in our primary
markets. Loans collateralized by oil and gas properties are subject to a semi-annual engineering review by our internal staff of petroleum engineers. This
review is used as the basis for developing the expected cash flows supporting the loan amount. The projected cash flows are discounted according to risk
characteristics of the underlying oil and gas properties. Loans are evaluated to demonstrate with reasonable certainty that crude oil, natural gas and natural gas
liquids can be recovered from known oil and gas reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions at current pricing levels and with existing
conventional equipment and operating methods and costs. As part of our evaluation of credit quality, we analyze rigorous stress tests over a range of
commodity prices and take proactive steps to mitigate risk when appropriate.

Outstanding energy loans totaled $3.4 billion or 15 percent of total loans at September 30, 2022, a $21 million decrease compared to June 30, 2022.
Approximately $2.7 billion of energy loans were to oil and gas producers, a $48 million increase over June 30, 2022. The majority of this portfolio is first lien,
senior secured, reserve-based lending, which we believe is the lowest risk form of energy lending. Approximately 72 percent of the committed production loans
are secured by properties primarily producing oil, and 28 percent of the committed production loans are secured by properties primarily producing natural gas.

Loans to midstream oil and gas companies totaled $549 million at September 30, 2022, a $90 million decrease compared to June 30, 2022. Loans to borrowers
that provide services to the energy industry totaled $139 million at September 30, 2022, an increase of $4.2 million. Loans to other energy borrowers, including
those engaged in wholesale or retail energy sales, totaled $25 million, a $17 million increase over the prior quarter.

Unfunded energy loan commitments were $3.5 billion at September 30, 2022, growing $107 million over June 30, 2022.

The healthcare sector of the loan portfolio totaled $3.8 billion or 18 percent of total loans. Healthcare loans increased $130 million over June 30, 2022,
primarily due to growth in loans to senior housing facilities and hospital systems. This was partially offset by a decrease in balances to other medical practices
compared to the prior quarter. Healthcare sector loans consist primarily of loans for the development and operation of senior housing and care facilities
including independent living, assisted living and skilled nursing. Generally we loan to borrowers with a portfolio of multiple facilities that serves to help
diversify risks specific to a single facility.
The services sector of the loan portfolio totaled $3.3 billion or 15 percent of total loans, a $141 million decrease compared to the prior quarter. Service sector
loans consist of a large number of loans to a variety of businesses including Native American tribal and state and local governments, Native American tribal
casino operations, foundations and not-for-profit organizations, educational services and specialty trade contractors. Approximately $1.6 billion of the services
category is made up of loans with individual balances of less than $10 million. Services sector loans are generally secured by the assets of the borrower with
repayment coming from the cash flows of ongoing operations of the customer’s business. 

General business loans totaled $3.1 billion or 14 percent of total loans, an increase of $61 million over the prior quarter. General business loans consist of $1.8
billion of wholesale/retail loans and $1.3 billion of loans from other commercial industries.

We participate in shared national credits when appropriate to obtain or maintain business relationships with local customers. Shared national credits are defined
by banking regulators as credits of $100 million or more and with three or more non-affiliated banks as participants. At September 30, 2022, the outstanding
principal balance of these loans totaled $5.0 billion, including $2.3 billion of energy loans. Substantially all of these loans are to borrowers with local market
relationships. We serve as the agent lender in approximately 22 percent of our shared national credits, based on dollars committed. We hold shared national
credits to the same standard of analysis and perform the same level of review as internally originated credits. Our lending policies generally avoid loans in
which we do not have the opportunity to maintain or achieve other business relationships with the customer. In addition to management’s quarterly assessment
of credit risk, banking regulators annually review a sample of shared national credits for proper risk grading.

Commercial Real Estate

Commercial real estate represents loans for the construction of buildings or other improvements to real estate and property held by borrowers for investment
purposes generally within our geographical footprint. We require collateral values in excess of the loan amounts, demonstrated cash flows in excess of expected
debt service requirements, equity investment in the project and a portion of the project already sold, leased or permanent financing already secured. The
expected cash flows from all significant new or renewed income producing property commitments are stress tested to reflect the risks in varying interest rates,
vacancy rates and rental rates. As with commercial loans, inherent lending risks are centrally monitored on a continuous basis from underwriting throughout the
life of the loan for compliance with applicable lending policies.

The outstanding balance of commercial real estate loans grew by $368 million over June 30, 2022 to $4.5 billion or 21 percent of total loans at September 30,
2022. Multifamily residential loans increased $248 million to $1.1 billion at September 30, 2022. Loans secured by industrial facilities grew by $150 million to
$1.1 billion. This growth was partially offset by a $20 million decrease in residential construction and land development loans and a $14 million decrease in
loans secured by office buildings.

Approximately 69 percent of loans in this segment are in our geographic footprint based on collateral location. The largest concentration of loans in this
segment outside our footprint is Utah, totaling 10 percent of the segment. All other states represent less than 5 percent individually.

Paycheck Protection Program

We actively participated in programs initiated by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act"), including the Small Business
Administration's ("SBA") Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP") that began on April 3, 2020. PPP provided fully forgivable loans when utilized for qualified
expenditures, including to help small businesses maintain payrolls during the COVID-19 pandemic. The remaining loans in this portfolio generally have a
contractual term of five years, though most are expected to be forgiven prior to maturity after completion of a compliance period. Loans are guaranteed and
amounts forgiven will be reimbursed to the Company by the SBA. The loans carry a fixed interest rate of 1 percent. Interest plus loan fees, which vary
depending on loan size, are accrued over the contractual life of the loan. Remaining unaccreted origination fees were not significant at September 30, 2022.

Loans to Individuals

Loans to individuals include residential mortgage and personal loans. Residential mortgage loans provide funds for our customers to purchase or refinance their
primary residence or to borrow against the equity in their home. These loans are secured by a first or second mortgage on the customer's primary residence.
Personal loans consist primarily of loans to Wealth Management clients secured by the cash surrender value of insurance policies and marketable securities.
Personal loans also include direct loans secured by and for the purchase of automobiles, recreational and marine equipment as well as unsecured loans. These
loans are made in accordance with underwriting policies we believe to be conservative and are fully documented. Loans may be individually underwritten or
credit scored based on size and other criteria. Credit scoring is assessed based on significant credit characteristics including credit history, residential and
employment stability.

In general, we sell the majority of our conforming fixed-rate loan originations in the secondary market and retain the majority of our non-conforming and
adjustable-rate mortgage loans. Our mortgage loan portfolio does not include payment option adjustable-rate mortgage loans or adjustable-rate mortgage loans
with initial rates that are below market. Home equity loans are primarily first-lien and fully amortizing.

Residential mortgage loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies have limited credit exposure because of the agency guarantee. This amount includes
residential mortgage loans previously sold into GNMA mortgage pools that the Company may repurchase when certain defined delinquency criteria are met.
Because of this repurchase right, the Company is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans and must include them on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet.

Approximately 91 percent of the loans in this segment are secured by collateral located within our geographical footprint. Loans for which the collateral
location is less relevant, such as unsecured loans are categorized by the borrower’s primary location.

The Company secondarily evaluates loan portfolio performance based on the primary geographical market managing the loan. Loans attributed to a
geographical market may not represent the location of the borrower or the collateral. All permanent mortgage loans serviced by our mortgage banking unit and
held for investment by the Company are centrally managed by the Oklahoma market.

Off-Balance Sheet Commitments

We enter into certain off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business as shown in Table 14. Loan commitments may be unconditional
obligations to provide financing or conditional obligations that depend on the borrower’s financial condition, collateral value or other factors. Standby letters of
credit are unconditional commitments to guarantee the performance of our customer to a third party. Since some of these commitments are expected to expire
before being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.

We have off-balance sheet commitments related to certain residential mortgage loans sold into mortgage-backed securities as part of our mortgage banking
activities. We retain off-balance sheet credit risk related to losses in excess of amounts guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs ("VA").

We also have off-balance sheet credit risk related to certain residential mortgage loans primarily originated under community development loan programs that
were sold to a U.S. government agency with full recourse prior to 2007. We are obligated to repurchase these loans for the life of these loans in the event of
foreclosure for the unpaid principal and interest at the time of foreclosure. The majority of our conforming fixed rate loan originations are sold in the secondary
market, and we only retain repurchase obligations under standard underwriting representations and warranties.

We offer programs that permit our customers to hedge various risks, including fluctuations in energy, cattle and other agricultural product prices, interest rates
and foreign exchange rates. Each of these programs work essentially the same way. Derivative contracts are executed between the customers and the
Company. Offsetting contracts are executed between the Company and selected counterparties to minimize market risk due to changes in commodity prices,
interest rates or foreign exchange rates. The counterparty contracts are identical to the customer contracts except for a fixed pricing spread or a fee paid to us as
compensation for administrative costs, credit risk and profit.

The customer derivative programs create credit risk for potential amounts due to the Company from our customers and from the counterparties. Customer
credit risk is monitored through existing credit policies and procedures. The effects of changes in commodity prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates are
evaluated across a range of possible scenarios to determine the maximum exposure we are willing to have individually to any customer. Customers may also be
required to provide cash margin or other collateral in conjunction with our credit agreements to further limit our credit risk.

Counterparty credit risk is evaluated through existing policies and procedures. This evaluation considers the total relationship between BOK Financial and each
of the counterparties. Individual limits are established by management, approved by Credit Administration and reviewed by the Asset/Liability
Committee. Margin collateral is required if the exposure between the Company and any counterparty exceeds established limits. Based on declines in the
counterparties’ credit ratings, these limits may be reduced and additional margin collateral may be required.

A deterioration of the credit standing of one or more of the customers or counterparties to these contracts may result in BOK Financial recognizing a loss as the
fair value of the affected contracts may no longer move in tandem with the offsetting contracts. This occurs if the credit standing of the customer or
counterparty deteriorates such that either the fair value of underlying collateral no longer supports the contract or the customer or the counterparty’s ability to
provide margin collateral becomes impaired. Credit losses on customer derivatives reduce brokerage and trading revenue in the Consolidated Statements of
Earnings.

Derivative contracts are carried at fair value. At September 30, 2022, the net fair values of derivative contracts, before consideration of cash margin, reported as
assets under these programs totaled $1.5 billion compared to $2.0 billion at June 30, 2022. At September 30, 2022, the net fair value of our derivative contracts
included $1.1 billion for energy contracts, $237 million for foreign exchange contracts and $170 million for interest rate swaps. The aggregate net fair value of
derivative contracts, before consideration of cash margin, held under these programs reported as liabilities totaled $1.5 billion at September 30, 2022 and $2.0
billion at June 30, 2022.

At September 30, 2022, total derivative assets were reduced by $148 million of cash collateral received from counterparties and total derivative liabilities were
reduced by $1.0 billion of cash collateral paid to counterparties related to instruments executed with the same counterparty under a master netting agreement.
Derivative contracts executed with customers may be secured by non-cash collateral in conjunction with a credit agreement with that customer, such as proven
producing oil and gas properties. Access to this collateral in event of default is reasonably assured.

A table showing the notional and fair value of derivative assets and liabilities on both a gross and net basis is presented in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

The fair value of derivative contracts reported as assets under these programs, net of cash margin held by the Company, by category of debtor at September 30,
2022 follows in Table 15.

At September 30, 2022, our largest derivative exposure was to an exchange for $83 million of net derivative positions and $56 million of cash margin placed.

Our customer derivative program also introduces liquidity and capital risk. We are required to provide cash margin to certain counterparties when the net
negative fair value of the contracts exceeds established limits. Also, changes in commodity prices affect the amount of regulatory capital we are required to
hold as support for the fair value of our derivative assets. These risks are modeled as part of the management of these programs. Based on current prices, a
decrease in market prices down to an equivalent of $64.86 per barrel of oil would decrease the fair value of derivative assets by $499 million, with lending
customers comprising the bulk of the assets. An increase in prices up to an equivalent of $94.12 per barrel of oil would increase the fair value of derivative
assets by $613 million as asset values rise faster than margin paid. Liquidity requirements of this program may also be affected by our credit rating. At
September 30, 2022, a decrease in our credit rating to below investment grade would increase our obligation to post cash margin on existing contracts by
approximately $10 million. The fair value of our to-be-announced residential mortgage-backed securities and interest rate swap derivative contracts is affected
by changes in interest rates. Based on our assessment as of September 30, 2022, changes in interest rates would not materially impact regulatory capital or
liquidity needed to support this portion of our customer derivative program.

Allowance for Loan Losses and Accrual for Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk from Unfunded Loan Commitments

Expected credit losses on assets carried at amortized cost are recognized over their expected lives based on models that measure the probability of default and
loss given default over a 12-month reasonable and supportable forecast period. Models incorporate base case, downside and upside macroeconomic variables
such as real gross domestic product ("GDP") growth, civilian unemployment rate and West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") oil prices on a probability weighted
basis. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of methodology of allowance for loan losses.

A $15.0 million provision for credit losses was necessary for the third quarter of 2022, primarily related to strong loan growth in loans and unfunded
commitments during the quarter. The level of uncertainty in the current economic outlook increased, resulting in an increase in the probability weighting of the
downside scenario. In addition, the key economic factors were slightly less favorable to economic growth across all scenarios. These changes were offset by a
decrease in expected losses on commercial real estate, energy, healthcare and services loans. Credit quality metrics also continued to improve. Non-pass grade
loans, including loans especially mentioned, accruing substandard and nonaccruing loans decreased $33 million compared to June 30, 2022. Non-pass grade
energy, services and general business loans were partially offset by increased non-pass grade healthcare and commercial real estate loans. A summary of
outstanding loan balances by risk grade is included in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The federal funds rate is increased at
Federal Reserve Open Market ("FOMC")
meetings through December 2022, which
results in a target range of 4.00 percent to
4.25 percent. Inflation peaks in the third
quarter of 2022 and begins to slowly
normalize thereafter. There are no
additional rate increases in 2023.

Labor force participants continue to re-enter
the job market to meet the record number of
job openings. Inflation pressures cause
modest declines in real household income
compared to pre-pandemic levels resulting
in below-trend GDP growth.

– GDP is forecasted to grow by 1.4
percent over the next 12 months.

– Civilian unemployment rate of 3.9
percent in the fourth quarter of
2022 increases to 4.1 percent by
the third quarter of 2023.
– WTI oil prices are projected to
generally follow the NYMEX
forward curve that existed at the
end of September 2022 and are
expected to average $81.86 per
barrel over the next 12 months.

Macro-economic
factors

Higher levels of inflation force the Federal
Reserve to adopt a more aggressive
monetary policy to combat the inflationary
environment. This results in a target range
of 4.75 percent to 5.00 percent by
September 2023. Inflation peaks in the
fourth quarter of 2022 and remains elevated
through the third quarter of 2023. This
pushes the United States into a recession,
with a contraction in economic activity and
a sharp increase in the unemployment rate.

– GDP is forecasted to contract 1.3
percent over the next twelve
months.

– Civilian unemployment rate of 4.5
percent in the fourth quarter of
2022 increases to 6.4 percent in the
third quarter of 2023.

– WTI oil prices are projected to

average $72.58 over the next 12
months, with a peak of $92.87 in
the fourth quarter of 2022 and
falling 39% over the following
three quarters.

The federal funds rate is increased at
FOMC meetings through December 2022,
which results in a target range of 3.50
percent to 3.75 percent. Inflation peaks in
the third quarter of 2022 and begins to
normalize thereafter. There are no
additional rate increases in 2023.

Labor force participants continue to re-enter
the job market to meet the record number of
job openings. The increase in employment
helps maintain household income above its
pre-pandemic trend. This coupled with the
drawdown in savings, supports consumer
spending and produces GDP growth
consistent with pre-pandemic levels.

– GDP is forecasted to grow by 1.8
percent over the next 12 months.

– Civilian unemployment rate of 3.7
percent in the third quarter of 2022
increases to 3.8 percent by the
third quarter of 2023.

– WTI oil prices are projected to

average $80.04 per barrel over the
next 12 months.

The sensitivity to management's economic scenario weighting may be quantified by comparing the results of weighting each
economic scenario at 100%. For example, compared to a 100% Base Case scenario, a 100% Downside case would result in an
additional $135 million in quantitative reserve at September 30, 2022. Such sensitivity calculations do not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future
changes in the related allowance.

At September 30, 2022, the allowance for loan losses totaled $242 million or 1.11 percent of outstanding loans. Excluding residential mortgage loans
guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, the allowance for loan losses was 212 percent of nonaccruing loans. The combined allowance for loan losses and
accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments was $298 million or 1.37 percent of outstanding loans and 262 percent of
nonaccruing loans at September 30, 2022.

No provision for credit losses was necessary for the second quarter of 2022. At June 30, 2022, the allowance for loan losses was $241 million or 1.13 percent of
outstanding loans. Excluding residential mortgage loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, the allowance for loan losses was 251 percent of
nonaccruing loans. The combined allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments was $283 million or
1.33 percent of outstanding loans and 295 percent of nonaccruing loans.

Net Loans Charged Off

Net recoveries of commercial loans were $646 thousand in the third quarter of 2022. Net commercial real estate loan recoveries were $7 thousand and net
charge-offs of loans to individuals were $1.1 million. Net charge-offs of loans to individuals include deposit account overdraft losses.

Accrual for Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk Associated with Mortgage Banking Activities

The accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk associated with mortgage banking activities includes consideration of credit risk related to certain residential
mortgage loans sold into mortgage-backed securities in excess of amounts guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veteran's Affairs ("VA") and mortgage loans
originated under community development loan programs that were sold to a U.S. government agency with full recourse.

We use publicly available long-term national data to estimate total loss given default for our off-balance sheet credit risk related to losses in excess of amounts
guaranteed by the VA. This result is combined with probability of default output from our mortgage servicing rights model to estimate total expected loss.
Then, we estimate the VA's guarantee percentage to determine our portion of the credit risk. Qualitative adjustment may be used, if necessary.

Allowance for Credit Losses Related to Held-to-Maturity (Investment) Securities

The expected credit losses principles apply to all financial assets measured at cost, including our held-to-maturity (investment) debt securities portfolio. Our
investment portfolio includes municipal and other tax-exempt securities and other debt securities. Expected credit losses for these assets is based on probability
of default and loss given default assumptions that align with similarly graded loans. Qualitative adjustment may be used, if necessary.

- 30 -

Nonperforming Assets

As more fully described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, loans are generally classified as nonaccruing when it becomes probable that we
will not collect the full contractual principal and interest. Accruing renegotiated loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies represent residential mortgage
loans that have been modified in troubled debt restructurings. Interest continues to accrue based on the modified terms of the loan and loans may be sold once
they become eligible according to U.S. government agency guidelines. Real estate and other repossessed assets are assets acquired in partial or total forgiveness
of loans. The assets are carried at the lower of cost as determined by fair value at the date of foreclosure or current fair value, less estimated selling costs. A
summary of nonperforming assets follows in Table 17:

Excluding assets guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, nonperforming assets increased $25 million from June 30, 2022, primarily due to a $27 million
increase in nonaccruing healthcare and $12 million increase in nonaccruing services loans, partially offset by a $17 million decrease in nonaccruing energy
loans. Newly identified nonaccruing loans totaled $54 million, offset by $24 million of payments, $8.2 million in foreclosures and $1.8 million of charge-offs.
The Company generally retains nonperforming assets to maximize potential recovery, which may cause future nonperforming assets to decrease more slowly.

We foreclose on loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies in accordance with agency guidelines. Generally these loans are not eligible for modification
programs or have failed to comply with modified loan terms. Principal is guaranteed by agencies of the U.S. government, subject to limitations and credit risk
is limited. At foreclosure, these amounts are transferred to claims receivable accounts. These properties will be conveyed to the agencies once applicable
criteria have been met.

Real Estate and Other Repossessed Assets

Real estate and other repossessed assets totaled $30 million at September 30, 2022, composed primarily of $22 million of developed commercial real estate.
Real estate and other repossessed assets increased $7.5 million compared to June 30, 2022.

Liquidity and Capital

Based on the average balances for the third quarter of 2022, approximately 82 percent of our funding was provided by deposit accounts, 5 percent from
borrowed funds, less than 1 percent from long-term subordinated debt and 11 percent from equity. Our funding sources, which primarily include deposits and
borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Banks and other banks, provide adequate liquidity to meet our operating needs.

Subsidiary Bank

Deposits and borrowed funds are the primary sources of liquidity for BOKF, NA, the wholly owned subsidiary bank of BOK Financial. We compete for retail
and commercial deposits by offering a broad range of products and services and focusing on customer convenience. Retail deposit growth is supported through
personal and small business checking, online bill paying services, mobile banking services, an extensive network of branch locations and ATMs and our
ExpressBank call center. Commercial deposit growth is supported by offering treasury management and lockbox services. We also acquire brokered deposits
when the cost of funds is advantageous to other funding sources.

Average deposits for the third quarter of 2022 totaled $37.0 billion, a $1.5 billion decrease compared to the second quarter of 2022. Deposit balances continue
to decline, consistent with industry trends, as customers redeploy resources following the savings trend during the height of the pandemic. Interest-bearing
transaction account balances decreased $1.5 billion. Demand deposits decreased $97 million. Certificate of deposit balances increased $36 million.

In addition to deposits, liquidity is provided primarily by federal funds purchased, securities repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank
borrowings. Federal funds purchased consist primarily of unsecured, overnight funds acquired from other financial institutions. Funds are primarily purchased
from bankers’ banks and Federal Home Loan banks from across the country. The Company has no wholesale federal funds purchased at September 30, 2022.
Securities repurchase agreements generally mature within 90 days and are secured by certain available for sale and trading securities. Federal Home Loan Bank
borrowings are generally short-term and are secured by a blanket pledge of eligible collateral (generally unencumbered U.S. Treasury and agency mortgage-
backed securities, 1-4 family residential mortgage loans, multifamily and other qualifying commercial real estate loans). Amounts borrowed from the Federal
Home Loan Bank of Topeka averaged $1.5 billion during the quarter, compared to $1.3 billion in the second quarter of 2022.

At September 30, 2022, the estimated unused credit available to BOKF, NA from collateralized sources was approximately $14 billion.

A summary of other borrowings for BOK Financial on a consolidated basis follows in Table 21.

BOKF, NA also has a liability related to the repurchase of certain delinquent residential mortgage loans previously sold in GNMA mortgage pools. Interest is
payable monthly at rates contractually due to investors if delinquent loans are not repurchased from the GNMA mortgage pools.

Parent Company

At September 30, 2022, cash and interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents held by the parent company totaled $175 million. The primary sources of liquidity
for BOK Financial are cash on hand and dividends from BOKF, NA. Dividends from the bank are limited by various banking regulations to net profits, as
defined, for the year plus retained profits for the two preceding years. Dividends are further restricted by minimum capital requirements. At September 30,
2022, based upon the most restrictive limitations as well as management's internal capital policy, BOKF, NA could declare up to $267 million of dividends.
Dividend constraints may be alleviated through increases in retained earnings, capital issuances or changes in risk weighted assets. Future losses or increases in
required regulatory capital at the bank could affect its ability to pay dividends to the parent company.

Our equity capital at September 30, 2022 was $4.5 billion, a $227 million decrease compared to June 30, 2022. Net income less cash dividends paid increased
equity $121 million during the third quarter of 2022. Changes in interest rates resulted in a $302 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income
compared to June 30, 2022. We also repurchased $50 million of common stock during the third quarter of 2022. Capital is managed to maximize long-term
value to the shareholders. Factors considered in managing capital include projections of future earnings including expected benefits from lower federal income
tax rates, asset growth and acquisition strategies, and regulatory and debt covenant requirements. Capital management may include subordinated debt or
perpetual preferred stock issuance, share repurchase and stock and cash dividends.

On April 30, 2019, the board of directors authorized the Company to purchase up to five million common shares, subject to market conditions, securities law
and other regulatory compliance limitations. As of September 30, 2022, 4,651,465 shares have been repurchased under this authorization. The Company
repurchased 548,034 shares of common stock at an average price of $91.20 a share in the third quarter of 2022. We view share buybacks opportunistically, but
within the context of maintaining our strong capital position.

On November 1, 2022, the board of directors authorized the Company to purchase up to five million additional common shares, subject to market conditions,
securities law and other regulatory compliance limitations. This authorization replaces the existing board authorization for the purchase of five million common
shares, under which 4,651,465 shares were repurchased.

BOK Financial and BOKF, NA are subject to various capital requirements administered by federal agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can
result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that could have a material impact on operations. These capital
requirements include quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items. The capital standards are also subject to qualitative judgments by
the regulators.

A summary of minimum capital requirements, including a capital conservation buffer follows in Table 22. A bank which falls below these levels, including the
capital conservation buffer, would be subject to regulatory restrictions on capital distributions (including, but not limited to, dividends and share repurchases)
and executive bonus payments.

In March 2020, in response to the impact on the financial markets by the COVID-19 pandemic, the banking agencies issued an interim final rule permitting
banking organizations that implement the current expected credit loss ("CECL") model the option to delay for two years an estimate of the CECL
methodology's effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. The estimate includes the implementation date adjustment as of January
1, 2020 plus an estimate of the impact of the change for a two year period following implementation of CECL. We elected to delay the regulatory capital
impact of the transition in accordance with the interim final rule. Deferral of the impact of CECL added 9 basis points to the Company's Common equity Tier 1
capital at September 30, 2022.

The capital ratios for BOK Financial on a consolidated basis are presented in Table 22.

Capital resources of financial institutions are also regularly measured by the tangible common shareholders’ equity ratio. Tangible common shareholders’
equity is shareholders’ equity as defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) less intangible assets and
equity which does not benefit common shareholders. Equity that does not benefit common shareholders includes preferred equity. This non-GAAP measure is a
valuable indicator of a financial institution’s capital strength since it eliminates intangible assets from shareholders’ equity and retains the effect of unrealized
losses on securities and other components of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity.

Table 23 provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures with financial measures defined by GAAP.

Pre-provision net revenue is a measure of revenue less expenses, and is calculated before provision for credit losses and income tax expense. This financial
measure is frequently used by investors and analysts to enable them to assess a company's ability to generate earnings to cover credit losses through a credit
cycle. It also provides an additional basis for comparing the results of operations between periods by isolating the impact of the provision for credit losses,
which can vary significantly between periods.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the Company’s significant off-balance sheet commitments.
