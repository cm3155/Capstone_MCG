Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Performance Summary

BOK Financial Corporation (“the Company”) reported net income of $62.5 million or $0.91 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2022. Net income was
$117.3 million or $1.71 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2021 and $146.1 million or $2.10 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2021. Interest rate
volatility driven by expectations of future Federal Reserve actions to address rising inflation as well as the the deepening conflict in Ukraine combined to
significantly decrease our trading revenue, mortgage loan production volumes, and our net mortgage servicing rights valuation.

Pre-provision net revenue ("PPNR"), a non-GAAP measure, was $78.7 million for the first quarter of 2022, $135.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, and
$163.4 million for the first quarter of 2021.

Highlights of the first quarter of 2022 included:

•

Net interest revenue totaled $268.4 million, a decrease of $8.7 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 and $12.0 million compared to the first
quarter of 2021. Average earning assets were $43.5 billion for the first quarter of 2022, $44.2 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021, and $44.2 billion
for the first quarter of 2021. Net interest margin was 2.44 percent for the first quarter of 2022, 2.52 percent for the fourth quarter of 2021, and 2.62
percent for the first quarter of 2021.

Fees and commissions revenue totaled $97.6 million, a decrease of $48.7 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 and $64.5 million compared
to the first quarter of 2021. Brokerage and trading revenue decreased $41.9 million from the prior quarter and $47.9 million from the first quarter of
2021. Mortgage banking revenue also decreased $4.6 million from the previous quarter and $20.5 million compared to first quarter of 2021.

The net cost of the changes in fair value of mortgage servicing rights and related economic hedges was $8.4 million for the first quarter of 2022
compared to a net benefit of $4.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2021 and a net benefit of $4.7 million for the first quarter of 2021.

Other operating expense totaled $277.6 million, a decrease of $21.9 million compared to the previous quarter and a decrease of $18.2 million
compared to the first quarter of 2021. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, personnel expense decreased $15.2 million, largely due to a decrease in
incentive compensation expense. Non-personnel expense decreased $6.6 million as the fourth quarter of 2021 included a $5.0 million charitable
donation to the BOKF Foundation that did not recur in the first quarter of 2022. Compared to the first quarter of 2021, personnel expense decreased
$13.8 million due to lower incentive compensation costs. Non-personnel expenses decreased $4.4 million as lower mortgage banking costs, other
expense and donations to the BOKF Foundation were partially offset by increased business promotion expenses, occupancy and equipment expenses,
and data processing and communications expenses.

Period-end outstanding loan balances totaled $20.7 billion at March 31, 2022, growing $469 million compared to December 31, 2021. Excluding a
decrease in loans originated through the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP"), outstanding loan balances increased
$608 million. Commercial loans increased $377 million and commercial real estate loans increased $270 million. Average loan balances increased
$221 million compared to the prior quarter to $20.5 billion.

No provision for expected credit losses was necessary for the first quarter of 2022. A $17.0 million negative provision for expected credit losses was
recorded in the prior quarter. The impact of continued strength in commodity prices and improved credit quality metrics was offset by higher required
provision due to loan growth and changes in our economic outlook. The combined allowance for credit losses totaled $283 million or 1.38 percent of
outstanding loans, excluding PPP loans, at March 31, 2022. The combined allowance for credit losses was $289 million or 1.45 percent of outstanding
loans, excluding PPP loans, at December 31, 2021.

Nonperforming assets not guaranteed by U.S. government agencies decreased $13 million compared to December 31, 2021. Potential problem loans
decreased $53 million while other loans especially mentioned decreased $4.1 million. Net charge-offs were $6.0 million or 0.12 percent of average
loans on an annualized basis for the first quarter of 2022, excluding PPP loans. Net charge-offs were 0.14 percent of average loans, excluding PPP
loans, over the last four quarters. Net recoveries were $714 thousand or 0.01 percent of average loans on an annualized basis for the fourth quarter of
2021, excluding PPP loans.

Period-end deposits were $39.4 billion at March 31, 2022, a $1.8 billion decrease compared to December 31, 2021 due to expected seasonal activity
from 2021 year-end balances. Average deposits increased $560 million, including a $243 million increase in demand deposits and a $317 million
increase in interest bearing deposits.

The common equity Tier 1 capital ratio at March 31, 2022 was 11.30 percent. Other regulatory capital ratios included the Tier 1 capital ratio at 11.31
percent, total capital ratio at 12.25 percent, and leverage ratio at 8.47 percent. At December 31, 2021, the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was
12.24 percent, the Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.25 percent, total capital ratio was 13.29 percent, and leverage ratio was 8.55 percent.

The Company repurchased 475,877 shares of common stock at an average price of $101.02 per share in the first quarter of 2022 and 128,522 shares at
an average price of $104.46 in the fourth quarter of 2021. We view share buybacks opportunistically, but within the context of maintaining our strong
capital position.

The Company paid a regular cash dividend of $36.1 million or $0.53 per common share during the first quarter of 2022. On May 3, 2022, the board of
directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.53 per common share payable on or about May 25, 2022 to shareholders of record as of May 10,
2022.

Results of Operations

Net Interest Revenue and Net Interest Margin

Net interest revenue is the interest earned on debt securities, loans and other interest-earning assets less interest paid for interest-bearing deposits and other
borrowings. The net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax-equivalent net interest revenue by average interest-earning assets. Net interest spread is the
difference between the average rate earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is typically
greater than net interest spread due to interest income earned on assets funded by non-interest bearing liabilities such as demand deposits and equity.

Tax-equivalent net interest revenue totaled $270.4 million for the first quarter of 2022, $279.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, and $282.7 million for the
first quarter of 2021. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, net interest revenue increased $3.8 million from changes in earning assets and decreased $12.6
million from changes in interest rates. Table 1 shows the effect on net interest revenue from changes in average balances and interest rates for various types of
earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.

Average earning assets decreased $744 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Average trading securities were reduced by $723 million. Average loan
balances increased $221 million, largely due to growth in commercial loans. The average balance of available for sale securities, which consists largely of
residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by U.S. government agencies decreased $155 million. We purchase securities to supplement
earnings and to manage interest rate risk. Interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents decreased $158 million.

Total average deposits grew by $560 million over the fourth quarter of 2021. Funds purchased and repurchase agreements decreased $889 million while other
borrowings increased $268 million.

Net interest margin was 2.44 percent compared to 2.52 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021. The tax-equivalent yield on earning assets was 2.58 percent, a
decrease of 8 basis points. The yield on trading securities was down 18 basis points to 1.71 percent, largely due to a decrease in the weighted average coupon
rate. Loan yields decreased 13 basis points to 3.57 percent. Yields related to loan fees decreased 17 basis points from the prior quarter while core loan yields
increased 4 basis points. PPP loan fees of $3.9 million were recognized in the first quarter of 2022 compared to $7.7 million in the previous quarter. PPP loan
fees remaining to be recognized were $3.5 million as of March 31, 2022. The available for sale securities portfolio yield increased 5 basis points to 1.77
percent. The yield on fair value option securities increased 10 basis points to 2.81 percent.

Funding costs were 0.21 percent, consistent with the prior quarter. The cost of interest bearing deposits was unchanged at 0.12 percent. The cost of other
borrowed funds increased 7 basis points to 0.74 percent. The benefit to net interest margin from assets funded by non-interest liabilities was 7 basis points for
the first quarter of 2022, unchanged from the prior quarter.

Compared to the first quarter of 2021, tax-equivalent net interest revenue decreased $2.1 million from a reduction in average earning assets and $10.2 million
from changes in interest rates. Net interest margin was 2.44 percent for the first quarter of 2022, compared to 2.62 percent for the first quarter of 2021.

Average earning assets decreased $717 million compared to the first quarter of 2021. Average loans decreased $2.3 billion, largely due to a reduction in PPP
loans combined with purposeful deleveraging by our customers as borrowers continued to pay down during this time of economic uncertainty. Available for
sale securities decreased $341 million. Average trading securities increased $1.6 billion due to increased customer demand for U.S. government agency
mortgage-backed securities in 2021.

Total average deposits increased $3.8 billion compared to the first quarter of 2021 as customers retained higher balances due to economic uncertainty during
the height of the pandemic. Other borrowings decreased $2.2 billion while funds purchased and repurchase agreements decreased $826 million.

The tax-equivalent yield on earning assets decreased 20 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2021. The yield on trading securities decreased 35 basis
points due to a lower weighted average coupon rate. The available for sale securities portfolio yield decreased 7 basis points as principal cash flows received
from maturities of the available for sale securities portfolio were reinvested at lower current market rates. Loan yields increased 2 basis points to 3.57 percent.
The yield on fair value option securities was up 86 basis points.

Funding costs decreased 3 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2021. The cost of other borrowed funds increased 44 basis points and the cost of
interest-bearing deposits decreased 5 basis points. The benefit to net interest margin from earning assets funded by non-interest bearing liabilities was 7 basis
points for the first quarter of 2022, a decrease of 1 basis point compared to the first quarter of 2021.

Our overall objective is to manage the Company’s balance sheet for changes in interest rates as is further described in the Market Risk section of this report.
Approximately 77 percent of our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios are either variable rate or fixed rate that will reprice within one
year. These loans are funded primarily by deposit accounts that are either non-interest bearing, or that reprice more slowly than the loans. The result is a
balance sheet that would be asset sensitive, which means that assets generally reprice more quickly than liabilities. One of the strategies that we use to manage
toward a relative rate-neutral position is to purchase fixed rate residential mortgage-backed securities issued primarily by U.S. government agencies and fund
them with market-rate-sensitive liabilities. The liability-sensitive nature of this strategy provides an offset to the asset-sensitive characteristics of our loan
portfolio. We also may use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risk. 

The effectiveness of these strategies is reflected in the overall change in net interest revenue due to changes in interest rates as shown in Table 1 and in the
interest rate sensitivity projections as shown in the Market Risk section of this report.

Other Operating Revenue

Other operating revenue was $87.9 million for the first quarter of 2022, $157.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, and $177.1 million for the first quarter of
2021. Recent national and international events, including rising inflation, recent actions by the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates and expectations of
future increases, and the deepening conflict in Ukraine combined to significantly decrease trading revenue and mortgage loan production volumes.

Certain percentage increases (decreases) in non-fees and commissions revenue are not meaningful for comparison purposes based on the nature of the item.

Fees and commissions revenue

Diversified sources of fees and commissions revenue are a significant part of our business strategy and represented 27 percent of total revenue for the first
quarter of 2022, excluding provision for credit losses and gains and losses on other assets, securities and derivatives and the change in the fair value of
mortgage servicing rights. Interest rate volatility during the first quarter had a significant negative impact to our mortgage-related fee businesses, reducing the
ratio of fees and commissions from our historical range of 35 percent to 45 percent. We believe that a variety of fee revenue sources provides an offset to
changes in interest rates, values in the equity markets, commodity prices and consumer spending, all of which can be volatile. Many of the economic factors
such as rising interest rates that we expect will result in growth in net interest revenue or fiduciary and asset management revenue may also decrease mortgage
banking production volumes and related trading, as we experienced in the first quarter of 2022. The velocity of changes in market conditions and interest rates
may result in timing differences between when offsetting impacts and benefits are realized. As interest rates are expected to move higher, we expect to
experience increased benefits to our net interest margin, which provides an offset to reduced mortgage-related fee income. Generally, for operating revenues
not as directly related to movement in interest rates, we expect growth to come through offering new products and services and by further development of our
presence in other markets. However, current and future economic conditions, including the recent impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory constraints,
increased competition and saturation in our existing markets could affect the rate of future increases.

Brokerage and Trading Revenue

Brokerage and trading revenue, which includes revenues from trading, customer hedging, retail brokerage and investment banking, decreased $41.9 million or
282 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 and $47.9 million or 230 percent compared to the first quarter of 2021.

- 6 -

 
 
Trading revenue includes net realized and unrealized gains and losses primarily related to residential mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by U.S.
government agencies and related derivative instruments that enable our mortgage banking customers to manage their production risk. Trading revenue also
includes net realized and unrealized gains and losses on municipal securities and other financial instruments that we sell to institutional customers, along with
changes in the fair value of financial instruments we hold as economic hedges against market risk of our trading securities. Trading revenue decreased $40.9
million to a net loss of $54.0 million compared to the prior quarter and decreased $57.8 million compared to first quarter of 2021. During 2021, to meet
customer demand in response to expected tightening by the Federal Reserve and increasing rates, we increased the trading volume of short duration, low
coupon U.S. government agency residential mortgage-backed securities, which led to record trading revenues in the third quarter of 2021. As inflation pressure
increased in the first quarter of 2022 and the conflict in Ukraine intensified, fixed income markets were disrupted, reducing the demand for these securities. As
of March 31, 2022, we have reduced our exposure to these securities by approximately 70 percent compared to December 31, 2021.

Customer hedging revenue is based primarily on realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of derivative contracts held for customer risk management
programs. As more fully discussed under Customer Derivative Programs in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, we offer commodity, interest rate,
foreign exchange and equity derivatives to our customers. Customer hedging revenue totaled $10.9 million for the first quarter of 2022, an increase of $1.8
million over the prior quarter. Customer hedging revenue increased $8.3 million over the first quarter of 2021 due to growth in interest rate and energy
contracts. Customer hedging revenue includes credit valuation adjustments of the fair value of derivatives to reflect the risk of counterparty default.

Revenue earned from retail brokerage transactions totaled $4.6 million for the first quarter of 2022, relatively unchanged compared to both the fourth quarter of
2021 and first quarter of 2021.

Investment banking, which includes fees earned upon completion of underwriting, financial advisory services and loan syndication fees, totaled $7.7 million
for the first quarter of 2022, a decrease of $3.9 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, related to the timing and volume of completed transactions.
Investment banking revenue increased $866 thousand over the first quarter of 2021.

Transaction Card Revenue

Transaction card revenue totaled $24.2 million for the first quarter of 2022, down slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 due to seasonal factors.
Transaction card revenue increased $1.8 million or 8 percent over the first quarter of 2021, largely due to stimulus measures and the broader reopening of the
U.S. economy.
Fiduciary and Asset Management Revenue

Fiduciary and asset management revenue is earned through managing or holding of assets for customers and executing transactions or providing related
services. Approximately 90 percent of fiduciary and asset management revenue is primarily based on the fair value of assets. Rates applied to asset values vary
based on the nature of the relationship. Fiduciary relationships and managed asset relationships generally have higher fee rates than non-fiduciary and/or
managed relationships. Fiduciary and asset management revenue was relatively unchanged compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 and increased $5.1 million
or 12 percent compared to the first quarter of 2021, largely driven by an increase in trust and managed account fees from higher client asset balances. We had
approximately $2.6 million in fee waivers during the first quarter of 2022, compared to approximately $3.0 million in fee waivers in the prior quarter and $2.8
million in the first quarter of 2021. We have voluntarily waived certain administration fees on the Cavanal Hill money market funds in order to maintain
positive yields on these funds in the current short-term interest rate environment.

Deposit Service Charges and Fees

Deposit service charges and fees were relatively flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 and increased $2.8 million or 12 percent over the first quarter of
2021. Commercial accounts where lower earnings credit rates caused by the low interest rate environment have resulted in higher service charges and consumer
activity has increased following the pandemic shut downs. Overdraft and non-sufficient funds fees earned primarily on consumer deposit accounts totaled $6.2
million for the first quarter of 2022, largely unchanged from the prior quarter and an increase of $1.6 million over the first quarter of 2021.

Mortgage Banking Revenue

Mortgage banking revenue decreased $4.6 million or 22 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 due to lower production volume combined with
narrowing margins. Interest rate volatility and continued inventory shortages have resulted in fewer refinance opportunities and heightened competitive pricing
pressure. Mortgage production volume decreased $93 million to $408 million. Production revenue as a percentage of production volume, which includes
unrealized gains and losses on our mortgage commitment pipeline and related hedges, decreased 76 basis points to 1.24 percent.

Mortgage banking revenue decreased $20.5 million or 55 percent compared to the first quarter of 2021. Mortgage loan production volume decreased $442
million or 52 percent largely due to industry-wide housing inventory constraints and overall market conditions. Production revenue as a percentage of
production volume decreased 174 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2021.

Other Revenue

Other revenue decreased $1.1 million or 10 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Other revenue decreased $5.9 million or 36 percent compared to
the first quarter of 2021 as a result of lower operating revenue from repossessed oil and gas assets due to the sale of properties during the prior year, which was
largely offset by a reduction of expenses on the same properties.

- 9 -

 
 
Net gains on other assets, securities and derivatives

Other gains and losses, net decreased $7.7 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 primarily related to changes in the fair value of rabbi trust
investments that are largely offset by lower deferred compensation expense. Other gains and losses, net decreased $11.8 million compared to the first quarter of
2021. The first quarter of 2021 included a $14.1 million gain on the sale of an equity interest received as part of the workout of a defaulted energy loan,
partially offset by additional operating expenses and a write-down of a repossessed oil and gas property, and a $3.6 million impairment of a merchant banking
investment.

As discussed in the Market Risk section following, the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights ("MSRs") changes in response to changes in primary
mortgage loan rates and other assumptions. We attempt to mitigate the earnings volatility caused by changes in the fair value of MSRs by designating certain
financial instruments as an economic hedge. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are generally expected to partially offset changes in the fair value of
MSRs.

Certain percentage increases (decreases) are not meaningful for comparison purposes.

Personnel expense

Personnel expense decreased $15.2 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Cash-based incentive compensation expense decreased $11.2 million from
elevated levels in the fourth quarter of 2021. Deferred compensation expense, which is largely offset by a decrease in the value of related investments included
in Other gains (losses), net, decreased $4.2 million. Share-based compensation expense decreased $3.8 million resulting from changes in vesting assumptions.
Employee benefits expense increased $3.2 million due to a seasonal increase in payroll taxes and retirement plan costs, partially offset by a decrease in
employee healthcare costs.

Personnel expense decreased $13.8 million compared to the first quarter of 2021. Cash-based incentive compensation decreased $7.8 million primarily due to
reduced trading revenues. Deferred compensation expense decreased $4.4 million; however, this is largely offset by a decrease in the value of related
investments included in Other gains (losses), net. Share-based compensation expense decreased $1.3 million based on changes in vesting assumptions of
certain performance-based equity awards. Regular compensation expense was relatively consistent with the first quarter of 2021 as the impact of annual
standard merit increases was dampened by a decrease in the number of employees.

- 11 -

 
Non-personnel operating expense

Non-personnel expense decreased $6.6 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. The prior quarter included a $5.0 million charitable contribution to the
BOKF Foundation. Decreases in professional fees and services expense and other expense were partially offset by an increase in occupancy and equipment
expense.

Non-personnel operating expense decreased $4.4 million compared to the first quarter of 2021. Mortgage banking costs decreased $6.1 million, largely due to a
decrease in prepayments combined with lower accruals related to default servicing and loss mitigation costs on loans serviced for others. The first quarter of
2021 also included a $4.0 million charitable contribution to the BOKF Foundation that did not recur in the first quarter of 2022. Other expense decreased $3.7
million as a result of lower operating expense from repossessed oil and gas assets due to the sale of certain repossessed oil and gas properties during the second
and third quarters of 2021; however, this was offset by decreased revenue from these same properties. These expense decreases were offset by a $4.4 million
increase in business promotion expense as advertising and travel expenses have returned to pre-pandemic levels, an increase of $4.2 million in net occupancy
and equipment expense, and a $2.4 million increase in data processing and communications expense due to continued investment in technology upgrades.

Income Taxes

The effective tax rate was 20.6 percent for the first quarter of 2022, 22.7 percent for the first quarter of 2021 and 22.9 percent for the fourth quarter of 2021.
The effective rate for the first quarter of 2022 decreased compared to fourth quarter of 2021 primarily due to the decrease in net income before tax relative to
increased excess tax benefits from vested share-based compensation. Income tax expense for the first quarter of 2022 decreased $18.6 million compared to the
fourth quarter of 2021, primarily due to the decrease in net income before tax for the first quarter of 2022.

Lines of Business

We operate three principal lines of business: Commercial Banking, Consumer Banking and Wealth Management. Commercial Banking includes lending,
treasury and cash management services and customer risk management products for small businesses, middle market and larger commercial
customers. Commercial Banking also includes the TransFund EFT network. Consumer Banking includes retail lending and deposit services, lending and
deposit services to small business customers served through our consumer branch network and all mortgage banking activities. Wealth Management provides
fiduciary services, private banking services, insurance and investment advisory services in all markets. Wealth Management also underwrites state and
municipal securities and engages in brokerage and trading activities.

In addition to our lines of business, we have a Funds Management unit. The primary purpose of this unit is to manage our overall liquidity needs and interest
rate risk. Each line of business borrows funds from and provides funds to the Funds Management unit as needed to support their operations. Operating results
for Funds Management and other include the effect of interest rate risk positions and risk management activities, securities gains and losses including
impairment charges, the provision for credit losses in excess of net loans charged off, tax planning strategies and certain executive compensation costs that are
not attributed to the lines of business.

We allocate resources and evaluate the performance of our lines of business using the net direct contribution, which includes the allocation of funds and capital
costs. Credit costs are attributed to the lines of business based on net loans charged off or recovered. The difference between credit costs attributed to the lines
of business and the consolidated provision for credit losses is attributed to Funds Management. In addition, we measure the performance of our business lines
after allocations of certain indirect expenses and taxes based on statutory rates.

The cost of funds borrowed from the Funds Management unit by the operating lines of business is transfer priced at rates that approximate market rates for
funds with similar repricing and cash flow characteristics. Market rates are generally based on the applicable wholesale borrowing rates or interest rate swap
rates, adjusted for prepayment risk and liquidity risk. This method of transfer-pricing funds that support assets of the operating lines of business tends to
insulate them from interest rate risk.

- 12 -

The value of funds provided by the operating lines of business to the Funds Management unit is also based on rates that approximate wholesale market rates for
funds with similar repricing and cash flow characteristics. Market rates are generally based on a proxy of wholesale borrowing rates or interest rate swap
rates. The funds credit formula applied to deposit products with indeterminate maturities is established based on their repricing characteristics reflected in a
combination of the short-term wholesale funding rate and a moving average of an intermediate term swap rate, with an appropriate spread applied to
both. Shorter duration products are weighted towards the short term wholesale funding rates and longer duration products are weighted towards the
intermediate swap rates. The expected duration ranges from 30 days for certain rate-sensitive deposits to five years.

Economic capital is assigned to the business units by a capital allocation model that reflects management’s assessment of risk. This model assigns capital based
upon credit, operating, interest rate and other market risk inherent in our business lines and recognizes the diversification benefits among the units. The level of
assigned economic capital is a combination of the risk taken by each business line, based on its actual exposures and calibrated to its own loss history where
possible. Average invested capital includes economic capital and amounts we have invested in the lines of business.

As shown in Table 8, net income attributable to our lines of business decreased $41.4 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Net interest revenue
decreased $9.4 million, primarily due to a reduction in loan fees and two fewer days in the quarter. Net charge-offs increased $7.2 million. Other operating
revenue decreased $36.4 million primarily due to the impact of interest rate volatility on our trading activities, mortgage banking revenue and mortgage
servicing rights valuation. Operating expense decreased $13.0 million, primarily attributable to reduced incentive compensation expense.

Net interest revenue increased by $20.7 million compared to the prior year, primarily driven by an increase in the spread on deposits sold to our Funds
Management unit. Net charge-offs decreased $8.7 million compared to the first quarter of 2021. Other operating revenue decreased by $48.6 million primarily
due to incurred trading losses and reduced mortgage banking revenue. These decreases were partially offset by increases in other revenue, fiduciary and asset
management revenue, deposit service charges and fees, and transaction card revenue. Operating expense decreased $12.8 million compared to the first quarter
of 2021, mainly from reduced mortgage banking costs in Consumer Banking and reduced incentive compensation expense.

Certain percentage increases (decreases) in non-fees and commissions revenue are not meaningful for comparison purposes based on the nature of the item.

Net interest revenue decreased $3.7 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily due to reduced loan fees and two fewer days in the quarter.

Fees and commissions revenue was consistent with the prior quarter. Operating expense decreased $9.3 million or 13 percent compared to the fourth quarter of
2021, primarily due to a decline in incentive compensation from elevated levels in the prior quarter. Corporate expense allocations increased $3.3 million or 26
percent primarily related to project resources.

Average outstanding balance of loans attributed to Commercial Banking increased $362 million or 2 percent over the fourth quarter of 2021 to $16.7 billion.
See the Loans section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition following for additional discussion of changes in commercial and
commercial real estate loans, which are primarily attributed to the Commercial Banking segment. 

- 14 -

 
 
Average deposits attributed to Commercial Banking were $19.6 billion for first quarter of 2022, a $58 million increase over the fourth quarter of 2021. See
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital for further discussion of change.

Net interest revenue increased $7.0 million over the first quarter of 2021, largely driven by increased deposit balances and improved spreads. Net loans
charged-off decreased $8.6 million. Fees and commissions revenue increased $7.1 million or 14 percent compared to the first quarter of 2021 due to growth in
customer hedging revenue and an increase in revenues from processing transactions on behalf of the members of our TransFund EFT network. These increases
were partially offset by reduced operating revenue from repossessed oil and gas assets due to the sale of properties during the prior year, which was largely
offset by a reduction of expenses on the same properties. Corporate expense allocations increased $3.5 million or 28 percent compared to the prior year related
to increased project resources.

Average loan balances decreased $826 million or 5 percent and average deposits increased $3.5 billion or 21 percent over the first quarter of 2021.

Consumer Banking

Consumer Banking provides retail banking services through four primary distribution channels: traditional branches, the 24-hour ExpressBank call center,
Internet banking and mobile banking. Consumer Banking also conducts mortgage banking activities through offices located outside of our Consumer Banking
markets.

Consumer Banking had a net loss of $7.3 million for the first quarter of 2022, compared to prior quarter net income of $6.8 million, largely due to lower
mortgage production volumes and narrowing margins combined with lower spreads on deposits sold to our Funds Management unit.

Certain percentage increases (decreases) in non-fees and commissions revenue are not meaningful for comparison purposes based on the nature of the item.

Net interest revenue from Consumer Banking activities decreased $3.2 million or 10 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, mainly due to lower
spreads on deposits sold to our Funds Management unit. Average consumer deposits grew $64.2 million or 1 percent over the fourth quarter of 2021.

Operating revenue decreased $5.0 million compared to the prior quarter. Mortgage production volume decreased $93 million to $408 million and production
revenue as a percentage of production volumes decreased 76 basis points resulting in a $4.7 million decrease in mortgage banking revenues. Operating expense
decreased $3.2 million, primarily due to decreased professional fees and services expense and mortgage banking costs. Corporate expense allocations were
consistent with the fourth quarter of 2021.

The net cost of the changes in fair value of mortgage servicing rights and related economic hedges was $8.4 million for the first quarter of 2022 compared to a
net benefit of $4.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2021 and a net benefit of $4.3 million in the first quarter of 2021. Interest rate volatility affected the
effectiveness of our mortgage servicing rights hedging strategy.

Net interest revenue from Consumer Banking activities increased $6.2 million or 30 percent over the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to increased deposit
balances combined with an increase in the spread on deposits sold to our Funds Management unit, as well as improved loan spreads. Fees and commissions
revenue decreased $18.3 million or 35 percent compared to the first quarter of 2021. Mortgage banking revenue decreased $20.4 million due to lower mortgage
production volume and compression in production revenue as a percentage of production volume. Deposit service charges increased $1.7 million. Customer
spending levels increased with the broader reopening of the U.S. economy, which resulted in increased overdraft fees and check card revenue compared to the
prior year. Operating expense decreased $6.8 million due to a decrease in mortgage banking costs.

Wealth Management

Wealth Management had a net loss of $4.4 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to net income of $21.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, and net
income of $19.4 million in the first quarter of 2021. The first quarter of 2022 was impacted by a net loss on trading activities.

Certain percentage increases (decreases) in non-fees and commissions revenue are not meaningful for comparison purposes based on the nature of the item.

Combined net interest revenue and fee revenue decreased $33.7 million. Combined revenue from trading activities decreased $43.3 million compared to the
fourth quarter of 2021, primarily due to reduced customer demand for U.S. government agency residential mortgage-backed securities. Fiduciary and asset
management revenue and retail brokerage revenue were relatively consistent with the prior quarter as decreases in revenue related to assets under management
or administration were offset by improved money market fund fees. Operating expense was consistent with prior quarter.

Average outstanding loans attributed to the Wealth Management segment increased $54 million or 3 percent and average Wealth Management deposits
increased $425 million or 5 percent. Deposit balances began to decline in the second half of March 2022 from elevated levels in the fourth quarter of 2021.

- 18 -

 
 
Combined net interest revenue and fee revenue from trading activities decreased by $51.2 million or 97 percent compared to the prior year due to reduced
demand for agency residential mortgage-backed securities. Fiduciary and asset management revenue increased $5.2 million due to growth in trust fees and
managed account fees as a result of higher client asset balances. Operating expense decreased $4.1 million largely due to reduced trading related incentive
compensation expense.

Average loans attributed to the Wealth Management segment grew $201 million or 10 percent to $2.1 billion. Average Wealth Management deposits decreased
$87.0 million or 1 percent.

Financial Condition

Securities

We maintain a securities portfolio to enhance profitability, manage interest rate risk, provide liquidity and comply with regulatory requirements. Securities are
classified as trading, held for investment, or available for sale. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the composition of the securities
portfolio as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

We hold an inventory of trading securities in support of sales to a variety of customers, including banks, corporations, insurance companies, money managers
and others. Trading securities decreased $4.2 billion to $4.9 billion during the first quarter of 2022. As discussed in the Market Risk section of this report,
trading activities involve risk of loss from adverse price movement. We mitigate this risk within board-approved limits through the use of derivative contracts,
short-sales and other techniques.

At March 31, 2022, the carrying value of investment (held-to-maturity) securities was $184 million, including a $633 thousand allowance for expected credit
losses compared to $210 million at December 31, 2021 with a $555 thousand allowance for expected credit losses. The fair value of investment securities was
$191 million at March 31, 2022 and $231 million at December 31, 2021. Investment securities consist primarily of residential mortgage-backed securities
issued by U.S. government agencies, intermediate and long-term, fixed rate Oklahoma and Texas municipal bonds, and taxable Texas school construction
bonds.

Available for sale securities, which may be sold prior to maturity, are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains or losses, net of deferred taxes, are recorded as
accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity. The amortized cost of available for sale securities totaled $13.4 billion at March 31, 2022, a
$377 million increase compared to December 31, 2021. The increase in the cost basis of available for sale securities was partially offset by a $263 million
decrease in fair value due to rising interest rates. At March 31, 2022, the available for sale securities portfolio consisted primarily of U.S. government agency
residential mortgage-backed securities and U.S. government agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. Both residential and commercial mortgage-
backed securities have credit risk from delinquency or default of the underlying loans. We mitigate this risk by primarily investing in securities issued by U.S.
government agencies. Principal and interest payments on the underlying loans are fully guaranteed. Commercial mortgage-backed securities have prepayment
penalties similar to commercial loans.

A primary risk of holding residential mortgage-backed securities comes from extension during periods of rising interest rates or prepayment during periods of
falling interest rates. We evaluate this risk through extensive modeling of risk both before making an investment and throughout the life of the security. Our
best estimate of the duration of the combined residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio held in investment and available for sale securities at March 31,
2022 is 3.6 years. Management estimates the duration extends to 4.2 years assuming an immediate 200 basis point upward shock. The estimated duration
contracts to 3.1 years assuming a 100 basis point decline in the current low rate environment. Management also regularly monitors the impact of interest rate
risk on the available for sale securities portfolio on our tangible equity ratio under various shock scenarios. Throughout the first quarter of 2022, this exposure
was reported and monitored by management, and the portfolio's actual performance remained within expectations.

Loans

The aggregate loan portfolio before allowance for loan losses totaled $20.7 billion at March 31, 2022, a $469 million increase over December 31, 2021. Core
loans, which exclude paycheck protection program loans increased $608 million, primarily due to growth in both commercial and commercial real estate loans.

Commercial loans represent loans for working capital, facilities acquisition or expansion, purchases of equipment and other needs of commercial customers
primarily located within our geographical footprint. These loans are underwritten individually and represent ongoing relationships based on a thorough
knowledge of the customer, the customer’s industry and market. While commercial loans are generally secured by the customer’s assets including real property,
inventory, accounts receivable, operating equipment, interests in mineral rights and other property and may also include personal guarantees of the owners and
related parties, the primary source of repayment of the loans is the ongoing cash flow from operations of the customer’s business. In addition, revolving lines of
credit are generally governed by a borrowing base. Inherent lending risks are centrally monitored on a continuous basis from underwriting throughout the life
of the loan for compliance with commercial lending policies.

Commercial loans totaled $12.9 billion or 62 percent of the loan portfolio at March 31, 2022, a $377 million increase compared to December 31, 2021,
primarily due to growth in the energy loan portfolio. Healthcare and general business loan balances also increased, partially offset by a decrease in services
loans.

- 20 -

 
 
Approximately 77 percent of loans in this segment are located within our geographic footprint, based on collateral location. Loans for which the collateral
location is less relevant, such as unsecured loans and reserve-based energy loans are categorized by the borrower's primary operating location. The largest
concentration of loans in this segment outside of our footprint is California, totaling 4 percent of the segment.

Supporting the energy industry with loans to producers and other energy-related entities has been a hallmark of the Company since its founding and represents
a large portion of our commercial loan portfolio. In addition, energy production and related industries have a significant impact on the economy in our primary
markets. Loans collateralized by oil and gas properties are subject to a semi-annual engineering review by our internal staff of petroleum engineers. This
review is used as the basis for developing the expected cash flows supporting the loan amount. The projected cash flows are discounted according to risk
characteristics of the underlying oil and gas properties. Loans are evaluated to demonstrate with reasonable certainty that crude oil, natural gas and natural gas
liquids can be recovered from known oil and gas reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions at current pricing levels and with existing
conventional equipment and operating methods and costs. As part of our evaluation of credit quality, we analyze rigorous stress tests over a range of
commodity prices and take proactive steps to mitigate risk when appropriate.

Outstanding energy loans totaled $3.2 billion or 15 percent of total loans at March 31, 2022, a $191 million increase over December 31, 2021. Approximately
$2.4 billion of energy loans were to oil and gas producers, a $235 million increase over December 31, 2021. The majority of this portfolio is first lien, senior
secured, reserve-based lending, which we believe is the lowest risk form of energy lending. Approximately 72 percent of the committed production loans are
secured by properties primarily producing oil and 28 percent of the committed production loans are secured by properties primarily producing natural gas.

Loans to midstream oil and gas companies totaled $630 million at March 31, 2022, a $16 million decrease compared to December 31, 2021. Loans to
borrowers that provide services to the energy industry totaled $121 million at March 31, 2022, a decrease of $22 million. Loans to other energy borrowers,
including those engaged in wholesale or retail energy sales, totaled $24 million, a decrease of $6.7 million compared to the prior quarter.

Unfunded energy loan commitments were $3.0 billion at March 31, 2022, a $23 million increase over December 31, 2021.

The healthcare sector of the loan portfolio totaled $3.4 billion or 17 percent of total loans. Healthcare loans increased $27 million over December 31, 2021,
primarily due to growth in loans to acute care and specialty hospital sectors. This was partially offset by a decline in balances to other medical practices
compared to the prior quarter. Healthcare sector loans consist primarily of loans for the development and operation of senior housing and care facilities,
including independent living, assisted living and skilled nursing. Generally we loan to borrowers with a portfolio of multiple facilities that serves to help
diversify risks specific to a single facility.
The services sector of the loan portfolio totaled $3.4 billion or 16 percent of total loans, a $16 million decrease compared to the prior quarter. Service sector
loans consist of a large number of loans to a variety of businesses, including Native American tribal and state and local governments, Native American tribal
casino operations, foundations and not-for-profit organizations, educational services and specialty trade contractors. Approximately $1.6 billion of the services
category is made up of loans with individual balances of less than $10 million. Services sector loans are generally secured by the assets of the borrower with
repayment coming from the cash flows of ongoing operations of the customer’s business. 

General business loans totaled $2.9 billion or 14 percent of total loans, an increase of $175 million over the prior quarter. General business loans consist of $1.5
billion of wholesale/retail loans and $1.4 billion of loans from other commercial industries.

We participate in shared national credits when appropriate to obtain or maintain business relationships with local customers. Shared national credits are defined
by banking regulators as credits of $100 million or more and with three or more non-affiliated banks as participants. At March 31, 2022, the outstanding
principal balance of these loans totaled $4.0 billion, including $1.8 billion of energy loans. Substantially all of these loans are to borrowers with local market
relationships. We serve as the agent lender in approximately 23 percent of our shared national credits, based on dollars committed. We hold shared national
credits to the same standard of analysis and perform the same level of review as internally originated credits. Our lending policies generally avoid loans in
which we do not have the opportunity to maintain or achieve other business relationships with the customer. In addition to management’s quarterly assessment
of credit risk, banking regulators annually review a sample of shared national credits for proper risk grading.

- 21 -

Commercial Real Estate

Commercial real estate represents loans for the construction of buildings or other improvements to real estate and property held by borrowers for investment
purposes generally within our geographical footprint. We require collateral values in excess of the loan amounts, demonstrated cash flows in excess of expected
debt service requirements, equity investment in the project and a portion of the project already sold, leased or permanent financing already secured. The
expected cash flows from all significant new or renewed income producing property commitments are stress tested to reflect the risks in varying interest rates,
vacancy rates and rental rates. As with commercial loans, inherent lending risks are centrally monitored on a continuous basis from underwriting throughout the
life of the loan for compliance with applicable lending policies.

The outstanding balance of commercial real estate loans increased $270 million over December 31, 2021 to $4.1 billion or 20 percent of total loans at March
31, 2022, as the recent payoff trend in this portfolio has abated. Loans secured by industrial facilities increased $146 million to $912 million. Multifamily
residential loans increased $81 million to $867 million at March 31, 2022. Loans secured by office facilities increased $57 million to $1.1 billion.

Approximately 70 percent of loans in this segment are in our geographic footprint based on collateral location. The largest concentration of loans in this
segment outside our footprint is Utah, totaling 9 percent of the segment. All other states represent less than 5 percent individually.

Paycheck Protection Program

We actively participated in programs initiated by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act"), including the Small Business
Administration's ("SBA") Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP") that began on April 3, 2020. PPP provided fully forgivable loans when utilized for qualified
expenditures, including to help small businesses maintain payrolls during the COVID-19 pandemic. These loans generally have a contractual term of two years,
though most are expected to be forgiven prior to maturity after completion of a compliance period. Loans are guaranteed and amounts forgiven will be
reimbursed to the Company by the SBA. The loans carry a fixed interest rate of 1 percent. Interest plus loan fees, which vary depending on loan size, are
accrued over the contractual life of the loan. Any unaccreted origination fees will be recognized when the loan is paid. At March 31, 2022, approximately $24
million of PPP loans from the initial rounds remain outstanding, with an insignificant unaccreted origination fee balance remaining.

The Company also participated in the most recent round of PPP, which began on January 19, 2021. Approximately $114 million of PPP loans from this round
remain outstanding. The newest round of loans have a fixed interest rate of 1 percent and a contractual term of five years, but are expected to be forgiven prior
to maturity. Unaccreted origination fees related to the 2021 vintage of PPP loans totaled $3.5 million at March 31, 2022.

Loans to Individuals

Loans to individuals include residential mortgage and personal loans. Residential mortgage loans provide funds for our customers to purchase or refinance their
primary residence or to borrow against the equity in their home. These loans are secured by a first or second mortgage on the customer's primary residence.
These loans are made in accordance with underwriting policies we believe to be conservative and are fully documented. Loans may be individually
underwritten or credit scored based on size and other criteria. Credit scoring is assessed based on significant credit characteristics including credit history,
residential and employment stability.

In general, we sell the majority of our conforming fixed-rate loan originations in the secondary market and retain the majority of our non-conforming and
adjustable-rate mortgage loans. Our mortgage loan portfolio does not include payment option adjustable-rate mortgage loans or adjustable-rate mortgage loans
with initial rates that are below market. Home equity loans are primarily first-lien and fully amortizing.

Residential mortgage, which includes home equity loans, and personal loans are made in accordance with underwriting policies we believe to be conservative
and are fully documented. Loans may be individually underwritten or credit scored based on size and other criteria. Credit scoring is assessed based on
significant credit characteristics including credit history, residential and employment stability.

Personal loans consist primarily of loans to Wealth Management clients secured by the cash surrender value of insurance policies and marketable securities. It
also includes direct loans secured by and for the purchase of automobiles, recreational and marine equipment as well as unsecured loans.

- 22 -

Approximately 92 percent of the loans in this segment are secured by collateral located within our geographical footprint. Loans for which the collateral
location is less relevant, such as unsecured loans are categorized by the borrower’s primary operating location.

Residential mortgage loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies have limited credit exposure because of the agency guarantee. This amount includes
residential mortgage loans previously sold into GNMA mortgage pools that the Company may repurchase when certain defined delinquency criteria are met.
Because of this repurchase right, the Company is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans and must include them on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet. After peaking in the second quarter of 2021, these loans are migrating toward pre-COVID levels through payoffs or sales.

The Company secondarily evaluates loan portfolio performance based on the primary geographical market managing the loan. Loans attributed to a
geographical market may not represent the location of the borrower or the collateral. All permanent mortgage loans serviced by our mortgage banking unit and
held for investment by the Company are centrally managed by the Oklahoma market.

Off-Balance Sheet Commitments

We enter into certain off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business as shown in Table 14. Loan commitments may be unconditional
obligations to provide financing or conditional obligations that depend on the borrower’s financial condition, collateral value or other factors. Standby letters of
credit are unconditional commitments to guarantee the performance of our customer to a third party. Since some of these commitments are expected to expire
before being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.

We have off-balance sheet commitments related to certain residential mortgage loans sold into mortgage-backed securities as part of our mortgage banking
activities. We retain off-balance sheet credit risk related to losses in excess of amounts guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs ("VA").

We also have off-balance sheet credit risk related to certain residential mortgage loans primarily originated under community development loan programs that
were sold to a U.S. government agency with full recourse prior to 2007. We are obligated to repurchase these loans for the life of these loans in the event of
foreclosure for the unpaid principal and interest at the time of foreclosure. The majority of our conforming fixed rate loan originations are sold in the secondary
market and we only retain repurchase obligations under standard underwriting representations and warranties.

We offer programs that permit our customers to hedge various risks, including fluctuations in energy, cattle and other agricultural product prices, interest rates
and foreign exchange rates. Each of these programs work essentially the same way. Derivative contracts are executed between the customers and the
Company. Offsetting contracts are executed between the Company and selected counterparties to minimize market risk due to changes in commodity prices,
interest rates or foreign exchange rates. The counterparty contracts are identical to the customer contracts, except for a fixed pricing spread or a fee paid to us
as compensation for administrative costs, credit risk and profit.

The customer derivative programs create credit risk for potential amounts due to the Company from our customers and from the counterparties. Customer
credit risk is monitored through existing credit policies and procedures. The effects of changes in commodity prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates are
evaluated across a range of possible scenarios to determine the maximum exposure we are willing to have individually to any customer. Customers may also be
required to provide cash margin or other collateral in conjunction with our credit agreements to further limit our credit risk.

Counterparty credit risk is evaluated through existing policies and procedures. This evaluation considers the total relationship between BOK Financial and each
of the counterparties. Individual limits are established by management, approved by Credit Administration and reviewed by the Asset/Liability
Committee. Margin collateral is required if the exposure between the Company and any counterparty exceeds established limits. Based on declines in the
counterparties’ credit ratings, these limits may be reduced and additional margin collateral may be required.

A deterioration of the credit standing of one or more of the customers or counterparties to these contracts may result in BOK Financial recognizing a loss as the
fair value of the affected contracts may no longer move in tandem with the offsetting contracts. This occurs if the credit standing of the customer or
counterparty deteriorated such that either the fair value of underlying collateral no longer supported the contract or the customer or the counterparty’s ability to
provide margin collateral was impaired. Credit losses on customer derivatives reduce brokerage and trading revenue in the Consolidated Statements of
Earnings.

- 25 -

 
 
Derivative contracts are carried at fair value. At March 31, 2022, the net fair values of derivative contracts, before consideration of cash margin, reported as
assets under these programs totaled $2.4 billion compared to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2021. At March 31, 2022, the net fair value of our derivative
contracts included $2.1 billion for energy contracts, $179 million for foreign exchange contracts and $63 million for interest rate swaps. The aggregate net fair
value of derivative contracts, before consideration of cash margin, held under these programs reported as liabilities totaled $2.4 billion at March 31, 2022 and
$1.1 billion at December 31, 2021.

At March 31, 2022, total derivative assets were reduced by $38 million of cash collateral received from counterparties and total derivative liabilities were
reduced by $2.2 billion of cash collateral paid to counterparties related to instruments executed with the same counterparty under a master netting agreement.
Derivative contracts executed with customers may be secured by non-cash collateral in conjunction with a credit agreement with that customer, such as proven
producing oil and gas properties. Access to this collateral in event of default is reasonably assured.

A table showing the notional and fair value of derivative assets and liabilities on both a gross and net basis is presented in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

The fair value of derivative contracts reported as assets under these programs, net of cash margin held by the Company, by category of debtor at March 31,
2022 follows in Table 15.

At March 31, 2022, our largest derivative exposure was to an energy customer for $107 million.

Our customer derivative program also introduces liquidity and capital risk. We are required to provide cash margin to certain counterparties when the net
negative fair value of the contracts exceeds established limits. Also, changes in commodity prices affect the amount of regulatory capital we are required to
hold as support for the fair value of our derivative assets. These risks are modeled as part of the management of these programs. Based on current prices, a
decrease in market prices equivalent to $86.03 per barrel of oil would decrease the fair value of derivative assets by $529 million, with lending customers
comprising the bulk of the assets. An increase in prices equivalent to $114.53 per barrel of oil would increase the fair value of derivative assets by $657 million
as asset values rise faster than margin paid. Liquidity requirements of this program may also be affected by our credit rating. At March 31, 2022, a decrease in
our credit rating to below investment grade would increase our obligation to post cash margin on existing contracts by approximately $10 million. The fair
value of our to-be-announced residential mortgage-backed securities and interest rate swap derivative contracts is affected by changes in interest rates. Based
on our assessment as of March 31, 2022, changes in interest rates would not materially impact regulatory capital or liquidity needed to support this portion of
our customer derivative program.

Allowance for Loan Losses and Accrual for Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk from Unfunded Loan Commitments

Expected credit losses on assets carried at amortized cost are recognized over their expected lives based on models that measure the probability of default and
loss given default over a 12-month reasonable and supportable forecast period. Models incorporate base case, downside and upside macroeconomic variables
such as real gross domestic product ("GDP") growth, civilian unemployment rate and West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") oil prices on a probability weighted
basis. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of methodology of allowance for loan losses.

No provision for credit losses was necessary for the first quarter of 2022. Changes in our reasonable and supportable forecasts of macroeconomic variables
resulted in a $7.3 million decrease in the allowance for credit losses related to lending activities. Continued strength in commodity prices was partially offset by
changes in our economic outlook. Changes in loan portfolio characteristics, primarily related to growth in loan balances resulted in a $6.6 million increase in
the allowance for credit losses related to lending activities. Continued improvements in credit quality metrics were offset by net charge-offs and changes in
specific impairment and payment profile characteristics.

- 28 -

The probability weighting of our base case reasonable and supportable forecast decreased to 60 percent in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 65 percent in
the fourth quarter of 2021 as the level of uncertainty in the current economic outlook increased. A summary of macroeconomic variables considered in
developing our estimate of expected credit losses at March 31, 2022 follows:

The Russia-Ukraine conflict remains
isolated and conditions improve by mid-
year 2022.

The federal funds rate is increased at each
Federal Reserve Open Market ("FOMC")
meeting through March 2023, which results
in a target range of 2.75 percent to 3.00
percent. Additionally, the Federal Reserve
begins balance sheet reduction by mid-year
2022.

Labor force participants continue to re-enter
the job market to meet the record number of
job openings. The increase in employment
helps maintain household income above its
pre-pandemic trend. This, coupled with the
drawdown in savings, supports consumer
spending and produces GDP growth
consistent with pre-pandemic levels.

– GDP is forecasted to grow by 2.2
percent over the next 12 months.

– Civilian unemployment rate of 3.9
percent in the first quarter of 2022
improves to 3.8 percent by the first
quarter of 2023.

– WTI oil prices are projected to
generally follow the NYMEX
forward curve that existed at the
end of March 2022 and are
expected to average $94.98 per
barrel over the next 12 months.

The Russia-Ukraine conflict persists
through 2022 but remains isolated.

The Federal Reserve is forced to adopt a
more aggressive monetary policy to combat
the inflationary environment. This results in
a target range of 4.00 percent to 4.25
percent by March 2023. Additionally, the
Federal Reserve begins balance sheet
reduction by mid-year 2022.

The Russia-Ukraine conflict remains
isolated and conditions improve early
second quarter 2022.

The federal funds rate is increased at each
FOMC meeting through March 2023, which
results in a target range of 2.25 percent to
2.50 percent. Additionally, the Federal
Reserve begins balance sheet reduction by
mid-year 2022.

Additional surges in commodity prices
exacerbated by supply chain dislocations
create higher levels of inflation that do not
peak until the fourth quarter of 2022. These
factors push the United States into a
recession, with contraction in economic
activity and a sharp increase in the
unemployment rate.

Labor force participants continue to re-enter
the job market to meet the record number of
job openings. The increase in employment
helps maintain household income above its
pre-pandemic trend. This coupled with the
drawdown in savings, supports consumer
spending and produces above trend GDP
growth.

– GDP is forecasted to contract 1.3
percent over the next twelve
months.

– Civilian unemployment rate of 4.4
percent in the second quarter of
2022 increases to 6.9 percent in the
first quarter of 2023.

– WTI oil prices are projected to

average $109.67 over the next 12
months, with a peak of $131.46 in
the third quarter of 2022 and
falling 33% over the following two
quarters.

– GDP is forecasted to grow by 3.3
percent over the next 12 months.

– Civilian unemployment rate of 3.7
percent in the second quarter of
2022 improves to 3.3 percent by
the first quarter of 2023.
– WTI oil prices are projected to

average $85.89 per barrel over the
next 12 months.

Growth in loan balances results in a $7.0 million increase in allowance. Net charge-offs and changes in specific impairments attributed to certain credits
required a $2.9 million provision during the first quarter of 2022. Improved risk grading during the quarter resulted in a $6.1 million decrease in the allowance
for lending activities, primarily related to energy, commercial real estate and commercial wholesale/retail sector loans. A summary of outstanding loan balances
by risk grade is included in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Non-pass grade loans include other loans especially mentioned, defined by
regulatory guidelines as loans that are currently performing in compliance with original terms but may have a potential weakness that deserves management’s
close attention, accruing substandard loans, and nonaccruing loans. Non-pass grade loans totaled $389 million at March 31, 2022, a $67 million decrease
compared to December 31, 2021. Non-pass graded loans were primarily composed of $101 million or 3 percent of energy loans, $77 million or 2 percent of
healthcare loans, $74 million or 2 percent of services loans, $52 million or 1 percent of commercial real estate loans and $36 million or 1 percent of general
business loans.

- 29 -

The allowance for loan losses totaled $246 million or 1.19 percent of outstanding loans and 230 percent of nonaccruing loans at March 31, 2022, excluding
residential mortgage loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. The combined allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from
unfunded loan commitments was $283 million or 1.37 percent of outstanding loans and 264 percent of nonaccruing loans at March 31, 2022.

The Company recorded a $17.0 million negative provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter of 2021. The allowance for loan losses was $256 million or
1.27 percent of outstanding loans and 213 percent of nonaccruing loans, excluding loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies at December 31, 2021. The
combined allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments was $289 million or 1.43 percent of
outstanding loans and 241 percent of nonaccruing loans.

Net Loans Charged Off

Net charge-offs of commercial loans were $5.5 million in the first quarter of 2022, primarily related to two general business borrowers and a single energy
services borrower. Net commercial real estate loan charge-offs were $47 thousand and net charge-offs of loans to individuals were $444 thousand. Net charge-
offs of loans to individuals include deposit account overdraft losses.

Accrual for Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk Associated with Mortgage Banking Activities

The accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk associated with mortgage banking activities includes consideration of credit risk related to certain residential
mortgage loans sold into mortgage-backed securities in excess of amounts guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veteran's Affairs ("VA") and mortgage loans
originated under community development loan programs that were sold to a U.S. government agency with full recourse.

We use publicly available long-term national data to estimate total loss given default for our off-balance sheet credit risk related to losses in excess of amounts
guaranteed by the VA. This result is combined with probability of default output from our mortgage servicing rights model to estimate total expected loss.
Then, we estimate the VA's guarantee percentage to determine our portion of the credit risk. Qualitative adjustment may be used, if necessary.

Allowance for Credit Losses Related to Held-to-Maturity (Investment) Securities

The expected credit losses principles apply to all financial assets measured at cost, including our held-to-maturity (investment) debt securities portfolio. Our
investment portfolio includes municipal and other tax-exempt securities and other debt securities. Expected credit losses for these assets is based on probability
of default and loss given default assumptions that align with similarly graded loans. Qualitative adjustment may be used, if necessary.

Nonperforming Assets

As more fully described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, loans are generally classified as nonaccruing when it becomes probable that we
will not collect the full contractual principal and interest. Accruing renegotiated loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies represent residential mortgage
loans that have been modified in troubled debt restructurings. Interest continues to accrue based on the modified terms of the loan and loans may be sold once
they become eligible according to U.S. government agency guidelines. Real estate and other repossessed assets are assets acquired in partial or total forgiveness
of loans. The assets are carried at the lower of cost as determined by fair value at the date of foreclosure or current fair value, less estimated selling costs. A
summary of nonperforming assets follows in Table 17:

Excluding assets guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, nonperforming assets decreased $13 million from December 31, 2021, primarily due to a $6.3
million decrease in nonaccruing general business loans and a $6.1 million decrease in nonaccruing energy loans. Newly identified nonaccruing loans totaled
$12 million, offset by $14 million of payments and $7.8 million of charge-offs. The Company generally retains nonperforming assets to maximize potential
recovery, which may cause future nonperforming assets to decrease more slowly.

We foreclose on loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies in accordance with agency guidelines. Generally these loans are not eligible for modification
programs or have failed to comply with modified loan terms. Principal is guaranteed by agencies of the U.S. government, subject to limitations and credit risk
is limited. At foreclosure, these amounts are transferred to claims receivable accounts. These properties will be conveyed to the agencies once applicable
criteria have been met. 

Real Estate and Other Repossessed Assets

Real estate and other repossessed assets totaled $24 million at March 31, 2022, composed primarily of $15 million of developed commercial real estate and
$7.1 million of oil and gas properties. Real estate and other repossessed assets was largely unchanged compared to December 31, 2021.

Liquidity and Capital

Based on the average balances for the first quarter of 2022, approximately 80 percent of our funding was provided by deposit accounts, 6 percent from
borrowed funds, less than 1 percent from long-term subordinated debt and 10 percent from equity. Our funding sources, which primarily include deposits and
borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Banks and other banks, provide adequate liquidity to meet our operating needs.

Subsidiary Bank

Deposits and borrowed funds are the primary sources of liquidity for BOKF, NA, the wholly owned subsidiary bank of BOK Financial. We compete for retail
and commercial deposits by offering a broad range of products and services and focusing on customer convenience. Retail deposit growth is supported through
personal and small business checking, online bill paying services, mobile banking services, an extensive network of branch locations and ATMs and our
ExpressBank call center. Commercial deposit growth is supported by offering treasury management and lockbox services. We also acquire brokered deposits
when the cost of funds is advantageous to other funding sources.

Average deposits for the first quarter of 2022 totaled $40.4 billion, a $560 million increase over the fourth quarter of 2021. Continued deposit growth was
primarily due to customers maintaining higher balances in the current economic environment, supplemented by inflows from government stimulus payments.
Interest-bearing transaction account balances increased $437 million. Demand deposits grew by $243 million and savings account balances were up $38
million. Certificate of deposit balances decreased $159 million.

Average Commercial Banking deposit balances increased $58 million over the fourth quarter of 2021. Interest-bearing transaction account balances increased
$40 million. Demand deposit balances were up $32 million. Commercial customers continue to retain large cash reserves due to a combination of factors
including uncertainty about the economic environment and potential for growth, lack of preferable liquid alternatives and a desire to minimize deposit service
charges through the earnings credit. The earnings credit is a non-cash method that enables commercial customers to offset deposit service charges based on
account balances. Commercial deposit balances may decrease as the economic outlook improves and if short-term rates move higher, enhancing their
investment alternatives.

Average Consumer Banking deposit balances increased $64 million over the prior quarter. A $72 million increase in interest-bearing transaction deposit
balances and a $33 million increase in savings account balances were partially offset by a $35 million decrease in time deposit balances. Demand deposit
balances were largely unchanged compared to prior quarter.

Average Wealth Management deposits increased $425 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. A $295 million increase in interest bearing transaction
accounts and a $246 million increase in demand deposit balances was partially offset by a $121 million decrease in time deposit balances.

Average time deposits for the first quarter of 2022 included $48 million of brokered deposits, an $845 thousand decrease compared to the fourth quarter of
2021. Average interest-bearing transaction accounts for the first quarter included $2.1 billion of brokered deposits, an $8.0 million increase over the fourth
quarter of 2021.

In addition to deposits, liquidity is provided primarily by federal funds purchased, securities repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank
borrowings. Federal funds purchased consist primarily of unsecured, overnight funds acquired from other financial institutions. Funds are primarily purchased
from bankers’ banks and Federal Home Loan banks from across the country. The Company has no wholesale federal funds purchased at March 31, 2022.
Securities repurchase agreements generally mature within 90 days and are secured by certain available for sale and trading securities. Federal Home Loan Bank
borrowings are generally short-term and are secured by a blanket pledge of eligible collateral (generally unencumbered U.S. Treasury and agency mortgage-
backed securities, 1-4 family residential mortgage loans, multifamily and other qualifying commercial real estate loans). Amounts borrowed from the Federal
Home Loan Bank of Topeka averaged $1.1 billion during the quarter, compared to $842 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.

At March 31, 2022, the estimated unused credit available to BOKF, NA from collateralized sources was approximately $16.4 billion.

A summary of other borrowings for BOK Financial on a consolidated basis follows in Table 21.

BOKF, NA also has a liability related to the repurchase of certain delinquent residential mortgage loans previously sold in GNMA mortgage pools. Interest is
payable monthly at rates contractually due to investors if delinquent loans are not repurchased from the GNMA mortgage pools.

Parent Company

At March 31, 2022, cash and interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents held by the parent company totaled $233 million. The primary sources of liquidity for
BOK Financial are cash on hand and dividends from BOKF, NA. Dividends from the bank are limited by various banking regulations to net profits, as defined,
for the year plus retained profits for the two preceding years. Dividends are further restricted by minimum capital requirements. At March 31, 2022, based upon
the most restrictive limitations as well as management's internal capital policy, BOKF, NA could declare up to $18 million of dividends. Dividend constraints
may be alleviated through increases in retained earnings, capital issuances or changes in risk weighted assets. Future losses or increases in required regulatory
capital at the bank could affect its ability to pay dividends to the parent company.

Our equity capital at March 31, 2022 was $4.9 billion, a $515 million decrease compared to December 31, 2021. Net income less cash dividends paid increased
equity $26 million during the first quarter of 2022. Changes in interest rates resulted in a $490 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income
compared to December 31, 2021. We also repurchased $48 million of common stock during the first quarter of 2022. Capital is managed to maximize long-
term value to the shareholders. Factors considered in managing capital include projections of future earnings including expected benefits from lower federal
income tax rates, asset growth and acquisition strategies, and regulatory and debt covenant requirements. Capital management may include subordinated debt
or perpetual preferred stock issuance, share repurchase and stock and cash dividends.

On April 30, 2019, the board of directors authorized the Company to purchase up to five million common shares, subject to market conditions, securities law
and other regulatory compliance limitations. As of March 31, 2022, 3,809,347 shares have been repurchased under this authorization. The Company
repurchased 475,877 shares of common stock at an average price of $101.02 a share in the first quarter of 2022. We view share buybacks opportunistically, but
within the context of maintaining our strong capital position.

BOK Financial and BOKF, NA are subject to various capital requirements administered by federal agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can
result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that could have a material impact on operations. These capital
requirements include quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items. The capital standards are also subject to qualitative judgments by
the regulators.
A summary of minimum capital requirements, including capital conservation buffer follows in Table 22. A bank which falls below these levels, including the
capital conservation buffer, would be subject to regulatory restrictions on capital distributions (including but not limited to dividends and share repurchases)
and executive bonus payments.

In March 2020, in response to the impact on the financial markets by the COVID-19 pandemic, the banking agencies issued an interim final rule permitting
banking organizations that implement CECL the option to delay for two years an estimate of the CECL methodology's effect on regulatory capital, followed by
a three-year transition period. The estimate includes the implementation date adjustment as of January 1, 2020 plus an estimate of the impact of the change for
a two year period following implementation of CECL. We have elected to delay the regulatory capital impact of the transition in accordance with the interim
final rule. Deferral of the impact of CECL added 11 basis points to the Company's Common equity Tier 1 capital at March 31, 2022.

The capital ratios for BOK Financial on a consolidated basis are presented in Table 22.

Capital resources of financial institutions are also regularly measured by the tangible common shareholders’ equity ratio. Tangible common shareholders’
equity is shareholders’ equity as defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) less intangible assets and
equity which does not benefit common shareholders. Equity that does not benefit common shareholders includes preferred equity. This non-GAAP measure is a
valuable indicator of a financial institution’s capital strength since it eliminates intangible assets from shareholders’ equity and retains the effect of unrealized
losses on securities and other components of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity.

Table 23 provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures with financial measures defined by GAAP.

Pre-provision net revenue is a measure of revenue less expenses, and is calculated before provision for credit losses and income tax expense. This financial
measure is frequently used by investors and analysts to enable them to assess a company's ability to generate earnings to cover credit losses through a credit
cycle. It also provides an additional basis for comparing the results of operations between periods by isolating the impact of the provision for credit losses,
which can vary significantly between periods.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the Company’s significant off-balance sheet commitments.
