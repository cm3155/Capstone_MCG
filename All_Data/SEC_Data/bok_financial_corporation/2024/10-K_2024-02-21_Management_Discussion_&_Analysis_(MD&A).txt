Management&#8217;s Assessment of Operations and Financial Condition 

Overview 

The following discussion is management's analysis to assist in the understanding and evaluation of the financial condition and results of operations of BOK Financial. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes and selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report. This section and other sections provide information about our recent financial performance. For information about results of operations for 2022 compared with 2021, see the respective sections in Management's Discussion and Analysis included in our 2022 Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2023. 

Economic conditions continued to be volatile in 2023 with inflationary concerns, fluctuating oil prices caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict and instability in the geopolitical environment. In order to combat rising inflation, the Federal Reserve began increasing the Federal Funds rate in March 2022 and continued to do so through the end of 2023 for a total 525 basis point increase. This has slowed the housing market, but home prices remain elevated. Consumer spending also continues to remain steady despite the Federal Reserve's effort to decrease spending with higher rates. Unemployment remains low, coming in at 3.7% for December 2023. See "Summary of Credit Loss Experience" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional discussion around our economic forecast. 

Performance Summary 

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2023 totaled $530.7 million or $8.02 per diluted share compared with net income of $520.3 million or $7.68 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2022. PPNR, a non-GAAP measure, was $728.9 million for 2023 compared to $690.1 million in the prior year. 2023 included a 52 cent per share reduction as a result of the FDIC special assessment. 

Highlights of 2023 included: 

&#8226; Net interest revenue totaled $1.3 billion for 2023, an increase of $60.8 million over the prior year. Net interest margin was 2.93% for 2023 compared to 2.98% for 2022, primarily due to deposit repricing activity and liability mix-shift. Average earning assets were $43.0 billion for 2023, up $2.9 billion compared to 2022, largely due to higher loan balances. 

&#8226; Fees and commissions revenue was $781.1 million for 2023, an increase of $123.9 million compared to 2022 led by a $99.6 million increase in brokerage and trading revenue. Trading revenue in 2022 was negatively affected by disruption in the fixed income markets. Fiduciary and asset management revenue increased $11.0 million with growth in Cavanal Hill fund fees, mutual fund fees, and trust business line fees. 

&#8226; Other gains and losses, net increased $56.7 million. The fourth quarter of 2023 included a pre-tax $31.0 million gain, before related professional fees, on the sale of our insurance brokerage and consulting business, BOKF Insurance. We also recognized a $17.3 million increase in the value of deferred compensation investments, which are held to offset the cost of various employee benefit programs. 

&#8226; Losses on available for sale securities totaled $30.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. We strategically repositioned a small portion of our portfolio throughout the year, mostly in the fourth quarter. 

&#8226; Other operating expense increased $168.4 million to $1.3 billion. Personnel expense grew $95.7 million, reflecting a combination of annual merit increases and salary adjustments, higher sales activity, and business expansion. Non-personnel expense increased $72.7 million including the FDIC special assessment of $43.8 million. Increased data processing and communications, business promotion, ongoing FDIC assessment costs, and occupancy and equipment expenses were partially offset by lower mortgage banking costs. 

&#8226; The net economic cost of the changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and related economic hedges was $18.2 million during 2023 compared to $12.5 million during 2022 due to continued market volatility throughout 2023. 

&#8226; The provision for credit losses was $46.0 million in 2023, primarily due to loan growth and changes in our economic forecast during the year, including a more challenging commercial real estate environment. Net charge-offs were $18.1 million or 0.08% of average loans on an annualized basis in 2023. We recorded a $30.0 million provision for expected credit losses in 2022. The combined allowance for credit losses totaled $326 million or 1.36% of outstanding loans at December 31, 2023. The combined allowance for credit losses was $297 million or 1.31% of outstanding loans at December 31, 2022. 

&#8226; Nonperforming assets not guaranteed by U.S. government agencies increased $18 million over December 31, 2022. Potential problem loans increased $65 million and other loans especially mentioned increased $43 million. 

&#8226; Average outstanding loan balances were $23.1 billion, a $1.8 billion increase, mostly driven by growth in commercial loans and commercial real estate loans secured by multifamily properties. Commercial loans increased $914 million and commercial real estate loans increased $818 million. Period-end outstanding loan balances increased $1.3 billion to $23.9 billion at December 31, 2023. 

&#8226; Average deposits decreased $4.6 billion to $33.2 billion. Average demand deposits decreased $4.2 billion while average interest-bearing deposits decreased $487 million. Period-end deposits decreased $461 million to $34.0 billion. The loan to deposit ratio was 70% at December 31, 2023 and was 65% at December 31, 2022. 

&#8226; Assets under management or administration totaled $104.7 billion at December 31, 2023, increasing $5.0 billion compared to December 31, 2022. 

&#8226; The Company's tangible common equity ratio, a non-GAAP measure, was 8.29% at December 31, 2023 and 7.63% at December 31, 2022. The tangible common equity ratio is primarily based on total shareholders' equity, which includes unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities. Adjusted for all securities portfolio losses, including the tax adjusted losses in the investment portfolio, the tangible common equity ratio would be 8.02% at December 31, 2023 and 7.36% at December 31, 2022. 

&#8226; The Company's common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.06% at December 31, 2023. In addition, the Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.07%, total capital ratio was 13.16% and leverage ratio was 9.45% at December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2022, the Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.71%, the total capital ratio was 12.67% and the leverage ratio was 9.91%. 

&#8226; The Company repurchased 2,113,808 common shares at an average price of $82.85 per share during 2023 and 1,632,401 common shares at an average price of $94.88 during 2022. 

&#8226; The Company paid cash dividends of $2.17 per common share during 2023 and $2.13 per common share in 2022. 

Net income for the fourth quarter of 2023 totaled $82.6 million or $1.26 per diluted share, compared to $134.5 million or $2.04 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2023. The fourth quarter included a 52 cent per share reduction as a result of the FDIC special assessment. 

Highlights of the fourth quarter of 2023 included: 

&#8226; Net interest revenue totaled $296.7 million, a decrease of $4.2 million compared to the prior quarter. Net interest margin was 2.64% compared to 2.69%, primarily due to deposit repricing activity and liability mix-shift. For the fourth quarter of 2023, our core net interest margin excluding trading activities, a non-GAAP measure, was 3.03% compared to 3.14% in the prior quarter. 

&#8226; Fees and commissions revenue was $196.8 million, largely consistent with the prior quarter. Lower brokerage and trading revenue and other revenue was offset by increased transaction card revenue. 

&#8226; Other gains and losses, net increased $39.0 million to $40.5 million. The fourth quarter included a $31.0 million pre-tax gain, before related professional fees, on the sale of our insurance brokerage and consulting business, BOKF Insurance. The value of our deferred compensation investments also increased $5.9 million versus a decline of $427 thousand in the prior quarter. 

&#8226; Losses on available for sale securities totaled $27.6 million in the fourth quarter. The gain on sale received from the disposition of BOKF Insurance was used to reposition a small portion of our available for sale securities portfolio. 

&#8226; Operating expense increased $59.8 million to $384.1 million. Personnel expense grew $12.2 million with higher regular compensation, incentive compensation, including deferred compensation plans, and employee benefits expense. Non-personnel expense increased $47.5 million including the FDIC special assessment of $43.8 million. Increased professional fees and services, business promotion, and charitable expenses were partially offset by lower occupancy and equipment costs. 

&#8226; The provision for credit losses of $6.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 reflects a stable economic forecast and continued loan growth. Net charge-offs were $4.1 million or 0.07% of average loans on an annualized basis in the fourth quarter. 

Critical Accounting Policies &#38; Estimates 

The Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company's accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management makes significant assumptions and estimates in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes in conformity with GAAP that may be highly subjective, complex and subject to variability. Actual results could differ significantly from these assumptions and estimates. The following discussion addresses the most critical areas where these assumptions and estimates could affect the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company. These critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the appropriate committees of the Board of Directors. 

Allowance for Loan Losses and Accrual for Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk from Loan Commitments 

The allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments represent the portion of amortized cost basis of loans and related unfunded commitments we do not expect to collect over the asset&#8217;s contractual life, considering past events, current conditions, as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. Quarterly, a senior management Allowance Committee assesses the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk. This assessment requires judgment about effects of uncertain matters, resulting in a subjective calculation which is inherently imprecise. Because of the subjective forward-looking nature of the calculation, changes in these measures may not directly correlate with actual economic events. In future periods, management judgment may consider new or changed information which may cause significant changes in these allowances in those future periods. 

See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the description of the expected credit losses calculation of the allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments. 

For the majority of risk-graded loans, the accruing loan's expected credit loss estimate is sensitive to management judgment, particularly probability of default and loss given default assumptions, changes in specific macroeconomic factor forecasts and the probability weight assigned to each economic scenario, and appropriate adjustments. 

Significant assumptions and estimates affecting the allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk include: 

&#8226; Probability of default and loss given default measurements are based on historical data that may not be a good predictor of future performance or actual losses. 

&#8226; Probability of default is based on risk grades, a subjective measurement of the risk of a loan. This subjective assessment of risk may not reflect actual risk of loss. 

&#8226; The forecast for each relevant economic loss driver and the probability weighting of economic scenarios are overseen by a senior management Economic Forecast Committee which includes members independent of the allowance process. 

&#8226; The Allowance Committee may increase or decrease the allowance to reflect risks not captured in the quantitative component. Examples of circumstances that may result in adjustments include, but are not limited to, new lines of business, market conditions that have not been previously encountered, observed changes in credit risk that are not yet reflected in macroeconomic factors, or economic conditions that impact loss given default assumptions. 

Although the resulting expected credit loss estimate represents management's best estimates at the time, actual credit losses will differ from management's estimate. Portfolio composition will change over time, actual economic conditions will differ from probability-weighted assumptions, borrower-specific circumstances will change, as well as other factors. Differences between actual losses and management's estimates may materially affect the Company's results of operations. 

We describe critical elements affecting our estimate of expected credit loss in the "Summary of Credit Loss Experience" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis. While it is challenging to evaluate the allowance impact for a change in a particular input, results of such an analysis demonstrate how the quantitative element of the allowance behaves under different conditions. The sensitivity to management's economic scenario weighting may be quantified by comparing the results of weighting each economic scenario at 100%. For example, compared to a 100% Base Case scenario, a 100% Downside case would result in an additional $172 million in quantitative reserve, while a 100% Upside Case would result in $19 million less in quantitative reserve at December 31, 2023. Such sensitivity calculations do not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the related allowance for a number of reasons including (1) management's weighting of multiple forecasted economic scenarios in estimating expected credit losses; (2) management's predictions of future economic trends and relationships among the scenarios may differ from actual events; and (3) management's application of subjective measures to modeled results when appropriate. 

Fair Value Measurement 

Certain assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Fair value is defined by applicable accounting guidance as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal markets for the given asset or liability at the measurement date based on market conditions at that date. An orderly transaction assumes exposure to the market for a customary period for marketing activities prior to the measurement date and not a forced liquidation or distressed sale. 

A hierarchy for fair value has been established that prioritizes the inputs of valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad categories: unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1), other observable inputs that can be observed either directly or indirectly (Level 2) and unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities (Level 3). Fair value may be recorded for certain assets and liabilities every reporting period on a recurring basis or under certain circumstances on a non-recurring basis. Fair value measurements of significant assets or liabilities that are based on unobservable inputs (Level 3) are considered Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. Additional discussion of fair value measurement and disclosure is included in Notes 7 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Mortgage Servicing Rights 

We have a significant investment in MSRs. Our MSRs are primarily retained from sales in the secondary market of residential mortgage loans we have originated or purchased from correspondent lenders. MSRs may be purchased from other lenders. Both originated and purchased MSRs are initially recognized at fair value. We carry all MSRs at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized in earnings as they occur. 

MSRs are not traded in active markets. The fair value of MSRs is determined by discounting the projected cash flows. Certain significant assumptions and estimates used in valuing MSRs are based on current market sources including projected prepayment speeds, assumed servicing costs, earnings on escrow deposits, ancillary income and discount rates. Assumptions used to value our MSRs are considered significant unobservable inputs and represent our best estimate of assumptions that market participants would use to value this asset. A separate third-party model is used to estimate prepayment speeds based on interest rates, housing turnover rates, estimated loan curtailment, anticipated defaults and other relevant factors. The prepayment model is updated periodically for changes in market conditions and adjusted to better correlate with actual performance of our servicing portfolio. The discount rate is based on benchmark rates for mortgage loans plus a market spread expected by investors in servicing rights. Significant assumptions used to determine the fair value of our MSRs are presented in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At least quarterly, we request estimates of fair value from outside sources to corroborate the results of the valuation model. 

The assumptions used in this model are primarily based on mortgage interest rates. Evaluation of the effect of a change in one assumption without considering the effect of that change on other assumptions is not meaningful. Considering all related assumptions, we expect a 50 basis point parallel rate shock to increase the fair value of our servicing rights by $8.0 million. We expect a $9.9 million decrease in the fair value of our MSRs from a 50 basis point parallel rate shock. 

Results of Operations 

Net Interest Revenue and Net Interest Margin 

2023 Net Interest Revenue 

Net interest revenue is the interest earned on debt securities, loans and other interest-earning assets less interest paid for interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings. The net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax-equivalent net interest revenue by average interest-earning assets. Net interest spread is the difference between the average rate earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is typically greater than net interest spread due to interest income earned on assets funded by non-interest bearing liabilities such as demand deposits and equity. 

Tax-equivalent net interest revenue totaled $1.3 billion for 2023, an increase of $61.1 million over the prior year. Net interest revenue increased $139.6 million due to changes in interest rates and decreased $78.5 million from increased average borrowing levels partially offset by growth in earning assets. Table 3 shows the effects on net interest revenue due to changes in average balances and interest rates for the various types of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, see the Annual Financial Summary of consolidated daily average balances, yields and rates as shown in Table 2. 

Net interest margin was 2.93% for 2023 and 2.98% for 2022. Our core net interest margin excluding trading activities, a non-GAAP measure, was 3.31% compared to 3.26% in the prior year. In response to rising inflation, the Federal Reserve increased the federal funds rate 525 basis points since the beginning of 2022. The resulting impact on market interest rates increased net interest margin at first as our earning assets, led by our significant percentage of variable-rate commercial loans, repriced at a higher rate and faster pace than our interest-bearing liabilities. Throughout 2023, we have experienced margin compression reflecting deposit repricing activity. The tax-equivalent yield on earning assets was 5.38% for 2023 compared to 3.42% in 2022. Loan yields increased 246 basis points to 7.08%. The available for sale securities portfolio yield increased 99 basis points to 3.06%. The yield on trading securities grew 250 basis points to 4.74% and the yield on interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents increased 368 basis points to 5.12%. 

Funding costs increased 273 basis points compared to 2022. The cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 226 basis points. The cost of other short-term borrowings increased 322 basis points. The benefit to net interest margin from earning assets funded by non-interest bearing liabilities was 98 basis points for 2023, up from 26 basis points for 2022. 

Average earning assets for 2023 increased $2.9 billion or 7% compared 2022. Average loans, net of allowance for loan losses, increased $1.8 billion, largely due to growth in commercial and commercial real estate loans. The average balance of investment securities increased $875 million while the average balance of available for sale securities, which consists largely of residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, increased $298 million. In the second quarter 2022, we transferred $2.4 billion of U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities from available for sale to the investment securities portfolio to limit the effect of future rate increases on the tangible common equity ratio. Average interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents decreased $169 million and average trading securities balances decreased $164 million. 

Total average deposits decreased $4.6 billion compared to the prior year as customers redeploy capital. Lower average demand deposit balances of $4.2 billion and average interest-bearing transaction account balances of $1.3 billion were partially offset by higher average time deposits of $908 million. Average short-term borrowings increased $5.7 billion. 

Our overall objective is to manage the Company's balance sheet for changes in interest rates as described in the Market Risk section of this report. Approximately 81% of our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios are either variable rate loans or fixed rate loans that will reprice within one year. These loans are funded primarily by deposit accounts that are either non-interest bearing or that reprice more slowly than the loans. The result is a balance sheet that would be asset-sensitive which means that assets generally reprice more quickly than liabilities. One of the strategies that we use to manage toward a relative rate-neutral position is to purchase fixed rate residential mortgage-backed securities issued primarily by U.S. government agencies and fund them with market rate sensitive liabilities. The liability-sensitive nature of this strategy provides an offset to the asset-sensitive characteristics of our loan portfolio. We also may use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risk. 

The effectiveness of these strategies is reflected in the overall change in net interest revenue due to changes in interest rates as shown in Table 3 and in the interest rate sensitivity projections as shown in the Market Risk section of this report.

Fourth Quarter 2023 Net Interest Revenue 

Tax-equivalent net interest revenue totaled $298.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, a decrease of $4.3 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. Net interest margin was 2.64% for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to 2.69% for the third quarter of 2023. For the fourth quarter of 2023, our core net interest margin excluding trading activities, a non-GAAP measure, was 3.03% compared to 3.14% in the prior quarter. The Federal Reserve increased the federal funds rate 100 basis points in 2023 following a 425 basis point increase in 2022. While the resulting market interest rates increased net interest margin in the beginning of the rising rate cycle, largely due to our significant percentage of variable-rate commercial loans, deposit and funding repricing outpaced the increase in net interest income in the fourth quarter. 

Average earning assets for the fourth quarter of 2023 increased $315 million over the third quarter of 2023. Average loans, net of allowance for loan losses, increased $284 million, largely due to growth in commercial and commercial real estate loans. Available for sale securities increased $138 million while investment securities decreased $67 million. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $1.2 billion as deposits continue to shift from demand to interest-bearing. Funds purchased and repurchase agreements declined $222 million while average other borrowings increased $153 million. 

The tax-equivalent yield on earning assets was 5.64% for the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 15 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2023. Loan yields increased 11 basis points to 7.36% while the yield on available for sale securities increased 16 basis points to 3.27%. The yield on trading securities was up 29 basis points to 5.05%. 

Funding costs were 3.98%, an increase of 17 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2023. The cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 26 basis points to 3.43% while the cost of other short-term borrowings increased 6 basis points to 5.35%. The cost of other borrowings was up 7 basis points to 5.55%. The cost of funds purchased and repurchase agreements decreased 2 basis points to 4.79%. The benefit to net interest margin from earning assets funded by non-interest bearing liabilities was 98 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 101 basis points in the third quarter of 2023.

The yield calculations exclude security trades that have been recorded on trade date with no corresponding interest income and the unrealized gains and losses. The yield calculation also includes average loan balances for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued and are net of unearned income. Yield/rate calculations are generally based on the conventions that determine how interest income and expense is accrued

Fees and commissions revenue 

Diversified sources of fees and commissions revenue are a significant part of our business strategy and represented 38% of combined net interest revenue before provision for credit losses and fees and commission revenue. We believe that a variety of fee revenue sources provides diversification to changes resulting from market or economic conditions such as interest rates, values in the equity markets, commodity prices and consumer spending, all of which can be volatile. Many of these economic factors, such as decreasing interest rates, that we expect will result in a decline in net interest revenue or fiduciary and asset management revenue may also increase mortgage banking production volumes and related trading. The velocity of changes in market conditions and interest rates may result in timing differences between when offsetting impacts and benefits are realized. Generally, for operating revenues not as directly related to movement in interest rates, we expect growth to come through offering new products and services and by further development of our presence in other markets. However, current and future economic conditions, regulatory constraints, increased competition and saturation in our existing markets could affect the rate of future increases. 

Brokerage and trading revenue, which includes revenues from trading, customer hedging, retail brokerage and investment banking, increased $99.6 million or 71% over the prior year. 

Trading revenue includes net realized and unrealized gains and losses primarily related to sales of residential mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by U.S. government agencies and related derivative instruments that enable our mortgage banking customers to manage their production risk. Trading revenue also includes net realized and unrealized gains and losses on municipal securities and other financial instruments that we sell to institutional customers, along with changes in the fair value of financial instruments we hold as economic hedges against market risk of our trading securities. Trading revenue was $134.5 million for 2023, an increase of $114.2 million compared to 2022. Trading revenue was negatively affected by the disruption of the fixed income markets early in 2022. See additional discussion in "Lines of Business" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis. 

Customer hedging revenue is based primarily on realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of derivative contracts held for customer risk management programs. As more fully discussed under Customer Derivative Programs in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we offer commodity, interest rate, foreign exchange and equity derivatives to our customers. Derivative contracts executed with customers are offset with contracts between selected counterparties and exchanges to minimize market risk from changes in commodity prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates. Customer hedging revenue, which is largely volume driven, totaled $36.5 million for 2023, a decrease of $9.2 million or 20% compared to 2022 and was primarily attributed to our energy and interest rate derivative customers. Customer hedging revenue includes credit valuation adjustments of the fair value of derivatives to reflect the risk of counterparty default. 

Investment banking, which includes fees earned upon completion of underwriting, financial advisory services and loan syndication fees, totaled $43.0 million for 2023, a decrease of $2.7 million or 6% compared to 2022, largely related to the timing and volume of transactions. 

Revenue earned from retail brokerage transactions totaled $15.9 million for 2023, consistent with prior year. Retail brokerage revenue is primarily based on fees and commissions earned on sales of fixed income securities, annuities, mutual funds and other financial instruments to retail customers. Revenue is primarily based on the volume of customer transactions and applicable commission rate for each type of product. 

Insurance brokerage fees were $10.7 million for 2023, a decrease of $2.2 million or 17% compared to 2022, reflecting lower revenue trends combined with the sale of this business in the fourth quarter of 2023. 

Transaction card revenue depends largely on the volume and amount of transactions processed, the number of TransFund ATM locations and the number of merchants served. Transaction card revenue totaled $106.9 million for 2023, a $2.6 million or 2% increase over 2022. Revenues from the processing of transactions on behalf of the members of our TransFund EFT network totaled $89.5 million, up $4.9 million or 6% over 2022. The number of TransFund ATM locations totaled 2,713 at December 31, 2023 compared to 2,774 at December 31, 2022. Merchant services fees paid by customers for account management and electronic processing of card transactions totaled $9.2 million, a decrease of $3.2 million or 26%. 

Fiduciary and asset management revenue is earned through managing or holding of assets for customers and executing transactions or providing related services. Fiduciary and asset management revenue is largely based on the fair value of assets. Rates applied to those asset values vary based on the nature of the relationship. Fiduciary and managed asset relationships generally have a higher fee rate than non-fiduciary and/or managed relationships. 

Fiduciary and asset management revenue increased $11.0 million or 6% compared to 2022, primarily due to increases in Cavanal Hill fund fees, mutual fund fees, and trust business line fees. During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, we voluntarily waived certain administration fees on the Cavanal Hill money market funds in order to maintain positive yields on these funds in the low short-term interest rate environment. This practice subsided in 2022 with $3.1 million in fee waivers during 2022.

Table 8 &#8211; Changes in Assets Under Management or Administration 

(In thousands) 

##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Beginning balance $ 99,735,040 &#160; $ 104,917,721 $ 91,592,247 Net inflows (outflows) (3,105,170) 572,812 4,786,237 Net change in fair value 8,107,129 &#160; (5,755,493) 8,539,237 Ending balance $ 104,736,999 &#160; $ 99,735,040 $ 104,917,721 ##TABLE_END

Assets under management as of December 31, 2023 consist of 42% fixed income, 33% equities, 16% cash and 9% alternative investments. Net outflows from assets under management increased during 2023, largely due to larger disbursements related to retirement plans. The increase in fair value of $8.1 billion mainly resulted from improvements in the equity markets in 2023. 

Deposit service charges and fees totaled $108.5 million for 2023, a $2.1 million or 2% decrease compared to 2022. Overdraft fees and non-sufficient fund fees earned primarily on consumer deposit accounts totaled $21.0 million for 2023, a decrease of $4.4 million or 17% compared to 2022. Changes were implemented in the fourth quarter of 2022 to eliminate non-sufficient funds fees and reduce consumer overdraft fees. Service charges earned primarily on commercial deposit accounts totaled $57.7 million, a $1.1 million or 2% increase over the previous year. Automated service charges totaled $6.3 million, a $1.1 million or 20% increase over 2022. Check card revenue totaled $23.5 million, relatively unchanged from 2022. 

Mortgage banking revenue totaled $55.7 million for 2023, a $6.3 million or 13% increase over 2022. Mortgage servicing revenue was $61.0 million, a $9.8 million increase compared to the prior year. The average outstanding principal balance of mortgage loans serviced for others totaled $20.8 billion at December 31, 2023, a $2.9 billion increase compared to December 31, 2022. During 2023, we acquired $2.8 billion in unpaid principal balance of mortgage servicing rights. This, combined with purchases in 2022 of mortgage servicing rights with an unpaid principal balance of $3.8 billion, led to higher mortgage servicing revenue in 2023. Mortgage production losses were $5.3 million, increasing $3.5 million, largely related to qualifying residential mortgage loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies previously in forbearance that have been resold into GNMA pools following the applicable performance period specified by the programs. Rising mortgage interest rates, low inventory, and home price affordability continued to place pressure on mortgage loan originations and margins in 2023. Production volume was down $399 million and production revenue as a percentage of production volume also decreased 64 basis points to (0.81)%. Mortgage refinancing activity was 9% of total production in 2023 compared to 24% in 2022.

Primary rates disclosed in Table 9 above represent rates generally available to borrowers on 30 year conforming mortgage loans. 

Other revenue totaled $62.1 million for 2023, an increase of $6.5 million or 12% compared to 2022, largely due to increased revenue on bank-owned life insurance and increased margin interest fees. 

Other gains, net and net gains on securities and derivatives 

Other gains, net increased $56.7 million compared to 2022. The fourth quarter of 2023 included a pre-tax $31.0 million gain, before related professional fees, on the sale of our insurance brokerage and consulting business, BOKF Insurance. We also recognized a $17.3 million increase in the value of deferred compensation investments, which are held to offset the cost of various employee benefit programs. The increase was principally due to improvements in the equity markets in 2023. 

We also recognized a $30.6 million loss on the sale of available for sale securities in 2023. 

As discussed in the Market Risk section following, the fair value of our MSRs changes in response to changes in primary mortgage loan rates and other assumptions. We attempt to mitigate the earnings volatility caused by changes in the fair value of MSRs by designating certain financial instruments, generally U.S. government agency residential mortgage-backed securities for which we have elected the fair value option, as an economic hedge. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are generally expected to partially offset changes in the fair value of MSRs.

Other operating revenue was $204.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, a $6.7 million or 3% increase over the third quarter of 2023. 

Brokerage and trading revenue decreased $1.4 million to $60.9 million. Investment banking revenue decreased $2.4 million to $11.5 million following a record third quarter from our Public and Corporate Finance group, which underwrites municipal bonds. Trading revenue grew $1.1 million to $35.5 million, largely related to our municipal bond trading activity. Insurance brokerage fees decreased $890 thousand to $1.8 million in conjunction with the sale of this business in the fourth quarter. Transaction card revenue grew $2.5 million to $28.8 million as a result of fourth quarter transaction activity. All other fee businesses performed consistently with the prior quarter. 

Other gains, net, increased $39.0 million to $40.5 million. The fourth quarter included a $31.0 million pre-tax gain, before related professional fees, on the sale of our insurance brokerage and consulting business, BOKF Insurance. The value of our deferred compensation investments also increased $5.9 million versus a decline of $427 thousand in the prior quarter due to performance of the equity markets in the fourth quarter. We also recognized a $27.6 million loss on the sale of available for sale securities in the fourth quarter. The gain on sale received from the disposition of BOKF Insurance was used to reposition a small portion of our available for sale securities portfolio. 

Other Operating Expense 

2023 Other Operating Expense 

Other operating expense for 2023 totaled $1.3 billion, a $168.4 million or 14% increase compared to the prior year. Personnel expense increased $95.7 million or 14%.

Personnel expense 

Personnel expense was $766.6 million in 2023, including $9.8 million in deferred compensation expense. Deferred compensation expense increased $16.1 million as the deferred compensation liabilities mirror the performance of the deferred compensation investments, which increased due to performance of the equity markets in 2023. Excluding deferred compensation costs, personnel expense increased $79.6 million. Regular compensation increased $40.9 million or 10% due to a combination of annual merit increases commencing in the first quarter, salary adjustments and business expansion. Cash-based incentive compensation plans, which are either intended to provide current rewards to employees who generate long-term business opportunities for the Company based on growth in loans, deposits, customer relationships and other measurable metrics or intended to compensate employees with commissions on completed transactions, increased $23.8 million or 14% compared to 2022, primarily related to higher loan and trading volumes. Changes in assumptions of certain performance-based equity awards led to a $5.8 million or 61% increase in share-based compensation expense. Employee benefits expense increased $9.2 million or 10%. The prior year included a $3.5 million decrease related to the termination of the Pension Plan. The remaining increase is primarily related to higher payroll tax expense and retirement plan costs. 

Non-personnel expense 

Excluding the FDIC special assessment, non-personnel expense was $52.5 million, an increase of $28.9 million or 6% over the prior year. 

Data processing and communications expense increased $15.5 million or 9%, largely affected by on-going technology project costs. Insurance expense increased $12.8 million or 71% due to higher ongoing assessment costs. On October 18, 2022, the FDIC finalized a rule that increased the initial base deposit insurance assessment rates by 2 basis points beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. Higher travel and advertising costs driven largely by business expansion led to a $5.4 million or 20% increase in business promotion expense. Occupancy and equipment expense was also up $4.6 million or 4%, primarily driven by the retirement of certain ATMs as we upgrade our network. 

Mortgage banking costs decreased $5.3 million or 15%, primarily due to a decrease in prepayments.

Other operating expense for the fourth quarter of 2023 totaled $384.1 million, an increase of $59.8 million or 18% over the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by the $43.8 million FDIC special assessment. 

Personnel expense was $203.0 million, including $5.4 million of deferred compensation expense. Excluding deferred compensation costs, personnel expense increased $6.9 million or 4% over the prior quarter. Regular compensation increased $3.2 million or 3%, primarily due to compensation related to business expansion and transaction related employee costs on the BOKF Insurance sale. Higher sales activity led to a $4.0 million or 8% increase in cash based incentive compensation. Employee benefits expense increased $1.1 million or 5%, primarily due to seasonal employee healthcare costs. 

Excluding the FDIC special assessment, non-personnel expense was $137.3 million, an increase of $3.8 million or 3%. A $3.1 million or 23% increase in professional fees and services was largely attributable to fees associated with the sale of BOKF Insurance. The fourth quarter of 2023 included a $1.5 million charitable donation to the BOKF Foundation as we continue to focus on the communities we serve. Occupancy and equipment costs decreased $2.2 million driven by the retirement of certain ATMs in the third quarter. 

Income Taxes 

Income tax expense was $152.1 million or 22.3% of net income before taxes for 2023 and $139.9 million or 21.2% of net income before taxes for 2022. 

Net deferred tax assets totaled $269.6 million at December 31, 2023 compared to net deferred tax assets of $321.3 million at December 31, 2022. We have evaluated the recoverability of our deferred tax assets based on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible and determined that no valuation allowance was required in 2023 or 2022. 

Income tax expense was $29.0 million or 26.0% of net income before taxes for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $33.3 million or 19.8% of net income before taxes for the third quarter of 2023. The fourth quarter of 2023 included an acceleration of $3.1 million of tax expense as a result of exiting three low income housing tax credit investments. 

Lines of Business 

We operate three principal lines of business: Commercial Banking, Consumer Banking and Wealth Management. Commercial Banking includes lending, treasury and cash management services and customer risk management products for small businesses, middle market and larger commercial customers. Commercial Banking also includes the TransFund EFT network. Consumer Banking includes retail lending and deposit services, lending and deposit services to small business customers served through our consumer branch network and all mortgage loan origination and servicing activities. Wealth Management provides fiduciary services, private bank services, insurance and investment advisory services in all markets. Wealth Management also underwrites state and municipal securities and engages in brokerage and trading activities. 

In addition to our lines of business, we have a Funds Management unit. The primary purpose of this unit is to manage our overall liquidity needs and interest rate risk. Each line of business borrows funds from and provides funds to the Funds Management unit as needed to support their operations. Operating results for Funds Management and other include the effect of interest rate risk positions and risk management activities, securities gains and losses, the provision for credit losses in excess of net loans charged off, tax planning strategies and certain executive compensation costs that are not attributed to the lines of business. The Funds Management unit also initially recognizes accruals for loss contingencies when losses become probable. Actual losses are recognized by the lines of business if the accruals are settled. 

We allocate resources and evaluate the performance of our lines of business using the net direct contribution, which includes the allocation of funds and capital costs. Credit costs are attributed to the lines of business based on net loans charged off or recovered. The difference between credit costs attributed to the lines of business and the consolidated provision for credit losses is attributed to Funds Management. In addition, we measure the performance of our business lines after allocations of certain indirect expenses and taxes based on statutory rates. 

Net interest income in our lines of business reflects our internal funds transfer pricing methodology. The funds transfer pricing methodology is the process by which the Company allocates interest income and expense to the lines of business and transfers the primary interest rate risk and liquidity risk to the Funds Management unit. The funds transfer pricing methodology considers the interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities. Periodically, the methodology and assumptions utilized in transfer pricing are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest income to the lines of business. 

As a result of the rising interest rate environment that began in 2022 and continued into 2023, the cost of funds for assets and the credits earned for liabilities have generally increased, impacting the business lines' net interest revenue. During the period ended December 31, 2023, this has resulted in a higher cost of funds for loans and contributed to margin expansion on deposits. 

Economic capital is assigned to the business units by a capital allocation model that reflects management's assessment of risk. This model assigns capital based upon credit, operating, interest rate and other market risk inherent in our business lines and recognizes the diversification benefits among the units. The level of assigned economic capital is a combination of the risk taken by each business line, based on its actual exposures and calibrated to its own loss history where possible. Average invested capital includes economic capital and amounts we have invested in the lines of business. 

As shown in Table 14 following, net income attributable to our lines of business increased $528.1 million or 92% compared to the prior year. Net interest revenue grew by $599.4 million over the prior year, primarily due to an increase in the spread on deposits. Net charge-offs decreased $3.7 million compared to the prior year. Other operating revenue increased $173.4 million. primarily due to growth in brokerage and trading revenues as the prior year was negatively affected by the disruption in the fixed income markets. The current year included the sale of BOKF Insurance that resulted in a $31.0 million pre-tax gain. Other operating expense increased $66.6 million with a $46.3 million increase in personnel expense and $20.3 million increase in non-personnel expense. The decrease in net income attributed to Funds Management and other is largely due to the full year impact of increased deposit credit rates to the business units from the Funding Center as market rates were rising, which exceeded the pace of rate increases the business lines passed through to their deposit products.

Net interest revenue and fee revenue increased $287.9 million or 39%, primarily due to an increase in the spread on deposits combined with loan growth . Net loans charged off decreased $3.8 million to $14.0 million in 2023. 

Fees and commissions revenue was consistent with the prior year. Growth in other revenue of $6.1 million and transaction card revenue of $2.3 million was completely offset by decreases in underwriting fees and customer hedging revenue. 

Operating expense increased $23.6 million or 8% over 2022. Personnel expense increased $16.1 million or 9%, reflecting a combination of annual merit increases and salary adjustments, along with increased incentive compensation costs associated with growth in loans. Non-personnel expense increased $7.4 million or 6%, driven primarily by ongoing technology projects, retirement of certain ATMs and increased insurance assessment costs. Corporate expense allocations increased $7.7 million or 11% compared to the prior year due to growth in lending activity. 

The average outstanding balance of loans attributed to Commercial Banking increased $1.8 billion or 10% over 2022 to $19.4 billion. See the Loans section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition following for additional discussion of changes in commercial and commercial real estate loans, which are primarily attributed to the Commercial Banking segment. 

Average deposits attributed to Commercial Banking were $15.3 billion for 2023, a $3.0 billion or 16% decrease compared to the prior year. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital for further discussion of this change.

Commercial Banking contributed $159.0 million to consolidated net income in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of $1.1 million over the third quarter of 2023. Net interest revenue decreased $3.8 million resulting from a shift in deposit balances from demand to interest-bearing transaction accounts. Fees and commissions revenue increased $3.1 million, primarily driven by growth in transaction card revenue. Net loans charged off decreased $1.9 million to $3.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Personnel expense increased $3.0 million led by increases in cash-based incentive compensation and regular compensation. Non-personnel expense decreased $4.3 million as the prior quarter included the retirement of certain ATMs. 

2023 Consumer Banking 

Consumer Banking services are provided through four primary distribution channels: traditional branches, the 24-hour ExpressBank call center, internet banking and mobile banking. Consumer Banking also conducts mortgage banking activities through offices located outside our Consumer Banking markets. 

Net income attributed to Consumer Banking totaled $221.6 million for 2023 compared to $5.9 million in the prior year.

Net interest revenue from Consumer Banking activities increased by $291.5 million or 184% compared to 2022, largely due to an increase in the spread on deposits sold to our Funds Management unit. 

Fees and commissions revenue increased $1.8 million or 1% compared to the prior year. Mortgage banking revenue increased $6.7 million, primarily due to growth in mortgage servicing revenue driven by recent purchases of mortgage servicing rights, partially offset by a decline in mortgage production volumes due to a combination of factors largely attributed to reduced mortgage loan production volume combined with narrowing margins. Mortgage production volume decreased $399 million or 38% and production revenue as a percentage of production volume, which includes unrealized gains and losses on our mortgage commitment pipeline and related hedges, decreased 64 basis points to (0.81)%. Deposit service charges and fees decreased $3.7 million as non-sufficient funds fees were eliminated and consumer overdraft fees were reduced in the fourth quarter of 2022. 

Operating expense increased $2.9 million or 1% led by higher regular compensation. Corporate expense allocations increased $3.6 million or 8% compared to the prior year. 

Average loans attributed to Consumer Banking increased $112 million or 7% to $1.8 billion. Average consumer deposits declined $749 million or 9% to $8.0 billion. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital for further discussion of the changes. 

The net cost of the change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights and related economic hedges, as more fully presented in Table 10, was $18.2 million for 2023 compared to a net cost of $12.5 million in 2022.

Consumer Banking contributed $53.7 million to net income in the fourth quarter of 2023, a decrease of $3.2 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. The net cost of changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and related economic hedges was $5.2 million compared to $1.3 million for the third quarter of 2023. Net interest revenue increased $1.8 million, mainly due to an increase in the funds credit on deposit balances. Fees and commissions revenue and operating expense were consistent with the prior quarter.

Combined net interest revenue and fees and commission revenue attributed to the Wealth Management segment totaled $657.0 million for 2023, an increase of $155.9 million, primarily driven by an increase in the spread on deposits combined with growth in brokerage and trading revenues. The prior year was negatively affected by the disruption in the fixed income markets. Fiduciary and asset management revenue increased $10.8 million led by higher Cavanal Hill fund fees, mutual fund fees, and trust business line fees. Other revenue increased $8.9 million, largely due to higher derivative margin use fees. 

Average Wealth Management loans grew by $35 million or 2% to $2.2 billion. Average deposits attributed to Wealth Management decreased $752 million or 9% to $7.7 billion in 2023. 

Operating expense increased $40.2 million or 13% over the prior year. Personnel expense increased $27.9 million or 12% due to a combination of higher trading volumes and business expansion. Non-personnel expense increased $12.2 million or 14% due to increased professional fees and services from the sale of BOKF Insurance combined with higher data processing and communications expense from ongoing technology projects. Corporate expense allocations increased $3.2 million or 6% over the prior year.

Wealth Management contributed $62.7 million to net income in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of $19.7 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. The fourth quarter included a pre-tax gain of $31.0 million, before related professional fees, on the sale of BOKF Insurance. Combined net interest and fee revenue totaled $161.5 million, an increase of $1.5 million. Total revenue from institutional trading activities increased $4.1 million due to favorable market opportunities, largely related to our municipal bond trading activity. Investment banking revenue decreased $3.3 million following a record third quarter from our Public and Corporate Finance group. Operating expense increased $6.9 million. Personnel expense increased $2.4 million due to increased cash-based incentive compensation driven by growth in trading activities and transaction related employee costs on the BOKF Insurance sale. Non-personnel expense increased $4.5 million with $2.5 million in professional fees directly related to the sale of BOKF Insurance and the remainder primarily resulting from settlement of certain disputed matters. 

Financial Condition 

Securities 

We maintain a securities portfolio to enhance profitability, manage interest rate risk, provide liquidity and comply with regulatory requirements. Securities are classified as trading, held for investment, or available for sale. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the composition of the securities portfolio as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

We hold an inventory of trading securities in support of sales to a variety of customers including banks, corporations, insurance companies, money managers and others. Trading securities totaled $5.2 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of $729 million compared to December 31, 2022. As discussed in the Market Risk section of this report, trading activities involve risk of loss from adverse price movements. We mitigate this risk within board-approved value-at-risk limits through the use of derivative contracts, short-sales and other techniques. 

At December 31, 2023, the carrying value of investment (held-to-maturity) securities was $2.2 billion, including a $336 thousand allowance for expected credit losses, compared to $2.5 billion at December 31, 2022 with a $558 thousand allowance for expected credit losses. The fair value of investment securities was $2.1 billion at December 31, 2023 and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2022. Investment securities consist primarily of residential mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies, intermediate and long-term, fixed rate Oklahoma and Texas municipal bonds, and taxable Texas school construction bonds. The investment security portfolio is diversified among issuers. During the second quarter of 2022, the Company transferred certain U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities from the available for sale portfolio to the investment securities portfolio to limit the effect of future rate increases on the tangible common equity ratio. No gains or losses were recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings at the time of the transfer. At the time of transfer, the fair value totaled $2.4 billion, amortized cost totaled $2.7 billion and the pretax unrealized loss totaled $268 million. Transfers of debt securities into the investment securities portfolio are made at fair value at the date of transfer. The unrealized holding gain or loss at the date of transfer is retained in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and in the carrying value of the investment securities portfolio. Such amounts are amortized over the estimated remaining lives of the securities as an adjustment to yield, offsetting the related amortization of the premium or accretion of the discount on the transferred securities. 

Available for sale securities, which may be sold prior to maturity, are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains or losses, net of deferred taxes, are recorded as Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in shareholders&#8217; equity. At December 31, 2023, the fair value of available for sale securities was $12.3 billion, an increase of $793 million compared to December 31, 2022. The amortized cost of available for sale securities totaled $12.9 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of $544 million compared to December 31, 2022. Available for sale securities consist primarily of U.S. government agency residential mortgage-backed securities and U.S. government agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. Both residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities have credit risk from delinquency or default of the underlying loans. We mitigate this risk by primarily investing in securities issued by U.S. government agencies for which the principal and interest payments on the underlying loans are fully guaranteed. Commercial mortgage-backed securities have prepayment penalties similar to commercial loans. At December 31, 2023, residential mortgage-backed securities represented 62% of total fair value of available for sale securities. 

A primary risk of holding residential mortgage-backed securities comes from extension during periods of rising interest rates or prepayment during periods of falling interest rates. We evaluate this risk through extensive modeling of risk both before making an investment and throughout the life of the security. Our best estimate of the effective duration of the combined residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio held in investment and available for sale securities portfolios at December 31, 2023 is 3.4 years. Management estimates the combined portfolios' duration extends to 3.8 years assuming an immediate 200 basis point upward shock. The estimated duration contracts to 2.5 years assuming a 200 basis point decline in the current rate environment. 

The aggregate gross amount of unrealized losses on available for sale securities totaled $669 million at December 31, 2023, a $225 million decrease compared to December 31, 2022. On a quarterly basis, we perform an evaluation on debt securities to determine if the unrealized losses are temporary as more fully described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. No credit impairment of available for sale securities was identified in 2023. 

Certain residential mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies and included in Fair value option securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets have been segregated and designated as economic hedges of changes in the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights. We have elected to carry these securities at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in current period income. These securities are held with the intent that gains or losses will offset changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and related derivative contracts. Fair value option securities totaled $21 million, a decrease of $276 million compared to 2022. See Market Risk section for further details. 

At December 31, 2023, we hold 252,233 non-transferable Class B-1 (formerly class B) shares of Visa, Inc. in connection with a restructuring and public offering by Visa U.S.A. As a member of Visa U.S.A., we received the Class B shares based on our interest in Visa U.S.A. On September 13, 2023, Visa, Inc. announced its intent to engage with common stockholders on a potential proposal that would result in the release of certain transfer restrictions on a portion of Visa Class B-1 common stock. The proposal was approved by a majority of voting common stockholders on January 23, 2024. As approved, the proposal is expected to provide us the option to convert up to 50% of our Class B-1 shares to Visa Class C shares and subsequently to freely transferable Visa Class A common shares. The details regarding the exchange process are undetermined as of February 21, 2024. The per share closing price of a Visa Class A common share was $260.35 at December 31, 2023. In light of uncertainties associated with certain ongoing litigation matters involving Visa and the timing and outcome of the aforementioned proposal, the ultimate impact of this gain contingency is unknown. 

Bank-Owned Life Insurance 

We have approximately $410 million of bank-owned life insurance at December 31, 2023. This investment is expected to provide a long-term source of earnings to support existing employee benefit programs. Approximately $314 million is held in separate accounts and $96 million represents the cash surrender value of policies held in general accounts and other amounts due from various insurance companies. Our separate account holdings are invested in diversified portfolios of investment-grade fixed income securities and cash equivalents, including U.S. Treasury and agency securities, residential mortgage-backed securities, corporate debt, asset-backed and commercial mortgage-backed securities. The portfolios are managed by unaffiliated professional managers within parameters established in the portfolio&#8217;s investment guidelines. The cash surrender value of certain life insurance policies is further supported by a stable value wrap which protects against changes in the fair value of the investments. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of investments held in separate accounts covered by the stable value wrap was approximately $289 million. Since the underlying fair value of the investments held in separate accounts at December 31, 2023 was below the net book value of the investments, $22 million of cash surrender value was supported by the stable value wrap. The remaining $2 million of fair value held in separate accounts is not supported by the stable value wrap. Future rate increases may cause write-downs in the current period. The stable value wrap is provided by an investment grade financial institution. 

Loans 

The aggregate loan portfolio before allowance for loan losses totaled $23.9 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of $1.3 billion compared to December 31, 2022, driven by growth in commercial loans, commercial real estate loans and loans to individuals.

Commercial 

Commercial loans represent loans for working capital, facilities acquisition or expansion, purchases of equipment and other needs of commercial customers primarily located within our geographical footprint. Commercial loans are underwritten individually and represent ongoing relationships based on a thorough knowledge of the customer, the customer&#8217;s industry and market. While commercial loans are generally secured by the customer&#8217;s assets including real property, inventory, accounts receivable, operating equipment, interests in mineral rights and other property and may also include personal guarantees of the owners and related parties, the primary source of repayment of the loans is the ongoing cash flow from operations of the customer&#8217;s business. Inherent lending risks are centrally monitored on a continuous basis from underwriting throughout the life of the loan for compliance with commercial lending policies. 

Commercial loans totaled $14.8 billion or 62% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2023, increasing $591 million or 4% compared to December 31, 2022, led by growth in healthcare loan balances, with services, general business and energy loans also increasing. 

Approximately 70% of commercial loans are located within our geographic footprint, based on collateral location. Loans for which the collateral location is less relevant, such as unsecured loans and reserve-based energy loans, are categorized by the borrower's primary operating location. The largest concentration of loans in this segment outside of our footprint is California, totaling 5% of the segment. 

Supporting the energy industry with loans to producers and other energy-related entities has been a hallmark of the Company since its founding and represents a large portion of our commercial loan portfolio. In addition, energy production and related industries have a significant impact on the economy in our primary markets. Loans collateralized by oil and gas properties are subject to semi-annual engineering reviews by our internal staff of petroleum engineers. These reviews are used as the basis for developing the expected cash flows supporting the loan amount. The projected cash flows are discounted according to risk characteristics of the underlying oil and gas properties. Loans are evaluated to demonstrate with reasonable certainty that crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids can be recovered from known oil and gas reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions at current pricing levels and with existing conventional equipment and operating methods and costs. As part of our evaluation of credit quality, we analyze rigorous stress tests over a range of commodity prices and take proactive steps to mitigate risk when appropriate. 

Outstanding energy loans totaled $3.4 billion or 14% of total loans at December 31, 2023. Approximately $2.7 billion or 78% of energy loans were to oil and gas producers, largely unchanged compared to December 31, 2022. The majority of this portfolio is first lien, senior secured, reserve-based lending, which we believe is the lowest risk form of energy lending. Approximately 69% of the committed production loans are secured by properties primarily producing oil and 31% of the committed production loans are secured by properties primarily producing natural gas. 

Loans to midstream oil and gas companies totaled $551 million or 16% of energy loans, a decrease of $24 million compared to the prior year. Loans to borrowers that provide services to the energy industry totaled $182 million or 5% of energy loans, a $25 million increase during 2023. Loans to other energy borrowers, including those engaged in wholesale or retail energy sales, totaled $47 million or 1% of energy loans, a $20 million increase over the prior year. 

Unfunded energy loan commitments were $4.5 billion at December 31, 2023, up $687 million over December 31, 2022. Utilization levels remain low, providing ample capacity for growth from our current customer base. 

The healthcare sector of the loan portfolio totaled $4.1 billion or 17% of total loans. Healthcare loans increased $298 million over December 31, 2022, primarily due to growth in loans to senior housing and other medical practices. Healthcare sector loans consist primarily of loans for the development and operation of senior housing and care facilities including independent living, assisted living and skilled nursing. Generally, we loan to borrowers with a portfolio of multiple facilities that serves to help diversify risks specific to a single facility. 

The services sector of the loan portfolio increased $145 million to $3.6 billion or 15% of total loans. Service sector loans consist of a large number of loans to a variety of businesses including Native American tribal and state and local municipal government entities, Native American tribal casino operations, educational services, foundations and not-for-profit organizations and specialty trade contractors. Approximately $1.6 billion of the services category is made up of loans with individual balances of less than $10 million. Service sector loans are generally secured by the assets of the borrower with repayment coming from the cash flows of ongoing operations of the customer&#8217;s business. 

General business loans increased $136 million to $3.6 billion or 15% of total loans. General business loans primarily consist of $2.2 billion of wholesale/retail loans and $1.4 billion of loans from other commercial industries. 

We participate in shared national credits when appropriate to obtain or maintain business relationships with local customers. Shared national credits are defined by banking regulators as credits of more than $100 million and with three or more non-affiliated banks as participants. At December 31, 2023, the outstanding principal balance of these loans totaled $5.7 billion, including $2.5 billion in the energy sector. Based on dollars committed, approximately 79% of shared national credits are to borrowers with local market relationships and we serve as the agent lender in approximately 22% of our shared national credits. We hold shared national credits to the same standard of analysis and perform the same level of review as internally originated credits. Our lending policies generally avoid loans in which we do not have the opportunity to maintain or achieve other business relationships with the customer. In addition to management&#8217;s quarterly assessment of credit risk, banking regulators annually review a sample of shared national credits for proper risk grading. 

Commercial Real Estate 

Commercial real estate represents loans for the construction of buildings or other improvements to real estate and property held by borrowers for investment purposes generally within our geographical footprint. We require collateral values in excess of the loan amounts, demonstrated cash flows in excess of expected debt service requirements, equity investment in the project and a portion of the project already sold, leased or permanent financing already secured. The expected cash flows from all significant new or renewed income producing property commitments are stress tested to reflect the risks in varying interest rates, vacancy rates and rental rates. As with commercial loans, inherent lending risks are centrally monitored on a continuous basis from underwriting throughout the life of the loan for compliance with applicable lending policies. 

The outstanding balance of commercial real estate loans totaled $5.3 billion or 22% of the loan portfolio, an increase of $731 million over December 31, 2022. Loans secured by multifamily real estate totaled $1.9 billion or 8% of total loans, a $660 million increase over the prior year. Loans secured by industrial facilities were $1.5 billion or 6% of total loans, a $254 million increase over the prior year. Loans secured by office facilities decreased $144 million to $909 million or 4% of total loans. Loans secured by retail facilities decreased $28 million to $593 million or 2% of total loans. 

Approximately 66% of commercial real estate loans are in our geographic footprint based on collateral location. The largest concentration of loans in this segment outside our footprint is Utah, totaling 9% of the segment. All other states represent less than 5% individually. 

Unfunded commercial real estate loan commitments were $1.8 billion at December 31, 2023, a $1.3 billion decrease compared to the prior year. We take a disciplined approach to managing our concentration of total commercial real estate loan commitments as a percentage of Tier 1 Capital. We have ample opportunity for continued modest growth in our outstanding commercial real estate balances as loans fund up. 

Loans to Individuals 

Loans to individuals include residential mortgage and personal loans. Residential mortgage loans provide funds for our customers to purchase or refinance their primary residence or to borrow against the equity in their home. These loans are secured by a first or second mortgage on the customer's primary residence. Personal loans consist primarily of loans to Wealth Management clients secured by the cash surrender value of insurance policies and marketable securities. It also includes direct loans secured by and for the purchase of automobiles, recreational and marine equipment as well as unsecured loans. These loans are made in accordance with underwriting policies we believe to be conservative and are fully documented. Loans may be individually underwritten or credit scored based on size and other criteria. Credit scoring is assessed based on significant credit characteristics including credit history, residential and employment stability. 

In general, we sell the majority of our conforming fixed rate mortgage loan originations in the secondary market and retain the majority of our non-conforming and adjustable rate mortgage loans. Our mortgage loan portfolio does not include payment option adjustable rate mortgage loans or adjustable rate mortgage loans with initial rates that are below market. Home equity loans are primarily first-lien and fully amortizing. 

Residential mortgage loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies have limited credit exposure because of the underlying agency guarantee. This amount includes residential mortgage loans previously sold into GNMA mortgage pools that the Company may repurchase when certain defined delinquency criteria are met. Because of this repurchase right, the Company is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans and must include them on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

Loans to individuals totaled $3.8 billion or 16% of the loan portfolio, growing $26 million over December 31, 2022. Approximately 91% of loans to individuals are secured by collateral located within our geographical footprint. Loans for which the collateral location is less relevant, such as unsecured loans, are categorized by the borrower&#8217;s primary operating location. 

The Company secondarily evaluates loan portfolio performance based on the primary geographical market managing the loan. Loans attributed to a geographical market may not represent the location of the borrower or the collateral. All permanent mortgage loans serviced by our mortgage banking unit and held for investment by the Company are centrally managed by the Oklahoma market.

Off-Balance Sheet Commitments 

We enter into certain off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business as shown in Table 24. Loan commitments may be unconditional obligations to provide financing or conditional obligations that depend on the borrower&#8217;s financial condition, collateral value or other factors. Standby letters of credit are unconditional commitments to guarantee the performance of our customer to a third party. Since some of these commitments are expected to expire before being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. 

We have off-balance sheet commitments related to certain residential mortgage loans sold into mortgage-backed securities as part of our mortgage banking activities. We retain off-balance sheet credit risk related to losses in excess of amounts guaranteed by the VA. 

We also have off-balance sheet credit risk related to certain residential mortgage loans primarily originated under community development loan programs that were sold to a U.S. government agency with full recourse prior to 2007. We are obligated to repurchase these loans for the life of these loans in the event of foreclosure for the unpaid principal and interest at the time of foreclosure. The majority of our conforming fixed rate loan originations are sold in the secondary market, and we only retain repurchase obligations under standard underwriting representations and warranties.

Customer Derivative Programs 

&#160; 

We offer programs that permit our customers to hedge various risks including fluctuations in energy, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and other commodities. Each of these programs work essentially the same way. Derivative contracts are executed between the customers and the Company. Offsetting contracts are executed between the Company and selected counterparties or exchanges to minimize market risk to us from changes in commodity prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates. The counterparty contracts are identical to the customer contracts except for a fixed pricing spread or a fee paid to us as compensation for administrative costs, credit risk and profit. 

The customer derivative programs create credit risk for potential amounts due to the Company from our customers and from the counterparties. Customer credit risk is monitored through existing credit policies and procedures. The effects of changes in commodity prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates are evaluated across a range of possible options to determine the maximum exposure we are willing to have individually to any customer. Customers may also be required to provide cash margin or other collateral in conjunction with our credit agreements to further limit our credit risk. 

Counterparty credit risk is evaluated through existing policies and procedures. This evaluation considers the total relationship between BOK Financial and each of the counterparties. Individual limits are established by management, approved by Credit Administration and reviewed by the Asset/Liability Committee. Margin collateral is required if the exposure between the Company and any counterparty exceeds established limits. Based on declines in the counterparties&#8217; credit ratings, these limits may be reduced and additional margin collateral may be required. 

A deterioration of the credit standing of one or more of the customers or counterparties to these contracts may result in BOK Financial recognizing a loss as the fair value of the affected contracts may no longer move in tandem with the offsetting contracts. This occurs if the credit standing of the customer or counterparty deteriorates such that either the fair value of underlying collateral no longer supports the contract or the customer or counterparty&#8217;s ability to provide margin collateral becomes impaired. Credit losses on customer derivatives reduce brokerage and trading revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 

Derivative contracts are carried at fair value. At December 31, 2023, the net fair values of derivative contracts, before consideration of cash margin, reported as assets under these programs totaled $593 million compared to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2022. Derivative contracts carried as assets include energy contracts with fair values of $437 million, interest rate swaps primarily sold to loan customers with fair values of $102 million and foreign exchange contracts with fair values of $54 million. Before consideration of cash margin paid to counterparties, the aggregate net fair values of derivative contracts held under these programs reported as liabilities totaled $587 million. 

At December 31, 2023, total derivative assets were reduced by $265 million of cash collateral received from counterparties, and total derivative liabilities were reduced by $6.4 million of cash collateral paid to counterparties related to instruments executed with the same counterparty under a master netting agreement. Derivative contracts executed with customers may be secured by non-cash collateral in conjunction with a credit agreement with that customer such as proven producing oil and gas properties. Access to this collateral in the event of default is reasonably assured. 

A table showing the notional and fair value of derivative assets and liabilities on both a gross and net basis is presented in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The fair value of derivative contracts reported as assets under these programs, net of cash margin held by the Company, by category of debtor at December 31, 2023 follows in Table 25.

&#160; 

The largest exposure to a single counterparty was to an exchange for $186 million of net derivative positions, net of cash collateral, at December 31, 2023. 

Our customer derivative program also introduces liquidity and capital risk. We are required to provide cash margin to certain counterparties when the net negative fair value of the contracts exceeds established limits. Also, changes in commodity prices affect the amount of regulatory capital we are required to hold as support for the fair value of our derivative assets. These risks are modeled as part of the management of these programs. Based on current prices, a decrease in market prices down to an equivalent of $54.72 per barrel of oil would decrease the fair value of derivative assets by $11 million with lending customers comprising the bulk of the assets. An increase in prices up to the equivalent of $88.58 per barrel of oil would increase the fair value of derivative assets by $397 million. Liquidity requirements of this program are also affected by our credit rating. A decrease in our credit rating to below investment grade would increase our obligation to post cash margin on existing contracts by approximately $10 million. The fair value of our to-be-announced residential mortgage-backed securities and interest rate swap derivative contracts is affected by changes in interest rates. Based on our assessment as of December 31, 2023, changes in interest rates would not materially impact regulatory capital or liquidity needed to support this portion of our customer derivative program.

Allowance for Loan Losses and Accrual for Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk from Unfunded Loan Commitments 

Expected credit losses on assets carried at amortized cost are recognized over their expected lives based on models that measure the probability of default and loss given default over a 12-month reasonable and supportable forecast period. Models incorporate base case, downside, and upside macroeconomic variables such as real GDP growth, civilian unemployment rate and WTI oil prices on a probability weighted basis. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of methodology of allowance for loan losses. 

A $46.0 million provision for credit losses was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to loan growth and changes in our economic forecast during the year, including a more challenging commercial real estate environment. 

Non-pass grade loans, which include loans especially mentioned, accruing substandard and nonaccruing loans, increased $132 million to $453 million at December 31, 2023. Non-pass grade loans were composed primarily of $174 million or 4% of commercial healthcare loans, $124 million or 3% of commercial general business loans, $49 million or 1% of energy loans, $38 million or 1% of commercial services loans, $36 million or 1% of loans to individuals and $33 million or 1% of commercial real estate loans. A summary of outstanding loan balances by risk grade is included in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The provision for credit losses of $6.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 reflects a stable economic environment, continued loan growth and the impact of net charge-offs for the quarter. 

At December 31, 2023, the allowance for loan losses totaled $277 million or 1.16% of outstanding loans. Excluding residential mortgage loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, the allowance for loan losses was 204% of nonaccruing loans. The combined allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments was $326 million or 1.36% of outstanding loans and 240% of nonaccruing loans at December 31, 2023. 

A $30.0 million provision for credit losses was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to strong growth in loans and loan commitments, partially offset by improvement in credit quality metrics. The uncertainty in our economic forecast increased resulting in an increase in the probability weighting of the downside scenario. In addition, some key economic factors were less favorable to growth across all scenarios. 

At December 31, 2022, the allowance for loan losses was $236 million or 1.04% of outstanding loans. Excluding loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, the allowance for loan losses was 221% of nonaccruing loans. The combined allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments was $297 million or 1.31% of outstanding loans and 278% of nonaccruing loans. 

A summary of macroeconomic variables considered in developing our estimate of expected credit losses at December 31, 2023 follows: 

##TABLE_START Base Downside Upside Scenario probability weighting 50% 35% 15% Economic outlook 

Geopolitical conflicts remain isolated. 

The federal funds rate target range of 5.25% to 5.50% is held flat for the forecast horizon. Core inflation continues to improve from the previous peaks and reaches 2.6% by the fourth quarter of 2024. 

Job openings revert to more normalized levels, and overall hiring levels decline causing the national unemployment rate to modestly increase over the next four quarters. Inflation pressures ease and help stabilize household income. A restrictive credit environment slows economic activity and results in below-trend GDP growth. 

Geopolitical conflicts remain isolated. 

The Federal Reserve is forced to adopt an accomodative monetary policy and cut the federal funds rate significantly to encourage economic activity and job creation to help limit the depth of a recession. In total, there are ten rate cuts in 2024 bringing the target range to 2.75% to 3.00% by the fourth quarter of 2024. 

Tight monetary conditions result in declines in consumer spending while a restrictive credit environment decreases private sector investment. This pushes the United States into a recession with a contraction in economic activity and a sharp increase in the unemployment rate. 

Geopolitical conflicts remain isolated. There is one federal funds rate cut in each quarter of 2024, bringing the target range to 4.25% to 4.50% by the fourth quarter of 2024. Core inflation continues to improve from the previous peaks and reaches 2.3% by the fourth quarter of 2024. Labor force participants continue to re-enter the job market to help fill the elevated level of job openings. This increase in employment helps real household income continue to grow above its pre-pandemic trend. This supports consumer spending and maintains GDP growth consistent with pre-pandemic levels. Macro-economic factors &#8211; GDP is forecasted to grow by 1.6% over the next 12 months. 

&#8211; Civilian unemployment rate of 3.9% in the first quarter of 2024 increasing to 4.2% by the fourth quarter of 2024. 

&#8211; WTI oil prices are projected to generally follow the NYMEX forward curve that existed at the end of December 2023 and are expected to average $71.34 per barrel over the next 12 months. 

&#8211; GDP is forecasted to contract 1.8% over the next 12 months. 

&#8211; Civilian unemployment rate of 4.7% in the first quarter of 2024 worsens to 6.1% by the fourth quarter of 2024. 

&#8211; WTI oil prices are projected to average $54.46 per barrel over the next twelve months, with a peak of $62.44 in the first quarter of 2024 and falling 22% over the following three quarters. 

&#8211; GDP is forecasted to grow by 1.9% over the next 12 months. 

&#8211; Civilian unemployment rate of 3.8% in the first quarter of 2024 increases slightly to 4.0% by the fourth quarter of 2024. 

&#8211; WTI oil prices are projected to average $74.75 per barrel over the next 12 months. 

##TABLE_END

Net Loans Charged Off 

In 2023, net loans charged off totaled $18 million or 0.08%, down from $21 million or 0.10% of average loans in 2022. 

In 2023, net charge-offs of commercial loans were $9.7 million, primarily related to a single services borrower and a single general business borrower in the wholesale/retail sector. Net commercial real estate loan charge-offs were $5.1 million primarily related to a single office loan. Net loan charge-offs of loans to individuals were $3.4 million. Net charge-offs of loans to individuals include deposit account overdraft losses. 

Nonperforming Assets 

As more fully described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, loans are generally classified as nonaccruing when it becomes probable that we will not collect the full contractual principal and interest. Accruing renegotiated loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies represent residential mortgage loans that have been modified in troubled debt restructurings. Interest continues to accrue based on the modified terms of the loan and loans may be sold once they become eligible according to U.S. government agency guidelines. Real estate and other repossessed assets are assets acquired in partial or total forgiveness of loans. The assets are carried at the lower of cost, as determined by fair value at the date of foreclosure, or current fair value, less estimated selling costs. A summary of nonperforming assets follows in Table 27:

2 Excludes residential mortgages guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. 

Excluding loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, nonperforming assets increased $18 million compared to December 31, 2022, primarily due to a $40 million increase in nonaccruing healthcare loans and a $16 million increase in nonaccruing energy loans. These increases were partially offset by a $13 million decrease in nonaccruing service sector loans, a $12 million decrease in nonaccruing residential real estate mortgage loans and a $9.3 million decrease in nonaccruing commercial real estate loans. Newly identified nonaccruing loans totaled $119 million, offset by $51 million in payments, $27 million of charge-offs, $12 million of loans returning to accrual status and $4.6 million in foreclosures of loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. The Company generally retains nonperforming assets to maximize potential recovery, which may cause future nonperforming assets to decrease more slowly.

We foreclose on loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies in accordance with agency guidelines. Generally these loans are not eligible for modification programs or have failed to comply with modified loan terms. Principal is guaranteed by agencies of the U.S. government, subject to limitations, and credit risk is limited. These properties will be conveyed to the agencies and receivables collected once applicable criteria have been met. 

Real Estate and Other Repossessed Assets 

Real estate and other repossessed assets totaled $2.9 million at December 31, 2023, composed primarily of $2.1 million of developed commercial real estate. Real estate and other repossessed assets decreased $11 million compared to December 31, 2022, primarily related to the sale of developed commercial real estate and oil and gas properties. 

Liquidity and Capital 

BOK Financial has numerous material cash requirements in the normal course of business. These obligations include deposits and other borrowed funds, leased premises, commitments to extend credit to borrowers and to purchase securities, derivative contracts and contracts for services such as data processing that are integral to our operations. Additional information on loan commitments can be found in the "Loan Commitments" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis while the distribution of time deposit balances can be located in Note 8, "Deposits," and information related to Other Borrowings can be located in Note 9, "Other Borrowings." 

Our funding sources, which primarily include deposits and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Banks, provide adequate liquidity to meet our operating needs. Based on the average balances for 2023, approximately 69% of our funding was provided by deposit accounts, 18% from borrowed funds, less than 1% from long-term subordinated debt and 10% from equity. The loan to deposit ratio increased to 70% at December 31, 2023 from 65% at December 31, 2022, and continues to provide significant on-balance sheet liquidity to meet future loan demand and contractual obligations. BOK Financial, similar to the banking industry as a whole, saw deposits continue to decline in 2023 as customers redeployed capital and moved to other off-balance sheet alternatives seeking higher yields in the rising interest rate environment. 

Subsidiary Bank 

Deposits and borrowed funds are the primary sources of liquidity for BOKF, NA the wholly owned subsidiary bank of BOK Financial. We compete for retail and commercial deposits by offering a broad range of products and services and focusing on customer convenience. Retail deposit growth is supported through personal and small business checking, online bill paying services, mobile banking services, an extensive network of branch locations and ATMs and our ExpressBank call center. Commercial deposit growth is supported by offering treasury management and lockbox services. We also acquire brokered deposits when the cost of funds is advantageous to other funding sources.

Estimated uninsured deposits totaled $18.7 billion or 55% of total deposits at December 31, 2023 and $21.3 billion or 62% of total deposits at December 31, 2022. In addition to insured deposits, we also hold $4.6 billion of collateralized deposits. Municipalities, Native American tribal governments and certain trust-related deposits are all required to be collateralized. Excluding the impact of collateralized deposits and deposits related to consolidated subsidiaries, our uninsured and uncollateralized deposit level is $12.9 billion or 38% of total deposits at December 31, 2023. The portion of time deposits in excess of the FDIC limit, as applied without regard to other deposit balances held by the depositor, were $465 million at December 31, 2023 and $373 million at December 31, 2022. 

In addition to deposits, liquidity for the subsidiary bank is provided primarily by federal funds purchased, securities repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings. Federal funds purchased consist primarily of unsecured, overnight funds acquired from other financial institutions. Funds are primarily purchased from bankers&#8217; banks and Federal Home Loan Banks from across the country. The largest source of wholesale federal funds purchased totaled $250 million at December 31, 2023. There were no wholesale federal funds purchased outstanding at December 31, 2022. Securities repurchase agreements generally mature within 90 days and are secured by certain trading or available for sale securities. Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings are generally short term and are secured by a blanket pledge of eligible collateral (generally unencumbered U.S. Treasury and mortgage-backed securities, 1-4 family residential mortgage loans, multifamily and other qualifying commercial real estate loans). Amounts borrowed from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Topeka averaged $5.9 billion during 2023 and $1.6 billion during 2022. Increased borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank were primarily related to higher average total assets and slightly lower average deposit balances. 

At December 31, 2023, management estimates a total potential secured borrowing capacity of approximately $23.1 billion. This includes current available secured capacity of $18.3 billion from the use of programs available to U.S. banks from the Federal Home Loan Banks and Federal Reserve Banks and an estimated $4.8 billion of other sources that could be converted into additional secured capacity. 

BOKF, NA also has a liability related to the repurchase of certain delinquent residential mortgage loans previously sold in GNMA mortgage pools. Interest is payable monthly at rates contractually due to investors. 

See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of other borrowings. 

Parent Company and Other Non-Bank Subsidiaries 

The primary sources of liquidity for BOK Financial are cash on hand and dividends from the subsidiary bank. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $204 million at December 31, 2023. Dividends from the subsidiary bank are limited by various banking regulations to net profits, as defined, for the year plus retained profits for the two preceding years. Dividends are further restricted by minimum capital requirements. At December 31, 2023, based on the most restrictive limitations as well as management&#8217;s internal capital policy, BOKF, NA could declare up to $405 million of dividends without regulatory approval. Dividend constraints may be alleviated through increases in retained earnings, capital issuances or changes in risk weighted assets. Future losses or increases in required regulatory capital could also affect its ability to pay dividends to the parent company. 

As a result of the acquisition of CoBiz Financial, we obtained $60 million of subordinated debt issued in June 2015 that will mature on June 25, 2030. This debt bears interest at the rate of 5.625% through June 25, 2025 and thereafter, the notes will bear an annual floating rate equal to 3-month SOFR plus 317 basis points and a 26 basis point tenor adjustment. We also acquired $72 million of junior subordinated debentures. Interest is based on spreads over 3-month SOFR ranging from 145 basis points to 295 basis points with a tenor adjustment of 26 basis points and mature September 17, 2033 through September 30, 2035. The junior subordinated debentures are subject to early redemption prior to maturity. 

Shareholders' equity at December 31, 2023 was $5.1 billion, an increase of $460 million compared to December 31, 2022. Net income less cash dividends paid increased equity $387 million during 2023. Changes in interest rates resulted in an accumulated other comprehensive loss of $599 million at December 31, 2023, compared to an accumulated comprehensive loss of $837 million at December 31, 2022. We also repurchased $177 million of common shares during 2023. Capital is managed to maximize long-term value to the shareholders. Factors considered in managing capital include projections of future earnings, asset growth and acquisition strategies, and regulatory and debt covenant requirements. Capital management may include subordinated debt issuance, share repurchase and stock and cash dividends. 

On November 1, 2022, the Company's board of directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to five million shares of the Company's common stock, subject to market conditions, securities laws and other regulatory compliance limitations. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had repurchased 2,428,214 shares under this authorization. The Company repurchased 2,113,808 shares during 2023 at an average price of $82.85 per share, net of the 1% excise tax on share purchases. We view share buybacks opportunistically, but within the context of maintaining our strong capital position. 

BOK Financial and the subsidiary bank are subject to various capital requirements administered by federal agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements, including a capital conservation buffer, can result in certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by regulators that could have a material impact on operations including restrictions on capital distributions from dividends and share repurchases and executive bonus payments. These capital requirements include quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items. The capital standards are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators. 

A summary of minimum capital requirements and other performance ratios follows for BOK Financial on a consolidated basis in Table 31.

In March 2020, in response to the impact on the financial markets by the COVID-19 pandemic, the banking agencies issued an interim final rule permitting banking organizations that implement CECL the option to delay for two years an estimate of the CECL methodology's effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. The estimate includes the implementation date adjustment as of January 1, 2020 plus an estimate of the impact of the change for a two year period following implementation of CECL. We elected to delay the regulatory capital impact of the transition in accordance with the interim final rule. Deferral of the impact of CECL added 6 basis points to the Company's Common equity Tier 1 capital at December 31, 2023.

Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures 

The tangible common equity ratio and return on average tangible common equity are primarily based on total shareholders' equity, which includes unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities, less intangible assets and equity that do not benefit common shareholders. The adjusted tangible common equity ratio also includes unrealized gains and losses on the investment portfolio. These measures are valuable indicators of a financial institution's capital strength since they eliminate intangible assets from shareholders' equity and retain the effect of unrealized losses on securities and other components of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity. 

Pre-provision net revenue is a measure of revenue less expenses and is calculated before provision for credit losses and income tax expense. This financial measure is frequently used by investors and analysts and enables them to assess a company's ability to generate earnings to cover credit losses through a credit cycle. It also provides an additional basis for comparing the results of operations between periods by isolating the impact of the provision for credit losses, which can vary significantly between periods. 

The efficiency ratio measures the Company's ability to use its assets and manage its liabilities effectively in the current period. 

Net interest revenue and net interest margin excluding trading activities remove the effect of trading activities on these metrics allowing management and investors to assess the performance of the Company's core lending and deposit activities without the associated volatility from trading activities.

Forward-Looking Statements 

This 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are based on management's beliefs, assumptions, current expectations, estimates and projections about BOK Financial, the financial services industry, the economy generally and the related responses of the government, consumers, and others, on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Words such as "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "expects," "forecasts," "plans," "projects," "will," "intends," variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Management judgments relating to and discussion of the provision and allowance for credit losses, allowance for uncertain tax positions, accruals for loss contingencies and valuation of mortgage servicing rights involve judgments as to expected events and are inherently forward-looking statements. Assessments that acquisitions and growth endeavors will be profitable are necessary statements of belief as to the outcome of future events based in part on information provided by others which BOK Financial has not independently verified. These various forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions which are difficult to predict with regard to timing, extent, likelihood and degree of occurrence. Therefore, actual results and outcomes may materially differ from what is expected, implied or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. Internal and external factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to changes in commodity prices, interest rates and interest rate relationships, inflation, demand for products and services, the degree of competition by traditional and nontraditional competitors, changes in banking regulations, tax laws, prices, levies and assessments, the impact of technological advances, and trends in customer behavior as well as their ability to repay loans. BOK Financial and its affiliates undertake no obligation to update, amend or clarify forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 

Annualized, pro forma, projected and estimated numbers are used for illustrative purpose only, are not forecasts and may not reflect actual results.
