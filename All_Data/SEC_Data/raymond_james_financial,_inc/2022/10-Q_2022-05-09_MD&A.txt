FACTORS AFFECTING &#8220;FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS&#8221; 

Certain statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may constitute &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include information concerning future strategic objectives, business prospects, anticipated savings, financial results (including expenses, earnings, liquidity, cash flow and capital expenditures), industry or market conditions, demand for and pricing of our products, acquisitions (including our announced acquisitions of TriState Capital and SumRidge Partners), divestitures, anticipated results of litigation, regulatory developments, and general economic conditions. In addition, words such as &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;projects,&#8221; and future or conditional verbs such as &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; and &#8220;would,&#8221; as well as any other statement that necessarily depends on future events, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and they involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Although we make such statements based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. We caution investors not to rely unduly on any forward-looking statements and urge you to carefully consider the risks described in our filings with the SEC from time to time, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, which are available at www.raymondjames.com and the SEC&#8217;s website at www.sec.gov.

INTRODUCTION 

The following Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;) is intended to help the reader understand the results of our operations and financial condition. This MD&#38;A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to condensed consolidated financial statements. Where &#8220;NM&#8221; is used in various percentage change computations, the computed percentage change has been determined to be not meaningful. 

We operate as a financial holding company and bank holding company. Results in the businesses in which we operate are highly correlated to general economic conditions and, more specifically, to the direction of the U.S. equity and fixed income markets, changes in interest rates, market volatility, corporate and mortgage lending markets and commercial and residential credit trends. Overall market conditions, economic, political and regulatory trends, and industry competition are among the factors which could affect us and which are unpredictable and beyond our control. These factors affect the financial decisions made by market participants, including investors, borrowers, and competitors, impacting their level of participation in the financial markets. These factors also impact the level of investment banking activity and asset valuations, which ultimately affect our business results. 

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 

Quarter ended March 31, 2022 compared with the quarter ended March 31, 2021 

For our fiscal second quarter of 2022, we generated net revenues of $2.67 billion, an increase of 13% compared with the prior-year quarter, while pre-tax income of $433 million decreased 3%. The decrease in pre-tax income was primarily due to a provision for loan losses in the current-year quarter compared with a benefit in the prior-year quarter. Our net income of $323 million decreased 9%, and our earnings per diluted share were $1.52, reflecting a 10% decrease. Our annualized return on equity (&#8220;ROE&#8221;) for the quarter was 15.0%, compared with 19.0% for the prior-year quarter, and our annualized return on tangible common equity (&#8220;ROTCE&#8221;) was 16.8% (1) , compared with 21.2% (1) for the prior-year quarter. 

Excluding acquisition-related expenses of $11 million, our adjusted net income was $331 million (1) and our adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.55 (1) . Adjusted annualized ROE for the quarter was 15.4% (1) and adjusted annualized ROTCE was 17.2% (1) . 

(1) ROTCE, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted annualized ROE, and adjusted annualized ROTCE are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the &#8220;Reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures&#8221; in this MD&#38;A for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and for other important disclosures. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

The increase in net revenues compared with the prior-year quarter was driven by significantly higher asset management and related administrative fees, largely attributable to strong growth in PCG assets in fee-based accounts compared with the prior-year quarter and, to a lesser extent, incremental revenues resulting from our acquisition of Charles Stanley which was completed on January 21, 2022. Net interest income also increased, primarily due to strong asset growth and a higher net interest margin at Raymond James Bank. 

Compensation, commissions and benefits expense increased 12%, primarily resulting from higher revenues compared with the prior-year quarter and, to a lesser extent, incremental compensation expense due to the Charles Stanley acquisition and an increase in compensation costs to support our growth. Our compensation ratio, or the ratio of compensation, commissions and benefits expense to net revenues, was 69.3%, compared with 69.5% for the prior-year quarter. 

Non-compensation expenses increased 40%, primarily due to a $53 million increase in the bank loan provision for credit losses, resulting from a provision of $21 million for the current-year quarter compared with a benefit of $32 million for the prior-year quarter. Communications and information processing expenses increased as a result of incremental expense of Charles Stanley, as well as continued investments in technology to support our growth. Business development expenses also increased from the very low prior-year quarter level, primarily due to an increase in travel and event-related expenses. 

Our effective income tax rate was 25.4% for our fiscal second quarter of 2022, an increase compared with a 20.6% effective income tax rate for the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of nondeductible valuation losses associated with our corporate-owned life insurance portfolio during the current quarter compared with nontaxable valuation gains in the prior-year quarter. 

As of March 31, 2022, our total capital ratio of 25.0% and tier 1 leverage ratio of 11.1% were both more than double the regulatory requirement to be considered well-capitalized. We also continue to have substantial liquidity with $2.2 billion (1) of cash at the parent as of March 31, 2022, which includes cash loaned to RJ&#38;A. We expect to continue to be opportunistic in deploying our capital in fiscal 2022, through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions, as evidenced by our acquisition of Charles Stanley completed on January 21, 2022, as well as our announced acquisitions of TriState Capital and SumRidge Partners, which we currently expect to close in our fiscal third and fourth quarters of 2022, respectively. Although our Board of Directors authorized share repurchases of up to $1 billion in December 2021, we do not expect to repurchase our common shares until after the TriState Capital acquisition is completed. As a result, as of the date this report was filed, $1 billion remained available under the share repurchase authorization. 

We remain well-positioned entering our fiscal third quarter, with client assets under administration of $1.26 trillion as of March 31, 2022, as well as strong financial advisor recruiting activity and solid retention of existing advisors. In addition, we expect our fiscal third quarter results to be positively impacted by a full quarter&#8217;s impact of the 25-basis point increase in the Fed&#8217;s short-term benchmark interest rate enacted in March 2022, as well as a partial quarter&#8217;s impact of the 50-basis point increase enacted in May 2022. With clients&#8217; domestic cash sweep balances of $76.5 billion as of March 31, 2022 and our high concentration of floating rate assets, we also believe we are well-positioned for further increases in short-term interest rates, which we expect to positively impact our net interest income and our RJBDP fees from third-party banks. However, we also expect to continue to face geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties which may continue to have a negative impact on equity and fixed income markets. As a result, we may experience volatility in asset management fees and brokerage revenues, as well as investment banking revenues, despite our robust investment banking pipelines. Our fiscal third quarter asset management and related administrative fee revenues will be negatively impacted by the decrease in fee-based asset balances (excluding the impact of Charles Stanley) and financial assets under management as of March 31, 2022. Net loan growth should result in additional provisions for credit losses in future periods and/or future market deterioration could result in increased bank loan provisions in future periods. In addition, although we have been focused on the management of expenses, we expect that expenses will continue to increase in fiscal 2022, as business and event-related travel should continue to increase and as we continue to make investments in our people and technology to support our growth.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Six months ended March 31, 2022 compared with the six months ended March 31, 2021 

For the six months ended March 31, 2022, we generated net revenues of $5.45 billion, an increase of 19% compared with the prior-year period, and pre-tax income of $991 million, an increase of 17%. Our net income of $769 million was 15% higher than the prior-year period and our earnings per diluted share were $3.61, reflecting a 14% increase. Our annualized ROE was 18.1%, unchanged from the prior-year period, and our annualized ROTCE was 20.2% (1) , compared with 20.1% (1) for the prior-year period. 

Excluding acquisition-related expenses of $17 million, our adjusted net income was $782 million (1) and our adjusted earnings per diluted share were $3.67 (1) . Adjusted annualized ROE for the year-to-date period was 18.4% (1) and adjusted annualized ROTCE was 20.6% (1) . 

The significant increase in net revenues compared with the prior-year period was primarily driven by higher asset management and related administrative fees, primarily attributable to higher PCG client assets in fee-based accounts and incremental revenues from our Charles Stanley acquisition which was completed in January 2022, as well as strong investment banking revenues, particularly in our fiscal first quarter. 

Compensation, commissions and benefits expense increased 19%, primarily attributable to the growth in revenues and pre-tax income compared with the prior-year period. Our compensation ratio was 68.5%, unchanged from the prior-year period. 

Non-compensation expenses increased 21%, primarily due to increases in communications and information processing and business development expenses, as well as higher investment sub-advisory fees. The bank loan provision for credit losses increased $28 million to a provision of $10 million for the current-year period, compared with a benefit of $18 million for the prior-year period. 

Our effective income tax rate was 22.4% for the six months ended March 31, 2022, an increase from 21.2% for the prior-year period. The increase in the effective tax rate from the prior-year period was primarily due to the negative impact of nondeductible valuation losses associated with our corporate-owned life insurance portfolio during the current-year period compared with nontaxable valuation gains for the prior-year period, partially offset by a larger tax benefit recognized during the current-year period related to share-based compensation that vested during the period. 

In December 2021, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend 31% to $0.34 per share and authorized share repurchases of up to $1 billion, which replaced the previous authorization. 

(1) ROTCE, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted annualized ROE, and adjusted annualized ROTCE are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the &#8220;Reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures&#8221; in this MD&#38;A for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and for other important disclosures.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 

We utilize certain non-GAAP financial measures as additional measures to aid in, and enhance, the understanding of our financial results and related measures. These non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted ROE, ROTCE, and adjusted ROTCE. We believe certain of these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to management and investors by excluding certain material items that may not be indicative of our core operating results. We utilize these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the financial performance of the business, as they facilitate a meaningful comparison of current- and prior-period results. We believe that ROTCE is meaningful to investors as this measure facilitates comparison of our results to the results of other companies. In the following tables, the tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments reflects the statutory rate associated with each non-GAAP item. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies. The following tables provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the periods indicated.

NET INTEREST ANALYSIS 

In March 2020, in response to macroeconomic concerns resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Fed decreased its benchmark short-term interest rate to a range of 0-0.25%. These near-zero short-term interest rates negatively impacted our net interest income over the past two years, as well as the fee income we earn from third-party banks on client cash balances swept to such banks as part of the RJBDP (included in account and service fees) which are also sensitive to changes in interest rates. In response to inflationary pressures and given the improved economic and employment conditions since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Fed increased its benchmark short-term interest rate by 25 basis points in March 2022 and an additional 50 basis points in May 2022 and has indicated that it intends to further increase short-term interest rates through the remainder of our fiscal 2022. 

Given the relationship between our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities (primarily held in our PCG, Raymond James Bank and Other segments) and the nature of fees we earn from third-party banks on the RJBDP, increases in short-term interest rates generally result in an increase in our net earnings, although the magnitude of the impact to our net interest margin depends on the yields on interest-earning assets relative to the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, including deposit rates paid to clients on their cash balances. As a result, we believe we are well-positioned for our net interest earnings to be favorably impacted by any additional increase in short-term rates that may arise. 

Based on our high concentration of floating-rate assets that are funded from clients&#8217; domestic cash sweep balances, we estimate (based on static balances as of March 31, 2022) that an instantaneous 100-basis point increase in short-term interest rates would result in incremental pre-tax income of nearly $600 million annually, with approximately 65% reflected as net interest income and approximately 35% as account and service fees. The realization of such amounts is dependent upon a number of key assumptions and actual results may differ materially from our estimates. Notably, of this 100-basis point instantaneous increase assumption, 75 basis points has already occurred with the recent interest rate actions by the Fed in March and May of 2022. These assumptions do not incorporate any impact from our announced acquisition of TriState Capital, currently anticipated to close by the end of our fiscal third quarter, which we would expect to further increase our incremental net interest income based on their relatively high concentration of floating-rate interest-earning assets. 

Refer to the discussion of our net interest income within the &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations&#8221; of our PCG, Raymond James Bank, and Other segments, where applicable. Also refer to &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations - Private Client Group - Clients&#8217; domestic cash sweep balances&#8221; for further information on the RJBDP.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. The following table shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities. The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous period&#8217;s average yield/cost. Similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average yield/cost by the previous period&#8217;s volume. Changes attributable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately.

(1) These metrics include the impact from the acquisition of Charles Stanley, which was completed on January 21, 2022. As of March 31, 2022, the impact on AUA was $33 billion and the impact on Assets in fee-based accounts was $21 billion. 

(2) A portion of our &#8220;Assets in fee-based accounts&#8221; is invested in &#8220;managed programs&#8221; overseen by our Asset Management segment, specifically our Asset Management Services division of RJ&#38;A (&#8220;AMS&#8221;). These assets are included in our financial assets under management as disclosed in the &#8220;Selected key metrics&#8221; section of our &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations - Asset Management.&#8221; 

Fee-based accounts within our PCG segment are comprised of a wide array of products and programs that we offer our clients. The majority of assets in fee-based accounts within our PCG segment are invested in programs for which our financial advisors provide investment advisory services, either on a discretionary or non-discretionary basis. Administrative services for such accounts (e.g., record-keeping) are generally performed by our Asset Management segment and, as a result, a portion of the related revenue is shared with the Asset Management segment. 

We also offer our clients fee-based accounts that are invested in &#8220;managed programs&#8221; overseen by AMS, which is part of our Asset Management segment. Fee-billable assets invested in managed programs are included in both &#8220;Assets in fee-based accounts&#8221; in the preceding table and &#8220;Financial assets under management&#8221; in the Asset Management segment. Revenues related to managed programs are shared by our PCG and Asset Management segments. The Asset Management segment receives a higher portion of the revenues related to accounts invested in managed programs, as compared to the portion received for non-managed programs, as it is performing portfolio management services in addition to administrative services. 

The vast majority of the revenues we earn from fee-based accounts is recorded in &#8220;Asset management and related administrative fees&#8221; on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Fees received from such accounts are based on the value of client assets in fee-based accounts and vary based on the specific account types in which the client invests and the level of assets in the client relationship. As fees for substantially all of such accounts are billed based on balances as of the beginning of the quarter, revenues from fee-based accounts may not be immediately affected by changes in asset values, but rather the impacts are seen in the following quarter. 

PCG AUA was essentially flat compared with December 31, 2021 as the positive impacts of strong net inflows of client assets during our fiscal second quarter and the Charles Stanley acquisition were offset by a decline in equity markets. Excluding the impact of the Charles Stanley acquisition, PCG AUA and assets in fee-based accounts each declined approximately 3% compared with December 31, 2021, which will negatively impact our asset management and related administrative fees for our fiscal third quarter of 2022. PCG assets in fee-based accounts continued to be a significant percentage of overall PCG AUA due to many clients&#8217; preference for fee-based alternatives versus transaction-based accounts and, as a result, a significant portion of our PCG revenues is more directly impacted by market movements.

The number of financial advisors as of March 31, 2022 increased compared to December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2021, as a result of the Charles Stanley acquisition, strong recruiting and strong retention of existing advisors. The recruiting pipeline remains robust across our affiliation options despite a competitive recruiting environment. Advisors in our Registered Investment Advisor &#38; Custody Services division are not included in our financial advisor metric although their client assets, which were $99.2 billion as of March 31, 2022, are included in PCG AUA.

0.32 &#160; % 0.30 % 0.30 &#160; % 0.31 % 

A significant portion of our domestic clients&#8217; cash is included in the RJBDP, a multi-bank sweep program in which clients&#8217; cash deposits in their accounts are swept into interest-bearing deposit accounts at Raymond James Bank and various third-party banks. We earn servicing fees for the administrative services we provide related to our clients&#8217; deposits that are swept to such banks as part of the RJBDP. The amounts from third-party banks are variable in nature and fluctuate based on client cash balances in the program, as well as the level of short-term interest rates and the interest paid to clients by the third-party banks on balances in the RJBDP. The &#8220;Average yield on RJBDP - third party banks&#8221; in the preceding table is computed by dividing annualized RJBDP fees from third-party banks, which are net of the interest expense paid to clients by the third-party banks, by the average daily RJBDP balance at third-party banks. The average yield on RJBDP - third-party banks increased only slightly from the prior-year quarter, as the 25-basis point increase in short-term interest rates in March 2022 occurred late in the current quarter. Although the Fed has indicated that it intends to continue to increase its benchmark short-term interest rate throughout the remainder of our fiscal 2022, as evidenced by the 50-basis point increase in May 2022, the amount of this increase that we will realize is impacted by other factors, including the timing and magnitude of the amount of such rate increases paid to clients as well as the demand for our deposit sweep balances from third-party banks that participate in the RJBDP. The PCG segment also earns RJBDP servicing fees from the Raymond James Bank segment, which are based on the number of accounts that are swept to Raymond James Bank. The fees from the Raymond James Bank segment are eliminated in consolidation. 

PCG segment results can be impacted by changes in the allocation of client cash balances between RJBDP balances with Raymond James Bank, RJBDP balances with third-party banks and our CIP, as the PCG segment typically earns different amounts from each of the three client cash destinations, depending on multiple factors. 

Client cash balances continued to increase as of March 31, 2022. The growing cash balances combined with limited capacity at third-party banks that participate in the RJBDP has resulted in a significant increase in cash balances held in our CIP, also resulting in a significant increase in our assets segregated for regulatory purposes balance presented on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Quarter ended March 31, 2022 compared with the quarter ended March 31, 2021 

Net revenues of $1.92 billion increased $275 million, or 17%, and pre-tax income of $213 million increased $21 million, or 11%. 

Asset management and related administrative fees increased $266 million, or 27%, primarily due to higher assets in fee-based accounts at the beginning of the current quarter, as well as incremental revenues related to Charles Stanley since the January 2022 acquisition date. 

Brokerage revenues decreased $16 million, or 4%, due to a decline in trailing placement fees from mutual and other fund products. 

Account and service fees increased $27 million, or 13%, primarily due to an increase in mutual fund service fees resulting from higher average mutual fund assets, as well as incremental client account and other fees resulting from our acquisition of Charles Stanley and higher RJBDP fees from Raymond James Bank due to an increase in the number of accounts swept to Raymond James Bank as part of the RJBDP. 

Compensation-related expenses increased $220 million, or 17%, primarily due to higher revenues, our acquisition of Charles Stanley, and an increase in compensation costs to support our growth. 

Non-compensation expenses increased $34 million, or 22%, due to incremental expenses resulting from the acquisition of Charles Stanley, higher communications and information processing expenses primarily due to ongoing enhancements of our technology platforms, and increases in travel and event-related expenses compared with the low levels incurred in the prior-year quarter. 

Six months ended March 31, 2022 compared with the six months ended March 31, 2021 

Net revenues of $3.76 billion increased $647 million, or 21%, and pre-tax income of $408 million increased $76 million, or 23%. 

Asset management and related administrative fees increased $543 million, or 29%, primarily due to higher assets in fee-based accounts at the beginning of each of the current-year quarterly billing periods compared with the prior-year quarterly billing periods and, to a lesser extent, the acquisition of Charles Stanley. 

Brokerage revenues increased $28 million, or 4%, primarily due to higher revenues from insurance and annuity products and mutual fund products, resulting from higher average asset values, as well as incremental revenues from the Charles Stanley acquisition. 

Account and service fees increased $67 million, or 17%, primarily due to an increase in mutual fund service fees resulting from higher average mutual fund assets, as well as incremental client account and other fees resulting from our acquisitions of NWPS Holdings, Inc. at the end of our fiscal first quarter of 2021 and Charles Stanley in our fiscal second quarter of 2022. RJBDP fees from Raymond James Bank also increased due to an increase in the number of accounts swept to Raymond James Bank as part of the RJBDP. 

Compensation-related expenses increased $510 million, or 21%, primarily due to higher revenues, incremental expenses resulting from our acquisition of Charles Stanley, and an increase in compensation costs to support our growth. 

Non-compensation expenses increased $61 million, or 20%, due to increases in travel and event-related expenses compared with the low levels incurred in the prior-year, higher communications and information processing expenses primarily due to ongoing enhancements of our technology platforms, and incremental expenses resulting from our acquisition of Charles Stanley.

Quarter ended March 31, 2022 compared with the quarter ended March 31, 2021 

Net revenues of $413 million decreased $20 million, or 5%, and pre-tax income of $87 million decreased $18 million, or 17%. 

Brokerage revenues decreased $10 million, or 6%, due to a decrease in fixed income brokerage revenues resulting from a more challenging trading environment compared with a strong prior-year quarter. We expect fixed income brokerage revenues to be volatile over the next few quarters given high levels of interest rate uncertainty. However, we expect our fixed income brokerage revenues to benefit from our announced acquisition of SumRidge Partners, which we expect to close in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022. 

Investment banking revenues were flat compared with the prior-year quarter. Merger &#38; acquisition and advisory revenues increased compared with the prior-year quarter. This increase was offset by a decrease in equity underwriting revenues, primarily due to a decline in market activity during the current quarter as a result of market uncertainty and geopolitical concerns. Our investment banking pipeline remains strong and, in part, reflects the investments we have made over the past several years, including our fiscal 2021 acquisitions of Financo and Cebile; however, continued market uncertainty could delay, or ultimately prevent, the closing of transactions, which could negatively impact our results for the remainder of fiscal 2022. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Compensation-related expenses decreased $6 million, or 2%, primarily due to the impact of lower revenues. 

Non-compensation expenses increased $4 million, or 6%, including an increase in business development expenses over relatively low prior-year levels. 

Six months ended March 31, 2022 compared with the six months ended March 31, 2021 

Net revenues of $1.03 billion increased $142 million, or 16%, and pre-tax income of $288 million increased $54 million, or 23%. 

Investment banking revenues increased $157 million, or 33%, due to a significant increase in merger &#38; acquisition and advisory revenues and, to a lesser extent, equity underwriting revenues. The significant increase in merger &#38; acquisition and advisory revenues reflected higher levels of client activity, especially in the fiscal first quarter of 2022. The increase in equity underwriting was primarily due to higher revenues from private placements, partially offset by a decline in public offerings. 

Brokerage revenues decreased $24 million, or 7%, primarily due to a decrease in fixed income brokerage revenues, which remained solid but were lower than the prior-year period as a result of challenging trading conditions compared with a strong prior-year period, due to a more volatile interest rate environment in fiscal 2022. 

Compensation-related expenses increased $73 million, or 14%, primarily due to the increase in revenues, as well as an increase in compensation costs to support our growth. 

Non-compensation expenses increased $15 million, or 11%, and included $4 million of acquisition-related expenses, comprised of the amortization of intangible assets with short useful lives which arose from the Financo and Cebile acquisitions.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Selected key metrics 

Managed programs 

Management fees recorded in our Asset Management segment are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of our fee-billable financial assets under management (&#8220;AUM&#8221;). These AUM include the portion of fee-based AUA in our PCG segment that is invested in programs overseen by our Asset Management segment (included in the &#8220;AMS&#8221; line of the following table), as well as retail accounts managed on behalf of third-party institutions, institutional accounts and proprietary mutual funds that we manage (collectively included in the &#8220;Carillon Tower Advisers&#8221; line of the following table). 

Revenues related to fee-based AUA in our PCG segment are shared by the PCG and Asset Management segments, the amount of which depends on whether or not clients are invested in assets that are in managed programs overseen by our Asset Management segment and the administrative services provided (see our &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations - Private Client Group&#8221; for more information). Our AUM in AMS are impacted by market fluctuations and net inflows or outflows of assets, including transfers between fee-based accounts and transaction-based accounts within our PCG segment. 

Revenues earned by Carillon Tower Advisers for retail accounts managed on behalf of third-party institutions, institutional accounts and our proprietary mutual funds are recorded entirely in the Asset Management segment. Our AUM in Carillon Tower Advisers are impacted by market and investment performance and net inflows or outflows of assets. 

Fees for our managed programs are generally collected quarterly. Approximately 70% of these fees are based on balances as of the beginning of the quarter, approximately 10% are based on balances as of the end of the quarter, and approximately 20% are based on average daily balances throughout the quarter.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Carillon Tower Advisers 

Assets managed by Carillon Tower Advisers include assets managed by its subsidiaries and affiliates: Eagle Asset Management, Scout Investments, Reams Asset Management (a division of Scout Investments), ClariVest Asset Management and Cougar Global Investments. The following table presents Carillon Tower Advisers&#8217; AUM by objective, excluding assets for which it does not exercise discretion, as well as the approximate average client fee rate earned on such assets.

Non-discretionary asset-based programs 

The following table includes assets held in certain non-discretionary asset-based programs for which the Asset Management segment does not exercise discretion but provides administrative support (including for affiliated entities). The vast majority of these assets are also included in our PCG segment fee-based AUA (as disclosed in &#8220;Assets in fee-based accounts&#8221; in the &#8220;Selected key metrics - PCG client asset balances&#8221; section of our &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations - Private Client Group&#8221;).

The decrease in assets as of March 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021 was largely due to a decline in equity markets during the quarter. Administrative fees associated with these programs are predominantly based on balances at the beginning of the quarter. 

RJ Trust 

The following table includes assets held in asset-based programs in RJ Trust (including those managed for affiliated entities). 

$ in billions March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 September 30, 2021 March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 September 30, 2020 Total assets $ 8.4 &#160; $ 8.8 $ 8.1 $ 7.8 $ 7.6 $ 7.1 

Quarter ended March 31, 2022 compared with the quarter ended March 31, 2021 

Net revenues of $234 million increased $25 million, or 12%, and pre-tax income of $103 million increased $16 million, or 18%. 

Asset management and related administrative fees increased $25 million, or 12%, driven by higher average financial assets under management and a higher beginning balance of assets in non-discretionary asset-based programs. The increase in average financial assets under management resulted from both equity market appreciation since the prior-year quarter and net inflows at AMS, partially offset by net outflows at Carillon Tower Advisers, which continued to be negatively impacted by the industry shift from actively managed investment strategies to passive investment strategies. We expect the declines in financial assets under management and assets in non-discretionary asset-based programs compared with December 31, 2021 to negatively affect our fiscal third quarter net revenues as the majority of our asset management and related administrative fees are billed based on balances as of the beginning of the quarter. 

Compensation expenses decreased $3 million, or 6%, and non-compensation expenses increased $12 million, or 17%. The increase in non-compensation expenses was primarily due to higher investment sub-advisory fees, which resulted from the increase in AUM in sub-advised programs. 

Six months ended March 31, 2022 compared with the six months ended March 31, 2021 

Net revenues of $470 million increased $66 million, or 16%, and pre-tax income of $210 million increased $40 million, or 24%. 

Asset management and related administrative fees increased $64 million, or 16%, driven by higher average financial assets under management and higher assets in non-discretionary asset-based programs at the beginning of each of the current-year quarterly billing periods compared with the prior-year quarterly billing periods. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Compensation expenses decreased $2 million, or 2%. Non-compensation expenses increased $28 million, or 20%, largely due to higher investment sub-advisory fees, resulting from the increase in AUM in sub-advised programs.

Quarter ended March 31, 2022 compared with the quarter ended March 31, 2021 

Net revenues of $197 million increased $37 million, or 23%, while pre-tax income of $83 million decreased $28 million, or 25%. 

Net interest income increased $34 million, or 22%, largely due to higher average interest-earning assets. The increase in average interest-earning assets was primarily driven by growth in securities-based loans and residential mortgage loans to PCG clients, as well as increases in average corporate loans and available-for-sale securities. The net interest margin increased to 2.01% from 1.94% for the prior-year quarter, primarily due to growth in higher-yielding assets. We anticipate that the net interest margin for our fiscal third quarter of 2022 will be positively impacted by the Fed&#8217;s short-term interest rate increases enacted in both March and May of 2022. In addition, given that a significant portion of our interest-earning assets are sensitive to changes in market interest rates, we expect our net interest earnings to also be favorably impacted by any additional increases in short-term interest rates that may occur over the remainder of our fiscal 2022. 

The bank loan provision for credit losses was $21 million for the current quarter, compared with a benefit for credit losses of $32 million for the prior-year quarter. The current quarter provision was largely attributable to loan growth. The prior-year quarter benefit primarily reflected favorable changes in macroeconomic inputs to our model during the quarter. 

RJBDP fees to PCG increased $5 million, or 11%, due to an increase in the number of accounts swept to Raymond James Bank as part of the RJBDP. These fees eliminate in consolidation. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Six months ended March 31, 2022 compared with the six months ended March 31, 2021 

Net revenues of $380 million increased $53 million, or 16%, and pre-tax income of $185 million increased $3 million, or 2%. 

Net interest income increased $54 million, or 17%, due to higher average interest-earning assets. The increase in average interest-earning assets was primarily driven by significant growth in securities-based loans and residential mortgage loans to PCG clients, as well as higher average corporate loans and available-for-sale securities. The net interest margin decreased to 1.97% from 1.98% for the prior-year period, primarily due to lower average short-term interest rates, as well as higher balances of agency-backed available-for-sale securities, which on average have a lower yield than loans. 

The bank loan provision for credit losses was $10 million for the current-year period, compared with a benefit for credit losses of $18 million for the prior-year period. The current-year period provision primarily reflected the impact of loan growth. The prior year benefit was largely attributable to favorable changes in inputs to our model, reflecting improvements in certain forecasted macroeconomic inputs. 

RJBDP fees to PCG increased $12 million, or 14%, due to an increase in the number of accounts swept to Raymond James Bank as part of the RJBDP. These fees are eliminated in consolidation.

Net revenues decreased $6 million, as the current quarter included a net $2 million of losses related to our private equity investments compared with $8 million of gains in the prior-year quarter. 

Non-interest expenses decreased $1 million, primarily due to a decrease in compensation expense and lower amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests due to private equity losses in the current quarter compared with gains in the prior-year quarter. Offsetting these declines were $11 million of acquisition-related expenses in the current quarter, which primarily included professional expenses and other costs incurred to effect our acquisition of Charles Stanley, which was completed in January 2022, and our announced acquisitions of TriState Capital and SumRidge Partners. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Six months ended March 31, 2022 compared with the six months ended March 31, 2021 

The pre-tax loss of $100 million was $28 million larger than the loss in the prior-year period. 

Net revenues decreased $25 million, primarily due to lower private equity gains compared with the prior-year period. The current-year period included $3 million of private equity valuation gains, of which an insignificant amount was attributable to noncontrolling interests, compared with $32 million of private equity valuation gains for the prior-year period, of which $10 million were attributable to noncontrolling interests and were offset within other expenses. 

Non-interest expenses increased $3 million, or 5%, primarily due to an increase in acquisition-related expenses, partially offset by lower private equity gains attributable to noncontrolling interests. The $13 million of acquisition-related expenses in the current-year period primarily included the aforementioned expenses associated with our acquisition of Charles Stanley, as well as our announced acquisitions of TriState Capital and SumRidge Partners. 

CERTAIN STATISTICAL DISCLOSURES BY BANK HOLDING COMPANIES 

We are required to provide certain statistical disclosures as a bank holding company under the SEC&#8217;s Industry Guide 3. The following table provides certain of those disclosures.

Return on assets is computed by dividing annualized net income for the period indicated by average assets for each respective period. Average assets for the quarter is computed by adding total assets as of the date indicated to the prior quarter-end total and dividing by two. Average assets for the year-to-date period is computed by adding total assets as of each quarter-end date during the year-to-date period to the beginning of the year total and dividing by three. 

Return on equity is computed by dividing annualized net income for the period indicated by average equity for each respective period. Average equity for the quarter is computed by adding total equity attributable to RJF as of the date indicated to the prior quarter-end total and dividing by two. Average equity for the year-to-date period is computed by adding total equity attributable to RJF as of each quarter-end date during the year-to-date period to the beginning of the year total and dividing by three. 

Average equity to average assets is computed by dividing average equity by average assets, as calculated in accordance with the previous explanations. 

Dividend payout ratio is computed by dividing dividends declared per common share during the period by earnings per diluted common share for the period.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION ANALYSIS 

The assets on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition consisted primarily of cash and cash equivalents, assets segregated for regulatory purposes and restricted cash (primarily segregated for the benefit of clients), receivables including bank loans, financial instruments held either for trading purposes or as investments, and other assets. A significant portion of our assets were liquid in nature, providing us with flexibility in financing our business. 

Total assets of $73.10 billion as of March 31, 2022 were $11.21 billion, or 18%, greater than our total assets as of September 30, 2021. The increase in assets was primarily due to an $8.18 billion increase in assets segregated for regulatory purposes and restricted cash, primarily due to a significant increase in client cash balances and the addition of $2.34 billion of segregated cash balances resulting from the Charles Stanley acquisition. The acquisition of Charles Stanley also contributed to the $338 million increase in brokerage client receivables and drove the $228 million increase in goodwill and identifiable intangible assets compared with September 30, 2021 (see Note 3 for further information). Bank loans, net increased by $2.89 billion, primarily due to an increase in securities-based loans and residential mortgage loans to PCG clients, as well as an increase in corporate loans. Available-for-sale securities increased $500 million. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $1.49 billion. 

As of March 31, 2022, our total liabilities of $64.49 billion were $10.90 billion, or 20%, greater than our total liabilities as of September 30, 2021. The increase in total liabilities was primarily related to the significant increase in client cash balances as of March 31, 2022, which resulted in a $8.71 billion increase in brokerage client payables, primarily due to an increase in client cash held in our CIP, and a $2.19 billion increase in bank deposits resulting from higher RJBDP balances held at Raymond James Bank. The increase in brokerage client payables also reflected an incremental $2.60 billion of client payables resulting from the Charles Stanley acquisition. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Liquidity and capital are essential to our business. The primary goal of our liquidity management activities is to ensure adequate funding to conduct our business over a range of economic and market environments. We seek to manage capital levels to support execution of our business strategy, provide financial strength to our subsidiaries, and maintain sustained access to the capital markets, while at the same time meeting our regulatory capital requirements and conservative internal management targets. 

Liquidity and capital resources are provided primarily through our business operations and financing activities. Financing activities could include bank borrowings, collateralized financing arrangements or additional capital raising activities under our &#8220;universal&#8221; shelf registration statement. We believe our existing assets, most of which are liquid in nature, together with funds generated from operations and available from committed and uncommitted financing facilities, provide adequate funds for continuing operations at current levels of activity in the short-term. We also believe that we will be able to continue to meet our long-term cash requirements due to our strong financial position and ability to access capital from financial markets. 

Liquidity and capital management 

Senior management establishes our liquidity and capital management frameworks. Our liquidity and capital management frameworks are overseen by the RJF Asset and Liability Committee, a senior management committee that develops and executes strategies and policies to manage our liquidity risk and interest rate risk, as well as provides oversight over the firm&#8217;s investments. The liquidity management framework includes senior management&#8217;s review of short- and long-term cash flow forecasts, review of capital expenditures, monitoring of the availability of alternative sources of financing, and daily monitoring of liquidity in our significant subsidiaries. Our decisions on the allocation of resources to our business units consider, among other factors, projected profitability, cash flow, risk, and future liquidity needs. Our treasury department assists in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the impact that our business activities have on our financial condition and liquidity, and also maintains our relationships with various lenders. The objective of our liquidity management framework is to support the successful execution of our business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity. 

Our capital planning and capital risk management processes are governed by the Capital Planning Committee (&#8220;CPC&#8221;), a senior management committee that provides oversight on our capital planning and ensures that our strategic planning and risk management processes are integrated into the capital planning process. The CPC meets at least quarterly to review key metrics related to the firm&#8217;s capital, such as debt structure and capital ratios; to analyze potential and emerging risks to capital; to 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

oversee our annual firmwide capital stress test; and to propose capital actions to the Board of Directors, such as declaring dividends, repurchasing securities, and raising capital. To ensure that we have sufficient capital to absorb unanticipated losses, the firm adheres to capital risk appetite statements and tolerances set in excess of regulatory minimums, which are established by the CPC and approved by the Board of Directors. We conduct enterprise-wide capital stress testing to ensure that we maintain adequate capital to adhere to our established tolerances under multiple scenarios, including stressed scenarios. 

Cash flows 

Cash and cash equivalents (excluding amounts segregated for regulatory purposes and restricted cash) decreased $1.49 billion to $5.72 billion during the six months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to the purchase of U.S. Treasuries, which were largely segregated for regulatory purposes as of March 31, 2022, as well as investments in bank loans and available-for-sale securities. In addition, on January 21, 2022, we completed our acquisition of Charles Stanley for &#163;277 million ($376 million as of January 21, 2022). Offsetting these cash outflows was the impact of positive net income during the period, as well as a significant increase in client cash balances which increased our brokerage client payables and bank deposits. 

Sources of liquidity 

Approximately $2.23 billion of our total March 31, 2022 cash and cash equivalents included cash held at the parent company, which included cash loaned to RJ&#38;A. These amounts include the impact of significant dividends from RJ&#38;A during the three months ended March 31, 2022, as well as dividends from RJF&#8217;s other subsidiaries. As of March 31, 2022, RJF had loaned $1.67 billion to RJ&#38;A (such amount is included in the RJ&#38;A cash balance in the following table), which RJ&#38;A has invested on behalf of RJF in cash and cash equivalents or otherwise deployed in its normal business activities. 

The following table presents our holdings of cash and cash equivalents. 

$ in millions March 31, 2022 RJF $ 579 &#160; RJ&#38;A 2,507 &#160; Raymond James Bank 869 &#160; Raymond James Ltd.

RJF maintained depository accounts at Raymond James Bank with a balance of $255 million as of March 31, 2022. The portion of this total that was available on demand without restrictions, which amounted to $178 million as of March 31, 2022, is reflected in the RJF cash balance and excluded from the Raymond James Bank cash balance in the preceding table. 

A large portion of the RJ Ltd. cash and cash equivalents balance as of March 31, 2022 was held to meet regulatory requirements and was not available for use by the parent. 

In addition to the cash balances described, we have various other potential sources of cash available to the parent from subsidiaries, as described in the following section. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Liquidity available from subsidiaries 

Liquidity is principally available to RJF, the parent company, from RJ&#38;A and Raymond James Bank. 

Certain of our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the requirements of the Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. As a member firm of FINRA, RJ&#38;A is subject to FINRA&#8217;s capital requirements, which are substantially the same as Rule 15c3-1. Rule 15c3-1 provides for an &#8220;alternative net capital requirement,&#8221; which RJ&#38;A has elected. Regulations require that minimum net capital, as defined, be equal to the greater of $1.5 million or 2% of aggregate debit items arising from client balances. In addition, covenants in RJ&#38;A&#8217;s committed financing facilities require its net capital to be a minimum of 10% of aggregate debit items. At March 31, 2022, RJ&#38;A significantly exceeded the minimum regulatory requirements, the covenants in its financing arrangements pertaining to net capital, as well as its internally-targeted net capital tolerances despite significant dividends to RJF during our fiscal second quarter of 2022. FINRA may impose certain restrictions, such as restricting withdrawals of equity capital, if a member firm were to fall below a certain threshold or fail to meet minimum net capital requirements which may result in RJ&#38;A limiting dividends it would otherwise remit to RJF. We evaluate regulatory requirements, loan covenants and certain internal tolerances when determining the amount of liquidity available to RJF from RJ&#38;A. 

Raymond James Bank may pay dividends to RJF without prior approval of its regulator as long as the dividends do not exceed the sum of Raymond James Bank&#8217;s current calendar year and the previous two calendar years&#8217; retained net income, and Raymond James Bank maintains its targeted regulatory capital ratios. Dividends from Raymond James Bank may be limited to the extent that capital is needed to support its balance sheet growth. 

Although we have liquidity available to us from our other subsidiaries, the available amounts are not as significant as those previously described and, in certain instances, may be subject to regulatory requirements. 

Borrowings and financing arrangements 

Committed financing arrangements 

Our ability to borrow is dependent upon compliance with the conditions in our various loan agreements and, in the case of secured borrowings, collateral eligibility requirements. Our committed financing arrangements consist of a tri-party repurchase agreement (i.e., securities sold under agreements to repurchase) and, in the case of our $500 million revolving credit facility agreement (the &#8220;Credit Facility&#8221;), an unsecured line of credit. The required market value of the collateral associated with the tri-party repurchase agreement ranges from 105% to 125% of the amount financed. 

The following table presents our committed financing arrangements with third-party lenders, which we generally utilize to finance a portion of our fixed income trading instruments, and the outstanding balances related thereto. 

March 31, 2022 $ in millions RJ&#38;A RJF Total Total number of arrangements Financing arrangement: Committed secured $ 100 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 100 &#160; 1 &#160; Committed unsecured 200 &#160; 300 &#160; 500 &#160; 1 &#160; Total committed financing arrangements

$ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; 

Our committed unsecured financing arrangement in the preceding table represents our Credit Facility, which provides for maximum borrowings of up to $500 million, with a sublimit of $300 million for RJF. RJ&#38;A may borrow up to $500 million under the Credit Facility, depending on the amount of outstanding borrowings by RJF. The variable rate facility fee on our Credit Facility, which is applied to the committed amount, decreased to 0.150% per annum as of March 31, 2022 from 0.175% per annum as of September 30, 2021, as a result of Moody&#8217;s Investor Services (&#8220;Moody&#8217;s&#8221;) upgrade of our credit ratings in February 2022. For additional details on our issuer and senior long-term debt ratings see our credit ratings table within this section below. For additional details on our committed unsecured financing arrangement, see our discussion of the Credit Facility in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our 2021 Form 10-K. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Uncommitted financing arrangements 

Our uncommitted financing arrangements are in the form of secured lines of credit, secured bilateral or tri-party repurchase agreements, or unsecured lines of credit. Our arrangements with third-party lenders are generally utilized to finance a portion of our fixed income securities or for cash management purposes. Our uncommitted secured financing arrangements generally require us to post collateral in excess of the amount borrowed and are generally collateralized by RJ&#38;A-owned securities or by securities that we have received as collateral under reverse repurchase agreements (i.e., securities purchased under agreements to resell). As of March 31, 2022, we had outstanding borrowings under two uncommitted secured borrowing arrangements out of a total of 12 uncommitted financing arrangements (eight uncommitted secured and four uncommitted unsecured). However, lenders are under no contractual obligation to lend to us under uncommitted credit facilities. 

The following table presents our borrowings on uncommitted financing arrangements, all of which were in the form of repurchase agreements in RJ&#38;A and were included in &#8220;Collateralized financings&#8221; on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.

Other borrowings and collateralized financings 

We had $850 million in FHLB borrowings outstanding at March 31, 2022, comprised of floating-rate advances which mature in December 2023. The interest rates on the floating-rate advances reset quarterly and transitioned to a Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;) -based rate in December 2021. We use interest rate swaps to manage the risk of increases in interest rates associated with these floating-rate advances by converting the balances subject to variable interest rates to a fixed interest rate. These FHLB borrowings were secured by a blanket lien on Raymond James Bank&#8217;s residential mortgage loan portfolio. Raymond James Bank had an additional $3.58 billion in immediate credit available from the FHLB as of March 31, 2022 and, with the pledge of additional eligible collateral to the FHLB, total available credit of 30% of total assets. See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our 2021 Form 10-K for additional information regarding these borrowings. 

Raymond James Bank is eligible to participate in the Federal Reserve&#8217;s discount window program; however, we do not view borrowings from the Federal Reserve as a primary source of funding. The credit available in this program is subject to periodic review, may be terminated or reduced at the discretion of the Federal Reserve, and is secured by pledged C&#38;I loans. 

We act as an intermediary between broker-dealers and other financial institutions whereby we borrow securities from one broker-dealer and then lend them to another. Where permitted, we have also loaned, to broker-dealers and other financial institutions, securities owned by clients or the firm. We account for each of these types of transactions as collateralized agreements and financings, with the outstanding balance of $285 million as of March 31, 2022 related to the securities loaned included in &#8220;Collateralized financings&#8221; on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition of this Form 10-Q. See Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for more information on our collateralized agreements and financings.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Senior notes payable 

At March 31, 2022, we had aggregate outstanding senior notes payable of $2.04 billion, which, exclusive of any unaccreted premiums or discounts and debt issuance costs, was comprised of $500 million par 4.65% senior notes due 2030, $800 million par 4.95% senior notes due 2046, and $750 million par 3.75% senior notes due 2051. See Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of our 2021 Form 10-K for additional information. 

Credit ratings 

Our issuer and senior long-term debt ratings as of the most current report are detailed in the following table. 

Rating Agency Rating Outlook Fitch Ratings, Inc. A- Stable 

Moody&#8217;s (1) 

A3 Stable 

Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Ratings Services (2) 

BBB+ Positive 

(1) In February 2022, Moody&#8217;s upgraded our senior debt and issuer credit rating to A3 from Baa1, which had a favorable impact on the interest rate and facility fee associated with our Credit Facility. 

(2) In March 2022, Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Rating Services revised their outlook to positive and affirmed our BBB+ issuer credit rating. 

Our current long-term debt ratings depend upon a number of factors, including industry dynamics, operating and economic environment, operating results, operating margins, earnings trends and volatility, balance sheet composition, liquidity and liquidity management, capital structure, overall risk management, business diversification and market share, and competitive position in the markets in which we operate. Deterioration in any of these factors could impact our credit ratings. Any rating downgrades could increase our costs in the event we were to obtain additional financing. 

Should our credit rating be downgraded prior to a public debt offering, it is probable that we would have to offer a higher rate of interest to bond holders. A downgrade to below investment grade may make a public debt offering difficult to execute on terms we would consider to be favorable. A downgrade below investment grade could result in the termination of certain derivative contracts and the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request immediate payment or demand immediate and ongoing overnight collateralization on our derivative instruments in liability positions. A credit downgrade could damage our reputation and result in certain counterparties limiting their business with us, result in negative comments by analysts, potentially negatively impact investors&#8217; and/or clients&#8217; perception of us, and cause a decline in our stock price. None of our borrowing arrangements contains a condition or event of default related to our credit ratings. However, a credit downgrade would result in the firm incurring a higher facility fee on the Credit Facility, in addition to triggering a higher interest rate applicable to any borrowings outstanding on that line as of and subsequent to such downgrade. Conversely, an improvement in RJF&#8217;s current credit rating could have a favorable impact on the facility fee, as well as the interest rate applicable to any borrowings on such line. 

Other sources and uses of liquidity 

We have company-owned life insurance policies which are utilized to fund certain non-qualified deferred compensation plans and other employee benefit plans. Certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans and other employee benefit plans are employee-directed while others are company-directed. Of the company-owned life insurance policies which fund these plans, certain policies could be used as a source of liquidity for the firm. Those policies against which we could readily borrow had a cash surrender value of $859 million as of March 31, 2022, comprised of $538 million related to employee-directed plans and $321 million related to company-directed plans, and we were able to borrow up to 90%, or $773 million, of the March 31, 2022 total without restriction. To effect any such borrowing, the underlying investments would be converted to money market investments, therefore requiring us to take market risk related to the employee-directed plans. There were no borrowings outstanding against any of these policies as of March 31, 2022. 

On May 12, 2021, we filed a &#8220;universal&#8221; shelf registration statement with the SEC pursuant to which we can issue debt, equity and other capital instruments if and when necessary or perceived by us to be opportune. Subject to certain conditions, this registration statement will be effective through May 12, 2024. 

On October 20, 2021, we announced we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire TriState Capital in a combination cash and stock transaction, valued at approximately $1.1 billion. Under the terms of the agreement, TriState Capital common stockholders will receive $6.00 cash and 0.25 RJF shares for each share of TriState Capital common stock, which represents per share consideration of $31.09 based on the closing price of RJF common stock on October 19, 2021. We have entered into an 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

agreement with the sole holder of the TriState Capital Series C Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to which the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock will be converted to common shares at the prescribed exchange ratio and cashed out at $30 per share. The TriState Capital Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock will remain outstanding and will be converted into equivalent shares of preferred stock of RJF. As of April 30, 2022, we had received approval to complete the transaction from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, and FINRA, and TriState Capital received approval to complete the transaction from its shareholders. Subject to additional applicable closing conditions, we currently expect the transaction to close in our fiscal third quarter of 2022. We currently have the ability to utilize our cash on hand to fund the cash component of the acquisition. See Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for additional information. 

On March 28, 2022, we announced we had reached an agreement to acquire SumRidge Partners, a technology-driven fixed income market maker specializing in investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds, municipal bonds and institutional preferred securities. The transaction, which is subject to certain regulatory and other closing conditions, is currently expected to close in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2022. The acquisition of SumRidge Partners will add an institutional market-making operation, as well as additional trading technologies and risk management tools to our existing fixed income operations. We currently have the ability to utilize our cash on hand to fund the acquisition. See Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for additional information. 

As part of our ongoing operations, we also enter into contractual arrangements that may require future cash payments, including certificates of deposit, lease obligations and other contractual arrangements, such as for software and various services. See Notes 13 and 14 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for information regarding our lease obligations and certificates of deposit, respectively. We have entered into investment commitments, lending commitments and other commitments to extend credit for which we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of future payments. See Note 16 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for further information. 

REGULATORY 

Refer to the discussion of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the impact on our operations of certain rules and regulations in &#8220;Item 1 - Business - Regulation&#8221; and &#8220;Item 7 - Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Regulatory&#8221; of our 2021 Form 10-K. 

RJF and many of its subsidiaries are each subject to various regulatory capital requirements. As of March 31, 2022, all of our active regulated domestic and international subsidiaries had net capital in excess of minimum requirements. In addition, RJF and Raymond James Bank were categorized as &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; as of March 31, 2022. The maintenance of certain risk-based and other regulatory capital levels could influence various capital allocation decisions impacting one or more of our businesses. However, due to the current capital position of RJF and its regulated subsidiaries, we do not anticipate these capital requirements will have a negative impact on our future business activities. See Note 21 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for further information on regulatory capital requirements. 

Alternative reference rate transition 

Central banks and regulators in the U.S. and other jurisdictions are working to implement the transition to suitable replacements for the London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;). In December 2021, our FHLB borrowings and SBL converted from LIBOR-based interest rates to SOFR-based interest rates, resulting in an insignificant impact on interest income, interest expense, and cash flows. We continue to evaluate the effect of the alternative reference rate transition and at this time, given current economic conditions, we expect minimal financial impact. Refer to &#8220;Item 1 - Business - Regulation&#8221; of our 2021 Form 10-K f or additional information regarding the alternative reference rate transition and our planned response.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

The condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during any reporting period in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Management has established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure the appropriateness of such estimates and assumptions and their consistent application from period to period. For a description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our 2021 Form 10-K. 

Due to their nature, estimates involve judgment based upon available information. Actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Therefore, understanding these critical accounting estimates is important in understanding our reported results of operations and financial position. We believe that of our accounting estimates and assumptions, those described in the following sections involve a high degree of judgment and complexity. 

Valuation of financial instruments 

The use of fair value to measure financial instruments, with related gains or losses recognized on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income, is fundamental to our financial statements and our risk management processes. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of our fair value accounting policies regarding financial instruments and financial instrument liabilities. See Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for additional information on our financial instruments at fair value. 

Loss provisions 

Loss provisions for legal and regulatory matters 

The recorded amount of liabilities related to legal and regulatory matters is subject to significant management judgment. For a description of the significant estimates and judgments associated with establishing such accruals, see the &#8220;Contingent liabilities&#8221; section of Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our 2021 Form 10-K. In addition, refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for information regarding legal and regulatory matter contingencies as of March 31, 2022. 

Allowance for credit losses 

We evaluate certain of our financial assets, including bank loans, to estimate an allowance for credit losses based on expected credit losses over a financial asset&#8217;s lifetime. Our estimates are based on ongoing evaluations of our financial assets, the related credit risk characteristics, and the overall economic and environmental conditions affecting the financial assets. Our process for determining the allowance for credit losses includes a complex analysis of several quantitative and qualitative factors requiring significant management judgment due to matters that are inherently uncertain. This uncertainty can produce volatility in our allowance for credit losses. In addition, the allowance for credit losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses. In such an event, any losses in excess of our allowance would result in a decrease in our net income, as well as a decrease in the level of regulatory capital. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our 2021 Form 10-K for information regarding our methodologies and assumptions used in estimating the allowance for credit losses. See Note 8 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for information regarding our allowance for credit losses related to bank loans as of March 31, 2022. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS 

In March 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new guidance related to troubled debt restructurings and disclosures regarding write-offs of financing receivables (ASU 2022-02), amending guidance related to the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments (ASU 2016-13). The amendment eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings for creditors, but requires enhanced disclosures for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, and requires disclosure of current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables. This new guidance is effective for our fiscal year beginning on October 1, 2023 and will be applied on a prospective basis. Although permitted, we do not currently plan to early adopt. We do not expect the adoption of this new guidance to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. 

RISK MANAGEMENT 

Risks are an inherent part of our business and activities. Management of risk is critical to our fiscal soundness and profitability. Our risk management processes are multi-faceted and require communication, judgment and knowledge of financial products and markets. We have a formal Enterprise Risk Management (&#8220;ERM&#8221;) program to assess and review aggregate risks across the firm. Our management takes an active role in the ERM process, which requires specific administrative and business functions to participate in the identification, assessment, monitoring and control of various risks. 

The principal risks related to our business activities are market, credit, liquidity, operational, model, and compliance. 

Governance 

Our Board of Directors, including its Audit and Risk Committee, oversees the firm&#8217;s management and mitigation of risk, reinforcing a culture that encourages ethical conduct and risk management throughout the firm. Senior management communicates and reinforces this culture through three lines of risk management and a number of senior-level management committees. Our first line of risk management, which includes all of our businesses, owns its risks and is responsible for identifying, mitigating, and escalating risks arising from its day-to-day activities. The second line of risk management, which includes Compliance and Risk Management, advises our client-facing businesses and other first-line functions in identifying, assessing and mitigating risk. The second line of risk management tests and monitors the effectiveness of controls, as deemed necessary, and escalates risks when appropriate to senior management and the Board of Directors. The third line of risk management, Internal Audit, independently reviews activities conducted by the previous lines of risk management to assess their management and mitigation of risk, providing additional assurance to the Board of Directors and senior management, with a view toward enhancing our oversight, management, and mitigation of risk. 

Market risk 

Market risk is our risk of loss resulting from the impact of changes in market prices on our trading inventory, derivatives and investment positions. We have exposure to market risk primarily through our broker-dealer trading operations and our banking operations. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries, primarily RJ&#38;A, trade debt obligations and equity securities and maintain trading inventories to ensure availability of securities and to facilitate client transactions. Inventory levels may fluctuate daily as a result of client demand. We also hold investments primarily in agency-backed MBS and agency-backed CMOs within Raymond James Bank&#8217;s available-for-sale securities portfolio, and from time-to-time may hold SBA loan securitizations not yet transferred. Our primary market risks relate to interest rates, equity prices, and foreign exchange rates. Interest rate risk results from changes in levels of interest rates, the volatility of interest rates, mortgage prepayment speeds and credit spreads. Equity risk results from changes in prices of equity securities. Foreign exchange risk results from changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatility of foreign exchange rates. 

See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our 2021 Form 10-K and Notes 4, 5 and 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for fair value and other information regarding our trading inventories, available-for-sale securities and derivative instruments. 

We regularly enter into underwriting commitments and, as a result, we may be subject to market risk on any unsold shares issued in the offerings to which we are committed. Risk exposure is controlled by limiting our participation, the transaction size or through the syndication process. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

The Market Risk Management department is responsible for measuring, monitoring, and reporting market risks associated with the firm&#8217;s trading and derivative portfolios. While Market Risk Management maintains ongoing communication with the revenue-generating business units, it is independent of such units. 

Interest rate risk 

Trading activities 

We are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our trading inventory (primarily comprised of fixed income instruments) in our Capital Markets segment. Changes in value of our trading inventory may result from fluctuations in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, macroeconomic factors, investor expectations or risk appetites, liquidity, as well as dynamic relationships among these factors. We actively manage interest rate risk arising from our fixed income trading inventory through the use of hedging strategies utilizing U.S. Treasuries, futures contracts, liquid spread products and derivatives. 

Our primary method for controlling risks within trading inventories is through the use of dollar-based and exposure-based limits. A hierarchy of limits exists at multiple levels, including firm, business unit, desk (e.g., for equities, corporate bonds, municipal bonds), product sub-type (e.g., below-investment-grade positions) and, at times, at the individual position. For derivative positions, which are primarily comprised of interest rate swaps, we have established limits based on a number of factors, including interest rate, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, spread, ratio, basis, and volatility risk. Derivative exposures are also monitored both for the total portfolio and by maturity periods. Trading positions and derivatives are monitored against these limits through daily reports that are distributed to senior management. During volatile markets, we may temporarily reduce limits and/or choose to pare our trading inventories to reduce risk. 

We monitor Value-at-Risk (&#8220;VaR&#8221;) for all of our trading portfolios on a daily basis for risk management purposes and as a result of applying the Fed&#8217;s Market Risk Rule (&#8220;MRR&#8221;) for the purpose of calculating our capital ratios. The MRR, also known as the &#8220;Risk-Based Capital Guidelines: Market Risk&#8221; rule released by the Fed, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC, requires us to calculate VaR for all of our trading portfolios, including fixed income, equity, derivatives, and foreign exchange instruments. VaR is an appropriate statistical technique for estimating potential losses in trading portfolios due to typical adverse market movements over a specified time horizon with a suitable confidence level. However, there are inherent limitations of utilizing VaR including: historical movements in markets may not accurately predict future market movements; VaR does not take into account the liquidity of individual positions; VaR does not estimate losses over longer time horizons; and extended periods of one-directional markets potentially distort risks within the portfolio. In addition, should markets become more volatile, actual trading losses may exceed VaR results presented on a single day and might accumulate over a longer time horizon. As a result, management complements VaR with sensitivity analysis and stress testing and employs additional controls such as a daily review of trading results, review of aged inventory, independent review of pricing, monitoring of concentrations and review of issuer ratings. 

To calculate VaR, we use models which incorporate historical simulation. This approach assumes that historical changes in market conditions, such as in interest rates and equity prices, are representative of future changes. Simulation is based on daily market data for the previous twelve months. VaR is reported at a 99% confidence level for a one-day time horizon. Assuming that future market conditions change as they have in the past twelve months, we would expect to incur losses greater than those predicted by our one-day VaR estimates about once every 100 trading days, or about three times per year on average. For regulatory capital calculation purposes, we also report VaR and Stressed VaR numbers for a ten-day time horizon. The VaR model is independently reviewed by our Model Risk Management function. See &#8220;Item 7 - Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management - Model risk&#8221; of our 2021 Form 10-K for further information. 

The modeling of the risk characteristics of trading positions involves a number of assumptions and approximations that management believes to be reasonable. However, there is no uniform industry methodology for estimating VaR, and different assumptions or approximations could produce materially different VaR estimates. As a result, VaR results are more reliable when used as indicators of risk levels and trends within a firm than as a basis for inferring differences in risk-taking across firms. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

The following table sets forth the high, low, period-end and average daily one-day VaR for all of our trading portfolios, including fixed income and equity instruments, and for our derivatives for the periods and dates indicated. 

&#160; Six months ended March 31, 2022 Period-end VaR Three months ended March 31, Six months ended March 31, $ in millions High Low March 31, 2022 September 30, 2021 $ in millions 2022 2021 2022 2021 Daily VaR $ 2 &#160; $ 1 &#160; $ 1 &#160; $ 1 Average daily VaR $ 1 &#160; $ 6 $ 1 &#160; $ 6 

Average daily VaR was lower during the three and six months ended March 31, 2022 compared with the three and six months ended March 31, 2021 due to the impact of scenarios of elevated volatility as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic (which commenced in March 2020) on our VaR model during the prior-year period. 

The Fed&#8217;s MRR requires us to perform daily back-testing procedures for our VaR model, whereby we compare each day&#8217;s projected VaR to its regulatory-defined daily trading losses, which exclude fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income and intraday trading. Regulatory-defined daily trading losses are used to evaluate the performance of our VaR model and are not comparable to our actual daily net revenues. Based on these daily &#8220;ex ante&#8221; versus &#8220;ex post&#8221; comparisons, we determine whether the number of times that regulatory-defined daily trading losses exceed VaR is consistent with our expectations at a 99% confidence level. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2022, our regulatory-defined daily loss in our trading portfolios exceeded our predicted VaR on five occasions as a result of heightened market volatility during our fiscal second quarter. 

Separately, RJF provides additional market risk disclosures to comply with the MRR, including 10-day VaR and 10-day Stressed VaR, which are available on our website at https://www.raymondjames.com/investor-relations/financial-information/filings-and-reports within &#8220;Other Reports and Information.&#8221; 

Banking operations 

Raymond James Bank maintains an interest-earning asset portfolio that is comprised of cash, C&#38;I loans, commercial and residential real estate loans, REIT loans, tax-exempt loans and SBL and other loans, as well as agency-backed securities held in the available-for-sale securities portfolio (primarily MBS and CMOs), and SBA loan securitizations. These interest-earning assets are primarily funded by client deposits. Based on its current asset portfolio, Raymond James Bank is subject to interest rate risk. Raymond James Bank analyzes interest rate risk based on forecasted net interest income, which is the net amount of interest received and interest paid, and the net portfolio valuation, both across a range of interest rate scenarios. 

One of the objectives of Raymond James Bank&#8217;s Asset and Liability Committee is to manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates. This committee uses several measures to monitor and limit Raymond James Bank&#8217;s interest rate risk, including scenario analysis and economic value of equity. The methods used to measure this sensitivity are described in &#8220;Item 7 - Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management - Market risk&#8221; of our 2021 Form 10-K. We utilize a hedging strategy using interest rate swaps as a result of Raymond James Bank&#8217;s asset and liability management process. For further information regarding this hedging strategy, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our 2021 Form 10-K. 

To ensure that Raymond James Bank remains within its tolerances established for net interest income, a sensitivity analysis of net interest income to interest rate conditions is estimated under a variety of scenarios. We use simulation models and estimation techniques to assess the sensitivity of net interest income to movements in interest rates. The model estimates the sensitivity by calculating interest income and interest expense in a dynamic balance sheet environment using current repricing, prepayment, and reinvestment of cash flow assumptions over a 12-month time horizon. Assumptions used in the model include interest rate movement, the slope of the yield curve, and balance sheet composition and growth. The model also considers interest rate-related risks such as pricing spreads, pricing of client cash accounts, and prepayments. Various interest rate scenarios are modeled in order to determine the effect those scenarios may have on net interest income. 

The following table is an analysis of Raymond James Bank&#8217;s estimated net interest income over a 12-month period based on instantaneous shifts in interest rates (expressed in basis points) using our previously described asset/liability model, which assumes a dynamic balance sheet and that interest rates do not decline below zero. While not presented, additional rate scenarios are performed, including interest rate ramps and yield curve shifts that may more realistically mimic the speed of potential interest rate movements. We also perform simulations on time horizons of up to five years to assess longer-term impacts to various interest rate scenarios. On a quarterly basis, we test expected model results to actual performance.

At March 31, 2022, our available-for-sale securities portfolio had a fair value of $8.82 billion with a weighted-average yield of 1.30% and a weighted-average life of approximately four years. See Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for additional information. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Equity price risk 

We are exposed to equity price risk as a result of our capital markets activities. Our broker-dealer activities are generally client-driven, and we carry equity securities as part of our trading inventory to facilitate such activities, although the amounts are not as significant as our fixed income trading inventory. We attempt to reduce the risk of loss inherent in our inventory of equity securities by monitoring those security positions each day and establishing position limits. Equity securities held in our trading inventory are generally included in VaR. 

In addition, we have a private equity portfolio, included in &#8220;Other investments&#8221; on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, which is primarily comprised of investments in third-party funds. See Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for additional information on this portfolio. 

Foreign exchange risk 

We are subject to foreign exchange risk due to our investments in foreign subsidiaries as well as transactions and resulting balances denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. For example, our bank loan portfolio includes loans which are denominated in Canadian dollars, totaling $1.38 billion and $1.29 billion at March 31, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively, when converted to the U.S. dollar. A majority of such loans are held by Raymond James Bank&#8217;s Canadian subsidiary, which is discussed in the following sections. 

Investments in foreign subsidiaries 

Raymond James Bank has an investment in a Canadian subsidiary, resulting in foreign exchange risk. To mitigate its foreign exchange risk, Raymond James Bank utilizes short-term, forward foreign exchange contracts. These derivatives are primarily accounted for as net investment hedges in the condensed consolidated financial statements. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our 2021 Form 10-K and Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for further information regarding these derivatives. 

At March 31, 2022, we had foreign exchange risk in our investment in RJ Ltd. of CAD 372 million and in our investment in Charles Stanley of &#163;278 million, which were not hedged. All of our other investments in subsidiaries located in Europe are not hedged and we do not believe we had material foreign exchange risk either individually, or in the aggregate, pertaining to these subsidiaries as of March 31, 2022. Foreign exchange gains/losses related to our foreign investments are primarily reflected in OCI on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. See Note 17 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for further information regarding our components of OCI. 

Transactions and resulting balances denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar 

We are subject to foreign exchange risk due to our holdings of cash and certain other assets and liabilities resulting from transactions denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. Any currency-related gains/losses arising from these foreign currency denominated balances are reflected in &#8220;Other&#8221; revenues in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The foreign exchange risk associated with a portion of such transactions and balances denominated in foreign currency are mitigated utilizing short-term, forward foreign exchange contracts. Such derivatives are not designated hedges and therefore, the related gains/losses are included in &#8220;Other&#8221; revenues in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. See Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for information regarding our derivatives. 

Credit risk 

Credit risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in a borrower&#8217;s, issuer&#8217;s or counterparty&#8217;s ability to meet its financial obligations under contractual or agreed-upon terms. The nature and amount of credit risk depends on the type of transaction, the structure and duration of that transaction, and the parties involved. Credit risk is an integral component of the profit assessment of lending and other financing activities. See further discussion of our credit risk, including how we manage such risk, in &#8220;Item 7 - Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management - Credit risk&#8221; of our 2021 Form 10-K. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Brokerage activities 

We are engaged in various trading and brokerage activities in which our counterparties primarily include broker-dealers, banks and other financial institutions. We are exposed to risk that these counterparties may not fulfill their obligations. In addition, certain commitments, including underwritings, may create exposure to individual issuers and businesses. The risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty and/or the issuer of the instrument. In addition, we may be subject to concentration risk if we hold large positions in or have large commitments to a single counterparty, borrower, or group of similar counterparties or borrowers (e.g., in the same industry). We seek to mitigate these risks by imposing and monitoring individual and aggregate position limits within each business segment for each counterparty, conducting regular credit reviews of financial counterparties, reviewing security, derivative and loan concentrations, holding and calculating the fair value of collateral on certain transactions and conducting business through clearing organizations, which may guarantee performance. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our 2021 Form 10-K and Notes 6 and 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for further information about our credit risk mitigation related to derivatives and collateralized agreements. 

Our client activities involve the execution, settlement, and financing of various transactions on behalf of our clients. Client activities are transacted on either a cash or margin basis. Credit exposure results from client margin loans, which are monitored daily and are collateralized by the securities in the clients&#8217; accounts. We monitor exposure to industry sectors and individual securities and perform analysis on a daily basis in connection with our margin lending activities. We adjust our margin requirements if we believe our risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions. In addition, when clients execute a purchase, we are at some risk that the client will default on their financial obligation associated with the trade. If this occurs, we may have to liquidate the position at a loss. Further information about our determination of the allowance for credit losses associated with certain of our brokerage lending activities is described in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of our 2021 Form 10-K. 

We offer loans to financial advisors for recruiting and retention purposes. We have credit risk and may incur a loss primarily in the event that such borrower is no longer affiliated with us. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of our 2021 Form 10-K and Note 9 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for further information about our loans to financial advisors. 

Banking activities 

Raymond James Bank has a substantial loan portfolio. Our strategy for credit risk management related to bank loans includes well-defined credit policies, uniform underwriting criteria, and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all credit exposures. The strategy also includes diversification on a geographic, industry and client level, regular credit examinations and management reviews of all corporate and tax-exempt loans as well as individual delinquent residential loans. The credit risk management process also includes an annual independent review of the credit risk monitoring process that performs assessments of compliance with credit policies, risk ratings, and other critical credit information. We seek to identify potential problem loans early, record any necessary risk rating changes and charge-offs promptly, and maintain appropriate reserve levels for expected losses. We utilize a comprehensive credit risk rating system to measure the credit quality of individual corporate and tax-exempt loans and related unfunded lending commitments, including the probability of default and/or loss given default of each corporate and tax-exempt loan and commitment outstanding. For our SBL and residential mortgage loans, we utilize the credit risk rating system used by bank regulators in measuring the credit quality of each homogeneous class of loans. In evaluating credit risk, we consider trends in loan performance, the level of allowance coverage relative to similar banking institutions, industry or client concentrations, the loan portfolio composition and macroeconomic factors (both current and forecasted). These factors have a potentially negative impact on loan performance and net charge-offs. 

While our bank loan portfolio is diversified, a significant downturn in the overall economy, deterioration in real estate values or a significant issue within any sector or sectors where we have a concentration will generally result in large provisions for credit losses and/or charge-offs. We determine the allowance required for specific loan grades based on relative risk characteristics of the loan portfolio. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our methods for determining the allowance for each class of loans and make enhancements we consider appropriate. Our allowance for credit losses methodology is described in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of our 2021 Form 10-K. As our bank loan portfolio is segregated into six portfolio segments, likewise, the allowance for credit losses is segregated by these same segments. See &#8220;Item 7 - Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management - Credit risk&#8221; of our 2021 Form 10-K for further information about the risk characteristics relevant to each portfolio segment. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total bank loans held for investment was 1.17% and 1.27% at March 31, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively. The bank loan provision for credit losses for the three and six months ended March 31, 2022 was $21 million and $10 million, respectively, compared to a benefit for credit losses of $32 million and $18 million for the three and six months ended March 31, 2021, respectively. See further explanation of the credit loss provision in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations - Raymond James Bank&#8221; of this Form 10-Q and Note 8 in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for further information about our allowance for credit losses. 

The level of charge-off activity is a factor that is considered in evaluating the potential severity of future credit losses. The following table presents net loan (charge-offs)/recoveries and the percentage of net loan (charge-offs)/recoveries to the average outstanding loan balances by loan portfolio segment.

(1) Total nonperforming loans held for investment at March 31, 2022 and September 30, 2021 included $92 million and $61 million of nonperforming loans, respectively, which were current pursuant to their contractual terms. 

The nonperforming loan balances in the preceding table exclude $7 million and $8 million as of March 31, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively, of residential TDRs which were returned to accrual status in accordance with our policy. 

The following table presents total nonperforming assets, including the nonperforming loans in the preceding table and, when applicable, other real estate acquired in the settlement of residential mortgages, as a percentage of Raymond James Bank&#8217;s total assets.

Although our nonperforming assets as a percentage of Raymond James Bank&#8217;s assets remained low as of March 31, 2022, any prolonged period of market deterioration could result in an increase in our nonperforming assets, an increase in our allowance for credit losses and/or an increase in net charge-offs in future periods, although the extent will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

In accordance with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, we did not apply TDR classification to any COVID-19 related loan modifications performed from March 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021 to borrowers who were current as of December 31, 2019. The expiration of these provisions on January 1, 2022, did not have a significant impact on our results of operations or our credit metrics, including delinquencies or nonaccrual loans.

Our underwriting policies for the major types of bank loans are described in &#8220;Item 7 - Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management - Credit risk&#8221; of our 2021 Form 10-K. 

Risk monitoring process 

Another component of credit risk strategy for our bank loan portfolio is the ongoing risk monitoring and review processes, including our internal loan review process, as well as our rigorous processes to manage and limit credit losses arising from loan delinquencies. There are various other factors included in these processes, depending on the loan portfolio. 

Residential mortgage and SBL and other loan portfolios 

The collateral securing our SBL and other portfolio is monitored on a recurring basis, with marketable collateral monitored on a daily basis. Collateral adjustments, as triggered by our monitoring procedures, are made by the borrower as necessary to ensure our loans are adequately secured, resulting in minimizing our credit risk. Collateral calls have been minimal relative to our SBL and other portfolio with no losses incurred to date. 

We track and review many factors to monitor credit risk in our residential mortgage loan portfolio. The factors include, but are not limited to: loan performance trends, loan product parameters and qualification requirements, borrower credit scores, level of documentation, loan purpose, geographic concentrations, average loan size, risk rating and LTV ratios. See Note 8 in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for additional information about our residential mortgage loan portfolio. 

The following table presents a summary of delinquent residential mortgage loans, the vast majority of which are first mortgage loans, which are comprised of loans which are two or more payments past due as well as loans in the process of foreclosure. 

&#160; Amount of delinquent residential loans Delinquent residential loans as a percentage of outstanding residential mortgage loan balances $ in millions 30-89 days 90 days or more Total 30-89 days 90 days or more Total March 31, 2022 $ 1 &#160; $ 8 &#160; $ 9 &#160; 0.02 &#160; % 0.13 &#160; % 0.15 &#160; % September 30, 2021 $ 4 $ 6 $ 10 0.08 % 0.11 % 0.19 % 

Our March 31, 2022 percentage compares favorably to the national average for over 30 day delinquencies of 2.57%, as most recently reported by the Fed. 

Credit risk is also managed by diversifying the residential mortgage portfolio. Most of the loans in our residential loan portfolio are to PCG clients across the U.S. The following table details the geographic concentrations (top five states) of our one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. 

March 31, 2022 Loans outstanding as a % of total residential mortgage loans Loans outstanding as a % of total bank loans CA 26.4% 5.6% FL 17.2% 3.6% TX 8.7% 1.8% NY 8.3% 1.8% CO 3.9% 0.8% 

Loans where borrowers may be subject to payment increases include adjustable-rate mortgage loans with terms that initially require payment of interest only. Payments may increase significantly when the interest-only period ends and the loan principal begins to amortize. At March 31, 2022 and September 30, 2021, these loans totaled $2.23 billion and $1.97 billion, respectively, or approximately 38% and 37% of the residential mortgage portfolio, respectively. The weighted-average number of years before the remainder of the loans, which were still in their interest-only period at March 31, 2022, begins amortizing is seven years.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Corporate and tax-exempt loans 

Credit risk in our corporate and tax-exempt bank loan portfolios is monitored on an individual loan basis. The majority of our tax-exempt bank loan portfolio is comprised of loans to investment-grade borrowers. Credit risk is managed by diversifying the corporate bank loan portfolio. Our corporate bank loan portfolio does not contain a significant concentration in any single industry. The following table details the industry concentrations (top five categories) of our corporate bank loans. 

March 31, 2022 Loans outstanding as a % of total corporate bank loans Loans outstanding as a % of total bank loans Multi-family 6.4% 3.2% Office real estate 6.3% 3.1% Automotive/transportation 6.3% 3.1% Consumer products and services 6.1% 3.0% Industrial warehouse 5.7% 2.8% 

While the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic appear to be waning, certain sectors continue to be impacted by supply chain disruptions and changes in consumer behavior. In addition, the Ukraine conflict has further exacerbated supply chain stresses and inflation concerns. These and related factors could negatively impact our borrowers, particularly those in consumer-facing or supply-dependent industries. In addition, we continue to monitor our exposure to office real estate where trends have changed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Liquidity risk 

See the section &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and capital resources&#8221; of this Form 10-Q for information regarding our liquidity and how we manage liquidity risk. 

Operational risk 

Operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including, but not limited to, business disruptions, improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions, deficiencies in our technology or financial operating systems and inadequacies or breaches in our control processes, including cybersecurity incidents. See &#8220;Item 7 - Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management - Operational risk&#8221; of our 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of our operational risk and certain of our risk mitigation processes. 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we activated and successfully executed on our business continuity protocols. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and in developing our plans to return to the office, we have endeavored to protect the health and well-being of our associates and our clients while ensuring the continuity of business operations for our clients. During the fiscal second quarter of 2022, we implemented our return to office strategy, which included more work location flexibility for our associates. We continue to monitor conditions and comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, as applicable. 

Periods of severe market volatility can result in a significantly higher level of transactions on specific days, which may present operational challenges from time to time that may result in losses. These losses can result from, but are not limited to, trade errors, failed transaction settlements, late collateral calls to borrowers and counterparties, or interruptions to our system processing. We did not incur any significant losses related to such operational challenges during the six months ended March 31, 2022. 

As more fully described in the discussion of our business technology risks included in various risk factors presented in &#8220;Item 1A - Risk Factors&#8221; of our 2021 Form 10-K, despite our implementation of protective measures and endeavoring to modify them as circumstances warrant, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to human error, natural disasters, power loss, cyber-attacks and other information security breaches, and other events that could have an impact on the security and stability of our operations.
