Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Factors affecting &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; 

Certain statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may constitute &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include information concerning future strategic objectives, business prospects, anticipated savings, financial results (including expenses, earnings, liquidity, cash flow and capital expenditures), industry or market conditions, demand for and pricing of our products, acquisitions and divestitures, anticipated results of litigation, our effective tax rate, regulatory developments, effects of accounting pronouncements, and general economic conditions. In addition, words such as &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;projects,&#8221; and future or conditional verbs such as &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; and &#8220;would,&#8221; as well as any other statement that necessarily depends on future events, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and they involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Although we make such statements based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. We caution investors not to rely unduly on any forward-looking statements and urge you to carefully consider the risks described in our filings with the SEC from time to time, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, which are available at www.raymondjames.com and the SEC&#8217;s website at www.sec.gov. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statement in the event it later turns out to be inaccurate, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 

Introduction 

The following Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;) is intended to help the reader understand the results of our operations and financial condition. This MD&#38;A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to condensed consolidated financial statements. Where &#8220;NM&#8221; is used in various percentage change computations, the computed percentage change has been determined to be not meaningful. 

We operate as a financial holding company and bank holding company. Results in the businesses in which we operate are highly correlated to general economic conditions and, more specifically, to the direction of the U.S. equity and fixed income markets, changes in interest rates, market volatility, corporate and mortgage lending markets and commercial and residential credit trends. Overall market conditions, economic, political and regulatory trends, and industry competition are among the factors which could affect us and which are unpredictable and beyond our control. These factors affect the financial decisions made by market participants, including investors, borrowers, and competitors, impacting their level of participation in the financial markets. These factors also impact the level of investment banking activity and asset valuations, which ultimately affect our business results. 

Executive overview 

Three months ended December 31, 2019 compared with the three months ended December 31, 2018 

Net revenues of $2.01 billion increased $78 million , or 4% . Pre-tax income of $359 million increased $27 million , or 8% . Our net income of $268 million increased $19 million , or 8% , and our earnings per diluted share were $1.89 , reflecting a 12% increase. We achieved an annualized return on equity (&#8220;ROE&#8221;) during the three months ended December 31, 2019 of 16.0% , compared with 15.9% for the prior year quarter, and an annualized return on tangible common equity (&#8220;ROTCE&#8221;) (1) of 17.5% , compared with 17.6% for the prior year quarter. 

The $78 million increase in net revenues compared with the prior year quarter reflected higher asset management and related administrative fees, primarily attributable to higher Private Client Group assets in fee-based accounts at the beginning of the quarter, which were 12% higher than fee-based assets as of the beginning of the prior year quarter. Fee-based assets as of December 31, 2019 grew 9% compared with the end of the previous quarter, which will impact asset management and related administrative fees in our second fiscal quarter of 2020. 

Compensation, commissions and benefits expense increased $86 million , or 7% , due to an increase in compensable net revenues, which primarily include asset management and related administrative fees, brokerage revenues, and investment banking revenues, as well as increased staffing levels required to support our continued growth and regulatory compliance requirements. 

Non-compensation expenses decreased $35 million , or 10% , primarily due to a $2 million loan loss benefit in the current year quarter compared with a $16 million loan loss provision for the prior year quarter, as well as a $15 million loss on the sale of our operations related to research, sales and trading of European equities that occurred in the prior year quarter. 

(1) &#8220;Return on tangible common equity&#8221; is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please see the &#8220;Reconciliation of GAAP measures to non-GAAP financial measures&#8221; in this MD&#38;A for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and for other important disclosures. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Our effective income tax rate was 25.3% for the three months ended December 31, 2019 , a slight increase compared with the 24.8% effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 . We estimate our effective income tax rate to be approximately 25% for the remainder of fiscal year 2020. Our future effective income tax rate may be impacted positively or negatively by non-taxable items (such as gains or losses earned on our company-owned life insurance and tax-exempt interest), non-deductible expenses (such as meals and entertainment and certain executive compensation), as well as vesting and exercises of equity compensation. 

During the three months ended December 31, 2019 , we repurchased 126 thousand shares of common stock under our Board of Directors&#8217; share repurchase authorization for $11 million at an average price of approximately $89.30 per share. As of December 31, 2019 , we had $739 million of availability remaining under this authorization. 

A summary of our financial results by segment as compared to the prior year quarter is as follows: 

&#8226; 

PCG segment net revenues of $1.41 billion increased 4% , while pre-tax income of $153 million decreased 7% . The increase in net revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in asset management and related administrative fees due to higher assets in fee-based accounts. Non-interest expenses increased $69 million , or 6% , primarily resulting from an increase in compensation expenses due to the growth in compensable net revenues and higher staffing levels to support our continued growth and regulatory compliance requirements. Pre-tax income decreased despite an increase in net revenues due to a shift in the revenue mix, as net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks, which have no associated direct payout expense, declined due to lower short-term interest rates. Meanwhile, revenues that have an associated direct payout expense (e.g., asset management and related administrative fees) increased. 

&#8226; 

Capital Markets net revenues of $268 million increased 6% and pre-tax income of $29 million increased 142% . The increase in net revenues was primarily due to an increase in fixed income brokerage revenues, as well as higher debt and equity underwriting revenues. These increases were partially offset by a decline in merger &#38; acquisition and advisory revenues and lower equity brokerage revenues. Non-interest expenses decreased slightly, as the prior year impact of the aforementioned $15 million loss on the sale of our operations related to research, sales and trading of European equities was partially offset by higher compensation expense. 

&#8226; 

Our Asset Management segment net revenues of $184 million increased 6% and pre-tax income of $73 million increased 14% . The increase in net revenues was driven by growth in Private Client Group assets in fee-based accounts, which increased both in programs managed by the Asset Management segment and in other asset-based programs for which the segment provides administrative support. 

&#8226; 

RJ Bank net revenues of $216 million increased 6% and pre-tax income of $135 million increased 23% . The increase in net revenues reflected higher net interest income due to growth in interest-earning assets, which more than offset the lower net interest margin caused by lower short-term interest rates. Non-interest expenses decreased $12 million , or 13% , due to a $2 million loan loss benefit compared with a $16 million loan loss provision in the prior year quarter, partially offset by an increase in fees for RJBDP paid to PCG. 

&#8226; 

Our Other segment reflected a pre-tax loss that was $13 million larger compared to the prior year quarter, the result of a modest valuation loss on private equity investments, compared with gains in the prior year quarter, and lower interest income on corporate cash balances due to a decline in interest rates. Non-interest expenses increased $3 million , or 15% , primarily due to higher compensation-related expenses. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Segments 

We currently operate through five segments. Our business segments are PCG, Capital Markets, Asset Management and RJ Bank. Our Other segment includes our private equity investments, interest income on certain corporate cash balances, and certain corporate overhead costs of RJF, including the interest costs on our public debt. 

The following table presents our consolidated and segment net revenues and pre-tax income/(loss) for the periods indicated.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Reconciliation of GAAP measures to non-GAAP financial measures 

We utilize certain non-GAAP financial measures to aid in, and enhance, the understanding of our financial results and related measures. These non-GAAP financial measures have been separately identified in this document. We believe that annualized return on tangible common equity is meaningful to investors as this measure facilitates comparison of our results to the results of other companies. This non-GAAP financial measure should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies. The following table provides a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for the periods indicated.

Annualized return on equity is computed by dividing annualized net income for the period indicated by average equity for each respective period or, in the case of annualized return on tangible common equity, computed by dividing annualized net income by average tangible common equity for each respective period. 

Average equity is computed by adding the total equity attributable to Raymond James Financial, Inc. as of the date indicated to the prior quarter-end total, and dividing by two, or in the case of average tangible common equity, computed by adding tangible common equity as of the date indicated to the prior quarter-end total, and dividing by two. 

Net interest analysis 

During our fourth fiscal quarter of 2019, the Federal Reserve decreased its benchmark short-term interest rate twice, each time by 25 basis points, and implemented a third decrease of 25 basis points in October 2019. These decreases in short-term interest rates have had a negative impact on our first fiscal quarter of 2020 results, as we have certain assets and liabilities, primarily held in our PCG, RJ Bank and Other segments, which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Fees we earn from third-party banks on client cash balances swept to such banks as part of RJBDP are also sensitive to changes in interest rates. 

Given the relationship between our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities held in each of these segments and the nature of fees we earn from third-party banks on the RJBDP, decreases in short-term interest rates generally result in an overall decrease in our net earnings, although the magnitude of the impact to our net interest margin depends on the yields on interest-earning assets relative to the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, including deposit rates paid to clients on their cash balances. Conversely, any increases in short-term interest rates and/or decreases in the deposit rates paid to clients generally have a positive impact on our earnings. 

Refer to the discussion of the specific components of our net interest income within the &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition - Results of Operations&#8221; of our PCG, RJ Bank, and Other segments. Also refer to &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition - Results of Operations - Private Client Group - Clients&#8217; domestic cash sweep balances&#8221; for further information on the RJBDP.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

The following table presents our consolidated average balances, interest income and expense and the related yields and rates. Average balances are calculated on a daily basis, with the exception of Loans to financial advisors, net and Corporate cash and all other, which are calculated based on the average of the end-of-month balances for each month within the period.

A portion of our &#8220;Assets in fee-based accounts&#8221; is invested in &#8220;managed programs&#8221; overseen by our Asset Management segment, specifically our Asset Management Services division of RJ&#38;A (&#8220;AMS&#8221;). These assets are included in our Financial assets under management as disclosed in the &#8220;Selected key metrics&#8221; section of our &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations - Asset Management.&#8221; 

Fee-based accounts within our PCG segment are comprised of a wide array of products and programs that we offer our clients. The majority of assets in fee-based accounts within our PCG segment are invested in programs for which our financial advisors provide investment advisory services, either on a discretionary or non-discretionary basis. Administrative services for such accounts (e.g., record-keeping) are generally performed by our Asset Management segment and, as a result, a portion of the related revenues is shared with the Asset Management segment. 

We also offer our clients fee-based accounts that are invested in &#8220;managed programs&#8221; overseen by AMS, which is part of our Asset Management segment. Fee-billable assets invested in managed programs are included in both &#8220;Assets in fee-based accounts&#8221; in the preceding table and &#8220;Financial assets under management&#8221; in the Asset Management segment. Revenues related to managed programs are shared by our PCG and Asset Management segments. The Asset Management segment receives a higher portion of the revenues related to accounts invested in managed programs, as compared to the portion received for non-managed programs, as it is performing portfolio management services in addition to administrative services. 

The vast majority of the revenues we earn from fee-based accounts are recorded in &#8220;Asset management and related administrative fees&#8221; on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Fees received from such accounts are based on the value of client assets in fee-based accounts and vary based on the specific account types in which the client participates and the level of assets in the client relationship. As fees for substantially all of such accounts are billed based on balances as of the beginning of the quarter, revenues from fee-based accounts may not be immediately impacted by changes in asset values, but rather the impacts are seen in the following quarter. 

PCG assets under administration increased compared with the prior year due to the net addition of financial advisors and equity market appreciation. In addition, PCG assets in fee-based accounts continued to increase as a percentage of overall PCG assets under administration due to clients&#8217; preference for fee-based alternatives versus transaction-based accounts. As a result of the continued shift to fee-based accounts, a larger portion of our PCG revenues are more directly impacted by market movements.

The number of financial advisors increased primarily due to continued financial advisor recruiting and high levels of retention, partially offset by planned financial advisor retirements during the December quarter, which is a seasonally typical period for such activity.

A significant portion of our clients&#8217; cash is included in the RJBDP, a multi-bank sweep program in which clients&#8217; cash deposits in their accounts are swept into interest-bearing deposit accounts at RJ Bank and various third-party banks. We earn servicing fees for the administrative services we provide related to our clients&#8217; deposits that are swept to such banks as part of the RJBDP. The amounts from third-party banks are variable in nature and fluctuate based on client cash balances in the program, as well as the level of short-term interest rates and the interest paid to clients by the third-party banks on balances in the RJBDP. The &#8220;Average yield on RJBDP - third party banks&#8221; in the preceding table is computed by dividing RJBDP fees from third-party banks, which are net of the interest paid to clients by the third-party banks, by the average daily RJBDP balances at third-party banks. The PCG segment also earns RJBDP servicing fees from RJ Bank, which are based on the number of accounts that are swept to RJ Bank. The fees from RJ Bank are eliminated in consolidation. 

RJBDP fees from third-party banks and the average yield on RJBDP (third-party banks) were negatively impacted by the decrease in short-term interest rates implemented by the Fed toward the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2020 and two short-term interest rate decreases implemented during the preceding fiscal quarter. The impact on our earnings of any future fluctuations in short-term interest rates will be largely dependent upon the change in the deposit rate paid on client cash balances. Any additional decreases in short-term interest rates, increases in deposit rates paid to clients, and/or a significant decline in our clients&#8217; cash balances will likely have a negative impact on our earnings. Further, PCG segment results are impacted by changes in the allocation of client cash balances in the RJBDP between RJ Bank and third-party banks. PCG generally earns a higher rate on cash held at third-party banks. 

Money market funds were discontinued as a sweep option in June 2019. Balances in those funds were converted to the RJBDP or reinvested by the client. 

Three months ended December 31, 2019 compared with the three months ended December 31, 2018 

Net revenues of $1.41 billion increased $58 million , or 4% , while pre-tax income of $153 million decreased $11 million , or 7% . Pre-tax income decreased despite an increase in net revenues due to a shift in the revenue mix, as net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks, which have no associated direct payout expense, declined due to lower short-term interest rates. Meanwhile, revenues that have an associated direct payout expense (e.g., asset management and related administrative fees) increased. 

Asset management and related administrative fees increased $75 million , or 11% , primarily due to higher asset balances in fee-based accounts at the beginning of the quarter, reflecting successful financial advisor recruiting and retention, equity market appreciation and the increased utilization of fee-based accounts. 

Brokerage revenues declined $17 million , or 5% , primarily as a result of the decline in mutual fund trails, which were impacted by the conversion of client assets into mutual fund share classes which pay lower rates and the continued shift to fee-based accounts. 

Total account and service fees were flat compared with the prior year quarter, as an increase in mutual fund service fees due to higher asset balances and an increase in RJBDP fees from RJ Bank due to an increase in the number of accounts, were offset by a decline in RJBDP fees from third-party banks. The decline in RJBDP fees from third-party banks was driven both by lower short-term interest rates and lower client cash balances compared with the prior year quarter. 

Net interest income decreased $5 million , or 11% , driven by a decrease in interest income from client margin loans and assets segregated pursuant to regulations due to a decrease in average balances and a decline in short-term interest rates. Partially offsetting the decrease in interest income, interest expense also decreased due to the impact of lower deposit rates paid on lower client cash balances in CIP. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Compensation-related expenses increased $72 million , or 7% , due to higher compensable net revenues, as well as increased staffing levels to support our continued growth and regulatory compliance requirements. 

Non-compensation expenses decreased $3 million , or 2% , as decreased legal reserves compared with the prior-year quarter were offset by higher occupancy and equipment expenses. The increase in occupancy and equipment expenses was driven by branch expansion in our employee affiliation option, rising real estate rental rates, and financial advisor growth.

Three months ended December 31, 2019 compared with the three months ended December 31, 2018 

Net revenues of $268 million increased $15 million , or 6% , and pre-tax income of $29 million increased $17 million , or 142% . 

Total brokerage revenues increased $16 million , or 16% , due to an increase in fixed income brokerage revenues, partially offset by a decrease in equity brokerage revenues. The increase in fixed income brokerage revenues was primarily due to an increase in client activity during the current year quarter, largely a result of higher interest rate volatility. Equity brokerage revenues continue to be challenged by industry trends, including the separate payment for research and execution services and the shift from high- to low-touch execution services. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Total investment banking revenues were flat compared with the prior-year quarter, as increased equity and debt underwriting revenues were offset by decreased merger &#38; acquisition and advisory revenues. 

Compensation-related expenses increased $8 million , or 5% , primarily due to the increase in net revenues. 

Non-compensation expenses decreased $10 million , or 12% , as the prior year quarter was negatively impacted by a $15 million loss associated with the sale of our operations related to research, sales and trading of European equities.

Selected key metrics 

Managed programs 

Management fees recorded in our Asset Management segment are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of our fee-billable financial assets under management (&#8220;AUM&#8221;). These AUM include the portion of fee-based AUA in our PCG segment that is invested in programs overseen by our Asset Management segment (included in the AMS line of the following table), as well as retail accounts managed on behalf of third-party institutions, institutional accounts and proprietary mutual funds that we manage (collectively included in the &#8220;Carillon Tower Advisers&#8221; line of the following table). 

Revenues related to fee-based AUA in our PCG segment are shared by the PCG and Asset Management segments, the amount of which depends on whether clients are invested in assets that are in managed programs overseen by our Asset Management segment and the administrative services provided (see our &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations - Private Client Group&#8221; for more information). Our AUM in AMS are impacted by market fluctuations and net inflows or outflows of assets, including transfers between fee-based accounts and transaction-based accounts within our PCG segment. 

Revenues earned by Carillon Tower Advisers for retail accounts managed on behalf of third-party institutions, institutional accounts and our proprietary mutual funds are recorded entirely in the Asset Management segment. Our AUM in Carillon Tower Advisers are impacted by market and investment performance and net inflows or outflows of assets.

Non-discretionary asset-based programs 

Assets held in certain non-discretionary asset-based programs for which the Asset Management segment does not exercise discretion but provides administrative support (including for affiliated entities) totaled $251.3 billion , $229.7 billion, $184.3 billion, and $200.1 billion as of December 31, 2019 , September 30, 2019 , December 31, 2018 , and September 30, 2018, respectively. The increase in assets over the prior year level was primarily due to clients moving to fee-based accounts from transaction-based accounts, successful financial advisor recruiting and market appreciation. Administrative fees associated with these programs are predominantly calculated based on balances at the beginning of the quarter. 

RJ Trust 

Assets held in asset-based programs in RJ Trust (including those managed for affiliated entities) totaled $7.2 billion , $6.6 billion , $5.7 billion , and $6.1 billion as of December 31, 2019 , September 30, 2019 , December 31, 2018 and September 30, 2018, respectively. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Three months ended December 31, 2019 compared with the three months ended December 31, 2018 

Net revenues of $184 million increased $10 million , or 6% , and pre-tax income of $73 million increased $9 million , or 14% . 

Asset management and related administrative fees increased $15 million , or 9% , driven by an increase in PCG assets in fee-based accounts compared with the prior year quarter. Assets in fee-based accounts increased both in managed programs overseen by the Asset Management segment and in non-discretionary asset-based programs for which the segment provides administrative support.

Three months ended December 31, 2019 compared with the three months ended December 31, 2018 

Net revenues of $216 million increased $13 million , or 6% , and pre-tax income of $135 million increased $25 million , or 23% . 

Net interest income increased $13 million , or 7% , as higher interest-earning banking assets offset the negative impact from lower short-term interest rates. The increase in average interest-earning banking assets was driven by growth in average loans of $1.33 billion and a $372 million increase in our average available-for-sale securities portfolio. The net interest margin decreased to 3.23% from 3.25% . 

The loan loss provision was a benefit of $2 million , compared to an expense of $16 million in the prior year quarter. The benefit in the current year quarter was primarily attributable to payoffs of certain lower-rated corporate loans and a shift in loan mix to a higher portion of residential mortgage loans, which generally have lower allowances for loan losses than corporate loans. 

Compensation and benefits expenses increased $1 million due increased staffing levels to support our continued growth. 

Non-compensation expenses (excluding the provision for loan losses) increased $5 million, including a $6 million , or 15% , increase in fees for RJBDP paid to PCG, primarily driven by an increase in the number of accounts. These fees are eliminated in consolidation.

Nonaccrual loans are included in the average loan balances in the preceding table. Any payments received for corporate nonaccrual loans are applied entirely to principal. Interest income on residential mortgage nonaccrual loans is recognized on a cash basis. 

Fee income on bank loans included in interest income for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $4 million and $5 million , respectively. 

The yield on tax-exempt loans in the preceding table is presented on a taxable-equivalent basis utilizing the applicable federal statutory tax rates for each of the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 . 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. The following table shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities. The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous period&#8217;s average yield/cost. Similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average yield/cost by the previous year&#8217;s volume. Changes attributable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately.

Three months ended December 31, 2019 compared with the three months ended December 31, 2018 

The pre-tax loss of $31 million was $13 million larger than the loss generated in the prior year quarter. 

Net revenues decreased $10 million from income of $2 million in the prior year quarter to a loss of $8 million , due to a modest valuation loss on private equity investments compared with gains in the prior year quarter, and a decrease in interest earned on corporate cash balances due to a decline in interest rates. 

Non-interest expenses increased $3 million , or 15% , primarily driven by higher compensation-related expenses.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Refer to the &#8220;Results of Operations - RJ Bank&#8221; and &#8220;Risk management - Credit risk&#8221; sections of Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and to the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for the other required disclosures. 

Liquidity and capital resources 

Liquidity is essential to our business. The primary goal of our liquidity management activities is to ensure adequate funding to conduct our business over a range of economic and market environments. 

Senior management establishes our liquidity and capital management framework. This framework includes senior management&#8217;s review of short- and long-term cash flow forecasts, review of monthly capital expenditures, monitoring of the availability of alternative sources of financing, and daily monitoring of liquidity in our significant subsidiaries. Our decisions on the allocation of capital to our business units consider, among other factors, projected profitability and cash flow, risk, and impact on future liquidity needs. Our treasury department assists in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the impact that our business activities have on our financial condition, liquidity and capital structure, and maintains our relationships with various lenders. The objective of this framework is to support the successful execution of our business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity. 

Liquidity is provided primarily through our business operations and financing activities. Financing activities could include bank borrowings, repurchase agreement transactions or additional capital raising activities under our &#8220;universal&#8221; shelf registration statement. 

Cash and cash equivalents increased $152 million to $4.11 billion during the three months ended December 31, 2019 , due to $654 million of cash provided by financing activities, which was primarily driven by an increase in bank deposits during the current period. Investing activities used $502 million primarily due to an increase in bank loans and the growth of our available-for-sale securities portfolio during the current period. 

We believe our existing assets, most of which are liquid in nature, together with funds generated from operations and available from committed and uncommitted financing facilities provide adequate funds for continuing operations at current levels of activity. 

Sources of liquidity 

Approximately $1.43 billion of our total December 31, 2019 cash and cash equivalents included cash on hand at the parent, as well as parent cash loaned to RJ&#38;A. The following table presents our holdings of cash and cash equivalents.

RJF maintained depository accounts at RJ Bank with a balance of $164 million as of December 31, 2019 . The portion of this total that was available on demand without restrictions, which amounted to $108 million as of December 31, 2019 , is reflected in the RJF total (and is excluded from the RJ Bank cash balance in the preceding table). 

RJF had loaned $999 million to RJ&#38;A as of December 31, 2019 (such amount is included in the RJ&#38;A cash balance in the preceding table), which RJ&#38;A has invested on behalf of RJF in cash and cash equivalents or otherwise deployed in its normal business activities. 

In addition to the cash balances described, we have various other potential sources of cash available to the parent from subsidiaries, as described in the following section. 

Liquidity available from subsidiaries 

Liquidity is principally available to RJF, the parent company, from RJ&#38;A and RJ Bank. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Certain of our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the requirements of the Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. As a member firm of FINRA, RJ&#38;A is subject to FINRA&#8217;s capital requirements, which are substantially the same as Rule 15c3-1. Rule 15c3-1 provides for an &#8220;alternative net capital requirement,&#8221; which RJ&#38;A has elected. Regulations require that minimum net capital, as defined, be equal to the greater of $1.5 million or 2% of aggregate debit items arising from client transactions. In addition, covenants in RJ&#38;A&#8217;s committed financing facilities require its net capital to be a minimum of 10% of aggregate debit items. At December 31, 2019 , RJ&#38;A significantly exceeded the minimum regulatory requirements, the covenants in its financing arrangements pertaining to net capital, as well as its internally-targeted net capital tolerances. FINRA may impose certain restrictions, such as restricting withdrawals of equity capital, if a member firm were to fall below a certain threshold or fail to meet minimum net capital requirements. 

RJ&#38;A, as a nonbank custodian of Individual Retirement Accounts (&#8220;IRAs&#8221;), must also satisfy certain Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) regulations in order to accept new IRA and plan accounts and retain the accounts for which it serves as nonbank custodian. To maintain adequate net worth under these regulations, RJ&#38;A may have to limit dividends to RJF. We evaluate regulatory requirements, loan covenants and certain internal tolerances when determining the amount of liquidity available to RJF from RJ&#38;A. 

RJ Bank may pay dividends to RJF without prior approval of its regulator as long as the dividend does not exceed the sum of RJ Bank&#8217;s current calendar year and the previous two calendar years&#8217; retained net income, and RJ Bank maintains its targeted regulatory capital ratios. At December 31, 2019 , RJ Bank had $351 million of capital in excess of the amount it would need at that date to maintain its targeted regulatory capital ratios, and could pay a dividend of such amount without requiring prior approval of its regulator. 

Although we have liquidity available to us from our other subsidiaries, the available amounts are not as significant as those previously described and, in certain instances, may be subject to regulatory requirements. 

Borrowings and financing arrangements 

Committed financing arrangements 

Our ability to borrow is dependent upon compliance with the conditions in our various loan agreements and, in the case of secured borrowings, collateral eligibility requirements. Our committed financing arrangements are in the form of either tri-party repurchase agreements or, in the case of the Credit Facility, an unsecured line of credit. The required market value of the collateral associated with the committed secured facilities ranges from 102% to 125% of the amount financed. 

The following table presents our committed financing arrangements with third-party lenders, which we generally utilize to finance a portion of our fixed income trading instruments held, and the outstanding balances related thereto.

For additional details on our committed unsecured financing arrangement, see our discussion of the Credit Facility in Note 11 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q. 

Uncommitted financing arrangements 

Our uncommitted financing arrangements are in the form of secured lines of credit, secured bilateral or tri-party repurchase agreements, or unsecured lines of credit. Our arrangements with third-party lenders are generally utilized to finance a portion of our fixed income securities or for cash management purposes. Our uncommitted secured financing arrangements generally require us to post collateral in excess of the amount borrowed. As of December 31, 2019 , we had outstanding borrowings under one uncommitted secured and 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

three uncommitted unsecured borrowing arrangements with lenders out of a total of 11 uncommitted financing arrangements (six uncommitted secured and five uncommitted unsecured). However, lenders are under no contractual obligation to lend to us under uncommitted credit facilities.

Other financings 

RJ Bank had $875 million in FHLB borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2019 , comprised of floating-rate advances totaling $850 million and a $25 million fixed-rate advance, all of which were secured by a blanket lien on RJ Bank&#8217;s residential mortgage loan portfolio (see Note 11 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding these borrowings). RJ Bank had an additional $2.62 billion in immediate credit available from the FHLB as of December 31, 2019 and, with the pledge of additional eligible collateral to the FHLB, total available credit of 30% of total assets. 

RJ Bank is eligible to participate in the FRB&#8217;s discount-window program; however, we do not view borrowings from the FRB as a primary source of funding. The credit available in this program is subject to periodic review, may be terminated or reduced at the discretion of the FRB, and is secured by pledged C&#38;I loans. 

We act as an intermediary between broker-dealers and other financial institutions whereby we borrow securities from one broker-dealer and then lend them to another. Where permitted, we have also loaned, to broker-dealers and other financial institutions, securities owned by clients or the firm. We account for each of these types of transactions as collateralized agreements and financings, with the outstanding balances related to the securities loaned included in &#8220;Securities loaned&#8221; on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition of this Form 10-Q, in the amount of $ 239 million as of December 31, 2019 . See Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for more information on our securities borrowed and securities loaned. 

From time to time we enter into repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements. We account for each of these types of transactions as collateralized agreements and financings, with the outstanding balances of the repurchase agreements included in &#8220;Securities sold under agreements to repurchase&#8221; on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition of this Form 10-Q, in the amount of $200 million as of December 31, 2019 . These balances are reflected in the preceding table of uncommitted financing arrangements. Such financings are generally collateralized by non-customer, RJ&#38;A-owned securities or by securities that we have received as collateral under reverse repurchase agreements. 

&#160; 

The average daily balance outstanding during the five most recent quarters, the maximum month-end balance outstanding during the quarter and the period-end balances for repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements is detailed in the following table.

At December 31, 2019 , in addition to the financing arrangements previously described, we had $18 million outstanding on a mortgage loan for our St. Petersburg, Florida home-office complex that is included in &#8220;Other borrowings&#8221; on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition of this Form 10-Q. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

At December 31, 2019 , we had aggregate outstanding senior notes payable of $1.55 billion. Our senior notes payable, exclusive of any unaccreted premiums or discounts and debt issuance costs, was comprised of $250 million par 5.625% senior notes due 2024, $500 million par 3.625% senior notes due 2026, and $800 million par 4.95% senior notes due 2046. See Note 15 of our 2019 Form 10-K for additional information. 

Our issuer and senior long-term debt ratings as of the most current report are detailed in the following table.

&#160;

Our current long-term debt ratings depend upon a number of factors, including industry dynamics, operating and economic environment, operating results, operating margins, earnings trends and volatility, balance sheet composition, liquidity and liquidity management, capital structure, overall risk management, business diversification and market share, and competitive position in the markets in which we operate. Deteriorations in any of these factors could impact our credit ratings. Any rating downgrades could increase our costs in the event we were to obtain additional financing. 

Should our credit rating be downgraded prior to a public debt offering, it is probable that we would have to offer a higher rate of interest to bond holders. A downgrade to below investment grade may make a public debt offering difficult to execute on terms we would consider to be favorable. A downgrade below investment grade could result in the termination of certain derivative contracts and the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request immediate payment or demand immediate and ongoing overnight collateralization on our derivative instruments in liability positions (see Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for additional information). A credit downgrade could damage our reputation and result in certain counterparties limiting their business with us, result in negative comments by analysts, potentially negatively impact investor and/or clients&#8217; perception of us, and cause a decline in our stock price. None of our borrowing arrangements contains a condition or event of default related to our credit ratings. However, a credit downgrade would result in the firm incurring a higher facility fee on the $500 million Credit Facility, in addition to triggering a higher interest rate applicable to any borrowings outstanding on that line as of and subsequent to such downgrade. Conversely, an improvement in RJF&#8217;s current credit rating could have a favorable impact on the facility fee, as well as the interest rate applicable to any borrowings on such line. 

Other sources and uses of liquidity 

We have company-owned life insurance policies which are utilized to fund certain non-qualified deferred compensation plans and other employee benefit plans. Certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans and other employee benefit plans are employee-directed while others are company-directed. Certain policies which we could readily borrow against had a cash surrender value of $615 million as of December 31, 2019 , comprised of $350 million related to employee-directed plans and $265 million related to company-directed plans, and we were able to borrow up to 90%, or $554 million, of the December 31, 2019 total without restriction. To effect any such borrowing, the underlying investments would be converted to money market investments, therefore requiring us to take market risk related to the employee-directed plans. There were no borrowings outstanding against any of these policies as of December 31, 2019 . 

On May 18, 2018, we filed a &#8220;universal&#8221; shelf registration statement with the SEC pursuant to which we can issue debt, equity and other capital instruments if and when necessary or perceived by us to be opportune. Subject to certain conditions, this registration statement will be effective through May 18, 2021. 

&#160; 

See the Contractual obligations section of this MD&#38;A for information regarding our contractual obligations. 

Statement of financial condition analysis 

The assets on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition consisted primarily of cash and cash equivalents (a large portion of which is segregated for the benefit of clients), receivables including bank loans, financial instruments held either for trading purposes or as investments, and other assets. A significant portion of our assets were liquid in nature, providing us with flexibility in financing our business. 

Total assets of $40.15 billion as of December 31, 2019 were $1.32 billion , or 3% , greater than our total assets as of September 30, 2019 . The increase in assets was primarily due to a $567 million increase in cash and cash equivalents segregated pursuant to regulations, a $465 million increase in other assets primarily due to ROU assets recorded as a result of the adoption of new guidance related to the 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

accounting for leases, and a $405 million increase in bank loans. Offsetting these increases, brokerage client receivables, net and receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations decreased $144 million and $119 million respectively. 

As of December 31, 2019 , our total liabilities of $33.25 billion were $1.06 billion , or 3% , greater than our total liabilities as of September 30, 2019 . The increase in total liabilities was comprised of a $694 million increase in bank deposits, primarily due to higher RJBDP balances held at RJ Bank and certificates of deposit issuances during the period, a $524 million increase in brokerage client payables, primarily due to a seasonal increase in client cash held in our CIP as of December 31, 2019 , and a net increase of $401 million in other payables primarily due to operating lease liabilities recorded as a result of the adoption of new guidance related to the accounting for leases. Offsetting these increases was a decrease in accrued compensation, commissions and benefits of $339 million , primarily due to the payment of accrued bonuses during the three months ended December 31, 2019 . 

See Notes 2 and 9 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for further information on our adoption of the new leasing guidance. 

Contractual obligations 

There were no significant changes to the contractual obligations presented in our 2019 Form 10-K, other than in the ordinary course of business, as of December 31, 2019 . See Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding commitments as of December 31, 2019 . 

Regulatory 

Refer to the discussion of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the impact on our operations of certain rules and regulations in Item 1 &#8220;Business - Regulation&#8221; and Item 7 &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Regulatory&#8221; of our 2019 Form 10-K. 

RJF and many of its subsidiaries are each subject to various regulatory capital requirements. As of December 31, 2019 , all of our active regulated domestic and international subsidiaries had net capital in excess of minimum requirements. In addition, RJF and RJ Bank were categorized as &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; as of December 31, 2019 . The maintenance of certain risk-based and other regulatory capital levels could impact various capital allocation decisions impacting one or more of our businesses. However, due to the current capital position of RJF and its regulated subsidiaries, we do not anticipate these capital requirements will have a negative impact on our future business activities. 

See Note 18 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for further information on regulatory capital requirements. 

Critical accounting estimates 

The condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during any reporting period in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Management has established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure the appropriateness of such estimates and assumptions and their consistent application from period to period. For a description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Due to their nature, estimates involve judgment based upon available information. Actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Therefore, understanding these critical accounting estimates is important in understanding our reported results of operations and financial position. We believe that of our accounting estimates and assumptions, those described in the following sections involve a high degree of judgment and complexity. 

Valuation of financial instruments 

The use of fair value to measure financial instruments, with related gains or losses recognized in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income, is fundamental to our financial statements and our risk management processes. See Note 2 of our 2019 Form 10-K for a discussion of our fair value accounting policies regarding financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold but not yet purchased. See Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for additional information on our financial instruments at fair value.

Loss provisions 

Refer to Item 7 &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical accounting estimates - Loss provisions&#8221; of our 2019 Form 10-K for more information. 

Loss provisions for legal and regulatory matters 

The recorded amount of liabilities related to legal and regulatory matters is subject to significant management judgment. For a description of the significant estimates and judgments associated with establishing such accruals, see the &#8220;Contingent liabilities&#8221; section of Note 2 of our 2019 Form 10-K. In addition, refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for information regarding legal and regulatory matter contingencies as of December 31, 2019 . 

Loan loss provisions arising from operations of RJ Bank 

We provide an allowance for loan losses which reflects our continuing evaluation of the probable losses inherent in RJ Bank&#8217;s loan portfolio. See the discussion regarding our methodology in estimating the allowance for loan losses in Note 2 of our 2019 Form 10-K. See Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for additional information on our bank loans. 

At December 31, 2019 , the amortized cost of all RJ Bank loans was $21.51 billion and the allowance for loan losses was $216 million , which was 1.01% of the held for investment loan portfolio. 

Our process of evaluating probable loan losses includes a complex analysis of several quantitative and qualitative factors, requiring management judgment. As a result, the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses. In such an event, any losses in excess of our allowance would result in a decrease in our net income, as well as a decrease in the level of regulatory capital. 

Recent accounting developments 

For information regarding our recent accounting developments, see Note 2 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q. 

Off-balance sheet arrangements 

For information regarding our off-balance sheet arrangements, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our 2019 Form 10-K and Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q. 

Effects of inflation 

Our assets are primarily liquid in nature and are not significantly affected by inflation. However, the rate of inflation affects our expenses, including employee compensation, communications and information processing, and occupancy costs, which may not be readily recoverable through charges for services we provide to our clients. In addition, to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has adverse effects upon the securities markets, it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. 

Risk management 

Risks are an inherent part of our business and activities. Management of these risks is critical to our fiscal soundness and profitability. Our risk management processes are multi-faceted and require communication, judgment and knowledge of financial products and markets. We have a formal Enterprise Risk Management (&#8220;ERM&#8221;) program to assess and review aggregate risks across the firm. Our management takes an active role in the ERM process, which requires specific administrative and business functions to participate in the identification, assessment, monitoring and control of various risks. 

The principal risks related to our business activities are market, credit, liquidity, operational, model, and compliance. 

Governance 

Our Board of Directors oversees the firm&#8217;s management and mitigation of risk, setting a culture that encourages ethical conduct and risk management throughout the firm. Senior management communicates and reinforces this culture through three lines of risk management and a number of senior-level management committees. Our first line of risk management, which includes all of our 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

businesses, owns its risks and is responsible for helping to identify, escalate, and mitigate risks arising from its day-to-day activities. The second line of risk management, which includes the Compliance, Legal, and Risk Management departments, supports and provides guidance, advice, and oversight to client-facing businesses and other first-line risk management functions in identifying and mitigating risk. The second line of risk management also tests and monitors the effectiveness of controls, escalates risks when appropriate, and reports on these risks. The third line of risk management, Internal Audit, independently reviews activities conducted by the previous lines of risk management to assess their management and mitigation of risk, providing additional assurance to the Board of Directors and senior management, with a view toward enhancing our oversight, management, and mitigation of risk. 

Market risk 

Market risk is our risk of loss resulting from the impact of changes in market prices on our trading inventory, derivatives and investment positions. We have exposure to market risk primarily through our broker-dealer trading operations and, to a lesser extent, through our banking operations. See Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management - Market risk&#8221; of our 2019 Form 10-K for a discussion of our market risk, including how we manage such risk. See Notes 3 , 4 and 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for fair value and other information regarding our trading inventories, available-for-sale securities and derivative instruments. 

Interest rate risk 

Trading activities 

We are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our trading inventory (primarily comprised of fixed income instruments) in our Capital Markets segment. We actively manage the interest rate risk arising from our fixed income trading securities through the use of hedging strategies that involve U.S. Treasury securities, futures contracts, liquid spread products and derivatives. 

We monitor the Value-at-Risk (&#8220;VaR&#8221;) for all of our trading portfolios on a daily basis. VaR is an appropriate statistical technique for estimating potential losses in trading portfolios due to typical adverse market movements over a specified time horizon with a suitable confidence level. We apply the Fed&#8217;s Market Risk Rule (&#8220;MRR&#8221;) for the purpose of calculating our capital ratios. The MRR, also known as the &#8220;Risk-Based Capital Guidelines: Market Risk&#8221; rule released by the Fed, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#8220;OCC&#8221;) and FDIC, requires us to calculate VaR for all of our trading portfolios, including fixed income, equity, foreign exchange and derivatives. 

To calculate VaR, we use historical simulation. This approach assumes that historical changes in market conditions, such as in interest rates and equity prices, are representative of future changes. Simulation is based on daily market data for the previous twelve months. VaR is reported at a 99% confidence level for a one-day time horizon. Assuming that future market conditions change as they have in the past twelve months, we would expect to incur losses greater than those predicted by our one-day VaR estimates about once every 100 trading days, or about three times per year on average. For regulatory capital calculation purposes, we also report VaR numbers for a ten-day time horizon. 

The Fed&#8217;s MRR requires us to perform daily back-testing procedures of our VaR model, whereby we compare each day&#8217;s projected VaR to its regulatory-defined daily trading losses, which exclude fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income and intraday trading. Based on these daily &#8220;ex ante&#8221; versus &#8220;ex post &#8221; comparisons, we determine whether the number of times that regulatory-defined daily trading losses exceed VaR is consistent with our expectations at a 99% confidence level. During the three months ended December 31, 2019 , our regulatory-defined daily loss in our trading portfolios did not exceed our predicted VaR. 

The following table sets forth the high, low, period-end and daily average VaR for all of our trading portfolios, including fixed income, equity and derivative instruments, for the period and dates indicated.

The modeling of the risk characteristics of trading positions involves a number of assumptions and approximations. While management believes that these assumptions and approximations are reasonable, there is no uniform industry methodology for estimating VaR, and different assumptions or approximations could produce materially different VaR estimates. As a result, VaR statistics are more reliable when used as indicators of risk levels and trends within a firm than as a basis for inferring differences in risk-taking across firms. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Separately, RJF provides additional market risk disclosures to comply with the MRR. The results of the application of this market risk capital rule are available on our website under https://www.raymondjames.com/investor-relations/financial-information/filings-and-reports within &#8220;Other Reports and Information.&#8221; 

Should markets suddenly become more volatile, actual trading losses may exceed VaR results presented on a single day and might accumulate over a longer time horizon, such as a number of consecutive trading days. Accordingly, management applies additional controls including position limits, a daily review of trading results, review of the status of aged inventory, independent controls on pricing, monitoring of concentration risk, review of issuer ratings and stress testing. We utilize stress testing to complement our VaR analysis so as to measure risk under historical and hypothetical adverse scenarios. During volatile markets, we may choose to pare our trading inventories to reduce risk. 

Banking operations 

RJ Bank maintains an earning asset portfolio that is comprised of cash, C&#38;I loans, tax-exempt loans, commercial and residential real estate loans, SBL and other loans, as well as MBS and CMOs (held in the available-for-sale securities portfolio), Small Business Administration loan securitizations and a trading portfolio of corporate loans. These earning assets are primarily funded by client deposits. Based on its current earning asset portfolio, RJ Bank is subject to interest rate risk. RJ Bank analyzes interest rate risk based on forecasted net interest income, which is the net amount of interest received and interest paid, and the net portfolio valuation, both in a range of interest rate scenarios. 

One of the objectives of RJ Bank&#8217;s Asset Liability Management Committee is to manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates. The methods used to measure this sensitivity are described in Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management - Market risk&#8221; of our 2019 Form 10-K. 

We utilize a hedging strategy using interest rate swaps as a result of RJ Bank&#8217;s asset and liability management process. For further information regarding this hedging strategy, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our 2019 Form 10-K. 

The following table is an analysis of RJ Bank&#8217;s estimated net interest income over a 12 month period based on instantaneous shifts in interest rates (expressed in basis points) using RJ Bank&#8217;s own asset/liability model.

Contractual loan terms for C&#38;I, CRE, CRE construction and residential mortgage loans may include an interest rate floor, cap and/or fixed interest rates for a certain period of time, which would impact the timing of the interest rate reset for the respective loan. See the discussion within the &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management - Credit risk - Risk monitoring process&#8221; section of this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding RJ Bank&#8217;s interest-only residential mortgage loan portfolio. 

In our RJ Bank available-for-sale securities portfolio, we hold primarily fixed-rate agency MBS and CMOs which were carried at fair value on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at December 31, 2019 , with changes in the fair value of the portfolio recorded through OCI in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. At December 31, 2019 , our RJ Bank available-for-sale securities portfolio had a fair value of $3.22 billion with a weighted-average yield of 2.35% and an average expected duration of three years. See Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for additional information on the fair value of these securities. 

Equity price risk 

We are exposed to equity price risk as a result of our capital markets activities. Our broker-dealer activities are primarily client-driven, with the objective of meeting clients&#8217; needs while earning revenues to compensate for the risk associated with carrying inventory. We attempt to reduce the risk of loss inherent in our inventory of equity securities by monitoring those security positions throughout each day and establishing position limits. 

Foreign exchange risk 

We are subject to foreign exchange risk due to our investments in foreign subsidiaries as well as transactions and resulting balances denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. For example, a portion of our bank loan portfolio includes loans which are denominated in Canadian dollars totaling $1.14 billion and $1.10 billion at December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019 , respectively. A portion of such loans are held by RJ Bank&#8217;s Canadian subsidiary, which is discussed in the following sections. 

Investments in foreign subsidiaries 

RJ Bank has an investment in a Canadian subsidiary, resulting in foreign exchange risk. To mitigate its foreign exchange risk, RJ Bank utilizes short-term, forward foreign exchange contracts. These derivatives are primarily accounted for as net investment hedges in the condensed consolidated financial statements. See Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for further information regarding these derivatives. 

We had foreign exchange risk in our investment in RJ Ltd. of CAD 363 million at December 31, 2019 , which was not hedged. Foreign exchange gains/losses related to this investment are primarily reflected in OCI on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. See Note 14 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for further information regarding our components of OCI. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

We also have foreign exchange risk associated with our investments in subsidiaries located in Europe. These investments are not hedged and we do not believe we have material foreign exchange risk either individually, or in the aggregate, pertaining to these subsidiaries. 

Transactions and resulting balances denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar 

We are subject to foreign exchange risk due to our holdings of cash and certain other assets and liabilities resulting from transactions denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. Any currency-related gains/losses arising from these foreign currency denominated balances are reflected in &#8220;Other&#8221; revenues in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The foreign exchange risk associated with a portion of such transactions and balances denominated in foreign currency are mitigated utilizing short-term, forward foreign exchange contracts. Such derivatives are not designated hedges and therefore, the related gains/losses associated with these contracts are included in &#8220;Other&#8221; revenues in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. See Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for information regarding our derivatives. 

Credit risk 

Credit risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in a borrower&#8217;s, issuer&#8217;s or counterparty&#8217;s ability to meet its financial obligations under contractual or agreed upon terms. The nature and amount of credit risk depends on the type of transaction, the structure and duration of that transaction, and the parties involved. Credit risk is an integral component of the profit assessment of lending and other financing activities. See further discussion of our credit risk, including how we manage such risk, in Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management - Credit risk&#8221; of our 2019 Form 10-K. 

RJ Bank has a substantial loan portfolio. A significant downturn in the overall economy, deterioration in real estate values or a significant issue within any sector or sectors where RJ Bank has a concentration could result in large provisions for loan losses and/or charge-offs. 

Our allowance for loan losses is regularly evaluated with adjustments made on a quarterly basis. Several factors were taken into consideration in evaluating the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2019 , including the risk profile of the portfolios, net charge-offs during the period, the level of nonperforming loans and delinquency ratios. RJ Bank also considered the uncertainty related to certain industry sectors and the extent of credit exposure to specific borrowers within the portfolio. Finally, RJ Bank considered current economic conditions and other factors that might impact the portfolio. RJ Bank determined the allowance that was required for specific loan grades based on relative risk characteristics of the loan portfolio. On an ongoing basis, RJ Bank evaluates its methods for determining the allowance for each class of loans and makes enhancements it considers appropriate. There was no material change in RJ Bank&#8217;s methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses during the three months ended December 31, 2019 . 

RJ Bank&#8217;s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of bank loans outstanding was 1.01% and 1.04% at December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019 , respectively. See Note 7 in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for detail on the changes in RJ Bank&#8217;s allowance for loan losses. 

The loan loss benefit for the three months ended December 31, 2019 was $2 million compared to a loan loss provision of $16 million for the prior year quarter. See further explanation of the loan loss provision increase in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - RJ Bank&#8221; of this Form 10-Q. 

The level of charge-off activity is a factor that is considered in evaluating the potential for severity of future credit losses. The following table presents net loan (charge-offs)/recoveries and the percentage of net loan (charge-offs)/recoveries to the average outstanding loan balances by loan portfolio segment.

Included in nonperforming residential mortgage loans were $9 million in loans for which $4 million in charge-offs were previously recorded, resulting in less exposure within the remaining balance. See Note 7 in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for loan categories as a percentage of total loans receivable. 

The nonperforming loan balances in the preceding table exclude $11 million and $12 million as of December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019 , respectively, of residential TDRs which were returned to accrual status in accordance with our policy. Total nonperforming assets, including other real estate acquired in the settlement of residential mortgages, amounted to $41 million and $46 million at December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019 , respectively. Total nonperforming assets as a percentage of RJ Bank total assets was 0.16% and 0.18% at December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019 , respectively. 

Loan underwriting policies 

RJ Bank&#8217;s underwriting policies for the major types of loans are described in Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management - Credit risk&#8221; of our 2019 Form 10-K. There were no material changes in RJ Bank&#8217;s underwriting policies during the three months ended December 31, 2019 .

Another component of credit risk strategy at RJ Bank is the ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all residential, SBL, corporate and tax-exempt credit exposures, as well as our rigorous processes to manage and limit credit losses arising from loan delinquencies. There are various other factors included in these processes, depending on the loan portfolio. There were no material changes to those processes and policies during the three months ended December 31, 2019 . 

Residential mortgage and SBL and other loan portfolios 

The collateral securing RJ Bank&#8217;s SBL and other portfolio is monitored on a recurring basis, with marketable collateral monitored on a daily basis. Collateral adjustments are made by the borrower as necessary to ensure RJ Bank&#8217;s loans are adequately secured, resulting in minimizing its credit risk. Collateral calls have been minimal relative to our SBL and other portfolio with no losses incurred to date. 

We track and review many factors to monitor credit risk in RJ Bank&#8217;s residential mortgage loan portfolio. The factors include, but are not limited to: loan performance trends, loan product parameters and qualification requirements, borrower credit scores, level of documentation, loan purpose, geographic concentrations, average loan size and LTV ratios. These measures, while considered and reviewed in establishing the allowance for loan losses, have not resulted in any material adjustments to RJ Bank&#8217;s historical loss rates.

Our December 31, 2019 percentage continues to compare favorably to the national average for over 30 day delinquencies of 2.64% , as most recently reported by the Fed. 

Credit risk is also managed by diversifying the residential mortgage portfolio. The following table details the geographic concentrations (top five states) of RJ Bank&#8217;s one-to-four family residential mortgage loans.

Loans where borrowers may be subject to payment increases include adjustable rate mortgage loans with terms that initially require payment of interest only. Payments may increase significantly when the interest-only period ends and the loan principal begins to amortize. At December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019 , these loans totaled $1.40 billion and $1.29 billion , respectively, or approximately 30% of the residential mortgage portfolio as of each of these dates. The weighted average number of years before the remainder of the loans, which were still in their interest-only period at December 31, 2019 , begins amortizing is 6.2 years. 

A component of credit risk management for the residential portfolio is the LTV ratio and borrower credit score at origination or purchase. The most recent weighted-average LTV ratios and FICO scores at origination of RJ Bank&#8217;s residential first mortgage loan portfolio were 64% and 765 , respectively. 

Corporate and tax-exempt loans 

Credit risk in RJ Bank&#8217;s corporate and tax-exempt loan portfolios is monitored on an individual loan basis. The majority of RJ Bank&#8217;s tax-exempt loan portfolio is comprised of loans to investment-grade borrowers. 

Credit risk is managed by diversifying the corporate loan portfolio. RJ Bank&#8217;s corporate loan portfolio does not contain a significant concentration in any single industry. The following table details the industry concentrations (top five categories) of RJ Bank&#8217;s corporate loans.

As more fully described in the discussion of our business technology risks included in various risk factors presented in Item 1A &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; of our 2019 Form 10-K, despite our implementation of protective measures and endeavoring to modify them as circumstances warrant, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to human error, natural disasters, power loss, cyberattacks and other information security breaches, and other events that could have an impact on the security and stability of our operations. To-date, we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyberattacks or other information security breaches; however, there can be no assurances that we will not suffer such losses in the future. 

Model risk 

Model risk refers to the possibility of unintended business outcomes arising from the design, implementation or use of models. See Item 7 &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management - Model risk&#8221; of our 2019 Form 10-K for information regarding how we utilize models throughout the firm and how we manage model risk.
