Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Factors affecting &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; 

Certain statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may constitute &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include information concerning future strategic objectives, business prospects, anticipated savings, financial results (including expenses, earnings, liquidity, cash flow and capital expenditures), industry or market conditions, demand for and pricing of our products, acquisitions and divestitures, anticipated results of litigation, our effective tax rate, regulatory developments, effects of accounting pronouncements, and general economic conditions. In addition, words such as &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; and future or conditional verbs such as &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; and &#8220;would,&#8221; as well as any other statement that necessarily depends on future events, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and they involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Although we make such statements based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. We caution investors not to rely unduly on any forward-looking statements and urge you to carefully consider the risks described in our filings with the SEC from time to time, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, which are available at www.raymondjames.com and the SEC&#8217;s website at www.sec.gov. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statement in the event it later turns out to be inaccurate, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 

Introduction 

The following Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;) is intended to help the reader understand the results of our operations and financial condition. This MD&#38;A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to condensed consolidated financial statements. Where &#8220;NM&#8221; is used in various percentage change computations, the computed percentage change has been determined to be not meaningful. 

We operate as a financial holding company and bank holding company. Results in the businesses in which we operate are highly correlated to general economic conditions and, more specifically, to the direction of the U.S. equity and fixed income markets, changes in interest rates, market volatility, corporate and mortgage lending markets and commercial and residential credit trends. Overall market conditions, economic, political and regulatory trends, and industry competition are among the factors which could affect us and which are unpredictable and beyond our control. These factors affect the financial decisions made by market participants, including investors, borrowers, and competitors, impacting their level of participation in the financial markets. These factors also impact the level of investment banking activity and asset valuations, which ultimately affect our business results. 

Executive overview 

Quarter ended March 31, 2020 compared with the quarter ended March 31, 2019 

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency due to the impact of the pandemic. As a result of the spread of COVID-19, governments and other authorities around the world have imposed measures intended to control the spread of the disease, including restrictions on travel and the conduct of business, such as stay-at-home orders, quarantines, travel bans, border closings, business closures and other similar measures. In response, we activated our business continuity plan endeavoring to safeguard our employees, with nearly all of our employees now working remotely, while still maintaining our standard of client service. Our systems and infrastructure have continued to support the increased volumes of activity, without any significant operational or technology disruptions. 

The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on our business during our quarter ended March 31, 2020 , as the spread of the disease and measures intended to prevent its spread have caused significant volatility and disruption in the financial markets both globally and in the U.S. We expect the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to prevent its spread to have a more significant impact on the remainder of fiscal 2020 than it did during the quarter ended March 31, 2020 , although the extent of such effects will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

During the quarter ended March 31, 2020 , net revenues of $2.07 billion increased $209 million , or 11% , compared with the prior-year quarter. Pre-tax income of $239 million decreased $108 million , or 31% , and net income of $169 million decreased $92 million , or 35% , both primarily due to a significant increase in the bank loan loss provision in response to the rapid and widespread economic deterioration caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our earnings per diluted share were $1.20 , reflecting a 34% decrease . Our annualized return on equity (&#8220;ROE&#8221;) for the quarter was 9.9% , compared with 16.7% in the prior-year quarter, and our annualized return on tangible common equity (&#8220;ROTCE&#8221;) (1) was 10.8% , compared with 18.5% for the prior-year quarter. 

The $209 million increase in net revenues compared with the prior-year quarter primarily reflected higher asset management and related administrative fees, attributable to higher PCG assets in fee-based accounts at the beginning of the quarter, which were 31% higher than fee-based assets as of the beginning of the prior-year quarter. Brokerage revenues also increased during the quarter as the significant market volatility in March drove an increase in client activity. Offsetting these increases, other revenues were negatively impacted by valuation losses on private equity investments, a portion of which was attributable to noncontrolling interests, which was reflected as an offset in other expenses. RJBDP fees and net interest income were negatively impacted by lower short-term interest rates. 

Compensation, commissions and benefits expense increased $197 million , or 16% , due to an increase in compensable net revenues, which primarily include asset management and related administrative fees, brokerage revenues, and investment banking revenues, as well as increased staffing levels required to support our continued growth and regulatory compliance requirements. 

Non-compensation expenses increased $120 million , or 42% , primarily due to the aforementioned bank loan loss provision of $109 million . 

Pursuant to our Board of Directors&#8217; share repurchase authorization, we repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares of common stock during the quarter for $202 million at an average price of approximately $79 per share. Due to the heightened market uncertainty as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, share buybacks have been suspended since mid-March and, as of March 31, 2020 , we had $537 million of availability remaining under this authorization. 

The firm ended the quarter with capital ratios well in excess of regulatory requirements and substantial liquidity, with nearly $2 billion (2) of cash at the parent company, which included the proceeds of a $500 million 10-year senior notes issuance in March. 

Certain of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will affect our results in future quarters to a greater extent than in the second fiscal quarter. Equity market declines toward the end of the quarter drove a 14% decline in fee-based assets and a 15% decline in financial assets under management as of March 31, 2020 , which will negatively impact asset management and related administrative fees in our PCG and Asset Management segments in our third fiscal quarter of 2020. Our net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks will be negatively affected by the full impact of the 150 basis point reduction in March by the Federal Reserve in its benchmark short-term interest rate. In Capital Markets, while our investment banking pipeline remains healthy, it is likely that we will experience a near-term slowdown in mergers &#38; acquisitions and underwriting activity due to market uncertainty. In addition, if market volatility declines, it is likely that brokerage revenues will decline compared with the second fiscal quarter of 2020. While our results during the second quarter were negatively impacted by the bank loan loss provision and private equity valuation losses, further market deterioration could result in additional provisions and losses in future quarters. 

A summary of our financial results by segment as compared to the prior-year quarter is as follows: 

&#8226; 

Our PCG segment net revenues of $1.50 billion increased 18% , while pre-tax income of $170 million increased 29% . The increase in net revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in asset management and related administrative fees due to higher assets in fee-based accounts at the beginning of the quarter, as well as an increase in brokerage revenues due to strong client activity driven by market volatility toward the end of the quarter. Non-interest expenses increased $186 million , or 16% , primarily resulting from an increase in compensation expenses due to the growth in compensable net revenues and higher staffing levels to support our continued growth and regulatory compliance requirements. 

&#8226; 

Capital Markets net revenues of $290 million increased 5% and pre-tax income of $28 million decreased 32% . The increase in net revenues was primarily due to an increase in brokerage revenues due to higher client activity as a result of market volatility, as well as an increase in equity underwriting revenues. These increases were partially offset by a decline in merger

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

&#38; acquisition revenues compared with a strong prior-year quarter. Non-interest expenses increased $26 million , or 11% , primarily resulting from an increase in compensation expense, primarily due to the mix of revenues. 

&#8226; 

Our Asset Management segment net revenues of $184 million increased 14% and pre-tax income of $73 million increased 33% . The increase in net revenues was driven by higher average financial assets under management, as well as higher beginning assets in programs for which the segment provides administrative support. 

&#8226; 

RJ Bank net revenues of $210 million decreased 1% and pre-tax income of $14 million decreased 90% . Net revenues were essentially flat as higher interest-earning banking assets offset the negative impact from lower short-term interest rates. Non-interest expenses increased $120 million , or 158% , as RJ Bank recorded a loan loss provision of $109 million compared to $5 million in the prior-year quarter, in response to the impact of COVID-19. 

&#8226; 

Our Other segment reflected a pre-tax loss that was $29 million larger compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily the result of private equity valuation losses in the current-year quarter compared with gains of in the prior-year quarter. 

Six months ended March 31, 2020 compared with the six months ended March 31, 2019 

Net revenues of $4.08 billion increased $287 million , or 8% . Pre-tax income of $598 million decreased $81 million , or 12% . Our net income of $437 million decreased $73 million , or 14% , and our earnings per diluted share were $3.09 , reflecting a 12% decrease . Our annualized ROE during the six months ended March 31, 2020 was 13.0% , compared with 16.2% for the prior-year period, and annualized ROTCE (1) was 14.2% , compared with 17.9% for the prior-year period. 

The $287 million increase in net revenues compared with the prior-year period reflects higher asset management and related administrative fees, primarily attributable to higher PCG assets in fee-based accounts at the beginning of the current-year periods. Brokerage revenues also increased, primarily due to higher market volatility in our second fiscal quarter. Offsetting these increases, other revenues were negatively impacted by valuation losses on private equity investments, a portion of which was attributable to noncontrolling interests, which was reflected as an offset in other expenses. RJBDP fees and net interest income were negatively impacted due to lower short-term interest rates. 

Compensation, commissions and benefits expense increased $283 million , or 11% , due to an increase in compensable net revenues, as well as increased staffing levels required to support our continued growth and regulatory compliance requirements. 

Non-compensation expenses increased $85 million , or 14% , primarily due to a $107 million bank loan loss provision compared with a $21 million bank loan loss provision for the prior-year period, partially offset by the $15 million loss on the sale of our operations related to research, sales and trading of European equities that occurred in the prior-year period. 

Our effective income tax rate was 26.9% for the six months ended March 31, 2020 , an increase compared with the 24.8% effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 , primarily due to the unfavorable impact in the current-year period of non-deductible valuation losses associated with our company-owned life insurance policies. 

Pursuant to our Board of Directors&#8217; share repurchase authorization, we repurchased approximately 2.7 million shares of common stock during the six months ended March 31, 2020 for $213 million at an average price of approximately $80 per share. 

A summary of our financial results by segment as compared to the prior-year period is as follows: 

&#8226; 

PCG segment net revenues of $2.91 billion increased 11% , while pre-tax income of $323 million increased 9% . The increase in net revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in asset management and related administrative fees due to higher assets in fee-based accounts at the beginning of the current-year periods, as well as an increase in brokerage revenues due to strong client activity driven by market volatility in our second fiscal quarter. Offsetting these increases were decreases in RJBDP fees from third-party banks and net interest income due to lower short-term interest rates. Non-interest expenses increased $255 million , or 11% , primarily resulting from an increase in compensation expenses due to the growth in compensable net revenues and higher staffing levels to support our continued growth and regulatory compliance requirements. 

&#8226; 

Capital Markets net revenues of $558 million increased 5% and pre-tax income of $57 million increased 8% . The increase in net revenues was primarily due to an increase in fixed income brokerage revenues, due to higher client activity driven by market volatility, as well as an increase in equity and debt underwriting revenues. These increases were partially offset by a decline in merger &#38; acquisition and advisory revenues. Non-interest expenses increased 5% , due to higher compensation

expenses, as a result of the increase in revenues, and higher business development expenses, professional fees and other expenses. These increases were partially offset by the aforementioned $15 million loss on the sale of our operations related to research, sales and trading of European equities in the prior-year period. 

&#8226; 

Our Asset Management segment net revenues of $368 million increased 10% and pre-tax income of $146 million increased 23% . The increase in net revenues was driven by higher average financial assets under management, as well as higher assets at the beginning of each of the current-year quarters in programs for which the segment provides administrative support. 

&#8226; 

RJ Bank net revenues of $426 million increased 3% and pre-tax income of $149 million decreased 39% . The increase in net revenues reflected higher net interest income due to growth in interest-earning assets, which more than offset the lower net interest margin caused by lower short-term interest rates. Non-interest expenses increased $108 million , or 64% , due to an $86 million increase in the loan loss provision, as well as an increase in fees for RJBDP paid to PCG. 

&#8226; 

Our Other segment reflected a pre-tax loss that was $42 million larger compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to private equity valuation losses, as compared to gains in the prior-year period, and lower interest income on corporate cash balances due to lower short-term interest rates. 

Segments 

We currently operate through five segments. Our business segments are PCG, Capital Markets, Asset Management and RJ Bank. Our Other segment includes our private equity investments, interest income on certain corporate cash balances, and certain corporate overhead costs of RJF, including the interest costs on our public debt. 

The following table presents our consolidated and segment net revenues and pre-tax income/(loss) for the periods indicated.

Reconciliation of GAAP measures to non-GAAP financial measures 

We utilize certain non-GAAP financial measures to aid in, and enhance, the understanding of our financial results and related measures. These non-GAAP financial measures have been separately identified in this document. We believe that annualized return on tangible common equity is meaningful to investors as this measure facilitates comparison of our results to the results of other companies. This non-GAAP financial measure should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies. The following table provides a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for the periods indicated.

Return on equity is computed by dividing annualized net income for the period indicated by average equity for each respective period or, in the case of return on tangible common equity, computed by dividing annualized net income by average tangible common equity for each respective period. 

Average equity for the quarter-to-date period is computed by adding the total equity attributable to Raymond James Financial, Inc. as of the date indicated to the prior quarter-end total, and dividing by two, or in the case of average tangible common equity, computed by adding tangible common equity as of the date indicated to the prior quarter-end total, and dividing by two. Average equity for the year-to-date period is computed by adding the total equity attributable to Raymond James Financial, Inc. as of each quarter-end date during the indicated year-to-date period to the beginning of the year total, and dividing by three, or in the case of average tangible common equity, computed by adding tangible common equity as of each quarter-end date during the indicated year-to-date period to the beginning of the year total, and dividing by three. 

Net interest analysis 

In response to macroeconomic concerns resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, The Federal Reserve decreased its benchmark short-term interest rate twice toward the end of our second fiscal quarter to a range of 0-0.25%, for a total decrease of 150 basis points during the quarter. These decreases in short-term interest rates, as well as the three rate cuts implemented in 2019 (225 basis points in total) have had a negative impact on our fiscal year 2020 results, as we have certain assets and liabilities, primarily held in our PCG, RJ Bank and Other segments, which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Fees we earn from third-party banks on client cash balances swept to such banks as part of the RJBDP are also sensitive to changes in interest rates. As the interest rate decreases during our second fiscal quarter occurred in March, we expect that these decreases will have a more significant negative impact on our results for the remainder of fiscal 2020. In addition, during the second fiscal quarter of 2020 we issued $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.65% senior notes. While this issuance strengthened our liquidity position, it will also increase our interest expense in future periods. 

Given the relationship between our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities held in each of these segments and the nature of fees we earn from third-party banks on the RJBDP, decreases in short-term interest rates generally result in an overall decrease in our net earnings, although the magnitude of the impact to our net interest margin depends on the yields on interest-earning assets relative to the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, including deposit rates paid to clients on their cash balances. Conversely, any increases in short-term interest rates and/or decreases in the deposit rates paid to clients generally have a positive impact on our earnings. 

Refer to the discussion of the specific components of our net interest income within the &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations&#8221; of our PCG, RJ Bank, and Other segments. Also refer to &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations - Private Client Group - Clients&#8217; domestic cash sweep balances&#8221; for further information on the RJBDP.

A portion of our &#8220;Assets in fee-based accounts&#8221; is invested in &#8220;managed programs&#8221; overseen by our Asset Management segment, specifically our Asset Management Services division of RJ&#38;A (&#8220;AMS&#8221;). These assets are included in our Financial assets under management as disclosed in the &#8220;Selected key metrics&#8221; section of our &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations - Asset Management.&#8221; 

Fee-based accounts within our PCG segment are comprised of a wide array of products and programs that we offer our clients. The majority of assets in fee-based accounts within our PCG segment are invested in programs for which our financial advisors provide investment advisory services, either on a discretionary or non-discretionary basis. Administrative services for such accounts (e.g., record-keeping) are generally performed by our Asset Management segment and, as a result, a portion of the related revenues is shared with the Asset Management segment. 

We also offer our clients fee-based accounts that are invested in &#8220;managed programs&#8221; overseen by AMS, which is part of our Asset Management segment. Fee-billable assets invested in managed programs are included in both &#8220;Assets in fee-based accounts&#8221; in the preceding table and &#8220;Financial assets under management&#8221; in the Asset Management segment. Revenues related to managed programs are shared by our PCG and Asset Management segments. The Asset Management segment receives a higher portion of the revenues related to accounts invested in managed programs, as compared to the portion received for non-managed programs, as it is performing portfolio management services in addition to administrative services. 

The vast majority of the revenues we earn from fee-based accounts are recorded in &#8220;Asset management and related administrative fees&#8221; on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Fees received from such accounts are based on the value of client assets in fee-based accounts and vary based on the specific account types in which the client participates and the level of assets in the client relationship. As fees for substantially all of such accounts are billed based on balances as of the beginning of the quarter, revenues from fee-based accounts may not be immediately affected by changes in asset values, but rather the impacts are seen in the following quarter. 

Despite the net addition of financial advisors in the current quarter, PCG assets under administration decreased due to the decline in equity markets as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. PCG assets in fee-based accounts continued to increase as a percentage of overall PCG assets under administration due to clients&#8217; preference for fee-based alternatives versus transaction-based accounts. As a result of the shift to fee-based accounts over the past several years, a larger portion of our PCG revenues are more directly impacted by market movements. Therefore, further declines in equity markets would negatively affect our PCG revenues.

The number of financial advisors increased primarily due to continued financial advisor recruiting and high levels of retention. The impact of COVID-19 on future recruiting is uncertain; however, we are likely to see a slowdown in recruiting until travel restrictions and other social distancing measures subside.

A significant portion of our clients&#8217; cash is included in the RJBDP, a multi-bank sweep program in which clients&#8217; cash deposits in their accounts are swept into interest-bearing deposit accounts at RJ Bank and various third-party banks. We earn servicing fees for the administrative services we provide related to our clients&#8217; deposits that are swept to such banks as part of the RJBDP. The amounts from third-party banks are variable in nature and fluctuate based on client cash balances in the program, as well as the level of short-term interest rates and the interest paid to clients by the third-party banks on balances in the RJBDP. The &#8220;Average yield on RJBDP - third party banks&#8221; in the preceding table is computed by dividing annualized RJBDP fees from third-party banks, which are net of the interest expense paid to clients by the third-party banks, by the average daily RJBDP balance at third-party banks. The PCG segment also earns RJBDP servicing fees from RJ Bank, which are based on the number of accounts that are swept to RJ Bank. The fees from RJ Bank are eliminated in consolidation. 

RJBDP fees from third-party banks and the average yield on RJBDP (third-party banks) were negatively impacted by the significant decrease in short-term interest rates. The Federal Reserve decreased its benchmark short-term interest rate twice toward the end of our second fiscal quarter, to a range of 0-0.25%, a total decrease of 150 basis points. These decreases were in addition to the three rate cuts implemented in 2019 (225 basis points in total). As the interest rate decreases during our second fiscal quarter of 2020 occurred in March, we expect that our average yield on RJBDP (third-party banks) will decrease to approximately 0.30% beginning with our third fiscal quarter. Any additional decreases in short-term interest rates, increases in deposit rates paid to clients, and/or a significant decline in our clients&#8217; cash balances will likely have a negative impact on our earnings. Further, PCG segment results are impacted by changes in the allocation of client cash balances in the RJBDP between RJ Bank and third-party banks. 

Money market funds were discontinued as a sweep option in June 2019. Balances in those funds were converted to the RJBDP or reinvested by the client. 

The significant increase in clients&#8217; cash balances as of March 31, 2020 was a result of the market volatility and the steep declines in the equity markets during the second fiscal quarter of 2020. 

Quarter ended March 31, 2020 compared with the quarter ended March 31, 2019 

Net revenues of $1.50 billion increased $224 million , or 18% , and pre-tax income of $170 million increased $38 million , or 29% . 

Asset management and related administrative fees increased $195 million , or 31% , due to higher asset balances in fee-based accounts at the beginning of the quarter. As assets in fee-based accounts are billed primarily on balances at the beginning of the quarter, the 14% decline in fee-based assets during the current quarter will negatively impact asset management fees in our third fiscal quarter. 

Brokerage revenues increased $46 million , or 14% , primarily due to strong client activity driven by market volatility toward the end of the quarter as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Account and service fees decreased $9 million , or 4% , due to the decline in RJBDP fees from third-party banks, primarily driven by lower short-term interest rates compared with the prior-year quarter. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in RJBDP fees from RJ Bank, due to an increase in the number of accounts, and increases in mutual fund service fees and client account and other fees, primarily due to higher average assets and activity during the quarter. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Net interest income decreased $9 million , or 19% , driven by a decrease in interest income from client margin loans and assets segregated pursuant to regulations due to a decline in short-term interest rates. Partially offsetting the decrease in interest income, interest expense also decreased due to the impact of lower deposit rates paid on client cash balances in CIP. 

Compensation-related expenses increased $176 million , or 18% , due to higher compensable net revenues, as well as increased staffing levels over the prior-year quarter to support our continued growth and regulatory compliance requirements. 

Non-compensation expenses increased $10 million , or 6% , primarily due to increased costs to support our growth, as well as higher legal reserves. 

Six months ended March 31, 2020 compared with the six months ended March 31, 2019 

Net revenues of $2.91 billion increased $282 million , or 11% , and pre-tax income of $323 million increased $27 million , or 9% . 

Asset management and related administrative fees increased $270 million , or 20% , primarily due to higher assets in fee-based accounts at the beginning of the current-year periods. 

Brokerage revenues increased $29 million , or 4% , primarily due to strong client activity driven by market volatility toward the end of our second fiscal quarter. Partially offsetting this increase was a decline in mutual fund trails, which were impacted by the conversion of client assets into mutual fund share classes which pay lower rates, and the continued shift to fee-based accounts. 

Account and service fees decreased $10 million , or 2% , driven by a decline in RJBDP fees from third-party banks, as a result of lower short-term interest rates. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in mutual fund service fees, primarily due to higher assets, and higher RJBDP fees from RJ Bank due to an increase in the number of accounts at RJ Bank. 

Net interest income decreased $14 million , or 15% , driven by a decrease in interest income from assets segregated pursuant to regulations, due a decline in short-term interest rates, and a decrease in interest income from client margin loans, due to the decline in short-term interest rates and a decline in average balances. Partially offsetting the decrease in interest income, interest expense also decreased due to the impact of lower deposit rates paid on client cash balances in CIP. 

Compensation-related expenses increased $248 million , or 12% , due to higher compensable net revenues, as well as increased staffing levels in the current year to support our continued growth and regulatory compliance requirements. 

Non-compensation expenses increased $7 million , or 2% , primarily due to increased costs to support our growth.

Quarter ended March 31, 2020 compared with the quarter ended March 31, 2019 

Net revenues of $290 million increased $13 million , or 5% , and pre-tax income of $28 million decreased $13 million , or 32% . 

Brokerage revenues increased $27 million , or 26% , due to an increase in both fixed income and equity brokerage revenues. The increase in brokerage revenues reflected an increase in client activity during the current-year quarter resulting from market volatility, partially offset by losses of approximately $6 million on our trading inventory, both due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We reduced our trading inventory toward the end of the quarter to reduce our risk. 

Investment banking revenues decreased $19 million, or 12%, due to a decrease in the number of completed merger &#38; acquisition transactions compared with a strong prior-year quarter. Partially offsetting the decrease in mergers &#38; acquisitions was an increase in equity underwriting revenues primarily due to an increase in activity compared with a difficult prior-year quarter, which was negatively impacted by the U.S. government shutdown during that period. While investment banking results during the second fiscal quarter were solid, merger &#38; acquisition and underwriting activity may be negatively impacted in future quarters if market uncertainty continues. 

Compensation-related expenses increased $16 million , or 10% , primarily due to the mix of revenues, as revenues with higher payout percentages increased, while revenues with lower payout percentages declined. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Non-compensation expenses increased $10 million , or 15% , reflecting increases in professional fees and business development costs, primarily related to the increase in underwriting revenues, as well as an increase in other expenses. 

Six months ended March 31, 2020 compared with the six months ended March 31, 2019 

Net revenues of $558 million increased $28 million , or 5% , and pre-tax income of $57 million increased $4 million , or 8% . 

Brokerage revenues increased $43 million , or 21% , due to an increase in fixed income brokerage revenues. The increase in fixed income brokerage revenues was primarily due to an increase in client activity during the current-year period, largely a result of higher market volatility, particularly toward the end of our second fiscal quarter. Equity brokerage revenues were challenged earlier in the year, but increased during our second fiscal quarter due to strong client activity driven by market volatility as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Investment banking revenues decreased $18 million, or 6% due to a significant decline in merger &#38; acquisition activity compared with a strong first half of fiscal 2019. Offsetting the decrease was an increase in both equity underwriting and debt underwriting net revenues, with an increase in the number of deals, as well as larger individual transactions. 

Compensation-related expenses increased $24 million , or 7% , primarily due to the increase in revenues. 

Non-compensation expenses were unchanged compared with the prior-year period, as increases in business development, professional fees and other expenses were offset by a loss in the prior-year period of $15 million associated with the sale of our operations related to research, sales and trading of European equities.

Selected key metrics 

Managed programs 

Management fees recorded in our Asset Management segment are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of our fee-billable financial assets under management (&#8220;AUM&#8221;). These AUM include the portion of fee-based AUA in our PCG segment that is invested in programs overseen by our Asset Management segment (included in the &#8220;AMS&#8221; line of the following table), as well as retail accounts 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

managed on behalf of third-party institutions, institutional accounts and proprietary mutual funds that we manage (collectively included in the &#8220;Carillon Tower Advisers&#8221; line of the following table). 

Revenues related to fee-based AUA in our PCG segment are shared by the PCG and Asset Management segments, the amount of which depends on whether clients are invested in assets that are in managed programs overseen by our Asset Management segment and the administrative services provided (see our &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations - Private Client Group&#8221; for more information). Our AUM in AMS are impacted by market fluctuations and net inflows or outflows of assets, including transfers between fee-based accounts and transaction-based accounts within our PCG segment. 

Revenues earned by Carillon Tower Advisers for retail accounts managed on behalf of third-party institutions, institutional accounts and our proprietary mutual funds are recorded entirely in the Asset Management segment. Our AUM in Carillon Tower Advisers are impacted by market and investment performance and net inflows or outflows of assets. 

Fees are generally collected quarterly. Approximately 65% of these fees are based on balances as of the beginning of the quarter, approximately 10% are based on balances as of the end of the quarter, and approximately 25% are based on average daily balances throughout the quarter.

The preceding table includes assets held in certain non-discretionary asset-based programs for which the Asset Management segment does not exercise discretion but provides administrative support (including for affiliated entities). The increase in assets over the prior-year level was primarily due to clients moving to fee-based accounts from transaction-based accounts and successful financial advisor recruiting. The decrease in assets during our second fiscal quarter was due to the decline in equity markets toward the end of our second fiscal quarter due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As administrative fees associated with these programs are predominantly based on balances at the beginning of the quarter, the 14% decline in assets during the quarter will negatively impact our third fiscal quarter revenues.

The preceding table includes assets held in asset-based programs in RJ Trust (including those managed for affiliated entities). 

Quarter ended March 31, 2020 compared with the quarter ended March 31, 2019 

Net revenues of $184 million increased $22 million , or 14% , and pre-tax income of $73 million increased $18 million , or 33% . 

Asset management and related administrative fee revenues increased $28 million , or 19% , driven by higher average financial assets under management and higher beginning assets in non-discretionary asset-based programs. Although financial assets under management and assets in non-discretionary asset-based programs at the end of the quarter were lower than the end of the prior-year quarter, revenues increased as the majority of assets in these programs are billed based on balances as of the beginning of the quarter. The decline in these assets as of March 31, 2020, primarily due to the negative market impact of the COVID-19 pandemic toward the end of the quarter, will negatively affect our third fiscal quarter results. 

Non-compensation expenses increased $4 million , or 6% , due to an increase in investment sub-advisory fees resulting from an increase in assets under management in sub-advised programs. 

Six months ended March 31, 2020 compared with the six months ended March 31, 2019 

Net revenues of $368 million increased $32 million , or 10% , and pre-tax income of $146 million increased $27 million , or 23% . 

Asset management and related administrative fees increased $43 million , or 14% , driven by higher average financial assets under management and higher beginning assets in non-discretionary asset-based programs. Although financial assets under management and assets in non-discretionary asset-based programs at the end of the period were lower than the end of the prior-year period, revenues increased as the majority of assets in these programs are billed based on balances as of the beginning of each quarter. 

Non-compensation expenses increased $3 million , or 2% , primarily due to an increase in investment sub-advisory fees resulting from an increase in assets under management in sub-advised programs.

Quarter ended March 31, 2020 compared with the quarter ended March 31, 2019 

Net revenues of $210 million decreased $2 million , or 1% , and pre-tax income of $14 million decreased $122 million , or 90% , primarily due to a higher bank loan loss provision. 

Net interest income was flat as the impacts of higher interest-earning banking assets offset the negative impact from lower short-term interest rates. The increase in average interest-earning banking assets was driven by growth in average loans of $1.42 billion , average cash balances of $661 million, and average available-for-sale portfolio of $567 million . The net interest margin decreased to 3.02% from 3.35% due to the decline in short-term interest rates. As the most recent rate cuts implemented by the Federal Reserve did not occur until late in our second fiscal quarter, we expect this decline to have a more significant impact on our net interest income and net interest margin in the third fiscal quarter. In addition, most of RJ Bank&#8217;s assets are priced based on LIBOR. Based on current LIBOR rates, we expect our net interest margin to decline to approximately 2.5% over the next two quarters. 

The loan loss provision was $109 million compared to $5 million in the prior-year quarter. The increase in the provision in the current-year quarter was in response to the rapid and widespread economic deterioration caused by COVID-19. Continued deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses in the future or to experience loan losses in excess of current reserves. 

Compensation and benefits expenses increased $1 million , or 8%, due increased staffing levels to support our continued growth. 

Non-compensation expenses (excluding the provision for loan losses) increased $15 million . The increase in non-compensation expenses included a $6 million , or 14% , increase in fees for RJBDP paid to PCG, primarily driven by an increase in the number of accounts, and an increase in FDIC insurance premiums due to the increase in deposit balances. RJBDP fees paid to PCG are eliminated in consolidation.

Nonaccrual loans are included in the average loan balances in the preceding table. Any payments received for corporate nonaccrual loans are applied entirely to principal. Interest income on residential mortgage nonaccrual loans is recognized on a cash basis. 

Fee income on bank loans included in interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 was $5 million and $6 million , respectively. 

The yield on tax-exempt loans in the preceding table is presented on a tax-equivalent basis utilizing the applicable federal statutory tax rates for each of the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 . 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. The following table shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities. The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous period&#8217;s average yield/cost. Similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average yield/cost by the previous year&#8217;s volume. Changes attributable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately.

Six months ended March 31, 2020 compared with the six months ended March 31, 2019 

Net revenues of $426 million increased $11 million , or 3% , and pre-tax income of $149 million decreased $97 million , or 39% . 

Net interest income increased $13 million , or 3% , as higher interest-earning banking assets offset the negative impact from lower short-term interest rates. The increase in average interest-earning banking assets was primarily driven by growth in average loans of $1.38 billion and a $469 million increase in our average available-for-sale securities portfolio. The net interest margin decreased to 3.12% from 3.30% . 

The loan loss provision was $107 million , compared to $21 million in the prior-year period. The increase in the provision in the current-year period was primarily attributable to the economic impacts of COVID-19 during the second fiscal quarter. 

Compensation and benefits expenses increased $2 million due increased staffing levels to support our continued growth. 

Non-compensation expenses (excluding the provision for loan losses) increased $20 million , including a $12 million , or 14% , increase in fees for RJBDP paid to PCG, primarily driven by an increase in the number of accounts. These fees are eliminated in consolidation.

Nonaccrual loans are included in the average loan balances in the preceding table. Any payments received for corporate nonaccrual loans are applied entirely to principal. Interest income on residential mortgage nonaccrual loans is recognized on a cash basis. 

Fee income on bank loans included in interest income for the six months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 was $9 million and $11 million , respectively. 

The yield on tax-exempt loans in the preceding table is presented on a taxable-equivalent basis utilizing the applicable federal statutory tax rates for each of the six months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 . 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. The following table shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities. The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous period&#8217;s average yield/cost. Similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average yield/cost by the previous year&#8217;s volume. Changes attributable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately.

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Quarter ended March 31, 2020 compared with the quarter ended March 31, 2019 

The pre-tax loss of $46 million was $29 million larger than the loss generated in the prior-year quarter. 

Net revenues for the current quarter included $39 million of private equity valuation losses, compared with gains of $2 million in the prior-year quarter. During the current quarter, $22 million of the losses on private equity were attributable to noncontrolling interests, which were reflected as an offset within other expenses. These valuation losses were primarily the result of the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on certain of our investments. Although net interest was flat compared with the prior-year quarter, we expect the impact of the decline in short-term interest rates implemented toward the end of the quarter, and the issuance of $500 million of senior notes payable at the end of the quarter to negatively affect our net interest in this segment in future quarters. 

Non-interest expenses decreased $15 million , or 88% , primarily due to the aforementioned $22 million offset of private equity valuation losses related to noncontrolling interests in other expenses. Increases in compensation-related expenses and advertising expenses partially offset the decrease in other expenses. 

Six months ended March 31, 2020 compared with the six months ended March 31, 2019 

The pre-tax loss of $77 million was $42 million larger than the loss generated in the prior-year period. 

Net revenues decreased $54 million from income of $2 million in the prior-year period to a loss of $52 million , primarily due to $41 million of private equity valuation losses, compared with gains of $6 million in the prior-year period. In the current-year period, $23 million of the losses on private equity investments were attributable to noncontrolling interests, which were reflected as an offset within other expenses. These valuation losses were primarily the result of the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on certain of our investments. Interest earned on corporate cash balances also decreased due to lower short-term interest rates, partially offset by the impact of higher average balances. 

Non-interest expenses decreased $12 million , or 32% , primarily due to the aforementioned $23 million offset of private equity valuation losses attributable to noncontrolling interests. Increases in compensation-related expenses and advertising expenses partially offset the decrease in other expenses.

Return on assets is computed by dividing annualized net income for the period indicated by average assets for each respective period. Average assets for the quarter is computed by adding total assets as of the date indicated to the prior quarter-end total, and dividing by two. Average assets for the year-to-date period is computed by adding total assets as of each quarter-end date during the year-to-date period to the beginning of the year total, and dividing by three. 

Return on equity is computed by dividing annualized net income for the period indicated by average equity for each respective period. Average equity for the quarter is computed by adding total equity attributable to RJF as of the date indicated to the prior quarter-end total, and dividing by two. Average equity for the year-to-date period is computed by adding total equity attributable to RJF as of each quarter-end date during the year-to-date period to the beginning of the year total, and dividing by three. 

Average equity to average assets is computed by dividing average equity by average assets, as calculated in accordance with the previous explanations. 

Dividend payout ratio is computed by dividing dividends declared per common share during the period by earnings per diluted common share for the period.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Refer to the &#8220;Results of Operations - RJ Bank&#8221; and &#8220;Risk management - Credit risk&#8221; sections of Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and to the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for the other required disclosures. 

Liquidity and capital resources 

Liquidity is essential to our business. The primary goal of our liquidity management activities is to ensure adequate funding to conduct our business over a range of economic and market environments. 

Senior management establishes our liquidity and capital management framework. This framework includes senior management&#8217;s review of short- and long-term cash flow forecasts, review of monthly capital expenditures, monitoring of the availability of alternative sources of financing, and daily monitoring of liquidity in our significant subsidiaries. Our decisions on the allocation of capital to our business units consider, among other factors, projected profitability and cash flow, risk, and impact on future liquidity needs. Our treasury department assists in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the impact that our business activities have on our financial condition, liquidity and capital structure, and maintains our relationships with various lenders. The objective of this framework is to support the successful execution of our business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity. 

Liquidity is provided primarily through our business operations and financing activities. Financing activities could include bank borrowings, repurchase agreement transactions or additional capital raising activities under our &#8220;universal&#8221; shelf registration statement. 

Cash and cash equivalents increased $6.69 billion to $10.65 billion during the six months ended March 31, 2020 , primarily due to $7.95 billion of cash provided by financing activities, partially offset by investing activities, which used $2.09 billion . Cash provided by financing activities mainly related to an increase in bank deposits, as client cash balances increased significantly due to the impact of COVID-19, and proceeds from our senior notes issuance during the current period, partially offset by our open-market share repurchases and dividends on our common stock. Investing activities primarily related to an increase in bank loans and growth of our available-for-sale securities portfolio during the current period. 

We believe our existing assets, most of which are liquid in nature, together with funds generated from operations and available from committed and uncommitted financing facilities provide adequate funds for continuing operations at current levels of activity. 

Sources of liquidity 

Nearly $2 billion of our total March 31, 2020 cash and cash equivalents included cash on hand at the parent, as well as parent cash loaned to RJ&#38;A. The following table presents our holdings of cash and cash equivalents.

&#160; 

The significant increase in cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2020 was primarily due to an increase in client cash balances as a result of the market volatility toward the end of our second fiscal quarter. Subsequent to March 31, 2020 , we utilized additional capacity with third-party banks in our RJBDP, which reduced cash and cash equivalents at RJ Bank by approximately $4 billion. 

RJF maintained depository accounts at RJ Bank with a balance of $179 million as of March 31, 2020 . The portion of this total that was available on demand without restrictions, which amounted to $108 million as of March 31, 2020 , is reflected in the RJF total (and is excluded from the RJ Bank cash balance in the preceding table). 

RJF had loaned $1.50 billion to RJ&#38;A as of March 31, 2020 (such amount is included in the RJ&#38;A cash balance in the preceding table), which RJ&#38;A has invested on behalf of RJF in cash and cash equivalents or otherwise deployed in its normal business activities. On April 1, 2020, we deposited approximately $350 million of cash into RJ&#38;A&#8217;s segregated reserve accounts as a result of our March 31, 2020 reserve calculation. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

In addition to the cash balances described, we have various other potential sources of cash available to the parent from subsidiaries, as described in the following section. 

Liquidity available from subsidiaries 

Liquidity is principally available to RJF, the parent company, from RJ&#38;A and RJ Bank. 

Certain of our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the requirements of the Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. As a member firm of FINRA, RJ&#38;A is subject to FINRA&#8217;s capital requirements, which are substantially the same as Rule 15c3-1. Rule 15c3-1 provides for an &#8220;alternative net capital requirement,&#8221; which RJ&#38;A has elected. Regulations require that minimum net capital, as defined, be equal to the greater of $1.5 million or 2% of aggregate debit items arising from client transactions. In addition, covenants in RJ&#38;A&#8217;s committed financing facilities require its net capital to be a minimum of 10% of aggregate debit items. At March 31, 2020 , RJ&#38;A significantly exceeded the minimum regulatory requirements, the covenants in its financing arrangements pertaining to net capital, as well as its internally-targeted net capital tolerances. FINRA may impose certain restrictions, such as restricting withdrawals of equity capital, if a member firm were to fall below a certain threshold or fail to meet minimum net capital requirements. 

RJ&#38;A, as a nonbank custodian of Individual Retirement Accounts (&#8220;IRAs&#8221;), must also satisfy certain Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) regulations in order to accept new IRA and plan accounts and retain the accounts for which it serves as nonbank custodian. To maintain adequate net worth under these regulations, RJ&#38;A may have to limit dividends to RJF. We evaluate regulatory requirements, loan covenants and certain internal tolerances when determining the amount of liquidity available to RJF from RJ&#38;A. 

RJ Bank may pay dividends to RJF without prior approval of its regulator as long as the dividend does not exceed the sum of RJ Bank&#8217;s current calendar year and the previous two calendar years&#8217; retained net income, and RJ Bank maintains its targeted regulatory capital ratios. At March 31, 2020 , RJ Bank had $253 million of capital in excess of the amount it would need at that date to maintain its targeted regulatory capital ratios, and could pay a dividend of such amount without requiring prior approval of its regulator. 

Although we have liquidity available to us from our other subsidiaries, the available amounts are not as significant as those previously described and, in certain instances, may be subject to regulatory requirements. 

Borrowings and financing arrangements 

Committed financing arrangements 

Our ability to borrow is dependent upon compliance with the conditions in our various loan agreements and, in the case of secured borrowings, collateral eligibility requirements. Our committed financing arrangements are in the form of either tri-party repurchase agreements or, in the case of the Credit Facility, an unsecured line of credit. The required market value of the collateral associated with the committed secured facilities ranges from 105% to 125% of the amount financed. 

The following table presents our committed financing arrangements with third-party lenders, which we generally utilize to finance a portion of our fixed income trading instruments held, and the outstanding balances related thereto.

The Credit Facility provides for maximum borrowings of up to $500 million , with a sublimit of $300 million for RJF. RJ&#38;A may borrow up to $500 million under the Credit Facility, depending on the amount of outstanding borrowings by RJF. For additional details on our committed unsecured financing arrangement, see our discussion of the Credit Facility in Note 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Uncommitted financing arrangements 

Our uncommitted financing arrangements are in the form of secured lines of credit, secured bilateral or tri-party repurchase agreements, or unsecured lines of credit. Our arrangements with third-party lenders are generally utilized to finance a portion of our fixed income securities or for cash management purposes. Our uncommitted secured financing arrangements generally require us to post collateral in excess of the amount borrowed. As of March 31, 2020 , we had outstanding borrowings under two uncommitted secured borrowing arrangements with lenders out of a total of 11 uncommitted financing arrangements (six uncommitted secured and five uncommitted unsecured). However, lenders are under no contractual obligation to lend to us under uncommitted credit facilities. 

The following table presents our borrowings on uncommitted financing arrangements, all of which were in RJ&#38;A.

Other financings 

RJ Bank had $875 million in FHLB borrowings outstanding at March 31, 2020 , comprised of floating-rate advances totaling $850 million and a $25 million fixed-rate advance, all of which were secured by a blanket lien on RJ Bank&#8217;s residential mortgage loan portfolio (see Note 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding these borrowings). RJ Bank had an additional $2.82 billion in immediate credit available from the FHLB as of March 31, 2020 and, with the pledge of additional eligible collateral to the FHLB, total available credit of 30% of total assets. 

RJ Bank is eligible to participate in the FRB&#8217;s discount-window program; however, we do not view borrowings from the FRB as a primary source of funding. The credit available in this program is subject to periodic review, may be terminated or reduced at the discretion of the FRB, and is secured by pledged C&#38;I loans. 

We act as an intermediary between broker-dealers and other financial institutions whereby we borrow securities from one broker-dealer and then lend them to another. Where permitted, we have also loaned, to broker-dealers and other financial institutions, securities owned by clients or the firm. We account for each of these types of transactions as collateralized agreements and financings, with the outstanding balances related to the securities loaned included in &#8220;Securities loaned&#8221; on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition of this Form 10-Q, in the amount of $ 28 million as of March 31, 2020 . See Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for more information on our securities borrowed and securities loaned. 

From time to time we enter into repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements. We account for each of these types of transactions as collateralized agreements and financings, with the outstanding balances of the repurchase agreements included in &#8220;Securities sold under agreements to repurchase&#8221; on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition of this Form 10-Q, in the amount of $215 million as of March 31, 2020 . These balances are reflected in the preceding table of uncommitted financing arrangements. Such financings are generally collateralized by non-customer, RJ&#38;A-owned securities or by securities that we have received as collateral under reverse repurchase agreements. 

&#160; 

The average daily balance outstanding during the five most recent quarters, the maximum month-end balance outstanding during the quarter and the period-end balances for repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements are detailed in the following table.

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

At March 31, 2020 , in addition to the financing arrangements previously described, we had $16 million outstanding on a mortgage loan for our St. Petersburg, Florida home-office complex that is included in &#8220;Other borrowings&#8221; on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition of this Form 10-Q. 

At March 31, 2020 , we had aggregate outstanding senior notes payable of $2.04 billion. Our senior notes payable, exclusive of any unaccreted premiums or discounts and debt issuance costs, was comprised of $250 million par 5.625% senior notes due 2024, $500 million par 3.625% senior notes due 2026, $500 million par 4.65% senior notes due 2030, which were issued during our second fiscal quarter of 2020, and $800 million par 4.95% senior notes due 2046. See Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for additional information. 

Our issuer and senior long-term debt ratings as of the most current report are detailed in the following table. 

Rating Agency 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Moody&#8217;s Investors Services 

&#160;

&#160; 

Stable 

Our current long-term debt ratings depend upon a number of factors, including industry dynamics, operating and economic environment, operating results, operating margins, earnings trends and volatility, balance sheet composition, liquidity and liquidity management, capital structure, overall risk management, business diversification and market share, and competitive position in the markets in which we operate. Deteriorations in any of these factors could impact our credit ratings. Any rating downgrades could increase our costs in the event we were to obtain additional financing. 

Should our credit rating be downgraded prior to a public debt offering, it is probable that we would have to offer a higher rate of interest to bond holders. A downgrade to below investment grade may make a public debt offering difficult to execute on terms we would consider to be favorable. A downgrade below investment grade could result in the termination of certain derivative contracts and the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request immediate payment or demand immediate and ongoing overnight collateralization on our derivative instruments in liability positions (see Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for additional information). A credit downgrade could damage our reputation and result in certain counterparties limiting their business with us, result in negative comments by analysts, potentially negatively impact investor and/or clients&#8217; perception of us, and cause a decline in our stock price. None of our borrowing arrangements contains a condition or event of default related to our credit ratings. However, a credit downgrade would result in the firm incurring a higher facility fee on the $500 million Credit Facility, in addition to triggering a higher interest rate applicable to any borrowings outstanding on that line as of and subsequent to such downgrade. Conversely, an improvement in RJF&#8217;s current credit rating could have a favorable impact on the facility fee, as well as the interest rate applicable to any borrowings on such line. 

Other sources and uses of liquidity 

We have company-owned life insurance policies which are utilized to fund certain non-qualified deferred compensation plans and other employee benefit plans. Certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans and other employee benefit plans are employee-directed while others are company-directed. Certain policies which we could readily borrow against had a cash surrender value of $512 million as of March 31, 2020 , comprised of $298 million related to employee-directed plans and $214 million related to company-directed plans, and we were able to borrow up to 90%, or $461 million, of the March 31, 2020 total without restriction. To effect any such borrowing, the underlying investments would be converted to money market investments, therefore requiring us to take market risk related to the employee-directed plans. There were no borrowings outstanding against any of these policies as of March 31, 2020 . 

On May 18, 2018, we filed a &#8220;universal&#8221; shelf registration statement with the SEC pursuant to which we can issue debt, equity and other capital instruments if and when necessary or perceived by us to be opportune. Subject to certain conditions, this registration statement will be effective through May 18, 2021. 

&#160; 

See the Contractual obligations section of this MD&#38;A for information regarding our contractual obligations. 

Statement of financial condition analysis 

The assets on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition consisted primarily of cash and cash equivalents (a large portion of which is segregated for the benefit of clients), receivables including bank loans, financial instruments held either for trading purposes or as investments, and other assets. A significant portion of our assets were liquid in nature, providing us with flexibility in financing our business. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Total assets of $49.81 billion as of March 31, 2020 were $10.98 billion , or 28% , greater than our total assets as of September 30, 2019 . The increase in assets was primarily due to a $8.72 billion increase in cash and cash and cash equivalents, including cash and cash equivalents segregated pursuant to regulations, primarily due to a significant increase in client cash balances due to the market volatility as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as proceeds from our $500 million senior notes issuance in March 2020. In addition, available-for-sale securities increased $1.17 billion , bank loans, net increased $897 million and other assets increased $321 million , primarily due to ROU assets recorded as a result of the adoption of new guidance related to the accounting for leases. Offsetting these increases, securities purchased under agreements to resell and trading instruments decreased $213 million and $263 million , respectively. 

As of March 31, 2020 , our total liabilities of $42.98 billion were $10.79 billion , or 34% , greater than our total liabilities as of September 30, 2019 . The increase in total liabilities was primarily related to the significant increase in client cash balances and was comprised of a $7.74 billion increase in bank deposits, reflecting higher RJBDP balances held at RJ Bank and certificates of deposit issuances during the period, and a $2.72 billion increase in brokerage client payables, primarily due to an increase in client cash held in our CIP as of March 31, 2020 . In addition, other payables increased $516 million , primarily due to operating lease liabilities recorded as a result of the adoption of new guidance related to the accounting for leases, and senior notes payable increased $494 million due to the issuance of $500 million of 4.65% senior notes due April 2030. Offsetting these increases was a decrease in accrued compensation, commissions and benefits of $343 million , primarily due to the annual payment of certain incentive compensation during the six months ended March 31, 2020 . 

See Notes 2 and 10 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for further information on our adoption of the new leasing guidance. 

Contractual obligations 

In March 2020 , we sold in a registered underwritten public offering $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.65% senior notes due April 2030 . Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our senior notes. 

Other than the item previously described, there were no other changes to the contractual obligations presented in our 2019 Form 10-K, other than in the ordinary course of business. See Note 15 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our commitments as of March 31, 2020 . 

Regulatory 

Refer to the discussion of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the impact on our operations of certain rules and regulations in &#8220;Item 1 - Business - Regulation&#8221; and &#8220;Item 7 - Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Regulatory&#8221; of our 2019 Form 10-K. 

RJF and many of its subsidiaries are each subject to various regulatory capital requirements. As of March 31, 2020 , all of our active regulated domestic and international subsidiaries had net capital in excess of minimum requirements. In addition, RJF and RJ Bank were categorized as &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; as of March 31, 2020 . The maintenance of certain risk-based and other regulatory capital levels could influence various capital allocation decisions impacting one or more of our businesses. However, due to the current capital position of RJF and its regulated subsidiaries, we do not anticipate these capital requirements will have a negative impact on our future business activities. 

Legislative and regulatory changes in connection with COVID-19 

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in governments around the world implementing several measures to help control the spread of the virus, including, among others, quarantines, travel restrictions and business curtailments. In addition, governments globally intervened with fiscal policy to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (&#8220;CARES&#8221;) Act in the U.S., which aimed to provide economic relief to businesses and individuals. 

The CARES Act includes a broad range of provisions intended to support the U.S. economy. Among its provisions, the act allocates funds for a new Paycheck Protection Program that expands an existing Small Business Administration (&#8220;SBA&#8221;) loan guarantee program for small businesses to keep their employees on payroll and make other eligible payments. Currently, the firm does not act as a lender under these programs and facilities, and has no plans to do so. 

The CARES Act also provides certain temporary regulatory relief for financial institutions, including RJF and its subsidiaries. The act permits financial institutions to temporarily suspend requirements under GAAP for COVID-19-related loan modifications that 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

would otherwise be classified as TDRs and to suspend any determination of a loan modified as a result of the effects of COVID-19 as being a TDR, including impairment for accounting purposes. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management - Credit risk&#8221; for further information on the impact of such loan modifications. The act also permits financial institutions to temporarily delay the implementation of CECL for estimating allowances for credit losses. Given our later adoption date of October 1, 2020, we do not anticipate delaying our adoption. In addition, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC issued a joint statement providing banking organizations optional temporary relief by delaying the initial adoption impact of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided during 2020 and 2021 (i.e., a five-year transition period). As we do not adopt CECL until October 1, 2020, we are currently evaluating whether we intend to avail ourselves of such relief. 

The CARES Act grants potential tax relief and liquidity to businesses, including corporate tax provisions that: temporarily allow for the carryback of net operating losses and remove limitations on the use of loss carryforwards, increase interest expense deduction limitations, and allow accelerated depreciation deductions on certain asset improvements. In addition, the CARES Act allows employers to defer the payment, including the deposit, of payroll taxes for the 2020 calendar year from March 27, 2020 until December 31, 2021 for 50 percent of such taxes and December 31, 2022 for the remaining 50 percent. 

The CARES Act further provides a number of consumer finance protections. The act also provides a range of forbearance rights with respect to any federally backed residential or multi-family mortgage loan and generally limits the ability of a lender or servicer to institute foreclosure or similar proceedings. The act additionally imposes a moratorium on evictions from dwellings of many tenants. These provisions are consistent with supervisory guidance previously issued by federal banking agencies, which also stated that they would not criticize financial institutions for working with customers affected by the outbreak in a safe and sound manner. We are modifying our processes to ensure full compliance and are working as appropriate to support affected businesses and individuals during this time. 

In addition to guidance regarding supporting customers, federal banking agencies have also taken a number of other actions. The Federal Reserve, for example, has taken active steps to inject liquidity into the economy. The Federal Reserve has reduced the benchmark interest rate in an attempt to stimulate the economy. As previously mentioned, this has and will continue to negatively impact our net interest earnings. In addition, the Federal Reserve has established a number of new facilities, including to provide liquidity for issuers of commercial paper, money market funds, new bond and loan issuances, outstanding corporate bonds, primary dealers, and small and medium-sized businesses, and has reduced the interest rates on borrowings under its discount window. 

The Company&#8217;s legislative and regulatory environment is continually changing in response to the outbreak of COVID-19, and new or modified laws, regulations and guidance may be promulgated at very short notice. 

See Note 20 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for further information on regulatory capital requirements. 

Critical accounting estimates 

The condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during any reporting period in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Management has established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure the appropriateness of such estimates and assumptions and their consistent application from period to period. For a description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Due to their nature, estimates involve judgment based upon available information. Actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Therefore, understanding these critical accounting estimates is important in understanding our reported results of operations and financial position. We believe that of our accounting estimates and assumptions, those described in the following sections involve a high degree of judgment and complexity. Recent market disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic have made it more challenging for us to determine the amount of our allowance for loan losses and the fair value of certain of our assets, particularly our private equity investments. The current circumstances have required a greater reliance on judgment than in recent periods in determining these amounts as of March 31, 2020. 

Valuation of financial instruments 

The use of fair value to measure financial instruments, with related gains or losses recognized in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income, is fundamental to our financial statements and our risk management processes. See Note 2 of 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our 2019 Form 10-K for a discussion of our fair value accounting policies regarding financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold but not yet purchased. See Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for additional information on our financial instruments at fair value. 

Loss provisions 

Refer to &#8220;Item 7 - Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical accounting estimates - Loss provisions&#8221; of our 2019 Form 10-K for more information. 

Loss provisions for legal and regulatory matters 

The recorded amount of liabilities related to legal and regulatory matters is subject to significant management judgment. For a description of the significant estimates and judgments associated with establishing such accruals, see the &#8220;Contingent liabilities&#8221; section of Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our 2019 Form 10-K. In addition, refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for information regarding legal and regulatory matter contingencies as of March 31, 2020 . 

Loan loss provisions arising from operations of RJ Bank 

We provide an allowance for loan losses which reflects our continuing evaluation of the probable losses inherent in RJ Bank&#8217;s loan portfolio. See the discussion regarding our methodology in estimating the allowance for loan losses in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our 2019 Form 10-K. See Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for additional information on our bank loans. 

At March 31, 2020 , the amortized cost of all RJ Bank loans was $22.11 billion and the allowance for loan losses was $324 million , which was 1.47% of the held for investment loan portfolio. 

Our process of evaluating probable loan losses includes a complex analysis of several quantitative and qualitative factors, requiring management judgment. As a result, the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses. In such an event, any losses in excess of our allowance would result in a decrease in our net income, as well as a decrease in the level of regulatory capital. 

Recent accounting developments 

For information regarding our recent accounting developments, see Note 2 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q. 

Off-balance sheet arrangements 

For information regarding our off-balance sheet arrangements, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our 2019 Form 10-K and Note 15 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q. 

Effects of inflation 

Our assets are primarily liquid in nature and are not significantly affected by inflation. However, the rate of inflation affects our expenses, including employee compensation, communications and information processing, and occupancy costs, which may not be readily recoverable through charges for services we provide to our clients. In addition, to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has adverse effects upon the securities markets, it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. 

Risk management 

Risks are an inherent part of our business and activities. Management of these risks is critical to our fiscal soundness and profitability. Our risk management processes are multi-faceted and require communication, judgment and knowledge of financial products and markets. We have a formal Enterprise Risk Management (&#8220;ERM&#8221;) program to assess and review aggregate risks across the firm. Our management takes an active role in the ERM process, which requires specific administrative and business functions to participate in the identification, assessment, monitoring and control of various risks. 

The principal risks related to our business activities are market, credit, liquidity, operational, model, and compliance. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Governance 

Our Board of Directors oversees the firm&#8217;s management and mitigation of risk, setting a culture that encourages ethical conduct and risk management throughout the firm. Senior management communicates and reinforces this culture through three lines of risk management and a number of senior-level management committees. Our first line of risk management, which includes all of our businesses, owns its risks and is responsible for helping to identify, escalate, and mitigate risks arising from its day-to-day activities. The second line of risk management, which includes the Compliance, Legal, and Risk Management departments, supports and provides guidance, advice, and oversight to client-facing businesses and other first-line risk management functions in identifying and mitigating risk. The second line of risk management also tests and monitors the effectiveness of controls, escalates risks when appropriate, and reports on these risks. The third line of risk management, Internal Audit, independently reviews activities conducted by the previous lines of risk management to assess their management and mitigation of risk, providing additional assurance to the Board of Directors and senior management, with a view toward enhancing our oversight, management, and mitigation of risk. 

Market risk 

Market risk is our risk of loss resulting from the impact of changes in market prices on our trading inventory, derivatives and investment positions. We have exposure to market risk primarily through our broker-dealer trading operations and, to a lesser extent, through our banking operations. See &#8220;Item 7 - Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management - Market risk&#8221; of our 2019 Form 10-K for a discussion of our market risk, including how we manage such risk. See Notes 3 , 4 and 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for fair value and other information regarding our trading inventories, available-for-sale securities and derivative instruments. 

Interest rate risk 

Trading activities 

We are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our trading inventory (primarily comprised of fixed income instruments) in our Capital Markets segment. We actively manage the interest rate risk arising from our fixed income trading securities through the use of hedging strategies that involve U.S. Treasury securities, futures contracts, liquid spread products and derivatives. During our second fiscal quarter of 2020, in response to the significant market volatility as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we took steps to proactively manage our market risk exposures, including enhanced review and monitoring of exposures and risk mitigation efforts. As a result, we reduced our trading inventory during the quarter to reduce risk. 

We monitor the Value-at-Risk (&#8220;VaR&#8221;) for all of our trading portfolios on a daily basis. VaR is an appropriate statistical technique for estimating potential losses in trading portfolios due to typical adverse market movements over a specified time horizon with a suitable confidence level. We apply the Fed&#8217;s Market Risk Rule (&#8220;MRR&#8221;) for the purpose of calculating our capital ratios. The MRR, also known as the &#8220;Risk-Based Capital Guidelines: Market Risk&#8221; rule released by the Fed, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#8220;OCC&#8221;) and FDIC, requires us to calculate VaR for all of our trading portfolios, including fixed income, equity, foreign exchange and derivatives. 

To calculate VaR, we use historical simulation. This approach assumes that historical changes in market conditions, such as in interest rates and equity prices, are representative of future changes. Simulation is based on daily market data for the previous twelve months. VaR is reported at a 99% confidence level for a one-day time horizon. Assuming that future market conditions change as they have in the past twelve months, we would expect to incur losses greater than those predicted by our one-day VaR estimates about once every 100 trading days, or about three times per year on average. For regulatory capital calculation purposes, we also report VaR numbers for a ten-day time horizon. 

The Fed&#8217;s MRR requires us to perform daily back-testing procedures of our VaR model, whereby we compare each day&#8217;s projected VaR to its regulatory-defined daily trading losses, which exclude fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income and intraday trading. Regulatory-defined daily trading losses are used to evaluate the performance of our VaR model and are not comparable to our actual daily net revenues. Based on these daily &#8220;ex ante&#8221; versus &#8220;ex post &#8221; comparisons, we determine whether the number of times that regulatory-defined daily trading losses exceed VaR is consistent with our expectations at a 99% confidence level. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2020 , our regulatory-defined daily loss in our trading portfolios exceeded our predicted VaR on eleven occasions due to higher levels of market volatility as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis

The modeling of the risk characteristics of trading positions involves a number of assumptions and approximations. While management believes that these assumptions and approximations are reasonable, there is no uniform industry methodology for estimating VaR, and different assumptions or approximations could produce materially different VaR estimates. As a result, VaR statistics are more reliable when used as indicators of risk levels and trends within a firm than as a basis for inferring differences in risk-taking across firms. 

Separately, RJF provides additional market risk disclosures to comply with the MRR. The results of the application of this market risk capital rule are available on our website under https://www.raymondjames.com/investor-relations/financial-information/filings-and-reports within &#8220;Other Reports and Information.&#8221; 

Should markets suddenly become more volatile, as they did in our second fiscal quarter of 2020, actual trading losses may exceed VaR results presented on a single day and might accumulate over a longer time horizon, such as a number of consecutive trading days. Accordingly, management applies additional controls including position limits, a daily review of trading results, review of the status of aged inventory, independent controls on pricing, monitoring of concentration risk, review of issuer ratings and stress testing. We utilize stress testing to complement our VaR analysis so as to measure risk under historical and hypothetical adverse scenarios. During volatile markets, we may choose to pare our trading inventories to reduce risk, as we did during our second fiscal quarter of 2020. 

Banking operations 

RJ Bank maintains an earning asset portfolio that is comprised of cash, C&#38;I loans, tax-exempt loans, commercial and residential real estate loans, SBL and other loans, as well as MBS and CMOs (held in the available-for-sale securities portfolio), SBA loan securitizations and a trading portfolio of corporate loans. These earning assets are primarily funded by client deposits. Based on its current earning asset portfolio, RJ Bank is subject to interest rate risk. RJ Bank analyzes interest rate risk based on forecasted net interest income, which is the net amount of interest received and interest paid, and the net portfolio valuation, both in a range of interest rate scenarios. 

One of the objectives of RJ Bank&#8217;s Asset Liability Management Committee is to manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates. The methods used to measure this sensitivity are described in &#8220;Item 7 - Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management - Market risk&#8221; of our 2019 Form 10-K. 

We utilize a hedging strategy using interest rate swaps as a result of RJ Bank&#8217;s asset and liability management process. For further information regarding this hedging strategy, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our 2019 Form 10-K. 

The following table is an analysis of RJ Bank&#8217;s estimated net interest income over a 12-month period based on instantaneous shifts in interest rates (expressed in basis points) using RJ Bank&#8217;s own asset/liability model.

Contractual loan terms for C&#38;I, CRE, CRE construction and residential mortgage loans may include an interest rate floor, cap and/or fixed interest rates for a certain period of time, which would impact the timing of the interest rate reset for the respective loan. See the discussion within the &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management - Credit risk - Risk monitoring process&#8221; section of this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding RJ Bank&#8217;s interest-only residential mortgage loan portfolio. 

In our RJ Bank available-for-sale securities portfolio, we hold primarily fixed-rate agency MBS and CMOs which were carried at fair value on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at March 31, 2020 , with changes in the fair value of the portfolio recorded through OCI in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. At March 31, 2020 , our RJ Bank available-for-sale securities portfolio had a fair value of $4.27 billion with a weighted-average yield of 2.27% and a duration of three years. See Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for additional information. 

Equity price risk 

We are exposed to equity price risk as a result of our capital markets activities. Our broker-dealer activities are primarily client-driven, with the objective of meeting clients&#8217; needs while earning revenues to compensate for the risk associated with carrying inventory. We attempt to reduce the risk of loss inherent in our inventory of equity securities by monitoring those security positions throughout each day and establishing position limits. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Foreign exchange risk 

We are subject to foreign exchange risk due to our investments in foreign subsidiaries as well as transactions and resulting balances denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. For example, a portion of our bank loan portfolio includes loans which are denominated in Canadian dollars totaling $1.11 billion and $1.10 billion at March 31, 2020 and September 30, 2019 , respectively. A portion of such loans are held by RJ Bank&#8217;s Canadian subsidiary, which is discussed in the following sections. 

Investments in foreign subsidiaries 

RJ Bank has an investment in a Canadian subsidiary, resulting in foreign exchange risk. To mitigate its foreign exchange risk, RJ Bank utilizes short-term, forward foreign exchange contracts. These derivatives are primarily accounted for as net investment hedges in the condensed consolidated financial statements. See Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for further information regarding these derivatives. 

We had foreign exchange risk in our investment in RJ Ltd. of CAD 338 million at March 31, 2020 , which was not hedged. Foreign exchange gains/losses related to this investment are primarily reflected in OCI on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. See Note 16 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for further information regarding our components of OCI. 

We also have foreign exchange risk associated with our investments in subsidiaries located in Europe. These investments are not hedged and we do not believe we have material foreign exchange risk either individually, or in the aggregate, pertaining to these subsidiaries. 

Transactions and resulting balances denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar 

We are subject to foreign exchange risk due to our holdings of cash and certain other assets and liabilities resulting from transactions denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. Any currency-related gains/losses arising from these foreign currency denominated balances are reflected in &#8220;Other&#8221; revenues in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The foreign exchange risk associated with a portion of such transactions and balances denominated in foreign currency are mitigated utilizing short-term, forward foreign exchange contracts. Such derivatives are not designated hedges and therefore, the related gains/losses associated with these contracts are included in &#8220;Other&#8221; revenues in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. See Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for information regarding our derivatives. 

Credit risk 

Credit risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in a borrower&#8217;s, issuer&#8217;s or counterparty&#8217;s ability to meet its financial obligations under contractual or agreed upon terms. The nature and amount of credit risk depends on the type of transaction, the structure and duration of that transaction, and the parties involved. Credit risk is an integral component of the profit assessment of lending and other financing activities. See further discussion of our credit risk, including how we manage such risk, in &#8220;Item 7 - Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management - Credit risk&#8221; of our 2019 Form 10-K. 

The sharp decline in economic activity as a result of COVID-19 has caused increased credit risk in general and particularly with regard to companies in sectors that have been most significantly impacted by the economic disruption, including oil and gas, airlines, entertainment and leisure, restaurants and gaming. Given the stresses on our clients&#8217; liquidity, we have enhanced our credit monitoring activities, with an increased focus on monitoring our credit exposures and counterparty credit risk, including the risk that trades may not settle with a given counterparty. We have required collateral to be posted across our credit risk exposures in accordance with agreements with our borrowers and counterparties. 

RJ Bank has a substantial loan portfolio. While RJ Bank&#8217;s loan portfolio is diversified, a significant downturn in the overall economy, such as the downturn during our second fiscal quarter, deterioration in real estate values or a significant issue within any sector or sectors where RJ Bank has a concentration will generally result in large provisions for loan losses and/or charge-offs. RJ Bank determines the allowance required for specific loan grades based on relative risk characteristics of the loan portfolio. On an ongoing basis, RJ Bank evaluates its methods for determining the allowance for each class of loans and makes enhancements it considers appropriate. 

Our allowance for loan losses is regularly evaluated with adjustments made on a quarterly basis. Several factors were taken into consideration in evaluating the allowance for loan losses at March 31, 2020 , including the risk profile of the portfolios, net charge-offs during the period, the level of nonperforming loans, delinquency ratios and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. RJ Bank also 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

considered the uncertainty related to certain industry sectors and the extent of credit exposure to specific borrowers within the portfolio. Finally, RJ Bank considered current economic conditions that might impact the portfolio. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we performed a portfolio-wide assessment on our loan portfolio. As a result, we downgraded loans in certain impacted industries, which gave rise to an increase in the loan loss provision during the current quarter. We will continue to assess the impact of COVID-19 and, as more information becomes available regarding the financial repercussions to our borrowers, the risk ratings for individual loans will be updated and the allowance will be adjusted accordingly. 

RJ Bank&#8217;s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of bank loans outstanding was 1.47% and 1.04% at March 31, 2020 and September 30, 2019 , respectively. See Note 7 in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for detail on the changes in RJ Bank&#8217;s allowance for loan losses. 

The bank loan loss provision for the six months ended March 31, 2020 was $107 million compared to a loan loss provision of $21 million for the prior-year period. See further explanation of the loan loss provision increase in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations - RJ Bank&#8221; of this Form 10-Q. 

The level of charge-off activity is a factor that is considered in evaluating the potential for severity of future credit losses. The following table presents net loan (charge-offs)/recoveries and the percentage of net loan (charge-offs)/recoveries to the average outstanding loan balances by loan portfolio segment.

Included in nonperforming residential mortgage loans were $7 million in loans for which $4 million in charge-offs were previously recorded, resulting in less exposure within the remaining balance. See Note 7 in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for loan categories as a percentage of total loans receivable. 

The nonperforming loan balances in the preceding table exclude $11 million and $12 million as of March 31, 2020 and September 30, 2019 , respectively, of residential TDRs which were returned to accrual status in accordance with our policy. Total nonperforming assets, including other real estate acquired in the settlement of residential mortgages, amounted to $27 million and $46 million at March 31, 2020 and September 30, 2019 , respectively. Total nonperforming assets as a percentage of RJ Bank total assets were 0.08% and 0.18% at March 31, 2020 and September 30, 2019 , respectively. Although our nonperforming assets as a percentage of RJ Bank assets remained low as of March 31, 2020, and we had no charge-offs during our second fiscal quarter, prolonged or further market deterioration could result in an increase in our nonperforming assets, an increase in our allowance for loan losses and/or an increase

in net charge-offs in future periods, although the extent will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. 

We have received requests from certain clients for forbearance, or deferral of their loan payments to us, driven or exacerbated by the economic impacts of the COVID pandemic. Certain clients have also requested modifications of covenant terms. The CARES Act permits, among other things, financial institutions to suspend requirements under GAAP for loan modifications to borrowers affected by COVID-19 and is intended to provide interpretive guidance as to conditions that would constitute a short-term modification that would not meet the definition of a TDR. We have made certain loan modifications that relate to short-term payment deferrals that are not considered TDRs. Based on the outstanding principal balance as of the end of April 2020, we have received payment deferral requests on approximately 3% and 2% of our corporate and residential loans, respectively. 

Loan underwriting policies 

RJ Bank&#8217;s underwriting policies for the major types of loans are described in &#8220;Item 7 - Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management - Credit risk&#8221; of our 2019 Form 10-K. There were no material changes in RJ Bank&#8217;s underwriting policies during the six months ended March 31, 2020 . 

Risk monitoring process 

Another component of credit risk strategy at RJ Bank is the ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all residential, SBL, corporate and tax-exempt credit exposures, as well as our rigorous processes to manage and limit credit losses arising from loan delinquencies. There are various other factors included in these processes, depending on the loan portfolio. There were no material changes to those processes and policies during the six months ended March 31, 2020 . 

Residential mortgage and SBL and other loan portfolios 

The collateral securing RJ Bank&#8217;s SBL and other portfolio is monitored on a recurring basis, with marketable collateral monitored on a daily basis. Collateral adjustments are made by the borrower as necessary to ensure RJ Bank&#8217;s loans are adequately secured, resulting in minimizing its credit risk. Collateral calls have been minimal relative to our SBL and other portfolio with no losses incurred to date. 

We track and review many factors to monitor credit risk in RJ Bank&#8217;s residential mortgage loan portfolio. The factors include, but are not limited to: loan performance trends, loan product parameters and qualification requirements, borrower credit scores, level of documentation, loan purpose, geographic concentrations, average loan size and LTV ratios. These measures, while considered and reviewed in establishing the allowance for loan losses, have not resulted in any material adjustments to RJ Bank&#8217;s historical loss rates. 

The following table presents a summary of delinquent residential mortgage loans, the vast majority of which are first mortgage loans, which are comprised of loans which are two or more payments past due as well as loans in the process of foreclosure.

Credit risk is also managed by diversifying the residential mortgage portfolio. Most of the loans in our residential loan portfolio are to Private Client Group clients across the country.

Loans where borrowers may be subject to payment increases include adjustable rate mortgage loans with terms that initially require payment of interest only. Payments may increase significantly when the interest-only period ends and the loan principal begins to amortize. At March 31, 2020 and September 30, 2019 , these loans totaled $1.51 billion and $1.29 billion , respectively, or approximately 30% of the residential mortgage portfolio as of each of these dates. The weighted average number of years before the remainder of the loans, which were still in their interest-only period at March 31, 2020 , begins amortizing is 5.9 years. 

A component of credit risk management for the residential portfolio is the LTV ratio and borrower credit score at origination or purchase.

Corporate and tax-exempt loans 

Credit risk in RJ Bank&#8217;s corporate and tax-exempt loan portfolios are monitored on an individual loan basis. The majority of RJ Bank&#8217;s tax-exempt loan portfolio is comprised of loans to investment-grade borrowers. 

Credit risk is managed by diversifying the corporate loan portfolio. RJ Bank&#8217;s corporate loan portfolio does not contain a significant concentration in any single industry. The following table details the industry concentrations (top five categories) of RJ Bank&#8217;s corporate loans.

RJ Bank&#8217;s exposure to the energy, airline, entertainment/leisure, restaurant and gaming sectors, those most affected by the economic disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic, were each less than 2% of the loan portfolio as of March 31, 2020. 

Although we saw significant deterioration in oil prices during our second fiscal quarter, our energy portfolio primarily consists of loans to midstream distribution companies and convenience stores, with no loans to exploration and production enterprises. As a result, the portfolio has minimal direct commodity price exposure. However, if we continue to see a significant deterioration in oil prices, our clients, and as a result our loans to such clients, could be negatively impacted in the future.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we activated and successfully executed on our business continuity protocols and continue to monitor the COVID-19 crisis under such protocols.

Our systems and infrastructure have continued to support the increased volumes of activity, without any significant operational or technology disruptions. We did not incur any material losses related to our operational risks during the six months ended March 31, 2020 . 

As more fully described in the discussion of our business technology risks included in various risk factors presented in &#8220;Item 1A - Risk Factors&#8221; of our 2019 Form 10-K and &#8220;Part II - Other Information - Item 1A - Risk Factors&#8221; of this Form 10-Q, despite our implementation of protective measures and endeavoring to modify them as circumstances warrant, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to human error, natural disasters, power loss, cyber-attacks and other information security breaches, and other events that could have an impact on the security and stability of our operations. To-date, we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches; however, there can be no assurances that we will not suffer such losses in the future.
