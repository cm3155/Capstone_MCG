FACTORS AFFECTING &#8220;FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS&#8221; 

Certain statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may constitute &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include information concerning future strategic objectives, business prospects, anticipated savings, financial results (including expenses, earnings, liquidity, cash flow and capital expenditures), industry or market conditions, demand for and pricing of our products, acquisitions and divestitures, anticipated results of litigation, our effective tax rate, regulatory developments, effects of accounting pronouncements, and general economic conditions. In addition, words such as &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; and future or conditional verbs such as &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; and &#8220;would,&#8221; as well as any other statement that necessarily depends on future events, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and they involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Although we make such statements based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. We caution investors not to rely unduly on any forward-looking statements and urge you to carefully consider the risks described in our filings with the SEC from time to time, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, which are available at www.raymondjames.com and the SEC&#8217;s website at www.sec.gov. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statement in the event it later turns out to be inaccurate, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 

INTRODUCTION 

The following Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;) is intended to help the reader understand the results of our operations and financial condition. This MD&#38;A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to condensed consolidated financial statements. Where &#8220;NM&#8221; is used in various percentage change computations, the computed percentage change has been determined to be not meaningful. 

We operate as a financial holding company and bank holding company. Results in the businesses in which we operate are highly correlated to general economic conditions and, more specifically, to the direction of the U.S. equity and fixed income markets, changes in interest rates, market volatility, corporate and mortgage lending markets and commercial and residential credit trends. Overall market conditions, economic, political and regulatory trends, and industry competition are among the factors which could affect us and which are unpredictable and beyond our control. These factors affect the financial decisions made by market participants, including investors, borrowers, and competitors, impacting their level of participation in the financial markets. These factors also impact the level of investment banking activity and asset valuations, which ultimately affect our business results. 

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 

Quarter ended June 30, 2020 compared with the quarter ended June 30, 2019 

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic and the United States declared a national emergency due to the impact of the pandemic. As a result of the spread of COVID-19, governments and other authorities around the world imposed measures intended to control the spread of the disease, including restrictions on travel and the conduct of business, such as stay-at-home orders, quarantines, travel bans, border closings, business closures and other similar measures. In response, we activated our business continuity plan endeavoring to safeguard our associates, and nearly all of our associates transitioned to working remotely, while still maintaining our standard of client service. Although economies began to reopen during our fiscal third quarter, a substantial portion of our associates continued to work remotely. Our systems and infrastructure have continued to support increased volumes of activity without any significant operational or technology disruptions. 

The economic uncertainty that has resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic continued during our fiscal third quarter and market volatility remained elevated; however, market sentiment improved, reflected in the recovery of U.S. equity markets during the quarter. Certain of our businesses benefited from the equity market appreciation, and PCG assets in fee-based accounts recovered, increasing 16%, which will have a positive impact on our fiscal fourth quarter results. However, our results continued to be negatively affected by the significant reduction in interest rates implemented by The Federal Reserve toward the end of our fiscal second quarter and an elevated bank loan loss provision due to the economic impact and uncertainty attributable to the pandemic. Uncertainty remains with regard to the extent and duration of the disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as its continuing impacts on the global economy. We expect the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to prevent its spread and to support the economy to continue to have an impact on our business during the remainder of fiscal 2020, although the extent of such effects will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

During the quarter ended June 30, 2020, net revenues of $1.83 billion decreased $93 million, or 5%, compared with the prior-year quarter. Pre-tax income of $198 million decreased $144 million, or 42%, and net income of $172 million decreased $87 million, or 34%, both primarily due to a significant increase in the bank loan loss provision in response to the economic deterioration caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our earnings per diluted share were $1.23, reflecting a 32% decrease. Our annualized return on equity (&#8220;ROE&#8221;) for the quarter was 10.0%, compared with 16.1% in the prior-year quarter, and our annualized return on tangible common equity (&#8220;ROTCE&#8221;) (1) was 10.9%, compared with 17.8% for the prior-year quarter. 

The $93 million decrease in net revenues compared with the prior-year quarter primarily reflected the impact of lower short-term interest rates on both net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks. These declines were partially offset by an increase in brokerage revenues, as the fixed income business generated strong results due to higher client activity levels. 

Compensation, commissions and benefits expenses were flat versus the prior-year quarter. Non-compensation expenses increased $51 million, or 17%, due to an $86 million increase in the bank loan loss provision, which was $81 million in the current-year quarter compared with a $5 million benefit in the prior-year quarter, partially offset by a decrease in business development expenses, as travel and conferences were halted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Our effective income tax rate of 13.1% for our fiscal third quarter of 2020 primarily reflected the impact of significant non-taxable gains on our corporate-owned life insurance portfolio on lower pre-tax earnings for the quarter. 

The firm ended the quarter with capital ratios well in excess of regulatory requirements and substantial liquidity, with over $2.1 billion (2) of cash at the parent company, which included the proceeds of a $500 million 10-year senior notes issuance at the end of our fiscal second quarter of 2020. 

Certain of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will likely continue to affect our results in future quarters. Our net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks will continue to be negatively affected by the 225 basis point reduction by the Federal Reserve of its benchmark short-term interest rate since August 2019. In Capital Markets, the high degree of market uncertainty will likely result in more volatility of both brokerage revenues and investment banking revenues during the pandemic. While our results during the third quarter were negatively impacted by elevated bank loan loss provisions, including losses on certain corporate loans that were sold during the quarter, further market deterioration could result in additional provisions in future quarters. Due to the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and related negative impact on our results, we are evaluating ways to reduce costs and find efficiencies to remain well-positioned for future growth and success. To that end, we are currently engaged in a firm-wide process of evaluating both compensation and non-compensation expenses. 

A summary of our financial results by segment as compared to the prior-year quarter is as follows: 

&#8226; Our PCG segment net revenues of $1.25 billion decreased 8%, while pre-tax income of $91 million decreased 35%. The $102 million decrease in net revenues was primarily attributable to the decrease in short-term interest rates, which negatively impacted both net interest income and RJBDP fees from third party banks. Brokerage revenues also declined compared with the prior-year quarter, primarily due to a decline in revenues from annuity products and mutual fund products. Non-interest expenses decreased $53 million, or 4%, primarily resulting from a decrease in travel and conference-related expenses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as lower compensation expenses due to a decrease in compensable net revenues, which primarily include asset management and related administrative fees, brokerage revenues and investment banking revenues. 

&#8226; Capital Markets net revenues of $323 million increased 29% and pre-tax income of $62 million increased 158%. The $72 million increase in net revenues was primarily due to an increase in fixed income and, to a lesser extent, equity brokerage revenues due to higher client activity, as well as an increase in debt and equity underwriting revenues. These increases were partially offset by a decline in merger &#38; acquisition revenues compared with the prior-year quarter due to market uncertainty. Non-interest expenses increased $34 million, or 15%, due to an increase in compensation expense, primarily as a result of the increase in net revenues. 

&#8226; Our Asset Management segment net revenues of $163 million decreased 8% and pre-tax income of $60 million decreased 8%. The decrease in net revenues was largely driven by lower average financial assets under management at Carillon Tower Advisers.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

&#8226; RJ Bank net revenues of $178 million decreased 17% and pre-tax income of $14 million decreased 90%. Net revenues decreased $37 million due to the negative impact from lower short-term interest rates, partially offset by the benefit from higher interest-earning assets. Non-interest expenses increased $87 million, or 113%, as RJ Bank recorded a loan loss provision of $81 million compared to a benefit of $5 million in the prior-year quarter. 

&#8226; Our Other segment reflected a pre-tax loss that was $4 million larger compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily the result of lower interest income on corporate cash balances due to the negative impact of lower short-term interest rates, as well as increased interest expense due to the issuance of $500 million of senior notes at the end of the fiscal second quarter. 

Nine months ended June 30, 2020 compared with the nine months ended June 30, 2019 

Net revenues of $5.91 billion increased $194 million, or 3%. Pre-tax income of $796 million decreased $225 million, or 22%. Our net income of $609 million decreased $160 million, or 21%, and our earnings per diluted share were $4.33, reflecting an 18% decrease. Our annualized ROE during the nine months ended June 30, 2020 was 11.9%, compared with 16.2% for the prior-year period, and annualized ROTCE (1) was 13.1%, compared with 17.9% for the prior-year period. 

The $194 million increase in net revenues compared with the prior-year period included higher asset management and related administrative fees, primarily attributable to higher average PCG assets in fee-based accounts at the beginning of the current-year periods and higher brokerage revenues, largely due to higher market volatility and a significant increase in institutional fixed income client activity in the current-year period. Offsetting these increases were the negative impacts of lower short-term interest rates on our net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks, and valuation losses on private equity investments, a portion of which was attributable to noncontrolling interests (reflected as an offset in other expenses). 

Compensation, commissions and benefits expense increased $283 million, or 8%, mostly due to an increase in compensable net revenues. 

Non-compensation expenses increased $136 million, or 15%, due to a $188 million bank loan loss provision, compared with a $16 million bank loan loss provision during the prior-year period. This increase was partially offset by lower travel and conference-related expenses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the aforementioned private equity valuation losses attributable to noncontrolling interests, which is an offset in other expenses. 

Our effective income tax rate was 23.5% for the nine months ended June 30, 2020, a decrease compared with the 24.8% effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019, primarily due to the favorable impact of permanent tax benefits on lower pre-tax earnings during the nine months ended June 30, 2020. 

Pursuant to our Board of Directors&#8217; share repurchase authorization, we repurchased approximately 2.7 million shares of common stock during the first six months of our current fiscal year for $213 million at an average price of approximately $80 per share. Due to heightened market uncertainty as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, share buybacks were suspended from mid-March through the end of our fiscal third quarter. As of June 30, 2020, we had $537 million of availability remaining under the previously-announced authorization. We resumed share repurchases to offset dilution in our fiscal fourth quarter. 

A summary of our financial results by segment as compared to the prior-year period is as follows: 

&#8226; PCG segment net revenues of $4.16 billion increased 5%, while pre-tax income of $414 million decreased 5%. The $180 million increase in net revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in asset management and related administrative fees due to higher average assets in fee-based accounts at the beginning of each of the current-year periods. Offsetting this increase were decreases in RJBDP fees from third-party banks and net interest income due to lower short-term interest rates. Non-interest expenses increased $202 million, or 6%, primarily resulting from an increase in compensation expenses largely due to the growth in compensable net revenues. 

&#8226; Capital Markets net revenues of $881 million increased 13% and pre-tax income of $119 million increased 55%. The $100 million increase in net revenues was primarily due to an increase in fixed income brokerage revenues, due to higher client activity, as well as increases in equity and debt underwriting revenues. These increases were partially offset by a decline in merger &#38; acquisition and advisory revenues, which were negatively impacted by the market uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Non-interest expenses increased $58 million, or 8%, due to higher compensation expenses, primarily as a result of the increase in revenues.

Please see the &#8220;Reconciliation of GAAP measures to non-GAAP financial measures&#8221; in this MD&#38;A for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and for other important disclosures. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

&#8226; Our Asset Management segment net revenues of $531 million increased 4% and pre-tax income of $206 million increased 12%. The increase in net revenues was driven by higher average beginning-of-quarter assets in programs offered to PCG clients for which the segment provides administrative support, as well as higher average financial assets under management during the current-year period. 

&#8226; RJ Bank net revenues of $604 million decreased 4% and pre-tax income of $163 million decreased 58%. The $26 million decrease in net revenues reflected the negative impact of lower short-term interest rates, which more than offset the growth in interest-earning assets. Non-interest expenses increased $195 million, or 79%, primarily due to a $172 million increase in the loan loss provision. 

&#8226; Our Other segment reflected a pre-tax loss that was $46 million larger compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to private equity valuation losses, as compared to gains in the prior-year period, lower interest income on corporate cash balances due to lower short-term interest rates, and increased interest expense, due to the issuance of $500 million of senior notes at the end of the fiscal second quarter. 

SEGMENTS 

We currently operate through five segments. Our business segments are PCG, Capital Markets, Asset Management and RJ Bank. Our Other segment includes our private equity investments, interest income on certain corporate cash balances, and certain corporate overhead costs of RJF, including the interest costs on our public debt. 

The following table presents our consolidated and segment net revenues and pre-tax income/(loss) for the periods indicated.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

RECONCILIATION OF GAAP MEASURES TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 

We utilize certain non-GAAP financial measures to aid in, and enhance, the understanding of our financial results and related measures. These non-GAAP financial measures have been separately identified in this document. We believe that annualized return on tangible common equity is meaningful to investors as this measure facilitates comparison of our results to the results of other companies. This non-GAAP financial measure should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies. The following table provides a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for the periods indicated. 

Three months ended June 30, Nine months ended June 30, $ in millions 2020 2019 2020 2019 Average equity $ 6,882 &#160; $ 6,434 &#160; $ 6,797 &#160; $ 6,345 &#160; Less: Average goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, net 603 &#160; 633 &#160; 606 &#160; 634 &#160; Average deferred tax liabilities, net (32) &#160; (31) &#160; (30) &#160; (32) &#160; Average tangible common equity $ 6,311 &#160; $ 5,832 &#160; $ 6,221 &#160; $ 5,743 &#160; Return on equity 10.0 % 16.1 % 11.9 % 16.2 % Return on tangible common equity 10.9 % 17.8 % 13.1 % 17.9 % 

Return on equity is computed by dividing annualized net income for the period indicated by average equity for each respective period or, in the case of return on tangible common equity, computed by dividing annualized net income by average tangible common equity for each respective period. 

Average equity for the quarter-to-date period is computed by adding the total equity attributable to RJF as of the date indicated to the prior quarter-end total, and dividing by two, or in the case of average tangible common equity, computed by adding tangible common equity as of the date indicated to the prior quarter-end total, and dividing by two. Average equity for the year-to-date period is computed by adding the total equity attributable to RJF as of each quarter-end date during the indicated year-to-date period to the beginning of the year total, and dividing by four, or in the case of average tangible common equity, computed by adding tangible common equity as of each quarter-end date during the indicated year-to-date period to the beginning of the year total, and dividing by four. 

NET INTEREST ANALYSIS 

In response to macroeconomic concerns resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, The Federal Reserve decreased its benchmark short-term interest rate twice in March 2020 to a range of 0-0.25%, for a total decrease of 150 basis points. These decreases in short-term interest rates, as well as the three rate cuts implemented in 2019 (225 basis points in total) have had a negative impact on our fiscal year 2020 results, as we have certain assets and liabilities, primarily held in our PCG, RJ Bank and Other segments, which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Fees we earn from third-party banks on client cash balances swept to such banks as part of the RJBDP are also sensitive to changes in interest rates. The negative impact of the decline in short-term interest rates outweighed the growth in interest-earning assets and RJBDP balances swept to third-party banks compared with the prior year, and we expect a continuation of this negative impact for the remainder of fiscal 2020. 

Given the relationship between our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities held in each of these segments and the nature of fees we earn from third-party banks on the RJBDP, decreases in short-term interest rates generally result in an overall decrease in our net earnings, although the magnitude of the impact to our net interest margin depends on the yields on interest-earning assets relative to the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, including deposit rates paid to clients on their cash balances. Conversely, any increases in short-term interest rates and/or decreases in the deposit rates paid to clients generally have a positive impact on our earnings. 

Refer to the discussion of the specific components of our net interest income within the &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations&#8221; of our PCG, RJ Bank, and Other segments. Also refer to &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations - Private Client Group - Clients&#8217; domestic cash sweep balances&#8221; for further information on the RJBDP. 

The following tables present our consolidated average balances, interest income and expense and the related yields and rates. Average balances are calculated on a daily basis, with the exception of Loans to financial advisors, net and Corporate cash and all other, which are calculated based on the average of the end-of-month balances for each month within the period.

(1) A portion of our &#8220;Assets in fee-based accounts&#8221; is invested in &#8220;managed programs&#8221; overseen by our Asset Management segment, specifically our Asset Management Services division of RJ&#38;A (&#8220;AMS&#8221;). These assets are included in our Financial assets under management as disclosed in the &#8220;Selected key metrics&#8221; section of our &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations - Asset Management.&#8221; 

Fee-based accounts within our PCG segment are comprised of a wide array of products and programs that we offer our clients. The majority of assets in fee-based accounts within our PCG segment are invested in programs for which our financial advisors provide investment advisory services, either on a discretionary or non-discretionary basis. Administrative services for such accounts (e.g., record-keeping) are generally performed by our Asset Management segment and, as a result, a portion of the related revenues is shared with the Asset Management segment. 

We also offer our clients fee-based accounts that are invested in &#8220;managed programs&#8221; overseen by AMS, which is part of our Asset Management segment. Fee-billable assets invested in managed programs are included in both &#8220;Assets in fee-based accounts&#8221; in the preceding table and &#8220;Financial assets under management&#8221; in the Asset Management segment. Revenues related to managed programs are shared by our PCG and Asset Management segments. The Asset Management segment receives a higher portion of the revenues related to accounts invested in managed programs, as compared to the portion received for non-managed programs, as it is performing portfolio management services in addition to administrative services. 

The vast majority of the revenues we earn from fee-based accounts are recorded in &#8220;Asset management and related administrative fees&#8221; on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Fees received from such accounts are based on the value of client assets in fee-based accounts and vary based on the specific account types in which the client participates and the level of assets in the client relationship. As fees for substantially all of such accounts are billed based on balances as of the beginning of the quarter, revenues from fee-based accounts may not be immediately affected by changes in asset values, but rather the impacts are seen in the following quarter. 

PCG assets under administration increased due to the net addition of financial advisors and equity market appreciation. In addition, PCG assets in fee-based accounts continued to increase as a percentage of overall PCG assets under administration due to clients&#8217; preference for fee-based alternatives versus transaction-based accounts. As a result of the shift to fee-based accounts over the past several years, a larger portion of our PCG revenues are more directly impacted by market movements.

Although the number of financial advisors increased from prior periods, the net addition of financial advisors was low relative to recent quarters as the COVID-19 pandemic impacted experienced financial advisor transitions, particularly in the employee channel due to office closures, and slowed the transitions of new trainees. While financial advisor recruiting activity has started to recover and the pipeline remains solid, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future recruiting is uncertain.

Clients&#8217; domestic cash sweep balances 

As of $ in millions June 30, 2020 March 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 September 30, 2019 June 30, 2019 RJBDP RJ Bank $ 24,101 &#160; $ 28,711 &#160; $ 21,891 &#160; $ 21,649 &#160; $ 21,600 &#160; Third-party banks 24,661 &#160; 20,379 &#160; 15,061 &#160; 14,043 &#160; 14,425 &#160; Subtotal RJBDP 48,762 &#160; 49,090 &#160; 36,952 &#160; 35,692 &#160; 36,025 &#160; Client Interest Program (&#8220;CIP&#8221;) 3,157 &#160; 3,782 &#160; 2,528 &#160; 2,022 &#160; 2,130 &#160; Total clients&#8217; domestic cash sweep balances

&#160; Three months ended June 30, Nine months ended June 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Average yield on RJBDP - third-party banks 

0.33 % 1.95 % 0.97 % 1.90 % 

A significant portion of our clients&#8217; cash is included in the RJBDP, a multi-bank sweep program in which clients&#8217; cash deposits in their accounts are swept into interest-bearing deposit accounts at RJ Bank and various third-party banks. We earn servicing fees for the administrative services we provide related to our clients&#8217; deposits that are swept to such banks as part of the RJBDP. The amounts from third-party banks are variable in nature and fluctuate based on client cash balances in the program, as well as the level of short-term interest rates and the interest paid to clients by the third-party banks on balances in the RJBDP. The &#8220;Average yield on RJBDP - third party banks&#8221; in the preceding table is computed by dividing annualized RJBDP fees from third-party banks, which are net of the interest expense paid to clients by the third-party banks, by the average daily RJBDP balance at third-party banks. The PCG segment also earns RJBDP servicing fees from RJ Bank, which are based on the number of accounts that are swept to RJ Bank. The fees from RJ Bank are eliminated in consolidation. 

RJBDP fees from third-party banks and the average yield on RJBDP (third-party banks) were negatively impacted by the significant decrease in short-term interest rates. The Federal Reserve decreased its benchmark short-term interest rate twice toward the end of our fiscal second quarter, to a range of 0-0.25%, a total decrease of 150 basis points. These decreases were in addition to the three rate cuts implemented during 2019 (225 basis points in total). Any additional decreases in short-term interest rates, increases in deposit rates paid to clients, and/or a significant decline in our clients&#8217; cash balances will have a negative impact on our earnings. Further, PCG segment results are impacted by changes in the allocation of client cash balances in the RJBDP between RJ Bank and third-party banks. 

Although lower compared with March 31, 2020, client cash balances remained elevated as of June 30, 2020 as a result of the market uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Quarter ended June 30, 2020 compared with the quarter ended June 30, 2019 

Net revenues of $1.25 billion decreased $102 million, or 8%, and pre-tax income of $91 million decreased $49 million, or 35%. 

Asset management and related administrative fees were largely unchanged, as assets in fee-based accounts at the beginning of the quarter were relatively flat compared with the beginning of the prior-year quarter. As assets in fee-based accounts are billed primarily on balances at the beginning of the quarter, the 16% increase in fee-based assets during the current quarter will positively impact asset management fees in our fiscal fourth quarter. 

Brokerage revenues decreased $27 million, or 8%, reflecting lower revenues from annuity products and lower mutual fund revenues. Offsetting these decreases was an increase in revenues from equities, ETFs, and fixed income products due to an increase in client activity. 

Account and service fees decreased $51 million, or 22%, due to the decline in RJBDP fees from third-party banks, driven by lower short-term interest rates compared with the prior-year quarter, which more than offset the impact of the significant increase in cash balances swept to such banks. 

Net interest income decreased $19 million, or 41%, driven by a decline in short-term interest rates, reducing the interest income earned on assets segregated pursuant to regulations and client margin loans, and a decline in average client margin loan balances. Partially offsetting the decrease in interest income, interest expense also decreased due to the impact of lower deposit rates paid on client cash balances in CIP. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Compensation-related expenses decreased $24 million, or 2%, due to lower compensable net revenues. Compensation-related expenses did not decrease at the same rate as net revenues, as a significant portion of the decline in net revenues related to net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks, which have no associated direct payout expense. 

Non-compensation expenses decreased $29 million, or 17%, primarily as a result of decreases in travel and conference-related expenses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as lower legal and regulatory reserves. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in communications and information processing expense. 

Nine months ended June 30, 2020 compared with the nine months ended June 30, 2019 

Net revenues of $4.16 billion increased $180 million, or 5%, and pre-tax income of $414 million decreased $22 million, or 5%. 

Asset management and related administrative fees increased $267 million, or 13%, primarily due to higher average assets in fee-based accounts at the beginning of each of the current-year quarterly billing periods compared with the prior-year periods. 

Brokerage revenues were flat as the impact of increased trading activity resulting from higher levels of market volatility in the current-year period, was offset by a decrease in mutual fund trails and lower revenues from annuity products. 

Account and service fees decreased $61 million, or 9%, driven by a decline in RJBDP fees from third-party banks, as a result of lower short-term interest rates, which more than offset the impact of the increase in cash balances swept to such banks. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in mutual fund service fees, and higher RJBDP fees from RJ Bank due to an increase in the number of accounts at RJ Bank. 

Net interest income decreased $33 million, or 24%, primarily driven by a decline in short-term interest rates, reducing the interest income earned on assets segregated pursuant to regulations and client margin loans. Partially offsetting the decrease in interest income, interest expense also decreased due to the impact of lower deposit rates paid on client cash balances in CIP. 

Compensation-related expenses increased $224 million, or 7%, primarily due to higher compensable net revenues. 

Non-compensation expenses decreased $22 million, or 5%, primarily as a result of decreases in conference and travel-related expenses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as lower legal reserves. Partially offsetting these decreases were increases in costs to support our growth.

Quarter ended June 30, 2020 compared with the quarter ended June 30, 2019 

Net revenues of $323 million increased $72 million, or 29%, and pre-tax income of $62 million increased $38 million, or 158%. 

Brokerage revenues increased $62 million, or 60%, due to an increase in fixed income and, to a lesser extent, equity brokerage revenues. The increase in brokerage revenues reflected an increase in client activity during the current-year quarter. Our trading inventory levels remain relatively low due to our risk mitigation efforts. 

Investment banking revenues increased $3 million, or 2%, due to an increase in both debt and equity underwriting revenues, as a result of increased market activity, particularly for debt underwritings. Offsetting the increase in underwriting revenues was a decline in the number of merger &#38; acquisition transactions compared with the prior-year quarter due to market uncertainty as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Merger &#38; acquisition and underwriting activity may be negatively impacted in future quarters if market uncertainty continues. 

Compensation-related expenses increased $35 million, or 22%, primarily due to the increase in revenues. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Non-compensation expenses decreased $1 million, or 1%, as lower business development costs as a result of less travel and conference-related expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic were partially offset by smaller increases across various expense categories. 

Nine months ended June 30, 2020 compared with the nine months ended June 30, 2019 

Net revenues of $881 million increased $100 million, or 13%, and pre-tax income of $119 million increased $42 million, or 55%. 

Brokerage revenues increased $105 million, or 34%, due to a significant increase in fixed income brokerage revenues, as well as an increase in equity brokerage revenues. The increase in fixed income brokerage revenues was primarily due to an increase in client activity during the current-year period, particularly toward the end of our fiscal second quarter and into our fiscal third quarter. Equity brokerage revenues were challenged earlier in the year, but increased during our fiscal second and third quarters due to strong client activity driven by market volatility as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Investment banking revenues decreased $15 million, or 4%, due to a significant decline in merger &#38; acquisition activity compared with a strong period-year period. This activity was negatively impacted by the uncertainty caused by COVID-19 during the current-year period. Offsetting the decrease was an increase in both equity and debt underwriting net revenues, with an increase in the number of deals, as well as larger individual transactions. 

Compensation-related expenses increased $59 million, or 12%, primarily due to the increase in revenues. 

Non-compensation expenses were unchanged compared with the prior-year period, as increases in professional fees and other expenses were offset by a loss in the prior-year period of $15 million associated with the sale of our operations related to research, sales and trading of European equities.

Selected key metrics 

Managed programs 

Management fees recorded in our Asset Management segment are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of our fee-billable financial assets under management (&#8220;AUM&#8221;). These AUM include the portion of fee-based AUA in our PCG segment that is invested in programs overseen by our Asset Management segment (included in the &#8220;AMS&#8221; line of the following table), as well as retail accounts managed on behalf of third-party institutions, institutional accounts and proprietary mutual funds that we manage (collectively included in the &#8220;Carillon Tower Advisers&#8221; line of the following table). 

Revenues related to fee-based AUA in our PCG segment are shared by the PCG and Asset Management segments, the amount of which depends on whether clients are invested in assets that are in managed programs overseen by our Asset Management segment and the administrative services provided (see our &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations - Private Client Group&#8221; for more information). Our AUM in AMS are impacted by market fluctuations and net inflows or outflows of assets, including transfers between fee-based accounts and transaction-based accounts within our PCG segment. 

Revenues earned by Carillon Tower Advisers for retail accounts managed on behalf of third-party institutions, institutional accounts and our proprietary mutual funds are recorded entirely in the Asset Management segment. Our AUM in Carillon Tower Advisers are impacted by market and investment performance and net inflows or outflows of assets. 

Fees are generally collected quarterly. Approximately 60% of these fees are based on balances as of the beginning of the quarter, approximately 15% are based on balances as of the end of the quarter, and approximately 25% are based on average daily balances throughout the quarter.

Carillon Tower Advisers 

Assets managed by Carillon Tower Advisers include assets managed by its subsidiaries and affiliates: Eagle Asset Management, ClariVest Asset Management, Cougar Global Investments and the Scout Group. The following table presents Carillon Tower Advisers&#8217; AUM by objective, excluding assets for which it does not exercise discretion, as well as the approximate average client fee rate earned on such assets for the periods presented.

The preceding table includes assets held in certain non-discretionary asset-based programs for which the Asset Management segment does not exercise discretion but provides administrative support (including for affiliated entities). The increase in assets over the prior-year level was primarily due to clients moving to fee-based accounts from transaction-based accounts, successful financial advisor recruiting and retention, and equity market appreciation. The increase in assets during our fiscal third quarter was primarily due to the recovery of equity markets from the decline in the fiscal second quarter caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As administrative fees associated with these programs are predominantly based on balances at the beginning of the quarter, the 17% increase in assets during the fiscal third quarter will positively impact our fiscal fourth quarter revenues.

The preceding table includes assets held in asset-based programs in RJ Trust (including those managed for affiliated entities). 

Quarter ended June 30, 2020 compared with the quarter ended June 30, 2019 

Net revenues of $163 million decreased $14 million, or 8%, and pre-tax income of $60 million decreased $5 million, or 8%. 

Asset management and related administrative fee revenues decreased $8 million, or 5%, primarily due to lower average financial assets under management at Carillon Tower Advisers, largely as a result of net outflows since the prior-year quarter, as well as the significant equity market decline in March 2020, which has since largely rebounded. Although AMS financial assets under management were higher than at the end of the prior-year quarter, revenues decreased as assets in these programs are billed based on balances as of the beginning of the quarter, which reflected the significant equity market decline in our fiscal second quarter due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in these assets as of June 30, 2020, primarily due to the market recovery in our fiscal third quarter, will positively affect our fiscal fourth quarter results. 

Account and service fees declined $5 million, or 63%, primarily due to a decline in servicing fees related to the money market sweep program, which was discontinued in June 2019. A significant portion of these revenues were offset by fees paid to PCG related to the money market sweep program, which were reflected in Other expenses and eliminated in consolidation. 

Compensation expenses decreased $3 million, or 6%, and non-compensation expenses decreased $6 million, or 9%. The decrease in non-compensation expenses was primarily due to a decline in travel-related expenses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and a decline in fees paid to PCG related to the aforementioned discontinuance of the money market sweep program. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Nine months ended June 30, 2020 compared with the nine months ended June 30, 2019 

Net revenues of $531 million increased $18 million, or 4%, and pre-tax income of $206 million increased $22 million, or 12%. 

Asset management and related administrative fees increased $35 million, or 7%, driven by higher assets in non-discretionary asset-based programs at the beginning of each of the current-year quarterly billing periods compared with the prior-year period, as well as higher average financial assets under management during the current-year period. 

Account and service fees declined $15 million, or 56%, primarily due to a decline in servicing fees related to the money market sweep program, which was discontinued in June 2019. 

Non-compensation expenses decreased $3 million, or 2%, primarily due to the aforementioned decline in fees paid to PCG associated with the money market sweep program, which was discontinued in June 2019, and lower travel-related expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by an increase in investment sub-advisory fees resulting from an increase in assets under management in sub-advised programs.

Quarter ended June 30, 2020 compared with the quarter ended June 30, 2019 

Net revenues of $178 million decreased $37 million, or 17%, and pre-tax income of $14 million decreased $124 million, or 90%. 

Net interest income decreased $39 million, or 19%, as the negative impact from lower short-term rates offset the higher interest-earning assets. The increase in average interest-earning assets was driven by growth in average cash balances of $1.99 billion, average available-for-sale securities portfolio of $1.54 billion, and average loans of $1.38 billion. The net interest margin decreased to 2.29% from 3.37% due to the significant decline in short-term interest rates and the corresponding decline in LIBOR, the rate on which the pricing for most of RJ Bank&#8217;s assets is based. Based on current LIBOR rates, we expect our net interest margin to further decline to 2.1% - 2.2% over the next two quarters. 

The loan loss provision was $81 million compared to a $5 million benefit in the prior-year quarter. The increase in the provision in the current-year quarter was in response to continued deterioration of macroeconomic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and included write-downs on certain corporate loans sold during the quarter. Continued deterioration of macroeconomic conditions will likely require us to increase our allowance for loan losses in the future or to experience loan losses in excess of

current reserves. Additional sales of certain corporate loans are also expected in the fiscal fourth quarter to further reduce credit risk in certain sectors. 

Compensation expenses were flat compared with the prior-year quarter, while non-compensation expenses (excluding the provision for loan losses) increased $1 million.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. The following table shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities. The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous period&#8217;s average yield/cost. Similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average yield/cost by the previous year&#8217;s volume. Changes attributable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately.

Nine months ended June 30, 2020 compared with the nine months ended June 30, 2019 

Net revenues of $604 million decreased $26 million, or 4%, and pre-tax income of $163 million decreased $221 million, or 58%. 

Net interest income decreased $26 million, or 4%, as the negative impact from lower short-term interest rates more than offset higher interest-earning assets. The increase in average interest-earning assets was primarily driven by growth in average loans of $1.38 billion, average cash balances of $847 million, and an $823 million increase in our average available-for-sale securities portfolio. The net interest margin for the current-year period decreased to 2.82% from 3.32% for the prior-year period. 

The loan loss provision was $188 million, compared to $16 million in the prior-year period. The increase in the provision in the current-year period was primarily attributable to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic during the current-year period as well as the aforementioned corporate loan sales. 

Compensation and benefits expenses increased $2 million due to annual raises and increased staffing levels to support our continued growth. 

Non-compensation expenses (excluding the provision for loan losses) increased $21 million, including an $11 million, or 9%, increase in fees for RJBDP paid to PCG, primarily driven by an increase in the number of accounts. These fees are eliminated in consolidation.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. The following table shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities. The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous period&#8217;s average yield/cost. Similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average yield/cost by the previous year&#8217;s volume. Changes attributable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Quarter ended June 30, 2020 compared with the quarter ended June 30, 2019 

The pre-tax loss of $29 million was $4 million larger than the loss generated in the prior-year quarter. 

Net revenues for the current quarter decreased $16 million due to a $9 million decrease in interest income earned on corporate cash balances due to lower short-term interest rates, which more than offset the increase in average balances, as well as a $7 million increase in interest expense due to the issuance of $500 million of senior notes in March 2020. 

Non-interest expenses decreased $12 million, or 57%, primarily due to a decrease in compensation expenses due to lower earnings. 

Nine months ended June 30, 2020 compared with the nine months ended June 30, 2019 

The pre-tax loss of $106 million was $46 million larger than the loss generated in the prior-year period. 

Net revenues decreased $70 million from a loss of $2 million in the prior-year period to a loss of $72 million, primarily due to $40 million of private equity valuation losses, compared with gains of $8 million in the prior-year period. In the current-year period, $23 million of the losses on private equity investments were attributable to noncontrolling interests, which are reflected as an offset within other expenses. These valuation losses were primarily the result of the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on certain of our investments. Interest income earned on corporate cash balances also decreased due to lower short-term interest rates, partially offset by the impact of higher average balances, and interest expense increased as a result of the aforementioned issuance of $500 million of senior notes. 

Non-interest expenses decreased $24 million, or 41%, primarily due to the aforementioned $23 million offset of private equity valuation losses attributable to noncontrolling interests. 

CERTAIN STATISTICAL DISCLOSURES BY BANK HOLDING COMPANIES 

We are required to provide certain statistical disclosures as a bank holding company under the SEC&#8217;s Industry Guide 3. The following table provides certain of those disclosures.

Average assets for the quarter is computed by adding total assets as of the date indicated to the prior quarter-end total, and dividing by two. Average assets for the year-to-date period is computed by adding total assets as of each quarter-end date during the year-to-date period to the beginning of the year total, and dividing by four. 

Return on equity is computed by dividing annualized net income for the period indicated by average equity for each respective period. Average equity for the quarter is computed by adding total equity attributable to RJF as of the date indicated to the prior quarter-end total, and dividing by two. Average equity for the year-to-date period is computed by adding total equity attributable to RJF as of each quarter-end date during the year-to-date period to the beginning of the year total, and dividing by four. 

Average equity to average assets is computed by dividing average equity by average assets, as calculated in accordance with the previous explanations. 

Dividend payout ratio is computed by dividing dividends declared per common share during the period by earnings per diluted common share for the period.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Liquidity is essential to our business. The primary goal of our liquidity management activities is to ensure adequate funding to conduct our business over a range of economic and market environments. 

Senior management establishes our liquidity and capital management framework. This framework includes senior management&#8217;s review of short- and long-term cash flow forecasts, review of monthly capital expenditures, monitoring of the availability of alternative sources of financing, and daily monitoring of liquidity in our significant subsidiaries. Our decisions on the allocation of capital to our business units consider, among other factors, projected profitability and cash flow, risk, and impact on future liquidity needs. Our treasury department assists in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the impact that our business activities have on our financial condition, liquidity and capital structure, and maintains our relationships with various lenders. The objective of this framework is to support the successful execution of our business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity. 

Liquidity is provided primarily through our business operations and financing activities. Financing activities could include bank borrowings, repurchase agreement transactions or additional capital raising activities under our &#8220;universal&#8221; shelf registration statement. 

Cash and cash equivalents increased $1.68 billion to $5.63 billion during the nine months ended June 30, 2020, primarily due to $3.26 billion of cash provided by financing activities and $2.66 billion of cash provided by operating activities, offset by cash used in investing activities of $3.02 billion and an increase in the amount of cash required to be segregated pursuant to regulations of $1.19 billion. Cash provided by financing activities primarily related to an increase in bank deposits, as client cash balances increased due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and proceeds from our senior notes issuance in March 2020, partially offset by our open-market share repurchases and dividends on our common stock. Cash used in investing activities primarily related to a net increase in our available-for-sale securities portfolio due to our growth strategy for this portfolio, and a net increase in bank loans. 

We believe our existing assets, most of which are liquid in nature, together with funds generated from operations and available from committed and uncommitted financing facilities provide adequate funds for continuing operations at current levels of activity. 

Sources of liquidity 

Over $2.1 billion of our total June 30, 2020 cash and cash equivalents included cash on hand at the parent, as well as parent cash loaned to RJ&#38;A. The following table presents our holdings of cash and cash equivalents. 

$ in millions June 30, 2020 RJF $ 479 &#160; RJ&#38;A 2,603 &#160; RJ Bank 1,519 &#160; RJ Ltd. 662 &#160; RJFS 123 &#160; Carillon Tower Advisers 69 &#160; Other subsidiaries 177 &#160; Total cash and cash equivalents $ 5,632 &#160; 

RJF maintained depository accounts at RJ Bank with a balance of $ 185 million as of June 30, 2020. The portion of this total that was available on demand without restrictions, which amounted to $108 million as of June 30, 2020, is reflected in the RJF total (and is excluded from the RJ Bank cash balance in the preceding table). 

RJF had loaned $1.66 billion to RJ&#38;A as of June 30, 2020 (such amount is included in the RJ&#38;A cash balance in the preceding table), which RJ&#38;A has invested on behalf of RJF in cash and cash equivalents or otherwise deployed in its normal business activities. 

In addition to the cash balances described, we have various other potential sources of cash available to the parent from subsidiaries, as described in the following section. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Liquidity available from subsidiaries 

Liquidity is principally available to RJF, the parent company, from RJ&#38;A and RJ Bank. 

Certain of our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the requirements of the Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. As a member firm of FINRA, RJ&#38;A is subject to FINRA&#8217;s capital requirements, which are substantially the same as Rule 15c3-1. Rule 15c3-1 provides for an &#8220;alternative net capital requirement,&#8221; which RJ&#38;A has elected. Regulations require that minimum net capital, as defined, be equal to the greater of $1.5 million or 2% of aggregate debit items arising from client transactions. In addition, covenants in RJ&#38;A&#8217;s committed financing facilities require its net capital to be a minimum of 10% of aggregate debit items. At June 30, 2020, RJ&#38;A significantly exceeded the minimum regulatory requirements, the covenants in its financing arrangements pertaining to net capital, as well as its internally-targeted net capital tolerances. FINRA may impose certain restrictions, such as restricting withdrawals of equity capital, if a member firm were to fall below a certain threshold or fail to meet minimum net capital requirements. 

RJ&#38;A, as a nonbank custodian of Individual Retirement Accounts (&#8220;IRAs&#8221;), must also satisfy certain Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) regulations in order to accept new IRA and plan accounts and retain the accounts for which it serves as nonbank custodian. To maintain adequate net worth under these regulations, RJ&#38;A may have to limit dividends to RJF. We evaluate regulatory requirements, loan covenants and certain internal tolerances when determining the amount of liquidity available to RJF from RJ&#38;A. 

RJ Bank may pay dividends to RJF without prior approval of its regulator as long as the dividend does not exceed the sum of RJ Bank&#8217;s current calendar year and the previous two calendar years&#8217; retained net income, and RJ Bank maintains its targeted regulatory capital ratios. At June 30, 2020, RJ Bank had $274 million of capital in excess of the amount it would need at that date to maintain its targeted regulatory capital ratios, and could pay a dividend of such amount without requiring prior approval of its regulator. 

Although we have liquidity available to us from our other subsidiaries, the available amounts are not as significant as those previously described and, in certain instances, may be subject to regulatory requirements. 

Borrowings and financing arrangements 

Committed financing arrangements 

Our ability to borrow is dependent upon compliance with the conditions in our various loan agreements and, in the case of secured borrowings, collateral eligibility requirements. Our committed financing arrangements consist of a tri-party repurchase agreement or, in the case of the Credit Facility, an unsecured line of credit. The required market value of the collateral associated with the committed secured facility ranges from 105% to 125% of the amount financed. 

The following table presents our committed financing arrangements with third-party lenders, which we generally utilize to finance a portion of our fixed income trading instruments, and the outstanding balances related thereto.

(1) The Credit Facility provides for maximum borrowings of up to $500 million, with a sublimit of $300 million for RJF. RJ&#38;A may borrow up to $500 million under the Credit Facility, depending on the amount of outstanding borrowings by RJF. For additional details on our committed unsecured financing arrangement, see our discussion of the Credit Facility in Note 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Uncommitted financing arrangements 

Our uncommitted financing arrangements are in the form of secured lines of credit, secured bilateral or tri-party repurchase agreements, or unsecured lines of credit. Our arrangements with third-party lenders are generally utilized to finance a portion of our fixed income securities or for cash management purposes. Our uncommitted secured financing arrangements generally require us to post collateral in excess of the amount borrowed. As of June 30, 2020, we had outstanding borrowings under two uncommitted secured borrowing arrangements with lenders out of a total of 11 uncommitted financing arrangements (seven uncommitted secured and four uncommitted unsecured). However, lenders are under no contractual obligation to lend to us under uncommitted credit facilities. 

The following table presents our borrowings on uncommitted financing arrangements, all of which were in RJ&#38;A. 

$ in millions June 30, 2020 Outstanding borrowing amount: Uncommitted secured $ 228 &#160; Uncommitted unsecured &#8212; &#160; Total outstanding borrowing amount 

$ 228 &#160; 

Other financings 

RJ Bank had $875 million in FHLB borrowings outstanding at June 30, 2020, comprised of floating-rate advances totaling $850 million and a $25 million fixed-rate advance, all of which were secured by a blanket lien on RJ Bank&#8217;s residential mortgage loan portfolio (see Note 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding these borrowings). RJ Bank had an additional $2.96 billion in immediate credit available from the FHLB as of June 30, 2020 and, with the pledge of additional eligible collateral to the FHLB, total available credit of 30% of total assets. 

RJ Bank is eligible to participate in the FRB&#8217;s discount-window program; however, we do not view borrowings from the FRB as a primary source of funding. The credit available in this program is subject to periodic review, may be terminated or reduced at the discretion of the FRB, and is secured by pledged C&#38;I loans. 

We act as an intermediary between broker-dealers and other financial institutions whereby we borrow securities from one broker-dealer and then lend them to another. Where permitted, we have also loaned, to broker-dealers and other financial institutions, securities owned by clients or the firm. We account for each of these types of transactions as collateralized agreements and financings, with the outstanding balances related to the securities loaned included in &#8220;Securities loaned&#8221; on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition of this Form 10-Q, in the amount of $88 million as of June 30, 2020. See Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for more information on our securities borrowed and securities loaned. 

From time to time we enter into repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements. We account for each of these types of transactions as collateralized agreements and financings, with the outstanding balances of the repurchase agreements included in &#8220;Securities sold under agreements to repurchase&#8221; on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition of this Form 10-Q, in the amount of $228 million as of June 30, 2020. These balances are reflected in the preceding table of uncommitted financing arrangements. Such financings are generally collateralized by non-customer, RJ&#38;A-owned securities or by securities that we have received as collateral under reverse repurchase agreements.

At June 30, 2020, in addition to the financing arrangements previously described, we had $15 million outstanding on a mortgage loan for our St. Petersburg, Florida home-office complex that is included in &#8220;Other borrowings&#8221; on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition of this Form 10-Q. 

At June 30, 2020, we had aggregate outstanding senior notes payable of $2.04 billion. Our senior notes payable, exclusive of any unaccreted premiums or discounts and debt issuance costs, was comprised of $250 million par 5.625% senior notes due 2024, $500 million par 3.625% senior notes due 2026, $500 million par 4.65% senior notes due 2030, which were issued during our fiscal second quarter of 2020, and $800 million par 4.95% senior notes due 2046. See Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for additional information. 

Our issuer and senior long-term debt ratings as of the most current report are detailed in the following table. 

Rating Agency Rating Outlook Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Ratings Services BBB+ Stable Moody&#8217;s Investors Services Baa1 Stable 

Our current long-term debt ratings depend upon a number of factors, including industry dynamics, operating and economic environment, operating results, operating margins, earnings trends and volatility, balance sheet composition, liquidity and liquidity management, capital structure, overall risk management, business diversification and market share, and competitive position in the markets in which we operate. Deteriorations in any of these factors could impact our credit ratings. Any rating downgrades could increase our costs in the event we were to obtain additional financing. 

Should our credit rating be downgraded prior to a public debt offering, it is probable that we would have to offer a higher rate of interest to bond holders. A downgrade to below investment grade may make a public debt offering difficult to execute on terms we would consider to be favorable. A downgrade below investment grade could result in the termination of certain derivative contracts and the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request immediate payment or demand immediate and ongoing overnight collateralization on our derivative instruments in liability positions (see Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for additional information). A credit downgrade could damage our reputation and result in certain counterparties limiting their business with us, result in negative comments by analysts, potentially negatively impact investor and/or clients&#8217; perception of us, and cause a decline in our stock price. None of our borrowing arrangements contains a condition or event of default related to our credit ratings. However, a credit downgrade would result in the firm incurring a higher facility fee on the $500 million Credit Facility, in addition to triggering a higher interest rate applicable to any borrowings outstanding on that line as of and subsequent to such downgrade. Conversely, an improvement in RJF&#8217;s current credit rating could have a favorable impact on the facility fee, as well as the interest rate applicable to any borrowings on such line. 

Other sources and uses of liquidity 

We have company-owned life insurance policies which are utilized to fund certain non-qualified deferred compensation plans and other employee benefit plans. Certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans and other employee benefit plans are employee-directed while others are company-directed. Certain policies which we could readily borrow against had a cash surrender value of $610 million as of June 30, 2020, comprised of $363 million related to employee-directed plans and $247 million related to company-directed plans, and we were able to borrow up to 90%, or $549 million, of the June 30, 2020 total without restriction. To effect any such borrowing, the underlying investments would be converted to money market investments, therefore requiring us to 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

take market risk related to the employee-directed plans. There were no borrowings outstanding against any of these policies as of June 30, 2020. 

On May 18, 2018, we filed a &#8220;universal&#8221; shelf registration statement with the SEC pursuant to which we can issue debt, equity and other capital instruments if and when necessary or perceived by us to be opportune. Subject to certain conditions, this registration statement will be effective through May 18, 2021. 

See the Contractual obligations section of this MD&#38;A for information regarding our contractual obligations. 

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION ANALYSIS 

The assets on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition consisted primarily of cash and cash equivalents (a large portion of which is segregated for the benefit of clients), receivables including bank loans, financial instruments held either for trading purposes or as investments, and other assets. A significant portion of our assets were liquid in nature, providing us with flexibility in financing our business. 

Total assets of $44.68 billion as of June 30, 2020 were $5.85 billion, or 15%, greater than our total assets as of September 30, 2019. The increase in assets was primarily due to a $2.87 billion increase in cash and cash and cash equivalents, including cash and cash equivalents segregated pursuant to regulations, primarily due to a significant increase in client cash balances due to the market volatility as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as proceeds from our $500 million senior notes issuance in March 2020. In addition, available-for-sale securities increased $2.54 billion, other assets increased $552 million, primarily due to ROU assets recorded as a result of the adoption of new guidance related to the accounting for leases, and bank loans, net increased $332 million. Offsetting these increases, trading instruments and brokerage client receivables, net decreased $347 million and $325 million, respectively. 

As of June 30, 2020, our total liabilities of $37.67 billion were $5.48 billion, or 17%, greater than our total liabilities as of September 30, 2019. The increase in total liabilities was primarily related to the significant increase in client cash balances and was comprised of a $3.09 billion increase in bank deposits, reflecting higher RJBDP balances held at RJ Bank and certificate of deposit issuances during the period, and a $1.59 billion increase in brokerage client payables, primarily due to an increase in client cash held in our CIP as of June 30, 2020. In addition, other payables increased $725 million, primarily due to operating lease liabilities recorded as a result of the adoption of new guidance related to the accounting for leases and an increase in payables resulting from unsettled securities purchases. In addition, senior notes payable increased $494 million due to the issuance of $500 million of 4.65% senior notes due April 2030. 

See Notes 2 and 10 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for further information on our adoption of the new leasing guidance. 

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 

In March 2020, we sold in a registered underwritten public offering $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.65% senior notes due April 2030. Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our senior notes. 

Other than the item previously described, there were no other changes to the contractual obligations presented in our 2019 Form 10-K, other than in the ordinary course of business. See Note 15 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our commitments as of June 30, 2020. 

REGULATORY 

Refer to the discussion of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the impact on our operations of certain rules and regulations in &#8220;Item 1 - Business - Regulation&#8221; and &#8220;Item 7 - Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Regulatory&#8221; of our 2019 Form 10-K. 

RJF and many of its subsidiaries are each subject to various regulatory capital requirements. As of June 30, 2020, all of our active regulated domestic and international subsidiaries had net capital in excess of minimum requirements. In addition, RJF and RJ Bank were categorized as &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; as of June 30, 2020. The maintenance of certain risk-based and other regulatory capital levels could influence various capital allocation decisions impacting one or more of our businesses. However, due to the current 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

capital position of RJF and its regulated subsidiaries, we do not anticipate these capital requirements will have a negative impact on our future business activities. 

Legislative and regulatory changes in connection with COVID-19 

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in governments around the world implementing several measures to help control the spread of the virus, including, among others, quarantines, travel restrictions and business curtailments. In addition, governments globally intervened with fiscal policy to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (&#8220;CARES&#8221;) Act in the U.S., which aimed to provide economic relief to businesses and individuals. 

The CARES Act includes a broad range of provisions intended to support the U.S. economy. Among its provisions, the act allocates funds for a new Paycheck Protection Program that expands an existing Small Business Administration (&#8220;SBA&#8221;) loan guarantee program for small businesses to keep their employees on payroll and make other eligible payments. Currently, the firm does not act as a lender under these programs and facilities, and has no plans to do so. 

The CARES Act also provides certain temporary regulatory relief for financial institutions, including RJF and its subsidiaries. The act permits financial institutions to temporarily suspend any determination of a loan modified as a result of the effects of COVID-19 as being a TDR, including impairment for accounting purposes. We elected to apply the CARES Act relief to certain loan modifications that relate to short-term payment deferrals and have not classified such modifications as TDRs. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management - Credit risk&#8221; for further information on the impact of such loan modifications. The act also permits financial institutions to temporarily delay the implementation of CECL for estimating allowances for credit losses. Given our later adoption date of October 1, 2020, we do not anticipate delaying our adoption. In addition, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC issued a joint statement providing banking organizations optional temporary relief by delaying the initial adoption impact of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided during 2020 and 2021 (i.e., a five-year transition period). As we do not adopt CECL until October 1, 2020, we are currently evaluating whether we intend to avail ourselves of such relief. 

The CARES Act grants potential tax relief and liquidity to businesses, including corporate tax provisions that: temporarily allow for the carryback of net operating losses and remove limitations on the use of loss carryforwards, increase interest expense deduction limitations, and allow accelerated depreciation deductions on certain asset improvements. In addition, the CARES Act allows employers to defer the payment, including the deposit, of payroll taxes for the 2020 calendar year from March 27, 2020 until December 31, 2021 for 50 percent of such taxes and December 31, 2022 for the remaining 50 percent. 

The CARES Act further provides a number of consumer finance protections. The act provides a range of forbearance rights with respect to any federally backed residential or multi-family mortgage loan and generally limits the ability of a lender or servicer to institute foreclosure or similar proceedings. The act additionally imposes a moratorium on evictions from dwellings of many tenants. These provisions are consistent with supervisory guidance previously issued by federal banking agencies, which also stated that they would not criticize financial institutions for working with customers affected by the outbreak in a safe and sound manner. We have modified our processes to ensure full compliance and are working as appropriate to support affected businesses and individuals during this time. 

In addition to guidance regarding supporting customers, federal banking agencies have also taken a number of other actions. The Federal Reserve, for example, has taken active steps to inject liquidity into the economy. The Federal Reserve has reduced the benchmark interest rate in an attempt to stimulate the economy. As previously mentioned, this has and will continue to negatively impact our net interest earnings. In addition, the Federal Reserve has established a number of new facilities, including to provide liquidity for issuers of commercial paper, money market funds, new bond and loan issuances, outstanding corporate bonds, primary dealers, and small and medium-sized businesses, and has reduced the interest rates on borrowings under its discount window. 

Many state and local authorities have also taken, or are considering taking, legislative, executive, or other action to respond to the economic disruptions caused by the spread of COVID-19, including with respect to foreclosure and repossession moratoriums. 

The Company&#8217;s legislative and regulatory environment is continually changing in response to the outbreak of COVID-19, and new or modified laws, regulations and guidance may be promulgated at very short notice. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

The Volcker Rule 

In June 2020, the Fed, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, FDIC, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#8220;OCC&#8221;) and the SEC finalized amendments to the rules implementing the Volcker Rule. The final rule includes new exclusions from the Volcker Rule&#8217;s general prohibition on banking entities investing in and sponsoring private equity funds, hedge funds, and certain other investment vehicles (collectively, &#8220;covered funds&#8221;) for credit funds, venture capital funds, family wealth management vehicles, and customer facilitation vehicles. The final rule also revises existing exclusions for foreign public funds, loan securitizations, and public welfare and small business funds. In addition, the final rule modifies the &#8220;Super 23&#8221; provisions of the Volcker Rule, which prohibit banking entities from extending credit to and entering into certain transactions with advised or sponsored covered funds, by exempting certain short-term extensions of credit, among several other previously prohibited transactions. 

Many of the amendments contained in the final rule address aspects of the existing regulations that have, since their adoption in 2013, proven in practice to be complex and burdensome or to have unintended consequences. The final rule is intended to clarify and simplify compliance with the implementing regulations and permit additional fund activities that do not present the risks that the Volcker Rule was intended to address. 

The final rule will become effective on October 1, 2020 for all banking entities subject to the Volcker Rule, including RJF and its subsidiaries. 

Community Reinvestment Act regulations 

The OCC issued a final rule comprehensively amending the Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) regulations applicable to RJ Bank and other OCC-regulated banks in May 2020. At the core of the OCC&#8217;s final rule is a set of new general performance standards that establish more quantitative measures of CRA performance than the tests set forth in existing CRA regulations. 

While RJ Bank will be required to comply with the final rule by January 2023, the OCC has deferred to a future rulemaking process the important decision of how key thresholds and benchmarks used in the rule will be applied to determine the level of performance necessary to achieve a particular performance rating. As a result, the final rule creates some uncertainty for RJ Bank and other OCC-regulated banks in planning their CRA activities until that decision in made. 

Neither the FDIC nor the Fed joined the OCC in issuing the final rule. State-chartered banks will therefore continue to operate under the FDIC&#8217;s and Fed&#8217;s existing CRA regulations rather than the final rule. In June 2020, certain organizations filed suit against the OCC asking a court to issue an order setting the rule aside, while in the same month, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval in an attempt to nullify the rule. These developments create further uncertainty for RJ Bank and others in planning their CRA activities. 

Fiduciary duty 

In June 2019, the SEC adopted a package of rulemakings and interpretations related to the provision of advice by broker-dealers and investment advisers, including Regulation Best Interest and Form CRS. Among other things, Regulation Best Interest requires a broker-dealer to act in the best interest of a retail customer when making a recommendation to that customer of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities. Form CRS requires that broker-dealers and investment advisers provide retail investors with a brief summary document containing simple, easy-to-understand information about the nature of the relationship between the parties. As of June 30, 2020, we are now required to comply with Regulation Best Interest and Form CRS. Implementation of the regulations required us to review and modify our policies and procedures, as well as associated supervisory and compliance controls, satisfy additional disclosure obligations, and provide related education and training to financial advisors, which has led to additional costs. Additionally, various states have proposed, or adopted, laws and regulations seeking to impose new standards of conduct on broker-dealers that may differ from the SEC&#8217;s new regulations, which will lead to additional implementation costs. The Department of Labor (&#8220;DOL&#8221;) has also reinstated the historical &#8220;five-part test&#8221; for determining who is an investment advice &#8220;fiduciary&#8221; when dealing with certain retirement plans and accounts and proposed a new exemption to allow investment advice fiduciaries to receive transaction-based compensation and engage in certain principal trades. We are studying and evaluating the proposal. The total impact of the DOL change on our business will not be fully known until the proposal is finalized and could lead to additional costs.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

The condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during any reporting period in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Management has established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure the appropriateness of such estimates and assumptions and their consistent application from period to period. For a description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Due to their nature, estimates involve judgment based upon available information. Actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Therefore, understanding these critical accounting estimates is important in understanding our reported results of operations and financial position. We believe that of our accounting estimates and assumptions, those described in the following sections involve a high degree of judgment and complexity. Recent market disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic have made it more challenging for us to determine the amount of our allowance for loan losses and the fair value of certain of our assets, particularly our private equity investments. The current circumstances have required a greater reliance on judgment than in recent periods in determining these amounts as of June 30, 2020. 

Valuation of financial instruments 

The use of fair value to measure financial instruments, with related gains or losses recognized in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income, is fundamental to our financial statements and our risk management processes. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our 2019 Form 10-K for a discussion of our fair value accounting policies regarding financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold but not yet purchased. See Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for additional information on our financial instruments at fair value. 

Loss provisions 

Refer to &#8220;Item 7 - Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical accounting estimates - Loss provisions&#8221; of our 2019 Form 10-K for more information. 

Loss provisions for legal and regulatory matters 

The recorded amount of liabilities related to legal and regulatory matters is subject to significant management judgment. For a description of the significant estimates and judgments associated with establishing such accruals, see the &#8220;Contingent liabilities&#8221; section of Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our 2019 Form 10-K. In addition, refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for information regarding legal and regulatory matter contingencies as of June 30, 2020. 

Loan loss provisions arising from operations of RJ Bank 

We provide an allowance for loan losses which reflects our continuing evaluation of the probable losses inherent in RJ Bank&#8217;s loan portfolio. See the discussion regarding our methodology in estimating the allowance for loan losses in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our 2019 Form 10-K. See Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for additional information on our bank loans. 

At June 30, 2020, the amortized cost of all RJ Bank loans was $21.56 billion and the allowance for loan losses was $334 million, which was 1.56% of the held for investment loan portfolio. 

Our process of evaluating probable loan losses includes a complex analysis of several quantitative and qualitative factors, requiring management judgment. As a result, the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses. In such an event, any losses in excess of our allowance would result in a decrease in our net income, as well as a decrease in the level of regulatory capital.

RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS 

For information regarding our recent accounting developments, see Note 2 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

EFFECTS OF INFLATION 

Our assets are primarily liquid in nature and are not significantly affected by inflation. However, the rate of inflation affects our expenses, including employee compensation, communications and information processing, and occupancy costs, which may not be readily recoverable through charges for services we provide to our clients. In addition, to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has adverse effects upon the securities markets, it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. 

RISK MANAGEMENT 

Risks are an inherent part of our business and activities. Management of these risks is critical to our fiscal soundness and profitability. Our risk management processes are multi-faceted and require communication, judgment and knowledge of financial products and markets. We have a formal Enterprise Risk Management (&#8220;ERM&#8221;) program to assess and review aggregate risks across the firm. Our management takes an active role in the ERM process, which requires specific administrative and business functions to participate in the identification, assessment, monitoring and control of various risks. 

The principal risks related to our business activities are market, credit, liquidity, operational, model, and compliance. 

Governance 

Our Board of Directors oversees the firm&#8217;s management and mitigation of risk, setting a culture that encourages ethical conduct and risk management throughout the firm. Senior management communicates and reinforces this culture through three lines of risk management and a number of senior-level management committees. Our first line of risk management, which includes all of our businesses, owns its risks and is responsible for helping to identify, escalate, and mitigate risks arising from its day-to-day activities. The second line of risk management, which includes the Compliance, Legal, and Risk Management departments, supports and provides guidance, advice, and oversight to client-facing businesses and other first-line risk management functions in identifying and mitigating risk. The second line of risk management also tests and monitors the effectiveness of controls, escalates risks when appropriate, and reports on these risks. The third line of risk management, Internal Audit, independently reviews activities conducted by the previous lines of risk management to assess their management and mitigation of risk, providing additional assurance to the Board of Directors and senior management, with a view toward enhancing our oversight, management, and mitigation of risk. 

Market risk 

Market risk is our risk of loss resulting from the impact of changes in market prices on our trading inventory, derivatives and investment positions. We have exposure to market risk primarily through our broker-dealer trading operations and, to a lesser extent, through our banking operations. See &#8220;Item 7 - Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management - Market risk&#8221; of our 2019 Form 10-K for a discussion of our market risk, including how we manage such risk. See Notes 3, 4 and 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for fair value and other information regarding our trading inventories, available-for-sale securities and derivative instruments. 

Interest rate risk 

Trading activities 

We are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our trading inventory (primarily comprised of fixed income instruments) in our Capital Markets segment. We actively manage the interest rate risk arising from our fixed income trading securities through the use of hedging strategies that involve U.S. Treasury securities, futures contracts, liquid spread products and derivatives. In response to 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

the significant market uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we took steps to proactively manage our market risk exposures, including enhanced review and monitoring of exposures and risk mitigation efforts. As a result, we reduced our trading inventory levels to reduce risk. 

We monitor the Value-at-Risk (&#8220;VaR&#8221;) for all of our trading portfolios on a daily basis. VaR is an appropriate statistical technique for estimating potential losses in trading portfolios due to typical adverse market movements over a specified time horizon with a suitable confidence level. We apply the Fed&#8217;s Market Risk Rule (&#8220;MRR&#8221;) for the purpose of calculating our capital ratios. The MRR, also known as the &#8220;Risk-Based Capital Guidelines: Market Risk&#8221; rule released by the Fed, the OCC and FDIC, requires us to calculate VaR for all of our trading portfolios, including fixed income, equity, foreign exchange and derivatives. 

To calculate VaR, we use historical simulation. This approach assumes that historical changes in market conditions, such as in interest rates and equity prices, are representative of future changes. Simulation is based on daily market data for the previous twelve months. VaR is reported at a 99% confidence level for a one-day time horizon. Assuming that future market conditions change as they have in the past twelve months, we would expect to incur losses greater than those predicted by our one-day VaR estimates about once every 100 trading days, or about three times per year on average. For regulatory capital calculation purposes, we also report VaR numbers for a ten-day time horizon. 

The Fed&#8217;s MRR requires us to perform daily back-testing procedures of our VaR model, whereby we compare each day&#8217;s projected VaR to its regulatory-defined daily trading losses, which exclude fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income and intraday trading. Regulatory-defined daily trading losses are used to evaluate the performance of our VaR model and are not comparable to our actual daily net revenues. Based on these daily &#8220;ex ante&#8221; versus &#8220;ex post &#8221; comparisons, we determine whether the number of times that regulatory-defined daily trading losses exceed VaR is consistent with our expectations at a 99% confidence level. During the three months ended June 30, 2020, our regulatory-defined daily loss in our trading portfolios did not exceed our predicted VaR. During the nine months ended June 30, 2020, our regulatory-defined daily loss in our trading portfolios exceeded our predicted VaR on eleven occasions due to significantly higher levels of market volatility during our fiscal second quarter as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The following table sets forth the high, low, period-end and daily average VaR for all of our trading portfolios, including fixed income, equity and derivative instruments, for the period and dates indicated. 

&#160; Nine months ended June 30, 2020 Period-end VaR Three months ended June 30, Nine months ended June 30, $ in millions High Low June 30, 2020 September 30, 2019 $ in millions 2020 2019 2020 2019 Daily VaR $ 6 &#160; $ 1 &#160; $ 5 &#160; $ 1 &#160; Daily average VaR $ 2 &#160; $ 1 &#160; $ 2 &#160; $ 1 &#160; 

The modeling of the risk characteristics of trading positions involves a number of assumptions and approximations. While management believes that these assumptions and approximations are reasonable, there is no uniform industry methodology for estimating VaR, and different assumptions or approximations could produce materially different VaR estimates. As a result, VaR statistics are more reliable when used as indicators of risk levels and trends within a firm than as a basis for inferring differences in risk-taking across firms. 

Separately, RJF provides additional market risk disclosures to comply with the MRR. The results of the application of this market risk capital rule are available on our website under https://www.raymondjames.com/investor-relations/financial-information/filings-and-reports within &#8220;Other Reports and Information.&#8221; 

Should markets suddenly become more volatile, as they did in our fiscal second quarter of 2020, actual trading losses may exceed VaR results presented on a single day and might accumulate over a longer time horizon, such as a number of consecutive trading days. Accordingly, management applies additional controls including position limits, a daily review of trading results, review of the status of aged inventory, independent controls on pricing, monitoring of concentration risk, review of issuer ratings and stress testing. We utilize stress testing to complement our VaR analysis so as to measure risk under historical and hypothetical adverse scenarios. During volatile markets, we may choose to pare our trading inventories to reduce risk, as we did during our fiscal second quarter of 2020. 

Banking operations 

RJ Bank maintains an earning asset portfolio that is comprised of cash, C&#38;I loans, tax-exempt loans, commercial and residential real estate loans, SBL and other loans, as well as MBS and CMOs (held in the available-for-sale securities portfolio), SBA loan securitizations and a trading portfolio of corporate loans. These earning assets are primarily funded by client deposits. Based on its 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

current earning asset portfolio, RJ Bank is subject to interest rate risk. RJ Bank analyzes interest rate risk based on forecasted net interest income, which is the net amount of interest received and interest paid, and the net portfolio valuation, both in a range of interest rate scenarios. 

One of the objectives of RJ Bank&#8217;s Asset Liability Management Committee is to manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates. The methods used to measure this sensitivity are described in &#8220;Item 7 - Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management - Market risk&#8221; of our 2019 Form 10-K. 

We utilize a hedging strategy using interest rate swaps as a result of RJ Bank&#8217;s asset and liability management process. For further information regarding this hedging strategy, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our 2019 Form 10-K. 

The following table is an analysis of RJ Bank&#8217;s estimated net interest income over a 12-month period based on instantaneous shifts in interest rates (expressed in basis points) using RJ Bank&#8217;s own asset/liability model.

The following table shows the contractual maturities of RJ Bank&#8217;s loan portfolio at June 30, 2020, including contractual principal repayments. This table does not include any estimates of prepayments, which could shorten the average loan lives and cause the actual timing of the loan repayments to differ significantly from those shown in the table. Loan amounts in the table exclude unearned income and deferred expenses.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

The following table shows the distribution of the recorded investment of those RJ Bank loans that mature in more than one year between fixed and adjustable interest rate loans at June 30, 2020. Loan amounts in the table exclude unearned income and deferred expenses. 

&#160; Interest rate type $ in millions Fixed Adjustable Total Loans held for investment: &#160; &#160; &#160; C&#38;I loans $ 126 &#160; $ 7,397 &#160; $ 7,523 &#160; CRE construction loans 1 &#160; 193 &#160; 194 &#160; CRE loans 72 &#160; 3,064 &#160; 3,136 &#160; Tax-exempt loans 1,290 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,290 &#160; Residential mortgage loans 210 &#160; 4,707 &#160;

Contractual loan terms for C&#38;I, CRE, CRE construction and residential mortgage loans may include an interest rate floor, cap and/or fixed interest rates for a certain period of time, which would impact the timing of the interest rate reset for the respective loan. See the discussion within the &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management - Credit risk - Risk monitoring process&#8221; section of this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding RJ Bank&#8217;s interest-only residential mortgage loan portfolio. 

In our RJ Bank available-for-sale securities portfolio, we hold primarily fixed-rate agency MBS and CMOs which were carried at fair value on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at June 30, 2020, with changes in the fair value of the portfolio recorded through OCI in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. At June 30, 2020, our RJ Bank available-for-sale securities portfolio had a fair value of $5.63 billion with a weighted-average yield of 1.90% and a duration of three years. See Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for additional information. 

Equity price risk 

We are exposed to equity price risk as a result of our capital markets activities. Our broker-dealer activities are primarily client-driven, with the objective of meeting clients&#8217; needs while earning revenues to compensate for the risk associated with carrying inventory. We attempt to reduce the risk of loss inherent in our inventory of equity securities by monitoring those security positions throughout each day and establishing position limits. 

Foreign exchange risk 

We are subject to foreign exchange risk due to our investments in foreign subsidiaries as well as transactions and resulting balances denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. For example, a portion of our bank loan portfolio includes loans which are denominated in Canadian dollars, totaling $1.11 billion and $1.10 billion at June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, respectively. A portion of such loans are held by RJ Bank&#8217;s Canadian subsidiary, which is discussed in the following sections. 

Investments in foreign subsidiaries 

RJ Bank has an investment in a Canadian subsidiary, resulting in foreign exchange risk. To mitigate its foreign exchange risk, RJ Bank utilizes short-term, forward foreign exchange contracts. These derivatives are primarily accounted for as net investment hedges in the condensed consolidated financial statements. See Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for further information regarding these derivatives. 

We had foreign exchange risk in our investment in RJ Ltd. of CAD 346 million at June 30, 2020, which was not hedged. Foreign exchange gains/losses related to this investment are primarily reflected in OCI on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. See Note 16 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for further information regarding our components of OCI. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

We also have foreign exchange risk associated with our investments in subsidiaries located in Europe. These investments are not hedged and we do not believe we have material foreign exchange risk either individually, or in the aggregate, pertaining to these subsidiaries. 

Transactions and resulting balances denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar 

We are subject to foreign exchange risk due to our holdings of cash and certain other assets and liabilities resulting from transactions denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. Any currency-related gains/losses arising from these foreign currency denominated balances are reflected in &#8220;Other&#8221; revenues in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The foreign exchange risk associated with a portion of such transactions and balances denominated in foreign currency are mitigated utilizing short-term, forward foreign exchange contracts. Such derivatives are not designated hedges and therefore, the related gains/losses associated with these contracts are included in &#8220;Other&#8221; revenues in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. See Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for information regarding our derivatives. 

Credit risk 

Credit risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in a borrower&#8217;s, issuer&#8217;s or counterparty&#8217;s ability to meet its financial obligations under contractual or agreed upon terms. The nature and amount of credit risk depends on the type of transaction, the structure and duration of that transaction, and the parties involved. Credit risk is an integral component of the profit assessment of lending and other financing activities. See further discussion of our credit risk, including how we manage such risk, in &#8220;Item 7 - Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management - Credit risk&#8221; of our 2019 Form 10-K. 

The decline in economic activity as a result of COVID-19 has caused increased credit risk in general and particularly with regard to companies in sectors that have been most significantly impacted by the economic disruption, including energy, airlines, entertainment and leisure, restaurants and gaming. Given the stresses on our clients&#8217; liquidity, we have enhanced our credit monitoring activities, with an increased focus on monitoring our credit exposures and counterparty credit risk, including the risk that trades may not settle with a given counterparty. We have required collateral to be posted across our credit risk exposures in accordance with agreements with our borrowers and counterparties. 

RJ Bank has a substantial loan portfolio. While RJ Bank&#8217;s loan portfolio is diversified, a significant downturn in the overall economy, deterioration in real estate values or a significant issue within any sector or sectors where RJ Bank has a concentration will generally result in large provisions for loan losses and/or charge-offs. RJ Bank determines the allowance required for specific loan grades based on relative risk characteristics of the loan portfolio. On an ongoing basis, RJ Bank evaluates its methods for determining the allowance for each class of loans and makes enhancements it considers appropriate. 

Our allowance for loan losses is regularly evaluated with adjustments made on a quarterly basis. Several factors were taken into consideration in evaluating the allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2020, including the risk profile of the portfolios, net charge-offs during the period, the level of nonperforming loans, delinquency ratios and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. RJ Bank also considered the uncertainty related to certain industry sectors and the extent of credit exposure to specific borrowers within the portfolio. Finally, RJ Bank considered current economic conditions that might impact the portfolio. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we performed a portfolio-wide assessment on our loan portfolio. As a result, we downgraded loans in certain impacted industries, which gave rise to elevated loan loss provisions during our fiscal second and third quarters. In addition, we sold approximately $355 million, before charge-offs and discounts or premiums, of corporate loans in industries that we believe to be most vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic. We will continue to assess the impact of COVID-19 and, as more information becomes available regarding the financial repercussions to our borrowers, the risk ratings for individual loans will be updated and the allowance will be adjusted accordingly. Additional sales of corporate loans are also expected in the fiscal fourth quarter to further reduce credit risk in certain sectors. 

RJ Bank&#8217;s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of bank loans held for investment was 1.56% and 1.04% at June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, respectively. See Note 7 in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for detail on the changes in RJ Bank&#8217;s allowance for loan losses. 

The bank loan loss provision for the nine months ended June 30, 2020 was $188 million compared to a loan loss provision of $16 million for the prior-year period. See further explanation of the loan loss provision increase in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations - RJ Bank&#8221; of this Form 10-Q. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

The level of charge-off activity is a factor that is considered in evaluating the potential for severity of future credit losses. The following table presents net loan (charge-offs)/recoveries and the percentage of net loan (charge-offs)/recoveries to the average outstanding loan balances by loan portfolio segment.

(1) Charge-offs related to loan sales amounted $61 million for both the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020 and $2 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019. 

The level of nonperforming loans is another indicator of potential future credit losses. The following table presents the nonperforming loans balance and total allowance for loan losses for the periods presented. 

&#160; June 30, 2020 September 30, 2019 $ in millions Nonperforming loan balance Allowance for loan losses balance Nonperforming loan balance Allowance for loan losses balance Loans held for investment: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; C&#38;I loans $ 1 &#160; $ 186 &#160; $ 19 &#160; $ 139 &#160; CRE construction loans &#8212; &#160; 4 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3 &#160; CRE loans 6 &#160; 106 &#160; 8 &#160; 46 &#160; Tax-exempt loans &#8212; &#160; 13 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 9 &#160; Residential mortgage loans 14 &#160; 20 &#160; 16 &#160; 16 &#160; SBL and other

0.07 % 0.21 % 

Included in nonperforming residential mortgage loans were $7 million in loans for which $4 million in charge-offs were previously recorded, resulting in less exposure within the remaining balance. See Note 7 in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for loan categories as a percentage of total loans receivable. 

The nonperforming loan balances in the preceding table exclude $11 million and $12 million as of June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, respectively, of residential TDRs which were returned to accrual status in accordance with our policy. Total nonperforming assets, including other real estate acquired in the settlement of residential mortgages, amounted to $23 million and $46 million at June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, respectively. Total nonperforming assets as a percentage of RJ Bank total assets were 0.08% and 0.18% at June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, respectively. Although our nonperforming assets as a percentage of RJ Bank assets remained low as of June 30, 2020, prolonged or further market deterioration could result in an increase in our nonperforming assets, an increase in our allowance for loan losses and/or an increase in net charge-offs in future periods, although the extent will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. 

We have received requests from certain clients for forbearance, or deferral of their loan payments to us, driven or exacerbated by the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Certain clients have also requested modifications of covenant terms. In accordance with the CARES Act, we have elected to not apply TDR classification to any COVID-19 related loan modifications that were performed after March 1, 2020 to borrowers who were current as of December 31, 2019. Based on the outstanding principal balance as of the end of June 30, 2020, we have active short-term payment deferrals on approximately $364 million and $126 million of our corporate and residential loans, respectively. The borrower&#8217;s past due and nonaccrual status will not be impacted during the deferral period. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Loan underwriting policies 

RJ Bank&#8217;s underwriting policies for the major types of loans are described in &#8220;Item 7 - Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management - Credit risk&#8221; of our 2019 Form 10-K. There were no material changes in RJ Bank&#8217;s underwriting policies during the nine months ended June 30, 2020. 

Risk monitoring process 

Another component of credit risk strategy at RJ Bank is the ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all residential, SBL, corporate and tax-exempt credit exposures, as well as our rigorous processes to manage and limit credit losses arising from loan delinquencies. There are various other factors included in these processes, depending on the loan portfolio. There were no material changes to those processes and policies during the nine months ended June 30, 2020. 

Residential mortgage and SBL and other loan portfolios 

The collateral securing RJ Bank&#8217;s SBL and other portfolio is monitored on a recurring basis, with marketable collateral monitored on a daily basis. Collateral adjustments are made by the borrower as necessary to ensure RJ Bank&#8217;s loans are adequately secured, resulting in minimizing its credit risk. Collateral calls have been minimal relative to our SBL and other portfolio with no losses incurred to date. 

We track and review many factors to monitor credit risk in RJ Bank&#8217;s residential mortgage loan portfolio. The factors include, but are not limited to: loan performance trends, loan product parameters and qualification requirements, borrower credit scores, level of documentation, loan purpose, geographic concentrations, average loan size and LTV ratios. These measures, while considered and reviewed in establishing the allowance for loan losses, have not resulted in any material adjustments to RJ Bank&#8217;s historical loss rates. 

The following table presents a summary of delinquent residential mortgage loans, the vast majority of which are first mortgage loans, which are comprised of loans which are two or more payments past due as well as loans in the process of foreclosure. 

&#160; Amount of delinquent residential loans Delinquent residential loans as a percentage of outstanding loan balances $ in millions 30-89 days 90 days or more Total 30-89 days 90 days or more Total June 30, 2020 $ 5 &#160; $ 7 &#160; $ 12 &#160; 0.10 % 0.14 % 0.24 % September 30, 2019 $ 2 &#160; $ 10 &#160; $ 12 &#160; 0.04 % 0.22 % 0.26 % 

Our June 30, 2020 percentage continues to compare favorably to the national average for over 30 day delinquencies of 2.51%, as most recently reported by the Fed. 

Credit risk is also managed by diversifying the residential mortgage portfolio. Most of the loans in our residential loan portfolio are to Private Client Group clients across the country. The following table details the geographic concentrations (top five states) of RJ Bank&#8217;s one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. 

June 30, 2020 Loans outstanding as a % of RJ Bank total residential mortgage loans Loans outstanding as a % of RJ Bank total loans CA 25.8% 5.9% FL 16.4% 3.8% TX 8.2% 1.9% NY 7.1% 1.6% CO 4.1% 0.9% 

Loans where borrowers may be subject to payment increases include adjustable rate mortgage loans with terms that initially require payment of interest only. Payments may increase significantly when the interest-only period ends and the loan principal begins to amortize. At June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, these loans totaled $1.57 billion and $1.29 billion, respectively, or approximately 32% and 30% of the residential mortgage portfolio, respectively. The weighted-average number of years before the remainder of the loans, which were still in their interest-only period at June 30, 2020, begins amortizing is 6 years. 

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

A component of credit risk management for the residential portfolio is the LTV ratio and borrower credit score at origination or purchase. The weighted-average LTV ratios and FICO scores at origination of RJ Bank&#8217;s residential first mortgage loan portfolio were 64% and 762, respectively. 

Corporate and tax-exempt loans 

Credit risk in RJ Bank&#8217;s corporate and tax-exempt loan portfolios are monitored on an individual loan basis. The majority of RJ Bank&#8217;s tax-exempt loan portfolio is comprised of loans to investment-grade borrowers. 

Credit risk is managed by diversifying the corporate loan portfolio. RJ Bank&#8217;s corporate loan portfolio does not contain a significant concentration in any single industry. The following table details the industry concentrations (top five categories) of RJ Bank&#8217;s corporate loans. 

June 30, 2020 Loans outstanding as a % of RJ Bank total corporate loans Loans outstanding as a % of RJ Bank total loans Office real estate 7.4% 4.0% Automotive/transportation 7.2% 3.9% Business systems and services 6.6% 3.6% Hospitality 6.6% 3.6% Multi-family 5.2% 2.8% 

RJ Bank&#8217;s exposure to the energy, airlines, entertainment and leisure, restaurant and gaming sectors, those most affected by the economic disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic, were each less than 2% of the loan portfolio as of June 30, 2020. 

Although we saw deterioration in oil prices during the current fiscal year, our energy portfolio primarily consists of loans to midstream distribution companies and convenience stores, with no loans to exploration and production enterprises. As a result, the portfolio has minimal direct commodity price exposure. However, if we continue to see a significant deterioration in oil prices, our clients, and as a result our loans to such clients, could be negatively impacted in the future. 

Liquidity risk 

See the section &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and capital resources&#8221; of this Form 10-Q for information regarding our liquidity and how we manage liquidity risk. 

Operational risk 

Operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including, but not limited to, business disruptions, improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions, deficiencies in our technology or financial operating systems and inadequacies or breaches in our control processes, including cybersecurity incidents. See &#8220;Item 7 - Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management - Operational risk&#8221; of our 2019 Form 10-K for a discussion of our operational risk and certain of our risk mitigation processes. 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we activated and successfully executed on our business continuity protocols and continue to monitor the COVID-19 crisis under such protocols. We have endeavored to safeguard our associates and to ensure continuity of business operations for our clients. As a result, most of our associates are working remotely. Our systems and infrastructure have continued to support the increased volumes of activity, without any significant operational or technology disruptions. We did not incur any material losses related to our operational risks during the nine months ended June 30, 2020. The firm continues to monitor the situation and has developed a phased approach to reopening our offices based on regional indicators and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. As of June 30, 2020, we have reopened certain of our offices in a limited capacity and are working under strict precautions. 

As more fully described in the discussion of our business technology risks included in various risk factors presented in &#8220;Item 1A - Risk Factors&#8221; of our 2019 Form 10-K and &#8220;Part II - Other Information - Item 1A - Risk Factors&#8221; of this Form 10-Q, despite our implementation of protective measures and endeavoring to modify them as circumstances warrant, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to human error, natural disasters, power loss, cyber-attacks and other information security breaches, and other events that could have an impact on the security and stability of our operations. To-date, we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches; however, there can be no assurances that we will not suffer such losses in the future.

Model risk 

Model risk refers to the possibility of unintended business outcomes arising from the design, implementation or use of models. See &#8220;Item 7 - Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management - Model risk&#8221; of our 2019 Form 10-K for information regarding how we utilize models throughout the firm and how we manage model risk. 

Compliance risk 

Compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss, or reputational damage that the firm may suffer from a failure to comply with applicable laws, external standards, or internal requirements. See &#8220;Item 7 - Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management - Compliance risk&#8221; of our 2019 Form 10-K for information on our compliance risks, including how we manage such risks. There have been no material changes in our compliance risk mitigation processes during the nine months ended June 30, 2020.
