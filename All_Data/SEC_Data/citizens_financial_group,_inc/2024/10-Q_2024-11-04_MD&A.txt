FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Any statement that does not describe historical or current facts is a forward-looking statement. These statements often include the words &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;goals,&#8221; &#8220;targets,&#8221; &#8220;initiatives,&#8221; &#8220;potentially,&#8221; &#8220;probably,&#8221; &#8220;projects,&#8221; &#8220;outlook,&#8221; &#8220;guidance&#8221; or similar expressions or future conditional verbs such as &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; and &#8220;could.&#8221; 

Forward-looking statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of management, and on information currently available to management. Our statements speak as of the date hereof, and we do not assume any obligation to update these statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those contained in such statements in light of new information or future events. We caution you, therefore, against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the following, without limitation: 

&#8226; Negative economic, business and political conditions, including as a result of the interest rate environment, supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures and labor shortages, that adversely affect the general economy, housing prices, the job market, consumer confidence and spending habits; 

&#8226; The general state of the economy and employment, as well as general business and economic conditions, and changes in the competitive environment; 

&#8226; Our capital and liquidity requirements under regulatory standards and our ability to generate capital and liquidity on favorable terms; 

&#8226; The effect of changes in our credit ratings on our cost of funding, access to capital markets, ability to market our securities, and overall liquidity position; 

&#8226; The effect of changes in the level of commercial and consumer deposits on our funding costs and net interest margin; 

&#8226; Our ability to execute on our strategic business initiatives and achieve our financial performance goals across our Consumer and Commercial businesses, including our Private Bank; 

&#8226; The effects of geopolitical instability, including the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, on economic and market conditions, inflationary pressures and the interest rate environment, commodity price and foreign exchange rate volatility, and heightened cybersecurity risks; 

&#8226; Our ability to comply with heightened supervisory requirements and expectations as well as new or amended regulations; 

&#8226; Liabilities and business restrictions resulting from litigation and regulatory investigations; 

&#8226; The effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest income, net interest margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing rights and mortgages held for sale; 

&#8226; Changes in interest rates and market liquidity, as well as the magnitude of such changes, which may reduce interest margins, impact funding sources and affect the ability to originate and distribute financial products in the primary and secondary markets; 

&#8226; Financial services reform and other current, pending or future legislation or regulation that could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses; 

&#8226; Environmental risks, such as physical or transition risks associated with climate change, and social and governance risks, that could adversely affect our reputation, operations, business, and customers; 

&#8226; A failure in or breach of our compliance with laws, as well as operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors or other service providers, including as a result of cyber-attacks; and 

&#8226; Management&#8217;s ability to identify and manage these and other risks. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 6 

In addition to the above factors, we also caution that the actual amounts and timing of any future common stock dividends or share repurchases will be subject to various factors, including our capital position, financial performance, capital impacts of strategic initiatives, market conditions, and regulatory considerations, as well as any other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant in making such a determination. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares from or pay any dividends to holders of our common stock, or as to the amount of any such repurchases or dividends. 

More information about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found in the &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section in Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 Form 10-K.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

This document contains non-GAAP financial measures denoted as &#8220;Underlying&#8221; results and &#8220;including AOCI impact.&#8221; Underlying results for any given reporting period exclude certain items that may occur in that period which management does not consider indicative of our on-going financial performance. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors because they are used by management to evaluate our operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions. In addition, we believe our Underlying results in any given reporting period reflect our on-going financial performance in that period and, accordingly, are useful to consider in addition to our GAAP financial results. We further believe the presentation of Underlying results increases comparability of period-to-period results. 

Other companies may use similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures that may be calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures. Accordingly, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by such companies. We caution investors not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP financial measures, but to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results reported under GAAP. 

Non-GAAP measures are denoted throughout our MD&#38;A by the use of the term &#8220;Underlying.&#8221; Where there is a reference to these metrics in that paragraph, all measures that follow are on the same basis when applicable. For more information on the computation of non-GAAP financial measures, see &#8220;Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations.&#8221;

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is our largest source of revenue and is the difference between the interest earned on interest-earning assets (generally loans and investment securities) and the interest expense incurred in connection with interest-bearing liabilities (generally deposits and borrowed funds). The level of net interest income is primarily a function of the difference between the effective yield on our average interest-earning assets and the effective cost of our interest-bearing liabilities. These factors are influenced by the pricing and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by external factors such as economic conditions, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the FRB and market interest rates. For further discussion, refer to the &#8220;Market Risk&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Governance&#8221; sections of our 2023 Form 10-K.

The following tables present the major components of our net interest income. Average balance represents amortized cost, excluding the unamortized basis adjustments related to the transfer of certain HTM securities from AFS, and LHFS, at fair value. The yield/rate is based on annualized interest income or expense for the periods presented and includes the impact of hedging activities associated with the respective asset and liability categories.

(1) Net interest income and net interest margin is presented on a FTE basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 21%. The FTE impact is predominantly attributable to commercial and industrial loans for the periods presented. 

Net interest income decreased $153 million, or 10%, and decreased $532 million, or 11%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, reflecting lower net interest margin and a decline of 1% in average interest-earning assets. 

Net interest margin on a FTE basis decreased 26 basis points and 32 basis points for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, reflecting higher funding and swap costs and the impact of building liquidity, partially offset by the benefit of Non-Core portfolio runoff. The decrease during the nine-month period is also partially offset by higher interest-earning-asset yields. 

Average interest-earning assets decreased $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, driven by a decline in total loans and leases, partially offset by an increase in investment securities and cash held in interest-bearing deposits. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 12 

Average deposits decreased $2.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, driven by a reduction in higher-cost Treasury deposits and rate-driven migration, partially offset by growth in Private Bank deposits. Average deposits were stable for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 

Average total borrowed funds increased $132 million and decreased $2.3 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, reflecting a decline in FHLB advances driven by Non-Core portfolio runoff, and a remix of funding to long-term senior debt and secured borrowings collateralized by loans. These factors are largely offsetting during the three-month period, with the decrease during the nine-month period driven by FHLB advances.

The primary drivers for the changes in noninterest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, are highlighted below. 

&#8226; Capital markets fees increased given higher underwriting and M&#38;A advisory fees. Higher loan syndication fees are also a driver during the nine-month period. 

&#8226; Card fees increased driven primarily by higher credit card fees, including favorable vendor contract negotiations. 

&#8226; Wealth fees reflect increased sales activity and higher asset management fees. 

&#8226; Mortgage banking fees declined reflecting lower production and servicing fees and a decline in MSR valuation, net of hedge impact. 

&#8226; Foreign exchange and derivative products revenue decreased given reduced client activity related to interest rate and commodities hedging.

Noninterest Expense 

Table 4: Noninterest Expense Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (dollars in millions) 2024 2023 Change Percent 2024 2023 Change Percent Salaries and employee benefits $647 $659 ($12) (2 %) $1,983 $1,932 $51 3 % Equipment and software 194 191 3 2 576 541 35 6 Outside services 146 160 (14) (9) 469 513 (44) (9) Occupancy 108 107 1 1 335 367 (32) (9) Other operating expense 164 176 (12) (7) 555 542 13 2 Noninterest expense $1,259 $1,293 ($34) (3 %) $3,918 $3,895 $23 1 % 

The decrease in noninterest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was driven by salaries and employee benefits reflecting lower headcount and other operating expense reflecting lower marketing-related expenses. 

The increase in noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was driven by salaries and employee benefits reflecting our Private Bank build-out, equipment and software given technology investments and maintenance, and other operating expense largely associated with FDIC deposit insurance, reflecting an estimate of CBNA&#8217;s incremental special assessment of $40 million recognized in 2024. These increases were partially offset by lower marketing and travel-related expenses. 

For more information regarding CBNA&#8217;s special assessment, see &#8220;Regulation and Supervision - Deposit Insurance&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses is the result of a detailed analysis performed to estimate our ACL. The total provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan and lease losses and the provision for unfunded commitments. Refer to &#8220;Analysis of Financial Condition &#8212; Credit Quality&#8221; for more information. 

Provision expense of $172 million and $525 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to $172 million and $516 million for the same periods in 2023. The provision expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflects higher reserves against the CRE office portfolio primarily driven by elevated interest rates and return-to-office dynamics. 

Income Tax Expense 

Income tax expense of $88 million and $272 million decreased $31 million and $134 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The effective income tax rate of 18.6% and 19.7% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased from 21.5% and 22.2%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. These decreases reflect a higher benefit from tax-advantaged investments and the favorable impact of certain tax matters. Provision for income taxes is calculated by applying the estimated annual effective tax rate to year-to-date pre-tax income, adjusting for discrete items that occurred during the period.

Consumer Banking 

Net interest income increased $89 million and $268 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, driven by higher net interest margin reflecting higher interest-earning asset yields and growth in average interest-earning assets. These increases were partially offset by higher funding costs. 

Noninterest income increased $7 million and $18 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, driven by wealth fees reflecting increased sales activity and higher asset management fees, higher credit card fees, and service charges and fees given higher overdraft and cash management fees. These increases were partially offset by mortgage banking fees reflecting lower production and servicing fees and a decline in MSR valuation, net of hedge impact. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 15 

Noninterest expense increased $97 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, driven primarily by salaries and benefits reflecting our Private Bank build-out. Noninterest expense was stable for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 

Net charge-offs increased $17 million and $51 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, driven primarily by other retail and education. 

Commercial Banking 

Net interest income decreased $82 million and $255 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, driven by lower net interest margin, a decline in average interest-earning assets and higher funding costs. 

Noninterest income increased $27 million and $88 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, driven by capital markets fees reflecting higher underwriting and M&#38;A advisory fees. These increases were partially offset by foreign exchange and derivative products revenue given reduced client activity related to interest rate and commodities hedging. Higher loan syndication fees are also a driver during the nine-month period. 

Noninterest expense decreased $25 million and $43 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, driven primarily by salaries and employee benefits reflecting lower headcount. 

Net charge-offs increased $24 million and $77 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase during the three-month period was driven by the resolution of several nonperforming credits in commercial and industrial, while the increase during the nine-month period was primarily driven by the office segment of CRE, partially offset by a decline in commercial and industrial. 

Non-Core 

Net interest income decreased $12 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, driven by the highest-cost implied marginal funding sources during 2024, including secured borrowings collateralized by auto loans and FHLB advances, and a decline in average interest-earning assets. 

Average loans and leases decreased $4.7 billion and $4.9 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, driven by planned Non-Core portfolio runoff.

The primary objective of our securities portfolio is to provide a readily available source of liquidity. The portfolio primarily includes high-quality, highly liquid investments reflecting our ongoing commitment to maintain strong contingent liquidity levels and pledging capacity. 

As of September 30, 2024, U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities issued by GNMA and GSEs represented 98% of the fair value of our debt securities portfolio, with approximately $34.1 billion of unencumbered high-quality liquid securities serving as potential collateral for borrowings from the FHLB, FRB discount window, and the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation bilateral repurchase agreement market. 

For further discussion of the use of our securities as liquidity collateral see the &#8220;Liquidity Risk Management and Governance&#8221; section in this document. For further discussion of liquidity requirements, see &#8220;Regulation and Supervision &#8212; Liquidity Requirements&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

We manage our securities portfolio duration and convexity risk through asset selection and securities structure, and maintain duration levels within our risk appetite in the context of our broader interest rate risk framework and limits. As of September 30, 2024, the portfolio&#8217;s average effective duration, including recent hedging actions to reduce duration, was 3.3 years compared with 3.9 years as of December 31, 2023.

Commercial Loan Asset Quality 

Our commercial portfolio consists of traditional commercial and industrial loans, commercial leases, and commercial real estate loans. As discussed in our 2023 Form 10-K, we utilize internal risk ratings to monitor credit quality for commercial loans and leases. 

Total commercial criticized balances of $8.6 billion at September 30, 2024 increased $136 million compared to December 31, 2023. 

Commercial and industrial criticized balances of $3.1 billion at September 30, 2024 decreased from $3.5 billion at December 31, 2023, primarily driven by declines in the healthcare and wholesale trade sectors. 

Commercial real estate criticized balances of $5.5 billion at September 30, 2024 increased from $5.0 billion at December 31, 2023, attributable to the continued impacts of interest rates and return-to-office dynamics on the Office sector and the continued impacts of interest rates on the Multi-family sector. Approximately 96% of commercial real estate loans remain current on payments as of September 30, 2024. 

For more information on the distribution of commercial loans by vintage date and regulatory classification rating, see Note 4.

Retail Loan Asset Quality 

We utilize credit scores provided by FICO, which are generally refreshed on a quarterly basis, and payment and delinquency status, among other data points, to monitor credit quality for retail loans. FICO credit scores represent current and historical national industry-wide consumer level credit performance data, which management believes are the strongest indicator of potential credit losses over the contractual life of the loan and a good predictor of a borrower&#8217;s future payment performance.

Total borrowed funds of $14.0 billion as of September 30, 2024 decreased $13 million compared to December 31, 2023, driven by a decline of approximately $3.7 billion in FHLB advances, partially offset by the issuance of senior debt and secured borrowings collateralized by loans. For more information regarding our borrowed funds, see &#8220;Liquidity&#8221; and Note 7. 

CAPITAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS 

As a bank and financial holding company, we are subject to regulation and supervision by the FRB. Our banking subsidiary, CBNA, is a national banking association primarily regulated by the OCC. Our regulation and supervision continues to evolve as the legal and regulatory frameworks governing our operations continue to change. See &#8220;Regulation and Supervision&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K for more information. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 22 

Capital Adequacy Process 

Our assessment of capital adequacy begins with our Board-approved risk appetite and risk management framework. This framework provides for the identification, measurement and management of material risks. There have been no significant changes to our capital adequacy risk appetite and risk management framework as described in &#8220;Capital and Regulatory Matters&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

The FRB regularly supervises and evaluates our capital adequacy and capital planning processes, including the submission of an annual capital plan approved by our Board of Directors or one of its committees. Under the FRB&#8217;s capital requirements, we must maintain capital ratios above the sum of the regulatory minimum and SCB requirement to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The FRB utilizes the supervisory stress test to determine our SCB, which is re-calibrated with each biennial supervisory stress test and updated annually to reflect our planned common stock dividends. As an institution subject to Category IV standards, we are subject to biennial supervisory stress testing in even-numbered years; however, the FRB required us to participate in the 2023 CCAR supervisory stress test to incorporate the effects of the Investors acquisition. Our SCB associated with the 2023 CCAR supervisory stress test was 4.0%, effective through September 30, 2024, and our SCB associated with the 2024 CCAR supervisory stress test is 4.5%, effective October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025. 

Regulations relating to capital planning, regulatory reporting, stress testing and capital buffer requirements applicable to firms like us are presently subject to rule-making and potential further guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators. We will continue to evaluate the impact of these and any other prudential regulatory changes, including their potential resultant changes in our regulatory and compliance costs and expenses. 

For more information on our capital adequacy process, see &#8220;Capital and Regulatory Matters&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Regulatory Capital Ratios and Capital Composition 

Under the current U.S. Basel III capital framework, we and our banking subsidiary, CBNA, must meet the following specific minimum requirements: CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%, tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, total capital ratio of 8.0% and tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. As a bank holding company, our SCB of 4.0% as of September 30, 2024 is imposed on top of the three minimum risk-based capital ratios listed above and a CCB of 2.5% is imposed on top of the three minimum risk-based capital ratios listed above for CBNA. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 23 

For additional discussion of the U.S. Basel III capital framework and its related application, see &#8220;Regulation and Supervision&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K. The table below presents the regulatory capital ratios for CFG and CBNA under the U.S. Basel III Standardized rules:

(2) Represents total average assets less certain amounts deducted from Tier 1 capital. 

At September 30, 2024, CFG&#8217;s CET1 capital ratio was stable and its tier 1 capital ratio increased compared to December 31, 2023. Net income and a $4.0 billion decrease in RWA was offset by common share repurchases, dividends, and a decrease in the modified CECL transition amount as we entered the third year of the CECL three-year transition period. Lower auto and commercial loans were the key drivers for the decline in RWA. An increase in preferred stock was also a contributing factor to the tier 1 capital ratio increase. 

At September 30, 2024, CBNA&#8217;s CET1 and tier 1 capital ratios increased compared to December 31, 2023. Net income and a $4.2 billion decrease in RWA, primarily driven by lower auto and commercial loans, was partially offset by dividend payments to the Parent Company and a decrease in the modified CECL transition amount as we entered the third year of the CECL three-year transition period. 

At September 30, 2024, CFG&#8217;s and CBNA&#8217;s total capital ratios increased compared to December 31, 2023, driven by their respective changes in CET1 and tier 1 capital described above and a reduction in the modified AACL transition amount. 

At September 30, 2024, CFG&#8217;s and CBNA&#8217;s tier 1 leverage ratios increased compared to December 31, 2023, reflecting a decline in quarterly adjusted average assets and their respective changes in tier 1 capital described above.

Capital Transactions 

We completed the following capital transactions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024: 

&#8226; Repurchased $825 million of our outstanding common stock; 

&#8226; Issued 400,000 shares of 7.375% fixed-rate non-cumulative perpetual Series H Preferred Stock at an aggregate offering price of $400 million; 

&#8226; Redeemed all outstanding shares of the 9.205% floating rate non-cumulative perpetual Series D Preferred Stock on July 8, 2024; 

&#8226; Declared quarterly common stock dividends of $0.42 per share, aggregating to $581 million; and 

&#8226; Declared preferred stock dividends aggregating to $103 million. 

For additional detail regarding our common and preferred stock dividends see Note 10. 

On June 28, 2024, our Board of Directors increased the capacity of our common share repurchase program to $1.25 billion, an increase of $656 million above the $594 million of capacity remaining under the prior February 2023 authorization. All future capital distributions are subject to consideration and approval by our Board of Directors prior to execution. The timing and amount of future dividends and share repurchases will depend on various factors, including our capital position, financial performance, capital impacts of strategic initiatives, market conditions, and regulatory considerations. 

AOCI Impact on Regulatory Capital 

Under the current applicable regulatory capital rules we have made the AOCI opt-out election, which enables us to exclude components of AOCI from regulatory capital. As noted in the &#8220;Capital and Stress Testing Requirements&#8221; section of &#8220;Regulation and Supervision&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K, the regulatory agencies are considering the inclusion of AOCI components in regulatory capital for Category IV firms like us, notably the AOCI relative to securities and pension. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 25 

The following table presents our regulatory capital ratios including the AOCI impact from securities and pension, which we believe provides useful information in light of recent events and the potential for change in the regulatory capital framework.

Recent Regulatory Developments 

On March 6, 2024, the SEC adopted a final rule to require registrants to disclose certain climate-related information in their registration statements and annual reports. Subsequent to adoption, a number of businesses and business groups filed petitions seeking a judicial review of the final rule, asserting that the SEC does not have the authority to promulgate it. On April 4, 2024, the SEC issued an order staying its final rule pending completion of the judicial review of certain petitions consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. We will continue to monitor the outcome of this judicial review. 

LIQUIDITY 

We consider the effective and prudent management of liquidity fundamental to our safety and soundness. We define liquidity as our ability to meet our obligations when they come due. As a financial institution, we must maintain operating liquidity to meet expected daily and forecasted cash-flow requirements, as well as contingent liquidity to meet unexpected (stress scenario) funding requirements. Reflecting the importance of meeting all unexpected and stress-scenario funding requirements, we identify and manage contingent liquidity, consisting of cash balances at the FRB, unencumbered high-quality liquid securities and unused FHLB borrowing capacity. Separately, we also identify and manage asset liquidity as a subset of contingent liquidity, consisting of cash balances at the FRB and unencumbered high-quality liquid securities. We maintain additional secured borrowing capacity at the FRB discount window, but do not view this as a primary means of funding, but rather a potential source in a stressed environment or during a market disruption. We manage liquidity at the consolidated enterprise level and at each material legal entity. 

Parent Company Liquidity 

Our Parent Company&#8217;s primary sources of cash are dividends and interest received from CBNA resulting from investing in bank equity and subordinated debt as well as externally issued preferred stock, senior debt and subordinated debt. Uses of cash include the routine cash flow requirements as a bank holding company, including periodic share repurchases and payments of dividends, interest and expenses; the needs of subsidiaries, including CBNA for additional equity and, as required, its need for debt financing; and the support for extraordinary funding requirements when necessary. To the extent the Parent Company relies on wholesale borrowings, uses also include payments of related principal and interest. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 26 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Parent Company completed the following transactions: 

&#8226; Issued $1.25 billion of 5.841% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2030; 

&#8226; Issued $750 million of 6.645% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2035; 

&#8226; Issued 400,000 shares of 7.375% fixed-rate non-cumulative perpetual Series H Preferred Stock at an aggregate offering price of $400 million; 

&#8226; Redeemed all outstanding shares of the 9.205% floating rate non-cumulative perpetual Series D Preferred Stock on July 8, 2024; and 

&#8226; Issued $1.25 billion of 5.718% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2032. 

Our Parent Company&#8217;s cash and cash equivalents represent a source of liquidity that can be used to meet various needs and totaled $3.1 billion and $2.9 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Parent Company declared dividends on common stock of $190 million and $199 million, respectively, and declared dividends on preferred stock of $38 million and $30 million, respectively. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Parent Company declared dividends on common stock of $581 million and $609 million, respectively, and declared dividends on preferred stock of $103 million and $87 million, respectively. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Parent Company repurchased $825 million of its outstanding common stock. 

CBNA Liquidity 

As CBNA&#8217;s primary business involves taking deposits and making loans, a key role of liquidity management is to ensure that customers have timely access to funds. Liquidity management also involves maintaining sufficient liquidity to repay wholesale borrowings, pay operating expenses and support extraordinary funding requirements when necessary. In the ordinary course of business, the liquidity of CBNA is managed by matching sources and uses of cash. The primary sources of bank liquidity include deposits from our consumer and commercial customers; payments of principal and interest on loans and investment securities; and wholesale borrowings, as needed, and as described under &#8220;Liquidity Risk Management and Governance.&#8221; The primary uses of bank liquidity include withdrawals and maturities of deposits; payment of interest on deposits; funding of loans and related commitments; and funding of securities purchases. To the extent that CBNA relies on wholesale borrowings, uses also include payments of related principal and interest. For further information on CBNA&#8217;s outstanding debt see Note 7. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, CBNA completed the following transactions: 

&#8226; Issued $2.7 billion of secured borrowings collateralized by loans; and 

&#8226; Redeemed $650 million of 4.119% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2025. 

Liquidity Risk 

Liquidity risk is the risk arising from the inability to meet our obligations when they come due. We must maintain adequate funding to meet current and future obligations, including customer loan requests, deposit maturities and withdrawals, debt service requirements, equipment and premises leases, and other cash commitments, under both normal operating conditions and periods of company-specific and/or market stress. 

We primarily rely on customer deposits to be a relatively stable and low-cost source of funding. In addition to customer deposits, our funding sources also include our ability to securitize loans in secondary markets, raise funds in the debt and equity capital markets, pledge loans and/or securities for borrowing from the FHLB, pledge securities as collateral for borrowing under repurchase agreements, and sell AFS securities. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 27 

Credit ratings assigned by agencies such as Moody&#8217;s, Standard and Poor&#8217;s, and Fitch impact our access to unsecured wholesale market funds and to large uninsured customer deposits and are presented in the table below.

We currently have a &#8220;stable&#8221; outlook at Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s, a &#8220;negative&#8221; outlook at Moody&#8217;s and a &#8220;positive&#8221; outlook at Fitch. Changes in our public credit ratings could affect both the cost and availability of our wholesale funding. 

Existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements represent another key driver of systemic liquidity conditions and liquidity management practices. The FRB and OCC regularly evaluate our liquidity as part of the overall supervisory process. In addition, we are subject to existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements, some of which are subject to further rulemaking, guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators. For further discussion, see the &#8220;Liquidity Requirements&#8221; section under &#8220;Regulation and Supervision&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Liquidity Risk Management and Governance 

Liquidity risk is measured and managed by the Funding and Liquidity unit within our Treasury group in accordance with policy guidelines promulgated by our Board and the Asset Liability Committee. The Funding and Liquidity unit is responsible for maintaining a liquidity management framework that effectively manages liquidity risk. Processes within this framework include, but are not limited to, regular and comprehensive reporting, including current levels versus threshold limits for a broad set of liquidity metrics and early warning indicators, explanatory commentary relating to emerging risk trends and, as appropriate, recommended remedial strategies, liquidity stress testing, contingency funding plans, and collateral management. 

Our Funding and Liquidity unit&#8217;s primary goals are to deliver and maintain prudent levels of operating liquidity to support expected and projected funding requirements, contingent liquidity to support unexpected funding requirements resulting from idiosyncratic, systemic, and combination stress events, and regulatory liquidity requirements in a timely manner from stable and cost-efficient funding sources. We seek to accomplish these goals by funding loans with stable deposits, by prudently controlling dependence on wholesale funding, particularly short-term unsecured funding, and by maintaining ample available liquidity, including a contingent liquidity buffer of unencumbered high-quality loans and securities. 

We maintain a contingency funding plan designed to ensure that liquidity sources are sufficient to meet ongoing obligations and commitments, particularly in a stressed environment or during a market disruption. The plan identifies members of the liquidity contingency team and provides a framework for management to follow, including notification and escalation of potential liquidity stress events. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 28 

As of September 30, 2024: 

&#8226; Organically generated deposits continue to be our primary source of funding, resulting in a consolidated period-end loans-to-deposits ratio, excluding LHFS, of 80.8%; 

&#9702; Estimated insured/secured deposits comprise 68% of our consolidated deposit base of $175.2 billion. 

&#8226; Our total available liquidity, comprised of contingent liquidity and available discount window capacity, was approximately $82.1 billion; 

&#9702; Contingent liquidity was $64.3 billion, consisting of unencumbered high-quality liquid securities of $34.1 billion, unused FHLB capacity of $20.4 billion, and our cash balances at the FRB of $9.8 billion; and 

&#9702; Available discount window capacity was $17.8 billion, defined as available total borrowing capacity from the FRB based on identified collateral, which is primarily secured by non-mortgage commercial and retail loans. 

For a summary of our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item 1. 

The Funding and Liquidity unit monitors a variety of liquidity and funding metrics and early warning indicators and metrics, including specific risk thresholds limits. These monitoring tools are broadly classified as follows: 

&#8226; Current liquidity sources and capacities, including cash balances at the FRB, free and liquid securities, and secured borrowing capacity at the FHLB and FRB discount window; 

&#8226; Liquidity stress sources, including idiosyncratic, systemic and combined stresses, in addition to evolving regulatory requirements; and 

&#8226; Current and prospective exposures, including secured and unsecured wholesale funding, and spot and cumulative cash-flow gaps across a variety of horizons. 

Further, certain of these metrics are monitored individually for CBNA and for our consolidated enterprise on a daily basis, including cash position, unencumbered securities, asset liquidity and available FHLB borrowing capacity. In order to identify emerging trends and risks and inform funding decisions, specific metrics are also forecasted over a one-year horizon. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We engage in a variety of activities that are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that are generally referred to as &#8220;off-balance sheet arrangements.&#8221; For more information on these types of activities, see Note 11. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

Our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

An accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are made using facts and circumstances known at a point in time. Changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates. Our significant accounting policies and estimates include the ACL, fair value measurements and the evaluation and measurement of goodwill impairment. For additional information regarding fair value measurements, see &#8220;Critical Accounting Estimates&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The ACL of $2.3 billion at September 30, 2024 remained stable compared to December 31, 2023. 

As of September 30, 2024, the ACL economic forecast over a two-year reasonable and supportable period was consistent with December 31, 2023, with peak unemployment of approximately 5.1% and start-to-trough real GDP decline of approximately 0.4%. These forecasts reflect a mild recession over the two-year reasonable and supportable period. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 29 

Our determination of the ACL is sensitive to changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions during the reasonable and supportable forecast period. To illustrate the sensitivity, we applied a more pessimistic scenario than that described above which reflects deeper real GDP contraction across our two-year reasonable and supportable forecast period with peak unemployment of approximately 6.0% and start-to-trough real GDP decline of approximately 1.9%. Excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments, this scenario would result in a quantitative lifetime loss estimate of approximately 1.2x our modeled period-end ACL, or an increase of approximately $400 million. This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimate and not to the overall period-end ACL, which includes qualitative adjustments. 

Because several quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in determining the ACL, this sensitivity analysis does not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the ACL or even what the ACL would be under these economic circumstances. The sensitivity analysis is intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment and the corresponding impact to modeled loss estimates. The hypothetical determination does not incorporate the impact of management judgment or other qualitative factors that could be applied in the actual estimation of the ACL and does not imply any expectation of future deterioration in our loss rates. 

It remains difficult to estimate how changes in economic forecasts might affect our ACL because such forecasts consider a wide variety of variables and inputs, and changes in the variables and inputs may not occur at the same time or in the same direction, and such changes may have differing impacts by product type. The variables and inputs may be idiosyncratically affected by risks to the economy, including changing monetary and fiscal policies, impacts from the recent stress on the banking industry, and their impact on inflationary trends. Changes in one or multiple of the key macroeconomic variables may have a material impact on our estimation of expected credit losses. 

For additional information regarding the ACL, see Note 4 and &#8220;Critical Accounting Estimates - Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; and Note 6 in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Goodwill 

We review the goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may exist. When assessing goodwill for impairment, a qualitative assessment may be made to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. The process of evaluating the fair value of a reporting unit is subjective, involving management assumptions, estimates and forecasts, and the use of external or internal valuations. Future potential changes in assumptions, estimates or forecasts may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value. Additionally, a reporting unit&#8217;s fair value could change based on market conditions or other factors, which could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. 

For additional information regarding Goodwill, see &#8220;Critical Accounting Estimates - Goodwill&#8221; and Note 10 in our 2023 Form 10-K.

RISK GOVERNANCE 

We are committed to maintaining a strong, integrated and proactive approach to the management of all risks to which we are exposed in pursuit of our business objectives. A key aspect of our Board&#8217;s responsibility as the main decision-making body is setting our risk appetite to ensure that the levels of risk that we are willing to accept in the attainment of our strategic business and financial objectives are clearly understood. 

To enable our Board to carry out its objectives, it has delegated authority for risk management activities, as well as governance and oversight of those activities, to a number of Board and executive management level risk committees. The Executive Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, is responsible for oversight of risk across the enterprise and actively considers our inherent material risks, analyzes our overall risk profile and seeks confirmation that the risks are being appropriately identified, assessed and mitigated. Reporting to the Executive Risk Committee are the following committees covering specific areas of risk: Compliance and Operational Risk, Model Risk, Credit Policy, Asset Liability, Business Initiatives Review, and Conduct and Ethics. 

There have been no significant changes in our risk governance practices, risk framework, risk appetite, or credit risk as described in &#8220;Risk Governance&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

MARKET RISK 

Market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and/or other relevant market rates or prices. Modest market risk arises from trading activities that serve customer needs, including the hedging of interest rate and foreign exchange risk. As described below, the market risk arising from our non-trading banking activities, such as the origination of loans and deposit-gathering, is more significant. We have established enterprise-wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor and report market risk. We actively manage market risk for both non-trading and trading activities. 

Non-Trading Risk 

Our non-trading banking activities expose us to market risk. This market risk is composed of interest rate risk, as we have no commodity risk and de minimis direct currency and equity risk. We also have market risk related to capital markets loan originations, as well as the valuation of our MSRs. There have been no significant changes in our sources of interest rate risk, interest rate risk practices, risk framework, metrics or assumptions as described in &#8220;Market Risk &#8212; Non-Trading Risk&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

The table below presents the sensitivity of net interest income to various parallel yield curve shifts from the market implied forward yield curve. Our policies involve measuring exposures as a percentage change in net interest income over the next year due to either instantaneous or gradual parallel changes in rates relative to the market implied forward yield curve. As the following table illustrates, our balance sheet is asset sensitive; net interest income would benefit from an increase in interest rates, while exposure to a decline in interest rates is within limits established and monitored by senior management. While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates is included in this analysis, we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would be more gradual and, therefore, have a more modest impact. 

Table 21: Sensitivity of Net Interest Income Estimated % Change in Net Interest Income over 12 Months Basis points September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Instantaneous Change in Interest Rates &#160; &#160; +200 2.6 % &#8212; % +100 1.5 0.5 -100 (1.8) (1.5) -200 (4.4) (3.0) Gradual Change in Interest Rates +200 2.1 % 0.4 % +100 1.0 0.5 -100 (1.1) (1.0) -200 (2.4) (1.9) 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 32 

We continue to manage asset sensitivity within the scope of our policy, changing market conditions and changes in our balance sheet. The Company&#8217;s base case net interest income assumes the forward-rate path implied by the period-end yield curve is realized. The rate risk exposure is then measured based on assumed changes from that base case rate path. 

Our risk position is slightly asset sensitive to a gradual change in rates as of September 30, 2024, compared to our broadly neutral position as of December 31, 2023. Our interest rate sensitivity incorporates the impacts of changes in our balance sheet mix, including securities, loans, deposits, borrowed funds and hedge activity, which is primarily comprised of received fixed swaps that offset our naturally asset-sensitive balance sheet. 

We use a valuation measure of exposure to structural interest rate risk, EVE, as a supplement to net interest income simulations. EVE complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure over a long-term horizon. EVE measures the extent to which the economic value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. This analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with non-contractual maturities. We employ sophisticated models for prepayments and deposit pricing and attrition, which provide a granular view of cash flows based on the unique characteristics of the underlying products and customer segments. The change in value is expressed as a percentage of regulatory capital. 

We use interest rate contracts as part of our ALM strategy to manage exposure to the variability in the interest cash flows on our floating-rate assets and wholesale funding, the variability in the fair value of AFS securities, and to hedge market risk on fixed-rate capital markets debt issuances.

(1) Weighted average floor and cap rates represents strike rates through which CFG will receive interest if the SOFR rate falls below the floor strike rate and pay interest if the SOFR rate exceeds the cap strike rate. 

(2) Weighted average floor rate represents strike rates for the short and long interest rate floors, respectively. CFG will receive interest if the SOFR rate falls below the upper strike rate and pay interest if the SOFR rate falls below the lower strike rate, effectively hedging the corridor between the two strike rates. The structure also includes a short cap and a long floor which are utilized to neutralize the initial premium.

&#8212; (1) &#8212; &#8212; 

Using the September 30, 2024 interest rate curve we estimate that $621 million in pre-tax net losses related to cash flow hedge strategies will be reclassified from AOCI to net interest income over the next 12 months. These losses could differ from amounts recognized due to changes in interest rates, hedge de-designations or the addition of other hedges after September 30, 2024. 

Included in AOCI is a net loss from terminated swaps of $868 million that will reduce net interest income by $137 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, $127 million in the first quarter of 2025, $119 million in the second quarter of 2025, $109 million in the third quarter of 2025, and $103 million in the fourth quarter of 2025. The remaining $273 million will reduce net interest income by $230 million in 2026 and $43 million after 2026. 

Capital Markets 

A key component of our capital markets activities is the underwriting and distribution of corporate credit facilities to finance merger and acquisition transactions for our clients. We have a rigorous risk management process around these activities, including a limit structure capping our underwriting risk, potential loss, and sub-limits for specific asset classes. Further, the ability to approve underwriting exposure is delegated only to senior level individuals in the credit risk management and capital markets organizations with each transaction adjudicated in the Loan Underwriting Approval Committee. 

Mortgage Servicing Rights &#160; 

We have market risk associated with the value of residential MSRs, which are impacted by various types of inherent risks, including duration, basis, convexity, volatility and yield curve. 

As part of our overall risk management strategy we enter into various free-standing derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, interest rate swaptions, interest rate futures and forward contracts to purchase mortgage-backed securities to economically hedge the changes in fair value of our MSRs. For more information regarding the fair value of our MSRs and associated derivatives see Note 5 and Note 8. 

As with our traded market risk-based activities, earnings at risk excludes the impact of MSRs. MSRs are captured under our single price risk management framework that is used for calculating a management value at risk consistent with the definition used by banking regulators. 

Trading Risk 

We are exposed to market risk primarily through client facilitation activities from certain derivative and foreign exchange products as well as underwriting and market making activities. Market risk exposure arises from fluctuations in interest rates, basis spreads, volatility, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and credit spreads across various financial instruments. Securities underwriting and trading activities are conducted through CBNA and Citizens JMP Securities, LLC. There have been no significant changes in our market risk governance, market risk measurement, or market risk practices including VaR, stressed VaR, sensitivity analysis, stress testing, VaR model review and validation, or VaR backtesting as described in &#8220;Market Risk &#8212; Trading Risk&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K.

Market Risk Regulatory Capital 

The U.S. banking regulators&#8217; &#8220;Market Risk Rule&#8221; covers the calculation of market risk capital. Under this rule, all of our client facing trades and associated hedges maintain a net low risk and qualify as &#8220;covered positions.&#8221; The internal management VaR measure is calculated based on the same population of trades that is utilized for regulatory VaR.
