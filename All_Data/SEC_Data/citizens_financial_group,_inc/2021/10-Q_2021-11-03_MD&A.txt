FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements regarding potential future share repurchases and future dividends as well as the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns on our business, operations, financial performance and prospects, are forward-looking statements. Also, any statement that does not describe historical or current facts is a forward-looking statement. These statements often include the words &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;goals,&#8221; &#8220;targets,&#8221; &#8220;initiatives,&#8221; &#8220;potentially,&#8221; &#8220;probably,&#8221; &#8220;projects,&#8221; &#8220;outlook,&#8221; &#8220;guidance&#8221; or similar expressions or future conditional verbs such as &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; and &#8220;could.&#8221; 

Forward-looking statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of management, and on information currently available to management. Our statements speak as of the date hereof, and we do not assume any obligation to update these statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those contained in such statements in light of new information or future events. We caution you, therefore, against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the following, without limitation: 

&#8226; Negative economic and political conditions that adversely affect the general economy, housing prices, the job market, consumer confidence and spending habits which may affect, among other things, the level of nonaccrual assets, charge-offs and provision expense; 

&#8226; The rate of growth in the economy and employment levels, as well as general business and economic conditions, and changes in the competitive environment; 

&#8226; Our ability to implement our business strategy, including the cost savings and efficiency components, and achieve our financial performance goals, including through the integration of Investors and the HSBC branches; 

&#8226; The COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns and their effects on the economic and business environments in which we operate; 

&#8226; Our ability to meet heightened supervisory requirements and expectations; 

&#8226; Liabilities and business restrictions resulting from litigation and regulatory investigations; 

&#8226; Our capital and liquidity requirements under regulatory capital standards and our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms; 

&#8226; The effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest income, net interest margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing rights and mortgages held for sale; 

&#8226; Changes in interest rates and market liquidity, as well as the magnitude of such changes, which may reduce interest margins, impact funding sources and affect the ability to originate and distribute financial products in the primary and secondary markets; 

&#8226; The effect of changes in the level of checking or savings account deposits on our funding costs and net interest margin; 

&#8226; Financial services reform and other current, pending or future legislation or regulation that could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses; 

&#8226; A failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors or other service providers, including as a result of cyber-attacks; 

&#8226; An inability to complete the acquisitions of Investors or the HSBC branches, or changes in the current anticipated timeframe, terms or manner of such acquisitions; 

&#8226; Greater than expected costs or other difficulties related to the integration of our business and that of Investors and HSBC branches; 

&#8226; The inability to retain existing Investors or HSBC clients and employees following the closings of the Investors and HSBC branch acquisitions; 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 7 

&#8226; The occurrence of any event change or other circumstance that could give rise to the right of one or both parties to terminate (i) the agreement to acquire Investors or (ii) the agreement to acquire HSBC branches; and 

&#8226; Management&#8217;s ability to identify and manage these and other risks. 

In addition to the above factors, we also caution that the actual amounts and timing of any future common stock dividends or share repurchases will be subject to various factors, including our capital position, financial performance, risk-weighted assets, capital impacts of strategic initiatives, market conditions and regulatory and accounting considerations, as well as any other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant in making such a determination. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares from or pay any dividends to holders of our common stock, or as to the amount of any such repurchases or dividends. Further, statements about the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns on our business, operations, financial performance and prospects may constitute forward-looking statements and are subject to the risk that the actual impacts may differ, possibly materially, from what is reflected in those forward-looking statements due to factors and future developments that are uncertain, unpredictable and in many cases beyond our control, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic, and the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our customers, third parties and us. In addition, statements about our net charge-off guidance constitute forward-looking statements and are subject to the risk that the actual charge-offs may differ, possibly materially, from what is reflected in those statements due to, among other potential factors, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effectiveness of stimulus and forbearance programs in response, changes in economic conditions, and idiosyncratic events affecting our commercial loans. Statements about Citizens&#8217; agreement to acquire Investors and CBNA&#8217;s agreement to acquire HSBC branches also constitute forward-looking statements and are subject to the risk that actual results could be materially different from those expressed in those statements, including if either of both transactions are not consummated in a timely manner or at all, or if integration is more costly or difficult than expected. 

More information about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found in the &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section in Part I, Item 1A of our 2020 Form 10-K as well as Part II, Item 1A of our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2021.

The following MD&#38;A is intended to assist readers in their analysis of the accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements and supplemental financial information.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

This document contains non-GAAP financial measures denoted as &#8220;Underlying&#8221;, &#8220;excluding PPP loans&#8221;, as well as other results excluding the impact of certain items. Underlying results for any given reporting period exclude certain items that may occur in that period which management does not consider indicative of our on-going financial performance. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors because they are used by management to evaluate our operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions. In addition, we believe our Underlying results or results excluding the impact of certain items in any given reporting period reflect our on-going financial performance and increase comparability of period-to-period results, and useful to consider in addition to our GAAP financial results. 

Other companies may use similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures that are calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures. Accordingly, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by such companies. We caution investors not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP financial measures, but to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results reported under GAAP. 

Non-GAAP measures are denoted throughout our MD&#38;A by the use of the term Underlying or identified as excluding the impact of certain items. Where there is a reference to these metrics in that paragraph, all measures that follow are on the same basis when applicable. For more information on the computation of non-GAAP financial measures, see &#8220;&#8212;Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations.&#8221;

(1) Net interest income and net interest margin is presented on a FTE basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 21%. The FTE impact is predominantly attributable to commercial and industrial loans for the periods presented. 

Third quarter 2021 vs third quarter 2020: Net interest income of $1.1 billion increased 1% from the third quarter of 2020 reflecting 4% growth in interest-earning assets, largely offset by lower net interest margin. 

Net interest margin on a FTE basis of 2.72% decreased 11 basis points compared to 2.83% in the third quarter of 2020, primarily reflecting the impact of elevated cash balances and the lower rate environment, partially offset by an improved funding mix, deposit pricing, and the benefit of accelerated PPP loan forgiveness. Interest-bearing deposit costs decreased 21 basis points. Average interest-earning asset yields of 2.89% decreased 26 basis points from 3.15% in the third quarter of 2020, while average interest-bearing liability costs of 0.28% decreased 24 basis points from 0.52% in the third quarter of 2020. 

Average interest-earning assets of $167.3 billion increased $7.1 billion, or 4%, from the third quarter of 2020, as elevated liquidity drove a $7.5 billion increase in cash held in interest-bearing deposits, and a $2.8 billion increase in investments. Loans and loans held for sale decreased $3.2 billion, or 2%, with a $5.2 billion decrease in average commercial reflecting line of credit repayments and net payoffs and a 1.9 billion decrease in 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 16 

PPP loans. Retail loans increased $2.9 billion driven by growth in education, residential mortgage, and automobile, partially offset by planned run-off of personal unsecured installment loans and a decrease in home equity. Loans held for sale decreased $945 million, driven by education. 

Average deposits of $151.9 billion increased $10.5 billion, or 7%, from the third quarter of 2020, reflecting an increase in demand deposits, money market accounts, savings and checking with interest, partially offset by a decrease in term deposits. Average total borrowed funds of $7.0 billion decreased $2.5 billion from the third quarter of 2020, as strong customer deposit inflows enabled the pay down of senior debt and short-term borrowings. Total borrowed funds costs of $42 million decreased $12 million from the third quarter of 2020. The total borrowed funds cost of 2.38% increased 8 basis points from 2.30% in the third quarter of 2020.

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 17 

Net interest margin on a FTE basis of 2.73% decreased 20 basis points compared to 2.93% in the first nine months of 2020, primarily reflecting the impact of a lower rate environment, and elevated cash balances given strong deposit flows, partially offset by the benefit of accelerated PPP loan forgiveness, improved funding mix, and deposit pricing. Average interest-earning asset yields of 2.92% decreased 53 basis points from 3.45% in the first nine months of 2020, while average interest-bearing liability costs of 0.32% decreased 45 basis points from 0.77% in the first nine months of 2020. 

Average interest-earning assets of $166.0 billion increased $8.2 billion, or 5%, from the first nine months of 2020, as elevated liquidity drove a $7.5 billion increase in cash held in interest-bearing deposits and a $2.3 billion, or 9%, increase in investments. Results also reflected a $1.7 billion, or 1%, decrease in average loans and leases and LHFS with a $3.5 billion decrease in average commercial loans and leases reflecting payoffs, partially offset by a $1.3 billion increase in PPP loans. Furthermore, average retail loans increased $1.6 billion, driven by growth in education, residential mortgage, and automobile, partially offset by decreases in home equity and other retail given run-off of personal unsecured installment loans. Loans held for sale increased $251 million, reflecting mortgage originations. 

Average deposits of $149.6 billion increased $13.1 billion, or 10%, from the first nine months of 2020, reflecting growth in demand deposits, money market accounts, savings, and checking with interest, partially offset by a decline in term deposits. Average total borrowed funds of $7.7 billion decreased $4.4 billion from the first nine months of 2020, given the pay down of senior debt and short-term borrowings. Total borrowed funds costs of $136 million decreased $75 million from the first nine months of 2020. The total borrowed funds cost of 2.36% increased 3 basis points from 2.33% in the first nine months of 2020.

Noninterest Income 

The following table presents a five quarter trend of our noninterest income: 

Third quarter 2021 versus second quarter 2021: Noninterest income of $514 million increased $29 million, or 6%, from the second quarter of 2021. Results reflect higher mortgage banking fees, service charges and fees, card fees and other income, partially offset by lower capital markets fees. 

&#8226; Mortgage banking fees increased driven by strong origination levels, the benefit of lower agency fees and improved MSR hedge results. 

&#8226; Services charges and fees and card fees increased reflecting seasonality and the benefit of economic recovery. 

&#8226; Other income increased reflecting the benefit of higher community development-related income and a seasonal improvement in tax-advantaged investments. 

&#8226; Capital markets fees declined from record levels reflecting seasonally lower activity, primarily in syndication fees, partially offset by higher merger and acquisition advisory fees.

Third quarter 2021 versus third quarter 2020: Noninterest income decreased $140 million, or 21%, from the third quarter of 2020. Results reflect lower mortgage banking fees and other income, partially offset by higher capital markets, service charges, card and trust and investment services fees. 

&#8226; Mortgage banking fees decreased driven by lower gain-on-sale margins and production volumes. 

&#8226; Capital markets fees increased driven by loan syndication and merger and acquisition advisory fees. 

&#8226; Service charges and fees increased reflecting recovery from COVID-19 impacts. 

&#8226; Card fees increased reflecting higher debit and credit card volumes given economic recovery. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 19 

&#8226; Other income decreased largely tied to a gain on the sale of education loans in the third quarter of 2020. 

&#8226; Trust and investment services fees increased driven by an increase in assets under management from higher equity market levels and strong inflows. 

First nine months 2021 versus first nine months 2020: Noninterest income decreased $200 million, or 11%, from the first nine months of 2020. Results reflect lower mortgage banking fees partially offset by improved capital markets, trust and investment services, letter of credit and loan, card and service charges and fees. 

&#8226; Mortgage banking fees decreased reflecting increased industry capacity and heightened competition resulting in lower gain-on-sale margins and production volumes. 

&#8226; Capital markets fees increased driven by loan syndication, underwriting, and merger and acquisition advisory fees. 

&#8226; Trust and investment services fees increased driven by an increase in assets under management from higher equity market levels and strong inflows. 

&#8226; Letter of credit and loan fees increased reflecting higher commitment fees. 

&#8226; Card fees and service charges and fees increased largely tied to economic recovery. 

Noninterest Expense 

&#160; The following table presents a five quarter trend of our noninterest expense: 

Third quarter 2021 versus second quarter 2021: Noninterest expense of $1.0 billion, or $988 million on an Underlying basis, was up slightly reflecting strong expense discipline and the benefit of efficiency initiatives. 

Table 8: Noninterest Expense Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2021 2020 Change Percent 2021 2020 Change Percent Salaries and employee benefits $509 $524 ($15) (3 %) $1,581 $1,586 ($5) &#8212; % Equipment and software 157 149 8 5 464 424 40 9 Outside services 144 139 5 4 420 405 15 4 Occupancy 77 81 (4) (5) 247 247 &#8212; &#8212; Other operating expense 124 95 29 31 308 317 (9) (3) Noninterest expense $1,011 $988 $23 2 % $3,020 $2,979 $41 1 % 

Third quarter 2021 versus third quarter 2020: Noninterest expense increased $23 million, or 2%, compared to the third quarter of 2020 and remains well-controlled. Salaries and employee benefits were lower as a result of a compensation-related credit associated with the CARES Act. Other operating expenses increased reflecting a pension settlement charge. On an Underlying basis, noninterest expense of $988 million increased $31 million, or 3%, compared to $957 million given higher salaries and employee benefits, outside services and other operating expense. 

&#8226; Higher salaries and employee benefits reflect revenue-based compensation and merit increases. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 20 

&#8226; Outside services increased largely tied to growth initiatives. 

&#8226; Other operating expense increased reflecting higher travel and advertising costs. 

First nine months 2021 versus first nine months 2020: Noninterest expense increased $41 million, or 1%, and was stable with the first nine months of 2020. On an Underlying basis, noninterest expense of $3.0 billion increased $70 million, or 2%, given higher salaries and employee benefits and outside services due to the reasons stated above and higher equipment and software expense. These increases were partially offset by a decline in other operating expense. 

&#8226; Equipment and software expense increased reflecting higher technology spend. 

&#8226; Other operating expense decreased reflecting lower travel and advertising costs. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The following table presents a five quarter trend of our provision for credit losses, net charge-offs and net charge-off ratio: 

&#160; 

The provision for credit losses is the result of a detailed analysis performed to estimate our ACL. The total provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan and lease losses and the provision for unfunded commitments. Refer to &#8220;&#8212;Analysis of Financial Condition &#8212; Allowance for Credit Losses and Nonaccrual Loans and Leases&#8221; for more information. 

Third quarter 2021 versus second quarter 2021: In the third quarter of 2021, strong credit performance across the retail and commercial loan portfolios and improvement in the macroeconomic outlook resulted in a credit provision benefit of $33 million. This compared to a credit provision benefit of $213 million in the second quarter of 2021. 

Third quarter 2021 versus third quarter 2020: The credit provision benefit was $33 million in the third quarter of 2021, compared with a $428 million credit provision expense in the third quarter of 2020. The credit provision expense in 2020 reflects the adverse impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns, while the credit provision benefit in 2021 reflects strong credit performance and improving macroeconomic outlook. 

First nine months 2021 versus first nine months 2020: The credit provision benefit was $386 million in the first nine months of 2021. This compared to a credit provision expense of $1.5 billion in the first nine months of 2020, which reflected the adverse impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns.

Income Tax Expense 

The following table presents a five quarter trend of our income tax expense and effective income tax rate: 

Third quarter 2021 versus third quarter 2020: Income tax expense increased $90 million from the third quarter of 2020 due to increased taxable income. The effective income tax rate increased to 22.4% from 16.1% in the third quarter of 2020, driven by the decreased benefit of tax advantaged investments on higher pre-tax income. 

First nine months 2021 versus first nine months 2020: Income tax expense for the first nine months of 2021 was $504 million compared to $126 million in the first nine months of 2020. Income tax expense increased $378 million from the first nine months of 2020 due to increased taxable income. The effective income tax rate increased to 22.0% from 17.3% in the first nine months of 2020 driven by the decreased benefit of tax advantaged investment on higher pre-tax income. 

Business Operating Segments 

We have two business operating segments: Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. Segment results are derived by specifically attributing managed assets, liabilities, capital and related revenues, provision for credit losses, which, at the segment level, is equal to net charge-offs, and other expenses. Non-segment operations are classified as Other, which includes assets, liabilities, capital, revenues, provision for credit losses, expenses and income tax expense not attributed to our Consumer or Commercial Banking segments as well as treasury and community development. In addition, Other includes goodwill not directly allocated to a business operating segment and any associated goodwill impairment charges. For impairment testing purposes, we allocate all goodwill to our Consumer Banking and/or Commercial Banking reporting units. There have been no significant changes in our methodologies used to allocate items to our business operating segments as described in &#8220;&#8212;Results of Operations &#8212; Business Operating Segments&#8221; in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 22 

The following table presents certain financial data of our business operating segments. Total business operating segment financial results differ from total consolidated financial results. These differences are reflected in Other non-segment operations. See Note 16 in Item 1 for further information.

(1) Includes LHFS. 

(2) The majority of PPP loans are reflected in Consumer Banking in accordance with how they are managed. 

Consumer Banking 

Net interest income increased $74 million, or 9%, from the third quarter of 2020, reflecting the benefit of accelerated PPP loan forgiveness and a $1.3 billion increase in average loans led by education, residential mortgage, and automobile, partially offset by a decline in other retail consistent with planned run-off of personal unsecured installment loans. In addition, higher deposit volumes, reflecting improved funding mix and deposit pricing, contributed to higher net interest income. Noninterest income decreased $180 million, or 36%, from the third quarter of 2020, driven by lower mortgage banking fees resulting from lower gain-on-sale margins and production volumes, and a decline in other income largely tied to a gain on the sale of education loans in the third quarter of 2020. These decreases were partially offset by recovery in service charges and fees from deposit products, card, as well as trust and investment services, reflecting an increase in assets under management. Noninterest expense was stable compared to the third quarter of 2020. Net charge-offs of $35 million decreased $20 million, or 36%, driven by the impact of U.S. Government stimulus programs and strong collateral values in automobile and residential real estate. 

&#160; Commercial Banking 

Net interest income of $428 million was stable compared to the third quarter of 2020. Noninterest income of $168 million increased $24 million, or 17%, from $144 million in the third quarter of 2020, driven by strength in capital markets due to higher loan syndication and merger and acquisition advisory fees, reflecting favorable market conditions and a strong pipeline. Noninterest expense of $226 million increased $16 million, or 8%, from $210 million in the third quarter of 2020, largely tied to increased technology spend as well as higher salaries and employee benefits.

Consumer Banking 

Net interest income of $2.7 billion increased $227 million, or 9%, from the first nine months of 2020, driven by the benefit of accelerated PPP loan forgiveness, loan and deposit growth, as well as improved funding mix, and deposit pricing. Average loans increased $3.1 billion led by education, residential mortgage, and automobile, partially offset by a decline in other retail given planned run-off of personal unsecured installment loans. Deposits increased $9.3 billion, or 10%, as a result of elevated liquidity tied to government stimulus associated with the COVID-19 disruption. Noninterest income decreased $331 million, or 26%, from the first nine months of 2020, driven by lower mortgage banking fees as increased industry capacity and heightened competition resulted in lower gain-on-sale margins and production volumes. This decrease was partially offset by higher trust and investment services fees driven by an increase in assets under management, and higher card fees and service charges and fees, reflecting continued volume recovery from COVID-19 impacts. Noninterest expense increased $35 million, or 2%, from the first nine months of 2020, reflecting higher salaries and employee benefits tied to higher revenue-based compensation, combined with higher equipment and software expense and outside services resulting from increased technology spend and growth initiatives. Net charge-offs of $139 million decreased $93 million, or 40%, driven by the impact of U.S. Government stimulus and forbearance, as well as strong collateral values in automobile and residential real estate. 

Commercial Banking 

Net interest income of $1.3 billion increased $63 million, or 5%, from $1.2 billion in the first nine months of 2020, driven by higher deposit volumes reflecting improved funding mix and deposit pricing. Noninterest income of $516 million increased $103 million, or 25%, from $413 million in the first nine months of 2020, driven by strength in capital markets from higher loan syndication and merger and acquisition advisory fees, in addition to higher letter of credit and loan fees. Noninterest expense of $679 million increased $35 million, or 5%, from $644 million in the first nine months of 2020, largely tied to growth initiatives, increased technology spends, and higher salaries and employee benefits. Net charge-offs of $150 million decreased $124 million, or 45%, from the first nine months of 2020, reflecting the stabilization from effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns.

Our securities portfolio is managed to maintain prudent levels of liquidity, credit quality, and market risk while achieving returns that align with our overall portfolio management strategy. The portfolio primarily includes high quality, highly liquid investments reflecting our ongoing commitment to maintain strong contingent liquidity levels and pledging capacity. U.S. government-guaranteed notes and GSE-issued mortgage-backed securities represent 93% of the fair value of our debt securities portfolio holdings. Holdings backed by mortgages dominate our portfolio and facilitate our ability to pledge those securities to the FHLB for collateral purposes. For further discussion of the liquidity coverage ratios, see &#8220;Regulation and Supervision &#8212; Liquidity Requirements&#8221; in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

The fair value of the AFS debt securities portfolio of $24.9 billion at September 30, 2021 increased $2.0 billion from $22.9 billion at December 31, 2020, including $2.5 billion in portfolio growth, offset by a $566 million reduction in unrealized gains driven by a steepening yield curve. The decline in the fair value of the HTM debt securities portfolio of $790 million was primarily attributable to portfolio run-off. For further information, see Note 2. 

As of September 30, 2021, the portfolio&#8217;s average effective duration was 3.9 years compared with 2.7 years as of December 31, 2020, as higher long-term rates drove a decrease in both actual and projected securities prepayment speeds. We manage our securities portfolio duration and convexity risk through asset selection and securities structure, and maintain duration levels within our risk appetite in the context of the broader interest rate risk framework and limits.

Third quarter 2021 NCOs of $44 million decreased $175 million, or 80%, from $219 million in the third quarter of 2020, driven by decreases in commercial and retail of $156 million and $19 million, respectively. Third quarter 2021 annualized net charge-offs of 0.14% of average loans and leases were down 56 basis points from the third quarter of 2020. The overall improvement in the macroeconomic environment and post-pandemic reopening drove the significant decline in commercial NCOs. Retail NCOs remained low driven by continued benefit to consumers from government stimulus and strong collateral values in residential real estate and automobile.

First nine months 2021 NCOs of $280 million decreased $223 million, or 44%, from $503 million in the first nine months of 2020, driven by decreases in commercial and retail of $126 million and $97 million, respectively. First nine months 2021 annualized net charge-offs of 0.30% of average loans and leases were down 24 basis points from first nine months of 2020. 

Retail and commercial NCOs were down in the first nine months of 2021 as compared to the first nine months of 2020. The decline in retail NCOs is primarily due to U.S. Government stimulus programs and forbearance, as well as strong collateral values in residential real estate and automobile. The decrease in commercial NCOs reflects the economic recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns. We continue to assess risks to the recovery, including potential for continuing impacts from COVID-19 variants, challenges in the global supply chain and recent inflationary trends, as well as potential impacts from ending monetary and fiscal stimulus programs. We have maintained a variety of measures to identify and monitor areas of potential risk, including direct outreach to commercial clients and close monitoring of retail credit metrics. 

Commercial Loan Asset Quality 

Our commercial loan and lease portfolio consists of traditional commercial and industrial loans, commercial leases and commercial real estate loans. The portfolio is predominantly focused on customers in our footprint and adjacent states in which we have a physical presence where our local delivery model provides for 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 28 

strong client connectivity. Additionally, we also do business in certain specialized industry sectors on a national basis. As discussed in our 2020 Form 10-K, for commercial loans and leases, we utilize regulatory classification ratings to monitor credit quality. 

As of September 30, 2021, commercial NPLs of $269 million decreased $189 million from $458 million as of December 31, 2020, representing 0.5% and 0.8% of the commercial loan and lease portfolio as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

The decrease was primarily driven by net repayments and charge-offs. Commercial and industrial criticized loans represented 65% of total criticized loans as of September 30, 2021 compared to 71% as of December 31, 2020. 

Commercial real estate criticized balances of $1.4 billion, or 9.4% of the commercial real estate portfolio, was stable compared to December 31, 2020 at $1.3 billion, or 8.8%.

Retail Loan Asset Quality 

For retail loans, we utilize credit scores provided by FICO, which generally refresh on a quarterly basis, and a loan&#8217;s payment and delinquency status to monitor credit quality. Management believes FICO credit scores are the strongest indicator of credit losses over the contractual life of a loan as the scores are based on current and historical national industry-wide consumer level credit performance data. These scores assist management in predicting the borrower&#8217;s future payment performance. The largest portion of the retail portfolio is represented by borrowers located in the New England, Mid-Atlantic, and Midwest regions, although we have continued to lend selectively in areas outside the footprint primarily in automobile, education and point-of-sale financing.

Retail asset quality continues to reflect a stronger economic outlook. The retail annualized net charge-off rate decreased to 0.19% for the third quarter of 2021 from 0.32% in the third quarter of 2020. The net charge-off rate of 0.26% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 reflected a decrease of 22 basis points from the nine months ended September 30, 2020, driven by the forbearance and stimulus programs stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns, as well as strong collateral values in automobile and residential real estate. 

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

In the first quarter of 2020, we adopted the CARES Act and interagency guidance issued by the bank regulatory agencies which provide that COVID-19-related modifications to retail and commercial loans that met certain eligibility criteria are exempt from classification as a TDR. We generally do not consider payment deferrals and forbearance plans established due to the COVID-19 pandemic to be TDRs.

Total deposits as of September 30, 2021 increased $5.1 billion, or 3%, to $152.2 billion, from $147.2 billion as of December 31, 2020, as a result of elevated liquidity tied to government stimulus associated with the COVID-19 disruption. Citizens Access &#174; , our national digital platform, ended the quarter with $4.6 billion of deposits, down from $5.9 billion as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to rate reduction strategies that resulted in a decrease in term deposits.

Borrowed Funds 

Total borrowed funds as of September 30, 2021 decreased $1.6 billion from December 31, 2020, driven by a $235 million and $1.4 billion decrease in short-term and long-term borrowed funds, respectively. Strong deposit growth enabled the paydown of senior debt.

For information regarding our liquidity and available borrowing capacity, see &#8220;&#8212;Liquidity&#8221; and Note 7. 

CAPITAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS 

As a bank holding company and a financial holding company, we are subject to regulation and supervision by the FRB. Our banking subsidiary, CBNA, is a national banking association whose primary federal regulator is the OCC. Our regulation and supervision continues to evolve as the legal and regulatory frameworks governing our operations continue to change. For more information, see &#8220;Regulation and Supervision&#8221; in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 33 

Tailoring of Prudential Requirements 

Under the FRB&#8217;s Tailoring Rules, Category IV firms, such as us, are subject to biennial supervisory stress testing and are exempt from company-run stress testing and related disclosure requirements. The FRB supervises Category IV firms on an ongoing basis, including evaluation of the capital adequacy and capital planning processes during off-cycle years. We are also required to develop, maintain and submit to the FRB an annual capital plan, which must be reviewed and approved by our board of directors or one of its committees. On April 2, 2021, we submitted our 2021 Capital Plan to the FRB under the FRB&#8217;s 2021 CCAR process. For more information, see the &#8220;Tailoring of Prudential Requirements&#8221; section in item 1 of our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Under the FRB&#8217;s Capital Plan Rule, a firm must update and resubmit its capital plan prior to the next annual submission date under certain circumstances, which includes a material change in the firm&#8217;s risk profile, financial condition or corporate structure since its last capital plan submission. On July 28, 2021, we announced an agreement to acquire Investors, which required us to resubmit our capital plan to the FRB, which was submitted on September 15, 2021. 

Under the stress capital buffer (&#8220;SCB&#8221;) framework, the FRB will not object to capital plans on quantitative grounds and each firm is required to maintain capital ratios above the sum of its minimum and SCB requirements to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. On October 1, 2020, our SCB of 3.4% became effective and applied to our capital actions through September 30, 2021. 

On February 3, 2021, the FRB adopted a final rule effective April 5, 2021 to tailor the requirements of its Capital Plan Rule, specifically modifying capital planning, regulatory reporting and stress capital buffer requirements to be consistent with the Tailoring Rules framework. Under the final rule, for Category IV firms, like us, the SCB will be re-calibrated with each biennial supervisory stress test and updated annually to reflect our planned common stock dividends. In addition, Category IV firms have the ability to elect to participate in the supervisory stress test and receive an updated SCB requirement in a year in which they are not subject to the supervisory stress test. We did not elect to participate in the 2021 supervisory stress test. On August 5, 2021, the FRB announced that our SCB will remain unchanged at 3.4% from October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022. 

In light of the heightened uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns, the FRB took certain actions to preserve capital at banks. Among those actions, the FRB imposed certain limitations on firms for the third and fourth quarters of 2020, including mandatory suspension of share repurchases and limiting common stock dividends to existing rates and the average quarterly net income over the prior four quarters. The FRB modified its limitations on capital distributions for the first and second quarters of 2021 such that firms that participate in CCAR, like us, may resume share repurchases provided that the aggregate of share repurchases and common stock dividends for the applicable quarter did not exceed average quarterly net income for the trailing four quarters. Beginning July 1, 2021, the FRB lifted the temporary additional restrictions on capital distributions and authorized firms, like us, that are on a two-year cycle and not subject to supervisory stress testing this year to make capital distributions that are consistent with the regulatory capital rules, including normal restrictions under the FRB stress capital buffer framework. In addition, we temporarily suspended share repurchases in connection with entering into the agreement to acquire Investors, and are poised to resume share repurchases after the Investors shareholder vote scheduled for November 19, 2021. In January 2021, our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to $750 million of our common stock, of which $655 million is available as of September 30, 2021. All future capital distributions are subject to consideration and approval by our board of directors prior to execution. The timing and amount of future dividends and share repurchases will depend on various factors, including our capital position, financial performance, risk-weighted assets, capital impacts of strategic initiatives, market conditions and regulatory considerations. 

Regulations relating to capital planning, regulatory reporting and SCB requirements applicable to firms like us are subject to ongoing rule-making and potential further guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators. We will continue to evaluate the impact of these and any other prudential regulatory changes, including their potential resultant changes in our regulatory and compliance costs and expenses. 

For more information, see &#8220;Regulation and Supervision&#8221; and &#8220;&#8212;Capital and Regulatory Matters&#8221; in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Capital Framework 

Under the current U.S. Basel III capital framework, we and our banking subsidiary, CBNA, must meet the following specific minimum requirements: CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%, tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, total capital ratio of 8.0% and tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. As a bank holding company, our SCB of 3.4% is imposed on top of 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 34 

the three minimum risk-based capital ratios listed above and a CCB of 2.5% is imposed on top of the three minimum risk-based capital ratios listed above for our banking subsidiary. 

Under the U.S. Basel III rules, the CET1 deduction threshold for MSRs, certain deferred tax assets and significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated institutions is 25%. As of September 30, 2021, we did not meet the threshold for these additional capital deductions. MSRs or deferred tax assets not deducted from CET1 capital are assigned a 250% risk weight and significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions not deducted from CET1 capital are assigned an exposure category risk weight. 

In reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FRB and the other federal banking regulators adopted a final rule relative to regulatory capital treatment of ACL under CECL. This rule allowed electing banking organizations to delay the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital for a two-year period ending January 1, 2022, followed by a three-year transition period ending January 1, 2025 to phase-in the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided during the initial two-year delay. As of September 30, 2021, $401 million of the capital benefit has been accumulated for application to the three-year transition period. 

For additional discussion of the U.S. Basel III capital framework and its related application, see &#8220;Regulation and Supervision&#8221; in our 2020 Form 10-K. The table below presents our actual regulatory capital ratios under the U.S. Basel III Standardized rules: 

Table 24: Regulatory Capital Ratios Under the U.S. Basel III Standardized Rules September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Required Minimum plus Required CCB for Non-Leverage Ratios (1) 

(in millions, except ratio data) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio CET1 capital $15,584 10.3 % $14,607 10.0 % 7.9 % Tier 1 capital 17,598 11.6 16,572 11.3 9.4 Total capital 20,295 13.4 19,602 13.4 11.4 Tier 1 leverage 17,598 9.7 16,572 9.4 4.0 Risk-weighted assets 151,796 146,781 Quarterly adjusted average assets 180,528 175,370 

(1) Required &#8220;Minimum Capital ratios&#8221; are: CET1 capital of 4.5%; Tier 1 capital of 6.0%; Total capital of 8.0%; and Tier 1 leverage of 4.0%. &#8220;Minimum Capital ratios&#8221; also include a SCB of 3.4%; N/A to Tier 1 leverage. 

At September 30, 2021, our CET1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital ratios were 10.3%, 11.6% and 13.4%, respectively, as compared with 10.0% , 11.3% and 13.4%, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. The CET1 capital ratio increased as net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was partially offset by dividends and common share repurchases as described in &#8220;&#8212;Capital Transactions&#8221; below, $5.0 billion of risk-weighted asset (&#8220;RWA&#8221;) growth and a decrease in the modified CECL transitional amount. The tier 1 capital ratio increased due to the changes in the CET1 capital ratio described above and the issuance of Series G Preferred Stock, partially offset by the redemption of Series A Preferred Stock as described in &#8220;&#8212;Capital Transactions&#8221; below. The total capital ratio increased as the changes in the CET1 and tier 1 capital ratios described above combined with the subordinated debt exchange offer in the first quarter of 2021, as described in the &#8220;Regulatory Capital Ratios and Capital Composition&#8221; section below, were partially offset by the reduction in the net AACL impact and a decrease in qualifying subordinated debt. At September 30, 2021, our CET1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital ratios were approximately 240 basis points, 220 basis points and 200 basis points, respectively, above their regulatory minimums plus our SCB. All ratios remained well above the U.S. Basel III minimums. 

Regulatory Capital Ratios and Capital Composition 

CET1 capital under U.S. Basel III Standardized rules totaled $15.6 billion at September 30, 2021, an increase of $977 million from $14.6 billion at December 31, 2020, largely driven by net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, partially offset by dividends, a decrease in the modified CECL transitional amount and common share repurchases. Tier 1 capital at September 30, 2021 totaled $17.6 billion, reflecting a $1.0 billion increase from $16.6 billion at December 31, 2020, driven by the changes in CET1 capital and the issuance of Series G Preferred Stock, partially offset by the redemption of Series A Preferred Stock. Total capital of $20.3 billion at September 30, 2021 increased $693 million from December 31, 2020, driven by the changes in CET1 and tier 1 capital and an increase in qualifying subordinated debt, partially offset by the reduction in the net AACL impact. 

RWA totaled $151.8 billion at September 30, 2021, based on U.S. Basel III Standardized rules, up $5.0 billion from December 31, 2020, driven by higher automobile loans, commercial commitments, MSRs, agency 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 35 

securities, education loans, bank-owned life insurance and retail commitments partially offset by lower commercial and other retail loans. 

As of September 30, 2021, the tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.7%, up from 9.4% at December 31, 2020, driven by higher tier 1 capital, partially offset by the $5.2 billion increase in quarterly adjusted average assets.

(1) As of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the amount of non-qualifying subordinated debt excluded from regulatory capital was $349 million and $348 million, respectively. 

(2) Excess allowance represents the amount excluded from tier 2 capital that is in excess of 1.25% of risk weighted assets, excluding market risk. 

On February 11, 2021, we completed $265 million in private exchange offers for five series of outstanding subordinated notes. Exchange offer participants received newly-issued fixed-rate reset subordinated notes due 2031 which are redeemable by us five years prior to their maturity. These subordinated debt exchange offers will benefit our tier 2 and total capital going forward by increasing the amount of subordinated debt eligible for inclusion in tier 2 capital without increasing the aggregate principal amount of subordinated debt outstanding. See Note 7 for more details on our outstanding subordinated debt. 

Capital Adequacy Process 

Our assessment of capital adequacy begins with our board-approved risk appetite and risk management framework. This framework provides for the identification, measurement and management of material risks. There have been no significant changes to our capital adequacy risk appetite and risk management framework as described in &#8220;&#8212;Capital and Regulatory Matters&#8221; in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Capital Transactions 

We completed the following capital actions during the nine months ended September 30, 2021:

Banking Subsidiary&#8217;s Capital 

Table 26: CBNA's Capital Ratios Under the U.S. Basel III Standardized Rules September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 (dollars in millions, except ratio data) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio CET1 capital $16,791 11.1 % $16,032 10.9 % Tier 1 capital 16,791 11.1 16,032 10.9 Total capital 19,405 12.8 18,980 13.0 Tier 1 leverage 16,791 9.3 16,032 9.2 Risk-weighted assets 151,438 146,558 Quarterly adjusted average assets 180,034 174,954 

CBNA&#8217;s CET1 and tier 1 capital totaled $16.8 billion at September 30, 2021, up $759 million from $16.0 billion at December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily driven by net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, partially offset by dividends paid to the Parent Company and a decrease in the modified CECL transitional amount. Total capital was $19.4 billion at September 30, 2021, an increase of $425 million from $19.0 billion at December 31, 2020, driven by the change in CET1 capital partially offset by the reduction in the net AACL impact. 

CBNA&#8217;s RWA totaled $151.4 billion at September 30, 2021, up $4.9 billion from December 31, 2020, driven by higher automobile loans, commercial commitments, MSRs, agency securities, education loans, bank-owned life insurance and retail commitments partially offset by lower commercial and other retail loans. 

As of September 30, 2021, CBNA&#8217;s tier 1 leverage ratio of 9.3% increased as the increase in tier 1 capital was mostly offset by the $5.1 billion increase in quarterly adjusted average assets. 

LIQUIDITY 

Liquidity is defined as our ability to meet our cash-flow and collateral obligations in a timely manner, at a reasonable cost. An institution must maintain operating liquidity to meet its expected daily and forecasted cash-flow requirements, as well as contingent liquidity to meet unexpected (stress scenario) funding requirements. As noted earlier, reflecting the importance of meeting all unexpected and stress-scenario funding requirements, we identify and manage contingent liquidity, consisting of cash balances at the FRB, unencumbered high-quality and liquid securities, and unused FHLB borrowing capacity. Separately, we also identify and manage asset liquidity as a subset of contingent liquidity, consisting of cash balances at the FRB and unencumbered high-quality securities. We consider the effective and prudent management of liquidity fundamental to our health and strength. We manage liquidity at the consolidated enterprise level and at each legal entity, including at the Parent Company and CBNA level. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 37 

Parent Company Liquidity 

Our Parent Company&#8217;s primary sources of cash are dividends and interest received from CBNA as a result of investing in bank equity and subordinated debt as well as externally issued preferred stock, senior and subordinated debt. Uses of cash include the routine cash flow requirements as a bank holding company, including periodic share repurchases and payments of dividends, interest and expenses; the needs of subsidiaries, including CBNA for additional equity and, as required, its need for debt financing; and the support for extraordinary funding requirements when necessary. To the extent the Parent Company has relied on wholesale borrowings, uses also include payments of related principal and interest. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the Parent Company completed the following transactions: 

&#8226; Redeemed all outstanding shares of 5.50% fixed-to-floating rate non-cumulative perpetual Series A Preferred Stock; 

&#8226; Issued 300,000 shares of 4.00% fixed-rate reset non-cumulative perpetual Series G Preferred Stock at an aggregate offering price of $300 million; and 

&#8226; Redeemed $350 million of 2.375% fixed-rate senior unsecured debt due July 2021. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Parent Company declared dividends on common stock of $167 million and $168 million, respectively, and declared dividends on preferred stock of $26 million and $25 million, respectively. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Parent Company declared dividends on common stock of $502 million and $504 million, respectively, and declared dividends on preferred stock of $81 million and $75 million, respectively. 

Our Parent Company&#8217;s cash and cash equivalents represent a source of liquidity that can be used to meet various needs and totaled $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The Parent Company&#8217;s double-leverage ratio, the combined equity investment in Parent Company subsidiaries divided by Parent Company equity, is a measure of reliance on equity cash flows from subsidiaries to fund Parent Company obligations. At September 30, 2021, the Parent Company&#8217;s double-leverage ratio was 97.2%. 

CBNA Liquidity 

As CBNA&#8217;s primary business involves taking deposits and making loans, a key role of liquidity management is to ensure that customers have timely access to funds from deposits and for loans. Liquidity management also involves maintaining sufficient liquidity to repay wholesale borrowings, pay operating expenses and support extraordinary funding requirements when necessary. In the ordinary course of business, the liquidity of CBNA is managed by matching sources and uses of cash. The primary sources of bank liquidity include deposits from our consumer and commercial customers; payments of principal and interest on loans and debt securities; and wholesale borrowings, as needed, and as described under &#8220;&#8212;Liquidity Risk Management and Governance.&#8221; The primary uses of bank liquidity include withdrawals and maturities of deposits; payment of interest on deposits; funding of loans and related commitments; and funding of securities purchases. To the extent that CBNA has relied on wholesale borrowings, uses also include payments of related principal and interest. For further information on CBNA&#8217;s outstanding debt, see Note 7. 

Liquidity Risk 

We define liquidity risk as the risk that an entity will be unable to meet its payment obligations in a timely manner, at a reasonable cost. Liquidity risk can arise due to contingent liquidity risk and/or funding liquidity risk. 

Contingent liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions may reduce an entity&#8217;s ability to liquidate, pledge and/or finance certain assets and thereby substantially reduce the liquidity value of such assets. Drivers of contingent liquidity risk include general market disruptions as well as specific issues regarding the credit quality and/or valuation of a security or loan, issuer or borrower and/or asset class. 

Funding liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions and/or entity-specific events may reduce an entity&#8217;s ability to raise funds from depositors and/or wholesale market counterparties. Drivers of funding liquidity risk may be idiosyncratic or systemic, reflecting impediments to operations and/or damaged market confidence.

Factors Affecting Liquidity 

Given the composition of assets and borrowing sources, contingent liquidity risk at CBNA would be materially affected by events such as deterioration of financing markets for high-quality securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities and other instruments issued by the GNMA, FNMA and the FHLMC), by any inability of the FHLBs to provide collateralized advances and/or by a refusal of the FRB to act as a lender of last resort in systemic stress. 

Similarly, given the structure of its balance sheet, the funding liquidity risk of CBNA would be materially affected by an adverse idiosyncratic event (e.g., a major loss, causing a perceived or actual deterioration in its financial condition), an adverse systemic event (e.g., default or bankruptcy of a significant capital markets participant), or a combination of both. Consequently, and despite ongoing exposure to a variety of idiosyncratic and systemic events, we view our contingent liquidity risk and our funding liquidity risk to be relatively modest. 

An additional variable affecting our access to unsecured wholesale market funds and to large denomination (i.e., uninsured) customer deposits is the credit ratings assigned by such agencies as Moody&#8217;s, Standard and Poor&#8217;s, and Fitch. 

Table 27: Credit Ratings &#160; September 30, 2021 &#160; Moody&#8217;s

&#160; NR = Not rated 

Changes in our public credit ratings could affect both the cost and availability of our wholesale funding. As a result, and in order to maintain a conservative funding profile, CBNA continues to minimize reliance on unsecured wholesale funding. At September 30, 2021, our wholesale funding consisted primarily of term debt issued by the Parent Company and CBNA. 

Existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements represent another key driver of systemic liquidity conditions and liquidity management practices. The FRB, the OCC, and the FDIC regularly evaluate our liquidity as part of the overall supervisory process. In addition, we are subject to existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements, some of which are subject to further rulemaking, guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators. For further discussion, see &#8220;Regulation and Supervision &#8212; Tailoring of Prudential Requirements&#8221; and &#8220;&#8212;Liquidity Requirements&#8221; in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Liquidity Risk Management and Governance 

Liquidity risk is measured and managed by the Funding and Liquidity unit within our Treasury unit in accordance with policy guidelines promulgated by our Board and the Asset Liability Committee. In managing liquidity risk, the Funding and Liquidity unit delivers regular and comprehensive reporting, including current levels versus threshold limits for a broad set of liquidity metrics and early warning indicators, explanatory commentary relating to emerging risk trends and, as appropriate, recommended remedial strategies. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 39 

Our Funding and Liquidity unit&#8217;s primary goals are to deliver and maintain prudent levels of operating liquidity to support expected and projected funding requirements, contingent liquidity to support unexpected funding requirements resulting from idiosyncratic, systemic, and combination stress events, and regulatory liquidity requirements in a timely manner from stable and cost-efficient funding sources. We seek to accomplish this goal by funding loans with stable deposits; by prudently controlling dependence on wholesale funding, particularly short-term unsecured funding; and by maintaining ample available liquidity, including a contingent liquidity buffer of unencumbered high-quality loans and securities. As of September 30, 2021: 

&#8226; Organically generated deposits continue to be our primary source of funding, resulting in a consolidated period end loan-to-deposits ratio, excluding LHFS, of 81.0%; 

&#8226; Our cash position, which is defined as cash balance held at the FRB, totaled $12.5 billion; 

&#8226; Our total available liquidity, comprised of contingent liquidity and available discount window capacity, was approximately $76.1 billion; 

&#8226; Contingent liquidity was $48.7 billion, consisting of unencumbered high-quality liquid securities of $21.1 billion, unused FHLB capacity of $15.1 billion, and our cash position of $12.5 billion. Asset liquidity, a component of contingent liquidity, was $33.6 billion, consisting of our cash position of $12.5 billion and unencumbered high-quality liquid securities of $21.1 billion; 

&#8226; Available discount window capacity, defined as available total borrowing capacity from the FRB based on identified collateral, is secured by non-mortgage commercial and retail loans and totaled $27.4 billion. Use of this borrowing capacity would be considered only during exigent circumstances; and 

&#8226; For a summary of our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 

The Funding and Liquidity unit monitors a variety of liquidity and funding metrics and early warning indicators and metrics, including specific risk thresholds limits. These monitoring tools are broadly classified as follows: 

&#8226; Current liquidity sources and capacities, including cash at the FRBs, free and liquid securities and secured FHLB borrowing capacity; 

&#8226; Liquidity stress sources, including idiosyncratic, systemic and combined stresses, in addition to evolving regulatory requirements; and 

&#8226; Current and prospective exposures, including secured and unsecured wholesale funding and spot and cumulative cash-flow gaps across a variety of horizons. 

Further, certain of these metrics are monitored individually for CBNA and for our consolidated enterprise on a daily basis, including cash position, unencumbered securities, asset liquidity and available FHLB borrowing capacity. In order to identify emerging trends and risks and inform funding decisions, specific metrics are also forecasted over a one-year horizon.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

Our unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Report, are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our audited Consolidated Financial Statements. 

An accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on our unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are made using facts and circumstances known at a point in time. Changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates. Our most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below. For additional information regarding fair value measurements, see &#8220;&#8212;Critical Accounting Estimates&#8221; in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The ACL decreased from $2.7 billion at December 31, 2020 to $2.0 billion at September 30, 2021, reflecting a reserve release of $666 million. 

To determine the ACL as of September 30, 2021, we utilized an economic forecast that generally reflects real GDP growth of approximately 5.8% over 2021. The forecast also projects the unemployment rate to be in the range of 5.3% to 6.3% throughout 2021. This forecast reflects an overall improved macroeconomic outlook as compared to December 31, 2020. We continue to utilize our qualitative allowance framework to reassess and adjust ACL reserve levels. Macroeconomic forecast risk, driven by uncertainty and volatility of key macroeconomic variables, is one of the primary factors influencing our qualitative reserve. As the economic recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic has continued, we have assessed risks to the recovery, including potential for continuing impacts from COVID-19 variants, challenges in the global supply chain, and recent inflationary trends, as well as potential impacts from ending monetary and fiscal stimulus programs. In addition to judgment applied to the commercial portfolio as a whole, we continued to apply management judgment to adjust the modeled reserves in the commercial industry sectors most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns, including CRE retail, CRE office and hospitality and casual dining. 

Our determination of the ACL is sensitive to changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions during the reasonable and supportable period. To illustrate the sensitivity, we applied a more pessimistic scenario than that described above which assumes that challenges in acceptance of vaccines cause COVID-19-related infections to abate later than in our base case scenario, with concerns rising about resistant strains. Consumer spending is slower to rebound, with businesses reopening more slowly and vacation spending muted. This pessimistic scenario reflects real GDP growth of approximately 2.5% and unemployment in the range of 5.9% to 8.4% over 2021. Excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments, this scenario would result in a quantitative lifetime loss estimate of approximately 1.2x our modeled period-end ACL, or an increase of approximately $230 million. This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimate and not to the overall period-end ACL, which includes qualitative adjustments. 

Because several quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in determining the ACL, this sensitivity analysis does not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the ACL or even what the ACL would be under these economic circumstances. The sensitivity is intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment and the corresponding impact to modeled loss estimates. The hypothetical determination does not incorporate the impact of management judgment or other qualitative factors that could be applied in the actual estimation of the ACL and does not imply any expectation of future deterioration in our loss rates. 

To provide additional context regarding sensitivity to more pessimistic scenarios, our ACL balance of $2.0 billion represents 23% of the $8.6 billion of n ine-quarter losses projected in the Federal Reserve run of the December 2020 Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario, which forecasted more protracted unemployment and GDP declines compared with our ACL calculation. Our ACL calculation also included the impacts of government stimulus. 

Comparatively, our ACL represents 39% of the $5.1 billion of projected losses in the Company run results of the Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario. Losses projected under the Company Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario are lower than the Federal Reserve results due to methodology and modeling differences. As an example, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s models did not recognize contractual loss sharing arrangements in the merchant loan portfolio. Both the Company and Federal Reserve results include incremental losses associated with loan 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 41 

originations assumed post-September 30, 2020. In contrast, our September 30, 2021 ACL balance considers only existing loans and lines of credit as of the reporting date. 

While the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic continues, significant future uncertainty still exists, including the impacts of COVID-19 variants and challenges from vaccine acceptance rates on consumer sentiment and spending behavior. It remains difficult to estimate how changes in economic forecasts might affect our ACL because such forecasts consider a wide variety of variables and inputs, and changes in the variables and inputs may not occur at the same time or in the same direction, and such changes may have differing impacts by product types. The variables and inputs may be idiosyncratically affected by risks to the recovery, including potential for continuing impacts from COVID-19 variants, challenges in the global supply chain and recent inflationary trends, as well as potential impacts from ending monetary and fiscal stimulus programs. Changes in one or multiple of the key variables may have a material impact to our estimation of expected credit losses. 

We continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 and related fiscal and monetary policy measures on the economy and the resulting potentially material effects on the ACL. 

For additional information regarding the ACL, see Note 4 of this report, and &#8220;Critical Accounting Estimates&#8221; and Note 5 in the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K. 

RISK GOVERNANCE 

We are committed to maintaining a strong, integrated, and proactive approach to the management of all risks to which we are exposed in pursuit of our business objectives. A key aspect of our Board&#8217;s responsibility as the main decision making body is setting our risk appetite to ensure that the levels of risk that we are willing to accept in the attainment of our strategic business and financial objectives are clearly understood. 

To enable our Board to carry out its objectives, it has delegated authority for risk management activities, as well as governance and oversight of those activities, to a number of Board and executive management level risk committees. The Executive Risk Committee (&#8220;ERC&#8221;), chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, is responsible for oversight of risk across the enterprise and actively considers our inherent material risks, analyzes our overall risk profile and seeks confirmation that the risks are being appropriately identified, assessed and mitigated. Reporting to the ERC are the following additional committees covering specific areas of risk: Compliance and Operational Risk Committee, Model Risk Committee, Credit Policy Committee, Asset Liability Committee, Business Initiatives Review Committee, and the Conduct and Ethics Committee. 

There have been no significant changes in our risk governance practices, risk framework, risk appetite, or credit risk as described in &#8220;&#8212;Risk Governance&#8221; in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

MARKET RISK 

Market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and/or other relevant market rates or prices. Modest market risk arises from trading activities that serve customer needs, including hedging of interest rate and foreign exchange risk. As described below, more material market risk arises from our non-trading banking activities, such as loan origination and deposit-gathering. We have established enterprise-wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor and report market risk. We actively manage market risk for both non-trading and trading activities. 

Non-Trading Risk 

We are exposed to market risk as a result of non-trading banking activities. This market risk is substantially composed of interest rate risk, as we have no commodity risk and de minimis direct currency and equity risk. We also have market risk related to capital markets loan originations, as well as the valuation of our MSRs. There have been no significant changes in our sources of interest rate risk, interest rate risk practices, risk framework, metrics or assumptions as described in &#8220;&#8212;Market Risk &#8212; Non-Trading Risk&#8221; in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

The table below reports net interest income exposures against a variety of interest rate scenarios. Our policies involve measuring exposures as a percentage change in net interest income over the next year due to either instantaneous or gradual parallel changes in rates relative to the market implied forward yield curve. As the following table illustrates, our balance sheet is asset sensitive; net interest income would benefit from an increase in interest rates, while exposure to a decline in interest rates is within limit. While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates is included in this analysis, we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and therefore have a more modest impact. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 42 

The table below presents the sensitivity of net interest income to various parallel yield curve shifts from the market implied forward yield curve: 

Table 29: Sensitivity of Net Interest Income Estimated % Change in Net Interest Income over 12 Months Basis points September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Instantaneous Change in Interest Rates &#160; &#160; 200 20.8 % 21.2 % 100 10.9 11.2 -25 (2.4) (2.7) Gradual Change in Interest Rates 200 9.8 10.8 100 4.9 5.5 -25 (1.2) (1.5) 

We continue to manage asset sensitivity within the scope of our policy and changing market conditions. Asset sensitivity against a 200 basis point gradual increase in rates decreased 1.0% to 9.8% as of September 30, 2021 as compared to 10.8% at December 31, 2020, resulting from loan and deposit mix changes and the addition of $10.5 billion of receive-fixed/pay-variable interest rate swaps. Current levels of asset sensitivity remain elevated relative to our core sensitivity profile due to these cash and deposit balances which are a result of monetary and fiscal stimulus programs. Changes in interest rates can also affect the risk positions, which impacts the repricing sensitivity or beta of the deposit base as well as the cash flows on assets that allow for early payoff without a penalty. The risk position is managed within our risk limits, and long-term view of interest rates through occasional adjustments to securities investments, interest rate swaps and mix of funding. 

We use a valuation measure of exposure to structural interest rate risk, Economic Value of Equity (&#8220;EVE&#8221;), as a supplement to net interest income simulations. EVE complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure over a long-term horizon. EVE measures the extent to which the economic value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. This analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with non-contractual maturities. The change in value is expressed as a percentage of regulatory capital. 

We use interest rate swap contracts to manage the interest rate exposure to variability in the interest cash flows on our floating-rate assets and floating-rate wholesale funding, and to hedge market risk on fixed-rate capital markets debt issuances.

(1) Asset Liability Management (&#8220;ALM&#8221;) strategies used to manage interest rate exposures include interest rate swap contracts used to manage exposure to the variability in the interest cash flows on our floating-rate commercial loans and floating-rate wholesale funding, as well as the variability in the fair value of AFS securities. 

(2) December 31, 2020 includes $1.8 billion of forward-starting, pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were terminated in the first quarter of 2021. 

Using the interest rate curve at September 30, 2021, the estimated net contribution to net interest income related to our ALM hedge strategies is approximately $103 million for the full-year 2021 compared to $133 million for the full-year 2020. The estimated net contribution could differ from amounts actually recognized due to changes in interest rates and the addition of other hedges subsequent to September 30, 2021.

The following table presents the pre-tax net gains (losses) recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income relating to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges: 

Table 31: Pre-Tax Gains (Losses) Recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Amount of pre-tax net gains (losses) recognized in OCI ($15) $&#8212; $19 $118 Amount of pre-tax net gains (losses) reclassified from OCI into interest income 46 68 141 128 Amount of pre-tax net gains (losses) reclassified from OCI into interest expense (13) (11) (37) (22) 

(1) Using the interest rate curve at September 30, 2021, with respect to cash flow hedge strategies, we estimate that approximately $76 million will be reclassified from AOCI to net interest income over the next 12 months. 

LIBOR Transition 

As previously disclosed, many of our lending products, securities, derivatives, and other financial transactions utilize the LIBOR benchmark rate and will be impacted by its planned discontinuance. In late 2018, we formed a LIBOR Transition Program designed to guide the organization through the planned discontinuation of LIBOR. The Program, with direction and oversight from our Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for developing, maintaining and executing against a coordinated strategy to ensure a timely and orderly transition from LIBOR. The Program is structured to address various initiatives including program governance, transition management, communications, exposure management, new alternative reference rate product delivery, risk management, contract remediation, operations and technology readiness, accounting and reporting, as well as tax and regulation impacts. Risks associated with the LIBOR transition are tracked and reviewed on a quarterly basis with a focus on the identification of mitigation actions. 

The ARRC recommended that banks be systemically and operationally capable of supporting transactions in alternative reference rates, such as SOFR, by the end of September 2020. Guided by this milestone, we are systemically and operationally prepared to support alternative reference rate transactions. On March 5, 2021, the Financial Conduct Authority (&#8220;FCA&#8221;) formally announced the future cessation or loss of representation of the LIBOR benchmark settings currently published by the Intercontinental Exchange (&#8220;ICE&#8221;) Benchmark Administration. Further, the FCA stated that the 1-week and 2-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR rates will cease as of December 31, 2021 and all other U.S. Dollar LIBOR tenors will cease as of June 30, 2023. With the FRB, OCC, and FDIC (collectively, the agencies) supporting this announcement, the LIBOR Transition Program adjusted LIBOR transition activities and timelines accordingly. The agencies continue to urge market participants to stop entering into new U.S. Dollar LIBOR contracts as soon as practicable, but no later than the end of 2021. We are continuing all efforts to move new originations to alternative reference rates over the course of 2021 in anticipation of this deadline. However, our plans for legacy contract remediation now extend through mid-2023 given the FCA announcement. More broadly, program governance remains robust, and progress has been made in the above-outlined initiatives as management continues to closely monitor industry and regulatory developments pertaining to the transition. 

C apital Markets 

A key component of our capital markets activities is the underwriting and distribution of corporate credit facilities to partially finance merger and acquisition transactions for our clients. We have a rigorous risk management process around these activities, including a limit structure capping our underwriting risk, our potential loss, and sub limits for specific asset classes. Further, the ability to approve underwriting exposure is delegated only to senior level individuals in the credit risk management and capital markets organizations with each transaction adjudicated in the Loan Underwriting Approval Committee. 

Mortgage Servicing Rights &#160; 

We have market risk associated with the value of residential MSRs, which are impacted by various types of inherent risks, including duration, basis, convexity, volatility and yield curve. 

As part of our overall risk management strategy relative to the fair market value of the MSRs, we enter into various free-standing derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, interest rate swaptions, interest rate futures, and forward contracts to purchase mortgage-backed securities to economically hedge the changes in fair value. As of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the fair value of our MSRs was $978 million and $658 million, respectively, and the total notional amount of related derivative contracts was $15.4 billion and $11.4 billion, 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 44 

respectively. Gains and losses on MSRs and the related derivatives used for hedging are included in mortgage banking fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

As with our traded market risk-based activities, earnings at-risk excludes the impact of MSRs. MSRs are captured under our single price risk management framework that is used for calculating a management value at risk that is consistent with the definition used by banking regulators. 

Trading Risk 

We are exposed to market risk primarily through client facilitation activities including derivatives and foreign exchange products as well as underwriting and market making activities. Exposure is created as a result of changes in interest rates and related basis spreads and volatility, foreign exchange rates, and credit spreads on a select range of interest rates, foreign exchange, commodities, corporate bonds and secondary loan instruments. These trading activities are conducted through CBNA and CCMI. There have been no significant changes in our market risk governance, market risk measurement, or market risk practices including VaR, stressed VaR, sensitivity analysis, stress testing, or VaR model review and validation as described in &#8220;&#8212;Market Risk &#8212; Trading Risk&#8221; in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Market Risk Regulatory Capital 

The U.S. banking regulators&#8217; &#8220;Market Risk Rule&#8221; covers the calculation of market risk capital. For the purposes of the Market Risk Rule, all of our client facing trades and associated hedges maintain a net low risk and do qualify as &#8220;covered positions.&#8221; The internal management VaR measure is calculated based on the same population of trades that is utilized for regulatory VaR.

VaR Backtesting 

Backtesting is one form of validation of the VaR model and is run daily. The Market Risk Rule requires a comparison of our internal VaR measure to the actual net trading revenue (excluding fees, commissions, reserves, intra-day trading and net interest income) for each day over the preceding year (the most recent 250 business days). Any observed loss in excess of the VaR number is taken as an exception. The level of exceptions determines the multiplication factor used to derive the VaR and SVaR-based capital requirement for regulatory reporting purposes, when applicable. We perform sub-portfolio backtesting as required under the Market Risk Rule, using models approved by our banking regulators, for interest rate, credit spread, commodity, and foreign exchange positions.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

Basis of Presentation 

The unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements, including the Notes presented in this document of Citizens Financial Group, Inc., have been prepared in accordance with GAAP interim reporting requirements, and therefore do not include all information and Notes included in the audited Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP. These unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes presented in this document should be read in conjunction with the Company&#8217;s audited Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes included in the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K. The Company&#8217;s principal business activity is banking, conducted through its banking subsidiary, CBNA. 

The unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and subsidiaries in which the Company has a controlling financial interest. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The Company has evaluated its unconsolidated entities and does not believe that any entity in which it has an interest, but does not currently consolidate, meets the requirements to be consolidated as a variable interest entity. The unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near-term relate to the determination of the ACL. 

Significant Accounting Policies 

For further information regarding the Company&#8217;s significant accounting policies, see Note 1 in the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K. 

Completed Acquisitions 

On September 1, 2021, the Company closed on its acquisition of Willamette, a Chicago, Illinois-based business valuation, forensic analysis, and transaction financial advisory services firm. This acquisition resulted in an estimated increase to goodwill of $ 15 million which was allocated to the Commercial business segment as of September 30, 2021. The Company expects that some adjustments of the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed may subsequently be recorded, although any such adjustments are not expected to be material. 

Pending Acquisitions 

On May 26, 2021, the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire 80 East Coast branches and the national online deposit business from HSBC for an approximate 2.0 % premium paid on deposits at closing. The branch purchase includes 66 locations in the New York City Metro area, 9 locations in the Mid-Atlantic/Washington D.C. area, and 5 locations in Southeast Florida. As of September 30, 2021, there were approximately $ 8.4 billion in deposits and $ 1.9 billion in loans. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing terms and conditions and regulatory approvals. 

On July 28, 2021, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger under which the Company will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Investors for a combination of stock and cash. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Investors shareholders will receive 0.297 of a share of the Company&#8217;s common stock and $ 1.46 in cash for each share of Investors they own. The acquisition of Investors builds our physical presence in the northeast with the addition of 154 branches located in the greater New York City and Philadelphia metropolitan areas and across New Jersey. As of September 30, 2021, Investors had total assets of $ 27.3 billion, including $ 21.6 billion of loans, $ 24.5 billion of liabilities, including $ 20.4 billion of deposits, and $ 2.8 billion of stockholders&#8217; equity. The merger is expected to close in early second quarter 2022, subject to approval by the shareholders of Investors, regulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions. 

On September 8, 2021, Citizens entered into a definitive agreement to acquire JMP in an all-cash transaction. Under the agreement, JMP shareholders will receive $ 7.50 for each common share of JMP they own, 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 57 

or approximately $ 149 million in cash. This transaction is targeted to close in mid-fourth quarter 2021, subject to approval by the shareholders of JMP and other customary closing conditions.

September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 (in millions) Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value Pledged against derivatives, to qualify for fiduciary powers, and to secure public and other deposits as required by law $ 4,547 &#160; $ 4,556 &#160; $ 3,818 &#160; $ 3,937 &#160; Pledged against FHLB borrowed funds 227 &#160; 239 &#160; 394 &#160; 423 &#160; Pledged against repurchase agreements 1 &#160; 1 &#160; 224 &#160; 231 &#160; 

The Company regularly enters into security repurchase agreements with unrelated counterparties, which involve the transfer of a security from one party to another, and a subsequent transfer of substantially the same security back to the original party. These repurchase agreements are typically short-term in nature and are accounted for as secured borrowed funds in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company recognized no offsetting of short-term receivables or payables as of September 30, 2021 or December 31, 2020. The Company offsets certain derivative assets and derivative liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For further information, see Note 8. 

Securitizations of mortgage loans retained in the investment portfolio were $ 60 million and $ 223 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively. There were $ 34 million securitizations of mortgage loans retained in the investment portfolio for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020. These securitizations include a substantive guarantee by a third party. In 2021, the guarantors were FNMA, FHLMC, and GNMA. The debt securities received from the guarantors are classified as AFS. 

Impairment 

As of September 30, 2021, the Company concluded that 68 % of HTM securities met the zero expected credit loss criteria; therefore, no ACL was recognized. For the remainder, the lifetime expected credit losses were determined to be insignificant based on the modeling of the Company&#8217;s credit loss position in the securities. The Company monitors the credit exposure through the use of credit quality indicators. For these securities, the Company uses external credit ratings or an internally derived credit rating when an external rating is not available. All securities were determined to be investment grade at September 30, 2021. 

The following tables present AFS mortgage-backed debt securities with fair values below their respective carrying values, separated by the duration the securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position:

Citizens does not currently have the intent to sell these debt securities, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell these debt securities prior to recovery of their amortized cost bases. Citizens has determined that credit losses are not expected to be incurred on the agency MBS, non-agency MBS, and CLOs identified with unrealized losses as of September 30, 2021. The unrealized losses on these debt securities reflect non-credit-related factors driven by changes in interest rates. Therefore, the Company has determined that these debt securities are not impaired.

NOTE 4 - ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, NONACCRUAL LOANS AND LEASES, AND CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK 

Allowance for Credit Losses &#160; 

Recorded in the ACL is management&#8217;s estimate of expected credit losses in the Company&#8217;s loan and lease portfolios. See Note 5 in the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of the ACL reserve methodology and estimation techniques as of December 31, 2020. There were no significant changes to the ACL reserve methodology in the nine months ended September 30, 2021. 

The following table presents a summary of changes in the ALLL and the allowance for unfunded lending commitments for the three months ended and nine months ended September 30, 2021: 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2021 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 (in millions) Commercial Retail Total Commercial Retail Total Allowance for loan and lease losses, beginning of period $ 953 &#160; $ 994 &#160; $ 1,947 &#160; $ 1,233 &#160; $ 1,210 &#160; $ 2,443 &#160; Charge-offs ( 17 ) ( 70 ) ( 87 ) ( 196 ) ( 243 ) ( 439 ) Recoveries 3 &#160; 40 &#160; 43 &#160; 37 &#160; 122 &#160; 159 &#160; Net charge-offs ( 14 ) ( 30 ) ( 44 ) ( 159 ) ( 121 ) ( 280 ) Provision charged to income ( 72 ) 24 &#160; ( 48 ) ( 207 ) ( 101 ) ( 308 ) Allowance for loan and lease losses, end of period $ 867 &#160; $ 988 &#160; $ 1,855 &#160; $ 867 &#160; $ 988 &#160; $ 1,855 &#160; Allowance for unfunded lending commitments, beginning of period $ 121 &#160; $ 13 &#160; $ 134 &#160; $ 186 &#160; $ 41 &#160; $ 227 &#160; Provision for unfunded lending commitments 9 &#160; 6 &#160; 15 &#160; ( 56 ) ( 22 ) ( 78 ) Allowance for unfunded lending commitments, end of period $ 130 &#160; $ 19 &#160; $ 149 &#160; $ 130 &#160; $ 19 &#160; $ 149 &#160; 

Overall, an ending ACL balance of $ 2.0 billion at September 30, 2021 compared to $ 2.7 billion at December 31, 2020. The difference in ACL as of September 30, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020 was due to net charge-offs of $ 280 million, as detailed below, coupled with a credit provision benefit of $ 386 million. This reflected strong credit performance across the retail and commercial loan portfolios, and improvement in the macroeconomic outlook. 

The decrease in commercial net charge-offs of $ 126 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2020 reflects the economic recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns. Retail net charge-offs were down $ 97 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as a result of government stimulus and forbearance programs as well as strong collateral values in residential real estate and automobile. 

To determine the ACL as of September 30, 2021, Citizens utilized an economic forecast that generally reflects real GDP growth of approximately 5.8% over 2021. The forecast also projects the unemployment rate to be in the range of 5.3% to 6.3% throughout 2021. This forecast reflects an overall improved macroeconomic outlook as compared to December 31, 2020. We continue to utilize our qualitative allowance framework to reassess and adjust ACL reserve levels. Macroeconomic forecast risk, driven by uncertainty and volatility of key macroeconomic variables, is one of the primary factors influencing our qualitative reserve. As the economic recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic has continued, we have assessed risks to the recovery, including potential for continuing impacts from COVID-19 variants, challenges in the global supply chain, and recent inflationary trends, as well as potential impacts from ending monetary and fiscal stimulus programs. In addition to judgment applied to the commercial portfolio as a whole, Citizens continued to apply management judgment

to adjust the modeled reserves in the commercial industry sectors most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns, including CRE retail, CRE office and hospitality and casual dining.

Credit Quality Indicators 

The Company presents loan and lease portfolio segments and classes by credit quality indicator and vintage year. Citizens defines the vintage date for the purpose of this disclosure as the date of the most recent credit decision. In general, renewals are categorized as new credit decisions and reflect the renewal date as the vintage date. Loans modified in a TDR are considered a continuation of the original loan and vintage date corresponds with the most recent credit decision. 

For commercial loans and leases, Citizens utilizes regulatory classification ratings to monitor credit quality. The assignment of regulatory classification ratings occurs at loan origination and are periodically re-evaluated by Citizens utilizing a risk-based approach, including any time management becomes aware of information affecting the borrowers' ability to fulfill their obligations. The review process considers both quantitative and qualitative factors. Loans with a &#8220;pass&#8221; rating are those that the Company believes will fully repay in accordance with the contractual loan terms. Commercial loans and leases identified as &#8220;criticized&#8221; have some weakness or potential weakness that indicate an increased probability of future loss. Citizens groups &#8220;criticized&#8221; loans into three categories, &#8220;special mention,&#8221; &#8220;substandard,&#8221; and &#8220;doubtful.&#8221; Special mention loans have potential weaknesses that, if left uncorrected, may result in deterioration of the Company&#8217;s credit position at some future date. Substandard loans are inadequately protected loans; these loans have well-defined weaknesses that could hinder normal repayment or collection of the debt. Doubtful loans have the same weaknesses as substandard, with the added characteristic that the possibility of loss is high and collection of the full amount of the loan is improbable.

For retail loans, Citizens utilizes FICO credit scores and the loan&#8217;s payment and delinquency status to monitor credit quality. Management believes FICO scores are the strongest indicator of credit losses over the contractual life of the loan and assist management in predicting the borrower&#8217;s future payment performance. Scores are based on current and historical national industry-wide consumer level credit performance data.

Concentrations of Credit Risk 

Most of the Company&#8217;s lending activity is with customers located in the New England, Mid-Atlantic, and Midwest regions. Generally, loans are collateralized by assets including real estate, inventory, accounts receivable, other personal property, and investment securities. As of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, Citizens had a significant amount of loans collateralized by residential and commercial real estate. There were no significant concentration risks within the commercial loan or retail loan portfolios. Exposure to credit losses arising from lending transactions may fluctuate with fair values of collateral supporting loans, which may not perform according to contractual agreements. The Company&#8217;s policy is to collateralize loans to the extent necessary. However, based on the financial strength of the applicant and facts Citizens will grant unsecured loans.

Certain loan products, including residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, and credit cards, have contractual features that may increase credit exposure to the Company in the event of an increase in interest rates or a decline in housing values. These products include loans that exceed 90 % of the value of the underlying collateral (high LTV loans), interest-only residential mortgages, and loans with low introductory rates. The following tables present balances of loans with these characteristics:

NOTE 5 - MORTGAGE BANKING AND OTHER 

The Company sells residential mortgages to GSEs and other parties, who may issue securities backed by pools of such loans. The Company retains no beneficial interests in these sales, but may retain the servicing rights for the loans sold. The Company may exercise its option to repurchase eligible government guaranteed residential mortgages or may be obligated to subsequently repurchase a loan if the purchaser discovers a representation or warranty violation such as noncompliance with eligibility or servicing requirements, or customer fraud that should have been identified in a loan file review.

The unpaid principal balance of residential mortgage loans related to our MSR was $ 87.4 billion and $ 81.2 billion at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The Company manages an active hedging strategy to manage the risk associated with changes in the value of the MSR portfolio, which includes the purchase of freestanding derivatives.

(1) Effective January 1, 2020, the Company elected to account for all MSRs previously accounted for under the amortization method under the fair value method. 

(2) Represents changes in value of the MSRs due to i) passage of time including the impact from both regularly scheduled loan principal payments and partial 

paydowns, and ii) loans that paid off during the period. 

(3) Represents changes in value primarily driven by market conditions. These changes are recorded in mortgage banking fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

The fair value of MSRs is estimated by using the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration actual and expected mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rates, contractual servicing fee income, servicing costs, default rates, ancillary income, and other economic factors, which are determined based on current market interest rates. The valuation does not attempt to forecast or predict the future direction of interest rates. 

The sensitivity analysis below presents the impact to current fair value of an immediate 50 basis point and 100 basis point adverse change in key economic assumptions and the decline in fair value if the respective adverse change was realized. These sensitivities are hypothetical, with the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the MSRs calculated independently without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (e.g., changes in interest rates, which drive changes in prepayment rates, could result in changes in the discount rates), which may amplify or counteract the sensitivities. The primary risk inherent in the Company&#8217;s MSRs is an increase in prepayments of the underlying mortgage loans serviced, which is largely dependent upon movements in market interest rates.

NOTE 8 - DERIVATIVES 

In the normal course of business, Citizens enters into a variety of derivative transactions to meet the financing needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. These transactions include interest rate swap contracts, interest rate options, foreign exchange contracts, residential loan commitment rate locks, interest rate future contracts, swaptions, certain commodities, forward commitments to sell TBAs, forward sale contracts and purchase options. The Company does not use derivatives for speculative purposes. Information regarding the valuation methodology and inputs used to estimate the fair value of the Company&#8217;s derivative instruments is described in Note 19 in the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K.

(1) The notional or contractual amount of interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange contracts is the amount upon which interest and other payments under the contract are based. For interest rate contracts, the notional amount is typically not exchanged. Therefore, notional amounts should not be taken as the measure of credit or market risk, as they do not measure the true economic risk of these contracts. 

(2) Amounts represent the impact of enforceable master netting agreements that allow the Company to net settle positive and negative positions as well as collateral paid and received. 

The Company&#8217;s derivative transactions are internally divided into three sub-groups: institutional, customer and residential loan. Certain derivative transactions within these sub-groups are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges, as described below: 

Derivatives Designated As Hedging Instruments 

The Company&#8217;s institutional derivatives qualify for hedge accounting treatment. The net interest accruals on interest rate swaps designated in a fair value or cash flow hedge relationship are treated as an adjustment to interest income or interest expense of the item being hedged. The Company formally documents at inception all hedging relationships, as well as risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various accounting 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 75 

hedges. Additionally, the Company monitors the effectiveness of its hedge relationships during the duration of the hedge period. The methods utilized to assess hedge effectiveness vary based on hedge relationship and the Company monitors each relationship to ensure that management&#8217;s initial intent continues to be satisfied. The Company discontinues hedge accounting treatment when it is determined that a derivative is not expected to be, or has ceased to be, effective as a hedge and subsequently reflects changes in the fair value of the derivative in earnings after termination of the hedge relationship. 

Fair Value Hedges 

Citizens has outstanding interest rate swap agreements utilized to manage the interest rate exposure on its long-term borrowings and AFS debt securities. Certain fair value hedges have been designated as a last-of-layer hedge, which affords the Company the ability to execute a fair value hedge of the interest rate risk associated with a portfolio of similar prepayable assets whereby the last dollar amount estimated to remain in the portfolio of assets is identified as the hedged item. 

The following table presents the change in fair value of interest rate contracts designated as fair value hedges, as well as the change in fair value of the related hedged items attributable to the risk being hedged, included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations:

Cash Flow Hedges 

Citizens has outstanding interest rate swap agreements designed to hedge a portion of the Company&#8217;s floating-rate assets, and liabilities. All of these swaps have been deemed highly effective cash flow hedges. During the next 12 months, there are $ 76 million in pre-tax net gains on derivative instruments included in OCI expected to be reclassified to net interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. This amount could differ from amounts actually recognized due to changes in interest rates, hedge de-designations, and the addition of other hedges subsequent to September 30, 2021. 

The following table presents the pre-tax net gains (losses) recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income relating to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges:

Derivatives Not Designated As Hedging Instruments 

Economic Hedges 

The Company&#8217;s economic hedges include those related to offsetting customer derivatives, residential mortgage loan derivatives (including interest rate lock commitments and forward sales commitments) and derivatives to hedge its residential MSR portfolio. Customer derivatives include interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity derivative contracts designed to meet the hedging and financing needs of the Company&#8217;s customers, and are economically hedged by the Company to offset its market exposure. Interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage loans that will be held for sale are considered derivative instruments, and are economically hedged by entering into forward sale commitments to manage changes in fair value due to interest rate risk. Residential MSR portfolio derivatives are entered to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of the Company&#8217;s MSRs.

NOTE 11 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

A summary of outstanding off-balance sheet arrangements is presented below. For more information on these arrangements, see Note 18 in the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K. 

(in millions) September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Commitments to extend credit $ 80,629 &#160; $ 74,160 &#160; Letters of credit 1,939 &#160; 2,239 &#160; Risk participation agreements 57 &#160; 98 &#160; Loans sold with recourse 70 &#160; 54 &#160; Marketing rights 26 &#160; 29 &#160; Total $ 82,721 &#160; $ 76,580 &#160; 

Commitments to Extend Credit 

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers in accordance with conditions contractually agreed upon in advance. Generally, the commitments have fixed expiration dates or termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash requirements. 

Letters of Credit 

Letters of credit in the table above reflect commercial, standby financial and standby performance letters of credit. Financial and performance standby letters of credit are issued by the Company for the benefit of its customers. They are used as conditional guarantees of payment to a third party in the event the customer either fails to make specific payments (financial) or fails to complete a specific project (performance). The Company&#8217;s exposure to credit loss in the event of counterparty nonperformance in connection with the above instruments is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. Generally, letters of credit are collateralized by cash, accounts receivable, inventory or investment securities. Credit risk associated with letters of credit is considered in determining the appropriate amounts of allowances for unfunded commitments. Standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit are issued for terms of up to ten years and one year , respectively. 

Other Commitments 

Citizens has additional off-balance sheet arrangements that are summarized below: 

&#8226; Marketing Rights - During 2003, Citizens entered into a 25 -year agreement to acquire the naming and marketing rights of a baseball stadium in Pennsylvania. 

&#8226; Loans sold with recourse - Citizens is an originator and servicer of residential mortgages and routinely sells such mortgage loans in the secondary market and to GSEs. In the context of such sales, the Company makes certain representations and warranties regarding the characteristics of the underlying loans and, 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 80 

as a result, may be contractually required to repurchase such loans or indemnify certain parties against losses for certain breaches of those representations and warranties. The Company also sells the government guaranteed portion of certain SBA loans to outside investors, for which it retains the servicing rights. 

&#8226; Risk Participation Agreements - RPAs are guarantees issued by the Company to other parties for a fee, whereby the Company agrees to participate in the credit risk of a derivative customer of the other party. The current amount of credit exposure is spread out over multiple counterparties. At September 30, 2021, the remaining terms on these RPAs ranged from less than one year to eight years . 

Contingencies 

The Company operates in a legal and regulatory environment that exposes it to potentially significant risks. A certain amount of litigation ordinarily results from the nature of the Company&#8217;s banking and other businesses. The Company is a party to legal proceedings, including class actions. The Company is also the subject of investigations, reviews, subpoenas, and regulatory matters arising out of its normal business operations, which, in some instances, relate to concerns about fair lending, unfair and/or deceptive practices, mortgage-related issues, and mis-selling of certain products. In addition, the Company engages in discussions with relevant governmental and regulatory authorities on a regular and ongoing basis regarding various issues, and any issues discussed or identified may result in investigatory or other action being taken. Litigation and regulatory matters may result in settlements, damages, fines, penalties, public or private censure, increased costs, required remediation, restrictions on business activities, or other impacts on the Company. 

In these disputes and proceedings, the Company contests liability and the amount of damages as appropriate. Given their complex nature, and based on the Company's experience, it may be years before some of these matters are finally resolved. Moreover, before liability can be reasonably estimated for a claim, numerous legal and factual issues may need to be examined, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, and by addressing novel or unsettled legal issues relevant to the proceedings in question. The Company cannot predict with certainty if, how, or when such claims will be resolved or what the eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, may be, particularly for claims that are at an early stage in their development or where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages. The Company recognizes a provision for a claim when, in the opinion of management after seeking legal advice, it is probable that a liability exists and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In many proceedings, however, it is not possible to determine whether any loss is probable or to estimate the amount of any loss. 

Based on information currently available, the advice of legal counsel and other advisers, and established reserves, management believes that the aggregate liabilities, if any, potentially arising from these proceedings will not have a materially adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements. 

NOTE 12 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 

Citizens measures or monitors many of its assets and liabilities on a fair value basis. Fair value is used on a recurring basis for assets and liabilities for which fair value is the required or elected measurement basis of accounting. Additionally, fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to evaluate assets for impairment or for disclosure purposes. Nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve the application of lower of cost or market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. Citizens also applies the fair value measurement guidance to determine amounts reported for certain disclosures in this Note for assets and liabilities that are not required to be reported at fair value in the financial statements. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 81 

Fair Value Option 

Citizens elected to account for residential mortgage LHFS and certain commercial and industrial, and commercial real estate LHFS at fair value. The following table presents the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate unpaid principal balance of LHFS measured at fair value:

For more information on the election of the fair value option for these assets see Note 19 in the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K. 

Recurring Fair Value Measurements 

Citizens utilizes a variety of valuation techniques to measure its assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. For more information on the valuation techniques utilized to measure recurring fair value see Note 19 in the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K. 

Collateralized Loan Obligations 

The fair value of CLOs is estimated using observable inputs, including prices of similar securities that trade in the market. The Company classifies these securities in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy using these observable inputs. 

Derivatives - Commodities Contracts 

The fair value of commodity derivatives uses the mid-point of market observable quoted prices as an input into the fair value model. The model uses the observed market prices combined with other market observed inputs to derive the fair value of the instrument, which generally classifies it as Level 2 instrument.
