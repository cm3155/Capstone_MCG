FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements regarding potential future share repurchases and future dividends as well as the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns on our business, operations, financial performance and prospects, are forward-looking statements. Also, any statement that does not describe historical or current facts is a forward-looking statement. These statements often include the words &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;goals,&#8221; &#8220;targets,&#8221; &#8220;initiatives,&#8221; &#8220;potentially,&#8221; &#8220;probably,&#8221; &#8220;projects,&#8221; &#8220;outlook,&#8221; &#8220;guidance&#8221; or similar expressions or future conditional verbs such as &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; and &#8220;could.&#8221; 

Forward-looking statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of management, and on information currently available to management. Our statements speak as of the date hereof, and we do not assume any obligation to update these statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those contained in such statements in light of new information or future events. We caution you, therefore, against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the following, without limitation: 

&#8226; Negative economic and political conditions that adversely affect the general economy, housing prices, the job market, consumer confidence and spending habits which may affect, among other things, the level of nonperforming assets, charge-offs and provision expense; 

&#8226; The rate of growth in the economy and employment levels, as well as general business and economic conditions, and changes in the competitive environment; 

&#8226; Our ability to implement our business strategy, including the cost savings and efficiency components, and achieve our financial performance goals; 

&#8226; The COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns and their effects on the economic and business environments in which we operate; 

&#8226; Our ability to meet heightened supervisory requirements and expectations; 

&#8226; Liabilities and business restrictions resulting from litigation and regulatory investigations; 

&#8226; Our capital and liquidity requirements under regulatory capital standards and our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms; 

&#8226; The effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest income, net interest margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing rights and mortgages held for sale; 

&#8226; Changes in interest rates and market liquidity, as well as the magnitude of such changes, which may reduce interest margins, impact funding sources and affect the ability to originate and distribute financial products in the primary and secondary markets; 

&#8226; The effect of changes in the level of checking or savings account deposits on our funding costs and net interest margin; 

&#8226; Financial services reform and other current, pending or future legislation or regulation that could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses; 

&#8226; A failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors or other service providers, including as a result of cyber-attacks; and 

&#8226; Management&#8217;s ability to identify and manage these and other risks. 

In addition to the above factors, we also caution that the actual amounts and timing of any future common stock dividends or share repurchases will be subject to various factors, including our capital position, financial performance, risk-weighted assets, capital impacts of strategic initiatives, market conditions and regulatory and accounting considerations, as well as any other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant in making such a determination. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares from or pay any dividends to holders of our common stock, or as to the amount of any such repurchases or dividends. Further, statements about the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns on our business, operations, 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 6 

financial performance and prospects may constitute forward-looking statements and are subject to the risk that the actual impacts may differ, possibly materially, from what is reflected in those forward-looking statements due to factors and future developments that are uncertain, unpredictable and in many cases beyond our control, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic, and the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our customers, third parties and us. In addition, statements about our net charge-off guidance constitute forward-looking statements and are subject to the risk that the actual charge-offs may differ, possibly materially, from what is reflected in those statements due to, among other potential factors, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effectiveness of stimulus and forbearance programs in response, changes in economic conditions, and idiosyncratic events affecting our commercial loans. 

More information about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 .

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

This document contains non-GAAP financial measures denoted as &#8220;Underlying&#8221;, &#8220;excluding elevated cash&#8221;, &#8220;excluding PPP loans&#8221;, as well as other results excluding the impact of certain items. Underlying results for any given reporting period exclude certain items that may occur in that period which management does not consider indicative of our on-going financial performance. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors because they are used by management to evaluate our operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions. In addition, we believe our Underlying results or results excluding the impact of certain items in any given reporting period reflect our on-going financial performance and increase comparability of period-to-period results, and accordingly, are useful to consider in addition to our GAAP financial results. 

Other companies may use similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures that are calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures. Accordingly, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by such companies. We caution investors not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP financial measures, but to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results reported under GAAP. 

Non-GAAP measures are denoted throughout our MD&#38;A by the use of the term Underlying or identified as excluding the impact of certain items and where there is a reference to these metrics in that paragraph, all measures that follow that reference are on the same basis when applicable. For more information on the computation of non-GAAP financial measures, see &#8220;&#8212;Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations.&#8221;

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 

Quarter to Date and Period End Key Highlights 

Net income of $611 million increased $577 million from the first quarter of 2020, with earnings per diluted common share of $1.37, up $1.34 from $0.03 per diluted common share in the first quarter of 2020. ROTCE of 17.2% increased from 0.4% in the first quarter of 2020. Improved results primarily reflect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns in the first quarter of 2020, resulting in a significant ACL reserve build in the first quarter of 2020. 

In the first quarter of 2021, results reflected $15 million of expenses, net of tax benefit, or $0.04 per diluted common share, from notable items, largely tied to TOP 6 transformational and revenue and efficiency initiatives. In the first quarter of 2020, there were $25 million of expenses, net of tax benefit, or $0.06 per diluted common share, from notable items, largely tied to TOP 6 transformational and revenue and efficiency initiatives.

&#8226; Net income available to common stockholders of $588 million increased $576 million, compared to $12 million in the first quarter of 2020. 

&#9702; On an Underlying basis, which excludes notable items, first quarter 2021 net income available to common stockholders of $603 million compared with $37 million in the first quarter of 2020. 

&#9702; On an Underlying basis, EPS of $1.41 per share compared to $0.09 in the first quarter of 2020. 

&#8226; Total revenue of $1.7 billion was stable with the first quarter of 2020, driven by a 9% increase in noninterest income, partially offset by a 4% decrease in net interest income. 

&#9702; Net interest income of $1.1 billion decreased 4%, reflecting 9% growth in average interest-earning assets, including the addition of PPP loans, which was more than offset by lower net interest margin. 

&#9702; Net interest margin of 2.75% decreased 34 basis points from 3.09% in the first quarter of 2020, primarily reflecting the impact of a lower rate environment, lower interest-earning asset yields and elevated cash balances given strong deposit flows, partially offset by improved funding mix and deposit pricing. 

&#8211; Net interest margin on a FTE basis of 2.76% decreased by 34 basis points, compared to 3.10% in the first quarter of 2020. 

&#8211; Average loans and leases of $122.8 billion increased $1.8 billion, or 1%, from $121.1 billion in the first quarter of 2020, reflecting a $1.4 billion increase in commercial driven by PPP loans, partially offset by line of credit repayments and net payoffs, as well as a $425 million increase in retail driven by growth in education and residential mortgage, partially offset by decreases in home equity and other retail given run off of personal unsecured installment loans. 

&#8211; Period-end loans declined $895 million, or 1%, from the fourth quarter of 2020, reflecting a 1% decline in both commercial and retail. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 8 

&#8211; Average deposits of $146.6 billion increased $20.0 billion, or 16%, from $126.6 billion in the first quarter of 2020, reflecting an increase in demand deposits, money market accounts, savings and checking with interest, partially offset by a decrease in term deposits. 

&#8211; Period-end deposit growth of $4.2 billion, or 3%, from the fourth quarter of 2020, reflecting growth in money market accounts, demand deposits, and savings given strong deposit flows from consumer-oriented government stimulus, partially offset by a decline in term deposits and checking with interest. 

&#9702; Noninterest income of $542 million increased $45 million, or 9%, from the first quarter of 2020, driven by growth in mortgage banking fees, strong capital markets fees and record trust and investment services fees, partially offset by a decrease in service charges and fees, reflecting COVID-19 impacts on overdraft fees. 

&#8226; Noninterest expense of $1.0 billion was stable compared to the first quarter of 2020. 

&#9702; On an Underlying basis, noninterest expense increased 2% from the first quarter of 2020, reflecting increases in outside services largely tied to growth initiatives, equipment and software driven by increased technology spend, and salaries and employee benefits as a result of higher revenue-based compensation, partially offset by a decrease in other operating expense driven by lower travel and advertising costs. 

&#8226; The efficiency ratio of 61.4% compared to 61.1% for the first quarter of 2020, and ROTCE of 17.2% compared to 0.4%. 

&#9702; On an Underlying basis, the efficiency ratio of 60.2% compared to 59.1% for the first quarter of 2020, and ROTCE of 17.6% compared to 1.1%.

&#8226; Tangible book value per common share of $32.79 increased 3% from the first quarter of 2020. Fully diluted average common shares outstanding decreased 1.5 million shares over the same period.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is our largest source of revenue and is the difference between the interest earned on interest-earning assets (generally loans, leases and investment securities) and the interest expense incurred in connection with interest-bearing liabilities (generally deposits and borrowed funds). The level of net interest income is primarily a function of the difference between the effective yield on our average interest-earning assets and the effective cost of our interest-bearing liabilities. These factors are influenced by the pricing and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by external factors such as local economic conditions, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the FRB and market interest rates. For further discussion, refer to &#8220;&#8212;Market Risk &#8212; Non-Trading Risk,&#8221; and &#8220;&#8212;Risk Governance&#8221; as described in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

The following table presents a five quarter trend of our Net interest margin, FTE and Net interest income: 

First quarter 2021 versus fourth quarter 2020: Net interest income of $1.1 billion was down 1% given the impact of lower day count, with broadly stable net interest margin and loans. Net interest margin on a FTE basis of 2.76% was up 1 basis point, reflecting improving funding mix and deposit pricing and a steepening yield curve, largely offset by lower earning-asset yields. Interest-bearing deposits costs of 0.20% decreased 7 basis points.

(1) Net interest income and net interest margin is presented on a FTE basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 21%. The FTE impact is predominantly attributable to commercial and industrial loans for the periods presented. 

First quarter 2021 versus first quarter 2020: Net interest income of $1.1 billion decreased 4% from first quarter 2020, with 9% growth in interest-earning assets, including the addition of PPP loans, which was more than offset by lower net interest margin. 

Net interest margin on a FTE basis of 2.76% decreased 34 basis points compared to 3.10% in the first quarter of 2020, primarily reflecting the impact of a lower rate environment, lower interest-earning asset yields, and elevated cash balances (16 basis points) given strong deposit flows, partially offset by improved funding mix and deposit pricing. Average interest-earning asset yields of 2.97% decreased 94 basis points from 3.91% in the first quarter of 2020, while average interest-bearing liability costs of 0.36% decreased 78 basis points from 1.14% in the first quarter of 2020. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 13 

Average interest-earning assets of $164.4 billion increased $13.4 billion, or 9%, from the first quarter of 2020, as increased liquidity allowed for a $6.2 billion, or 42%, decrease in borrowed funds, and drove a $9.0 billion increase in cash held in interest-bearing deposits, and a $1.7 billion, or 7%, increase in investments. Results also reflected a $2.7 billion, or 2%, increase in average loans and leases and LHFS with a $1.4 billion increase in average commercial loans and leases driven by $4.8 billion of PPP loans, largely offset by line of credit repayments and net payoffs. Furthermore, average retail loans increased $425 million, driven by growth in education and residential mortgage, partially offset by decreases in home equity and other retail given run off of personal unsecured installment loans. 

Average deposits of $146.6 billion increased $20.0 billion, or 16%, from the first quarter of 2020, reflecting growth in demand deposits, money market accounts, savings and checking with interest, partially offset by a decline in term deposits. Average total borrowed funds of $8.5 billion decreased $6.2 billion from the first quarter of 2020, as strong customer deposit inflows allowed for significantly lower levels of FHLB advances. Results also reflect the paydown of senior debt and short-term borrowings. Total borrowed funds costs of $49 million decreased $42 million from the first quarter of 2020. The total borrowed funds cost of 2.32% decreased 16 basis points from 2.48% in the first quarter of 2020. 

Noninterest Income 

The following table presents a five quarter trend of our noninterest income: 

First quarter 2021 versus fourth quarter 2020: Noninterest income of $542 million was down 6%, reflecting lower mortgage banking fees, capital markets fees, foreign exchange and interest rate products and service charges and fees. These decreases were partially offset by improved trust and investment services fees and net securities gains.

higher trust and investment services fees, offset by lower service charges and fees. Capital markets fees increased from the first quarter of 2020 driven by higher underwriting revenue and mergers and acquisitions advisory fees, as well as the impact of a mark-to-market loss on loan trading assets in the first quarter of 2020. Mortgage banking fees reflected higher production volumes and favorable MSR hedging results, partially offset by lower servicing income given higher amortization expense. Trust and investment services fees increased reflecting an increase in assets under management from strong net inflows and higher equity market levels. Service charges and fees decreased from the first quarter of 2020 as a result of COVID-19 impacts on overdraft fees. 

Noninterest Expense 

&#160; The following table presents a five quarter trend of our noninterest expense: 

First quarter 2021 versus fourth quarter 2020: Noninterest expense of $1.0 billion was broadly stable and included the impact of notable items. On an Underlying basis, noninterest expense of $998 million was up 3%, reflecting seasonally higher salaries and employee benefits. These increases were partially offset by lower other operating expense which reflected lower advertising costs.

First quarter 2021 versus first quarter 2020: Noninterest expense increased $6 million, or 1%, from the first quarter of 2020, largely reflecting higher equipment and software driven by increased technology spend as well as higher outside services tied to growth initiatives. These results were partially offset by a decrease in other operating expense related mainly to lower travel and advertising costs. Underlying noninterest expense of $998 million increased $19 million, or 2%, as a result of the items stated above as well as higher salaries and employee benefits tied to higher revenue-based compensation.

Provision for Credit Losses 

The following table presents a five quarter trend of our provision for credit losses, net charge-offs and net charge-off ratio: 

&#160; 

The provision for credit losses is the result of a detailed analysis performed to estimate our ACL. The total provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan and lease losses and the provision for unfunded commitments. Refer to &#8220;&#8212;Analysis of Financial Condition &#8212; Allowance for Credit Losses and Nonaccruing Loans and Leases&#8221; for more information. 

First quarter 2021 versus fourth quarter 2020: In the first quarter of 2021, strong credit performance across the retail and commercial loan portfolios and improvement in the macroeconomic outlook resulted in a negative provision for credit losses of $140 million. This compared to a provision of $124 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. 

First quarter 2021 versus first quarter 2020: As described above, the negative provision for credit losses was $140 million in the first quarter of 2021. This compared to provision for credit losses of $600 million in the first quarter of 2020, which reflected the adverse impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns.

Income Tax Expense 

The following table presents a five quarter trend of our income tax expense and effective income tax rate: 

First quarter 2021 versus first quarter 2020: Income tax expense increased $159 million from the first quarter of 2020 due to increased taxable income. The effective income tax rate decreased to 21.8% from 24.1% in the first quarter of 2020. The first quarter 2020 rate was elevated due to the negative tax impact of stock-based compensation on lower pre-tax income. 

Business Operating Segments 

We have two business operating segments: Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. Segment results are derived by specifically attributing managed assets, liabilities, capital and related revenues, provision for credit losses, which, at the segment level, is equal to net charge-offs, and other expenses. Non-segment operations are classified as Other, which includes corporate functions, the Treasury function, the securities portfolio, wholesale funding activities, intangible assets not directly allocated to a business operating segment, community development, non-core assets and other unallocated assets, liabilities, capital, revenues, provision for credit losses, expenses and income tax expense. In addition, Other includes goodwill not directly allocated to a business operating segment and any associated goodwill impairment charges. For impairment testing purposes, we allocate all goodwill to our Consumer Banking and/or Commercial Banking reporting units. There have been no significant changes in our methodologies used to allocate items to our business operating segments as described in &#8220;&#8212;Results of Operations &#8212; Business Operating Segments&#8221; in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

The following table presents certain financial data of our business operating segments. Total business operating segment financial results differ from total consolidated financial results. These differences are reflected in Other non-segment operations. See Note 16 in Item 1 for further information.

Consumer Banking 

Net interest income of $863 million increased $70 million, or 9%, from the first quarter of 2020, driven by the benefit of loan and deposit growth, partially offset by lower deposit margins given lower rates. Average loans grew $4.8 billion led by education and residential mortgage, as well as the impact of the PPP loan program. Deposits grew $12 billion, or 14%, driven by government stimulus. Noninterest income decreased $6 million, or 2%, from the first quarter of 2020, driven by lower service charges and fees reflecting COVID-19 impacts on overdraft fees, partially offset by higher mortgage banking and trust and investment services fees which reflected an increase in assets under management from strong equity market levels and net inflows. Noninterest expense increased $12 million, or 2%, from the first quarter of 2020, reflecting higher salaries and employee benefits tied to higher revenue-based compensation, equipment and software, as a result of increased technology spend, and outside services, largely tied to growth initiatives, partially offset by lower other operating expense related to lower travel and advertising costs. Net charge-offs of $59 million decreased $38 million, or 39%, reflecting the impact of U.S. Government stimulus programs and forbearance. 

Commercial Banking 

Net interest income of $421 million increased $56 million, or 15%, from $365 million in the first quarter of 2020, primarily driven by higher loan and deposit volumes that were partially offset by improved funding mix and deposit pricing. Noninterest income of $170 million increased $45 million, or 36%, from $125 million in the first quarter of 2020, driven by strength in capital markets fees due to higher underwriting revenue and mergers and acquisition advisory fees, as well as the impact of a mark-to-market loss on loan trading assets in the first quarter of 2020. Noninterest expense of $227 million increased $6 million , or 3%, from $221 million in the first quarter of 2020, driven by higher salaries and employee benefits, and higher equipment and software due to increased technology spend. Net charge-offs of $101 million increased $58 million from the first quarter of 2020, driven by finance and insurance, including one large charge-off related to a financial sponsor, and commercial real estate as a result of COVID-19 impacts.

Our securities portfolio is managed to maintain prudent levels of liquidity, credit quality and market risk while achieving appropriate returns that align with our overall portfolio management strategy. The portfolio primarily includes high quality, highly liquid investments reflecting our ongoing commitment to maintain appropriate contingent liquidity levels and pledging capacity. U.S. government-guaranteed notes and GSE-issued mortgage-backed securities represent 96% of the fair value of our debt securities portfolio holdings. Holdings backed by mortgages dominate our portfolio and facilitate our ability to pledge those securities to the FHLB for collateral purposes. For further discussion of the liquidity coverage ratios, see &#8220;Regulation and Supervision &#8212; Liquidity Requirements&#8221; in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

The fair value of the AFS debt securities portfolio of $24.5 billion at March 31, 2021 increased $1.5 billion from $22.9 billion at December 31, 2020, including $1.9 billion in new investments, offset by a $414 million reduction in unrealized gains driven by the steepening yield curve. The decline in the fair value of the HTM debt portfolio of $280 million was primarily attributable to portfolio run off. For further information, see Note 2. 

As of March 31, 2021, the portfolio&#8217;s average effective duration was 4.1 years compared with 2.7 years as of December 31, 2020, as higher long-term rates drove a decrease in both actual and projected securities prepayment speeds. We manage our securities portfolio duration and convexity risk through asset selection and securities structure, and maintain duration levels within our risk appetite in the context of the broader interest rate risk framework and limits.

Allowance for Credit Losses and Nonaccruing Loans and Leases 

The ACL is created through charges to the provision for credit losses in order to provide appropriate reserves to absorb future estimated credit losses in accordance with GAAP. For further information on our processes to determine our ACL, see &#8220;&#8212;Critical Accounting Estimates &#8212; Allowance for Credit Losses.&#8221; 

The ACL of $2.4 billion as of March 31, 2021 compared with the ACL of $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2020, reflecting a reserve release of $298 million. For further information, see Note 4.

First quarter of 2021 NCOs of $158 million increased $21 million, or 15%, from $137 million in the first quarter of 2020, driven by an increase in commercial of $60 million partially offset by a decrease in retail of $39 million. First quarter of 2021 annualized net charge-offs of 0.52% of average loans and leases were up 6 basis points from first quarter of 2020. 

The increase in commercial NCOs in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the first quarter of 2020 were primarily driven by a charge-off related to a financial sponsor, described below, as well as COVID-related charge-offs in CRE. Retail NCOs were down in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the first quarter of 2020 primarily due to U.S. Government stimulus programs, as well as forbearance. 

In the first quarter of 2021, we charged-off our full exposure of approximately $54 million associated with a private equity sponsor client. This impact has been incorporated into our most recent full-year 2021 net charge-off guidance of 35-45 basis points of average loans. We recently filed a lawsuit in Federal court against this sponsor client alleging breach of contract and fraud. The Company has completed a full portfolio review and believes this incident is an isolated matter. 

We continue to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns and have instituted a variety of measures to identify and monitor areas of potential risk, including direct outreach to commercial clients and close monitoring of retail credit metrics.

Commercial Loan Asset Quality 

Our commercial loan and lease portfolio consists of traditional commercial and industrial loans, commercial leases and commercial real estate loans. The portfolio is predominantly focused on customers in our footprint and adjacent states in which we have a physical presence where our local delivery model provides for strong client connectivity. Additionally, we also do business in certain specialized industry sectors on a national basis. 

As of March 31, 2021, commercial NPLs of $382 million decreased $76 million from $458 million as of December 31, 2020, representing 0.6% and 0.8% of the commercial loan and lease portfolio as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

For commercial loans and leases, we utilize regulatory classification ratings to monitor credit quality. Loans with a &#8220;pass&#8221; rating are those that we believe will be fully repaid in accordance with the contractual loan terms. Commercial loans and leases that are &#8220;criticized&#8221; are those that have some weakness, or potential weakness, that indicate an increased probability of future loss. &#8220;Criticized&#8221; loans are grouped into three categories, &#8220;special mention,&#8221; &#8220;substandard&#8221; and &#8220;doubtful.&#8221; Special mention loans have potential weaknesses that, if left uncorrected, may result in deterioration of our credit position at some future date. Substandard loans are inadequately protected loans which have well-defined weaknesses that could hinder normal repayment or collection of the debt. Doubtful loans have the same weaknesses as substandard, with the added characteristics that the possibility of loss is high and collection of the full amount of the loan is improbable.

Commercial and industrial criticized balances of $3.1 billion, or 7.1% of the total commercial and industrial loan portfolio as of March 31, 2021, decreased from $3.3 billion, or 7.5%, as of December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by net repayments and charge-offs. Commercial and industrial criticized loans represented 76% of total criticized loans as of March 31, 2021 compared to 71% as of December 31, 2020. 

Commercial real estate criticized balances of $922 million, or 6.3% of the commercial real estate portfolio, decreased from $1.3 billion, or 8.8%, as of December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by credit upgrades and net charge-offs. Commercial real estate accounted for 22% of total criticized loans as of March 31, 2021 compared to 28% as of December 31, 2020.

Retail Loan Asset Quality 

For retail loans, we utilize credit scores provided by FICO which are generally refreshed on a quarterly basis and the loan&#8217;s payment and delinquency status to monitor credit quality. Management believes FICO credit scores are considered the strongest indicator of credit losses over the contractual life of the loan as the scores are based on current and historical national industry-wide consumer level credit performance data, and assist management in predicting the borrower&#8217;s future payment performance. The largest portion of the retail portfolio is represented by borrowers located in the New England, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions, although we have continued to lend selectively in areas outside the footprint primarily in the auto, education and point-of-sale financing.

Retail asset quality continues to reflect a stronger economic outlook. The net charge-off rate of 0.35% for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 reflected a decrease of 26 basis points from the quarter ended March 31, 2020, driven by the forbearance and stimulus activity stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns. 

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

In the first quarter of 2020, we adopted the CARES Act and interagency guidance issued by the bank regulatory agencies which provide that COVID-19-related modifications to retail and commercial loans that met certain eligibility criteria are exempt from classification as a TDR. Payment deferrals and forbearance plans entered into as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic were generally not considered TDRs. 

As of March 31, 2021, $714 million of retail loans were classified as TDRs, compared with $718 million as of December 31, 2020. As of March 31, 2021, $188 million of retail TDRs were in nonaccrual status with 33% of those current on payments compared to $171 million in nonaccrual status with 38% of those current on payments at December 31, 2020. TDRs that are current on payments generally return to accrual status once repayment capacity and appropriate payment history has been established. TDRs are individually evaluated to estimate ACL, and loans, once classified as TDRs, remain classified as TDRs until paid off, sold, or refinanced at market terms. For additional information regarding TDRs, see Note 5 in our 2020 Form 10-K.

For information regarding our liquidity and available borrowing capacity, see &#8220;&#8212;Liquidity&#8221; and Note 7. 

CAPITAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS 

As a bank holding company and a financial holding company, we are subject to regulation and supervision by the FRB. Our banking subsidiary, CBNA, is a national banking association whose primary federal regulator is the OCC. Our regulation and supervision continues to evolve as the legal and regulatory frameworks governing our operations continue to change. For more information, see &#8220;Regulation and Supervision&#8221; in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 26 

Tailoring of Prudential Requirements 

Under the FRB&#8217;s Tailoring Rules, Category IV firms, such as us, are subject to biennial supervisory stress testing and are exempt from company-run stress testing and related disclosure requirements. The FRB supervises Category IV firms on an ongoing basis, including evaluation of the capital adequacy and capital planning processes during off-cycle years. We are also required to develop, maintain and submit an annual capital plan for review and approval by our board of directors (or one of its committees), as well as FR Y-14 reporting requirements. On April 2, 2021, we submitted our 2021 Capital Plan to the FRB under the FRB&#8217;s 2021 CCAR process. For more information, see the &#8220;Tailoring of Prudential Requirements&#8221; section in item 1 of our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Under the stress capital buffer (&#8220;SCB&#8221;) framework, the FRB will not object to capital plans on quantitative grounds and each firm is required to maintain capital ratios above the sum of its minimum requirements and the SCB requirements to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. For Category IV firms, like us, the FRB has stated that the SCB will be re-calibrated with each biennial supervisory stress test and updated annually to reflect our planned common stock dividends. On October 1, 2020, our SCB of 3.4% became effective and applies to our capital actions through September 30, 2021. 

On February 3, 2021, the FRB adopted a final rule to tailor the requirements of its Capital Plan Rule, specifically modifying capital planning, regulatory reporting and stress capital buffer requirements to be consistent with the Tailoring Rules framework. Under the final rule, effective April 5, 2021, Category IV firms, like us, have the ability to elect to participate in the supervisory stress test and receive an updated SCB requirement in a year in which they are not subject to the supervisory stress test. We did not elect to participate in the 2021 supervisory stress test and therefore our SCB is expected to remain at 3.4% for 2021. 

In light of the heightened uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns, the FRB took certain actions to preserve capital at banks. Among those actions, the FRB imposed certain limitations on firms for the third and fourth quarters of 2020, including mandatory suspension of share repurchases and limiting common stock dividends to existing rates and the average quarterly net income over the prior four quarters. The FRB modified its limitations on capital distributions for the first and second quarters of 2021 such that firms that participate in CCAR, like us, may resume share repurchases provided that the aggregate of share repurchases and common stock dividends for the applicable quarter did not exceed average quarterly net income for the trailing four quarters. In January 2021, our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to $750 million of our common stock beginning in the first quarter of 2021. Our 2020 Capital Plan includes maintaining quarterly common dividends of $0.39 per common share through the SCB window period ending third quarter 2021. In March 2021, the FRB announced that the current capital distribution limitations will end on June 30, 2021 for firms, like us, that are on a two-year cycle and not subject to supervisory stress testing this year. The timing and amount of future dividends and share repurchases will depend on various factors, including our capital position, financial performance, risk-weighted assets, capital impacts of strategic initiatives, market conditions and regulatory considerations. All future capital distributions are subject to consideration and approval by the board of directors prior to execution. 

Regulations relating to capital planning, regulatory reporting, and SCB requirements applicable to firms like us are subject to ongoing rulemaking and potential further guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators. We will continue to evaluate the impact of these and any other prudential regulatory changes, including their potential resultant changes in our regulatory and compliance costs and expenses. 

For more information, see &#8220;Regulation and Supervision&#8221; and &#8220;&#8212;Capital and Regulatory Matters&#8221; in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Capital Framework 

Under the current U.S. Basel III capital framework, we and our banking subsidiary, CBNA, must meet the following specific minimum requirements: CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%, tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, total capital ratio of 8.0%, and tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. As a bank holding company, our SCB of 3.4% is imposed on top of the three minimum risk-based capital ratios listed above and a CCB of 2.5% is imposed on top of the three minimum risk-based capital ratios listed above for our banking subsidiary. 

Under the U.S. Basel III rules, the CET1 deduction threshold for MSRs, certain deferred tax assets and significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated institutions is 25%. As of March 31, 2021, we did not meet the threshold for these additional capital deductions. MSRs or deferred tax assets not deducted from CET1 capital 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 27 

are assigned a 250% risk weight and significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions not deducted from CET1 capital are assigned an exposure category risk weight. 

In reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FRB and the other federal banking regulators adopted a final rule relative to regulatory capital treatment of ACL under CECL. This rule allowed electing banking organizations to delay the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital for a two-year period ending January 1, 2022, followed by a three-year transition period ending January 1, 2025 to phase-in the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided during the initial two-year delay. As of March 31, 2021, $493 million of the capital benefit has been accumulated for application to the three-year transition period. 

For additional discussion of the U.S. Basel III capital framework and its related application, see &#8220;Regulation and Supervision&#8221; in our 2020 Form 10-K. The table below presents our actual regulatory capital ratios under the U.S. Basel III Standardized rules:

(1) Required &#8220;Minimum Capital ratios&#8221; are: CET1 capital of 4.5%; Tier 1 capital of 6.0%; Total capital of 8.0%; and Tier 1 leverage of 4.0%. &#8220;Minimum Capital ratios&#8221; also include a SCB of 3.4%; N/A to Tier 1 leverage. 

At March 31, 2021, our CET1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital ratios were 10.1%, 11.4% and 13.4%, respectively, as compared with 10.0% , 11.3% , and 13.4%, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. The CET1 capital ratio increased as net income for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was partially offset by $1.0 billion of risk-weighted asset (&#8220;RWA&#8221;) growth, the impact of the capital actions described in &#8220;&#8212;Capital Transactions&#8221; below and a decrease in the modified CECL transitional amount. The tier 1 capital ratio increased due to the changes in the CET1 capital ratio described above. The total capital ratio was constant as the changes in the CET1 capital ratio described above combined with the subordinated debt exchange offer in the first quarter of 2021, as described in the &#8220;Regulatory Capital Ratios and Capital Composition&#8221; section below, were partially offset by the reduction in the net AACL impact. At March 31, 2021, our CET1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital ratios were approximately 220 basis points, 200 basis points and 200 basis points, respectively, above their regulatory minimums plus our SCB. All ratios remained well above the U.S. Basel III minimums. 

Regulatory Capital Ratios and Capital Composition 

CET1 capital under U.S. Basel III Standardized rules totaled $14.9 billion at March 31, 2021, an increase of $260 million from $14.6 billion at December 31, 2020, largely driven by net income for the three months ended March 31, 2021 partially offset by dividends, common share repurchases and a decrease in the modified CECL transitional amount. Tier 1 capital at March 31, 2021 totaled $16.8 billion, reflecting a $260 million increase from $16.6 billion at December 31, 2020, driven by the changes in CET1 capital. Total capital of $19.9 billion at March 31, 2021, increased $277 million from December 31, 2020, driven by the changes in CET1 capital and a decrease in non-qualifying subordinated debt partially offset by the reduction in the net AACL impact. 

RWA totaled $147.8 billion at March 31, 2021, based on U.S. Basel III Standardized rules, up $1.0 billion from December 31, 2020. This increase in RWA was driven by higher MSRs, agency securities, commercial commitments, bank-owned life insurance, education loans and unsettled trades. These RWA increases were partially offset by lower commercial loans and derivative valuations. 

As of March 31, 2021, the tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.5%, up from 9.4% at December 31, 2020, driven by higher tier 1 capital, partially offset by the $1.5 billion increase in quarterly adjusted average assets.

(2) Excess allowance represents the amount excluded from tier 2 capital that is in excess of 1.25% of risk weighted assets, excluding market risk. 

On February 11, 2021, we completed $265 million in private exchange offers for five series of outstanding subordinated notes. Exchange offer participants received newly-issued fixed-rate reset subordinated notes due 2031 which are redeemable by us five years prior to their maturity. These subordinated debt exchange offers will benefit our tier 2 and total capital going forward by increasing the amount of subordinated debt eligible for inclusion in tier 2 capital without increasing the aggregate principal amount of subordinated debt outstanding. See Note 7 for more details on our outstanding subordinated debt. 

Capital Adequacy Process 

Our assessment of capital adequacy begins with our risk appetite and risk management framework. This framework provides for the identification, measurement and management of material risks. There have been no significant changes to our capital adequacy risk appetite and risk management framework as described in &#8220;&#8212;Capital and Regulatory Matters&#8221; in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Capital Transactions 

We completed the following capital actions during the quarterly period ended March 31, 2021:

CBNA&#8217;s CET1 and tier 1 capital totaled $16.3 billion at March 31, 2021, up $233 million from $16.0 billion at December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily driven by net income for the three months ended March 31, 2021, partially offset by dividends paid to the Parent Company and a decrease in the modified CECL transitional amount. Total capital was $19.2 billion at March 31, 2021, an increase of $175 million from $19.0 billion at December 31, 2020, driven by the change in CET1 capital partially offset by the reduction in the net AACL impact. 

CBNA&#8217;s RWA totaled $147.4 billion at March 31, 2021, up $836 million from December 31, 2020, driven by higher MSRs, agency securities, commercial commitments, bank-owned life insurance, education loans and unsettled trades. These RWA increases were partially offset by lower commercial loans and derivative valuations. 

As of March 31, 2021, CBNA&#8217;s tier 1 leverage ratio of 9.2% slightly increased as the increase in tier 1 capital was mostly offset by the $1.5 billion increase in quarterly adjusted average assets. 

LIQUIDITY 

Liquidity is defined as our ability to meet our cash-flow and collateral obligations in a timely manner, at a reasonable cost. An institution must maintain operating liquidity to meet its expected daily and forecasted cash-flow requirements, as well as contingent liquidity to meet unexpected (stress scenario) funding requirements. As noted earlier, reflecting the importance of meeting all unexpected and stress-scenario funding requirements, we identify and manage contingent liquidity (consisting of cash balances at the FRB, unencumbered high-quality and liquid securities, and unused FHLB borrowing capacity). Separately, we also identify and manage asset liquidity as a subset of contingent liquidity (consisting of cash balances at the FRB and unencumbered high-quality securities). We consider the effective and prudent management of liquidity fundamental to our health and strength. We manage liquidity at the consolidated enterprise level and at each material legal entity, including at the Parent Company and CBNA level. 

Parent Company Liquidity 

Our Parent Company&#8217;s primary sources of cash are dividends and interest received from CBNA as a result of investing in bank equity and subordinated debt and externally issued preferred stock as well as senior and subordinated debt. Uses of cash include the routine cash flow requirements as a bank holding company, including periodic share repurchases and payments of dividends, interest and expenses; the needs of subsidiaries, including CBNA, for additional equity and, as required, its need for debt financing; and the support for extraordinary funding requirements when necessary. To the extent the Parent Company has relied on wholesale borrowings, uses also include payments of related principal and interest. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the Parent Company declared dividends on common stock of $167 million and $168 million, respectively, and declared dividends on preferred stock of $23 million and $22 million, respectively. 

Our Parent Company&#8217;s cash and cash equivalents represent a source of liquidity that can be used to meet various needs and totaled $2.7 billion as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The Parent Company&#8217;s 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 30 

double-leverage ratio (the combined equity investment in Parent Company subsidiaries divided by Parent Company equity) is a measure of reliance on equity cash flows from subsidiaries to fund Parent Company obligations. At March 31, 2021, the Parent Company&#8217;s double-leverage ratio was 98.2%. 

CBNA Liquidity 

In the ordinary course of business, the liquidity of CBNA is managed by matching sources and uses of cash. The primary sources of bank liquidity include deposits from our consumer and commercial customers; payments of principal and interest on loans and debt securities; and wholesale borrowings, as needed, and as described under &#8220;&#8212;Liquidity Risk Management and Governance.&#8221; The primary uses of bank liquidity include withdrawals and maturities of deposits; payment of interest on deposits; funding of loans and related commitments; and funding of securities purchases. To the extent that CBNA has relied on wholesale borrowings, uses also include payments of related principal and interest. For further information on CBNA&#8217;s outstanding debt, see Note 7. 

As CBNA&#8217;s primary business involves taking deposits and making loans, a key role of liquidity management is to ensure that customers have timely access to funds from deposits and for loans. Liquidity management also involves maintaining sufficient liquidity to repay wholesale borrowings, pay operating expenses and support extraordinary funding requirements when necessary. 

Liquidity Risk 

We define liquidity risk as the risk that an entity will be unable to meet its payment obligations in a timely manner, at a reasonable cost. Liquidity risk can arise due to contingent liquidity risk and/or funding liquidity risk. 

Contingent liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions may reduce an entity&#8217;s ability to liquidate, pledge and/or finance certain assets and thereby substantially reduce the liquidity value of such assets. Drivers of contingent liquidity risk include general market disruptions as well as specific issues regarding the credit quality and/or valuation of a security or loan, issuer or borrower and/or asset class. 

Funding liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions and/or entity-specific events may reduce an entity&#8217;s ability to raise funds from depositors and/or wholesale market counterparties. Drivers of funding liquidity risk may be idiosyncratic or systemic, reflecting impediments to operations and/or damaged market confidence. 

Factors Affecting Liquidity 

Given the composition of assets and borrowing sources, contingent liquidity risk at CBNA would be materially affected by events such as deterioration of financing markets for high-quality securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities and other instruments issued by the GNMA, FNMA and the FHLMC), by any inability of the FHLBs to provide collateralized advances and/or by a refusal of the FRB to act as a lender of last resort in systemic stress. 

Similarly, given the structure of its balance sheet, the funding liquidity risk of CBNA would be materially affected by an adverse idiosyncratic event (e.g., a major loss, causing a perceived or actual deterioration in its financial condition), an adverse systemic event (e.g., default or bankruptcy of a significant capital markets participant), or a combination of both. Consequently, and despite ongoing exposure to a variety of idiosyncratic and systemic events, we view our contingent liquidity risk and our funding liquidity risk to be relatively modest.

An additional variable affecting our access to unsecured wholesale market funds and to large denomination (i.e., uninsured) customer deposits is the credit ratings assigned by such agencies as Moody&#8217;s, Standard and Poor&#8217;s, and Fitch. 

Table 23: Credit Ratings &#160; March 31, 2021 &#160; Moody&#8217;s

&#160; NR = Not rated 

Changes in our public credit ratings could affect both the cost and availability of our wholesale funding. As a result, and in order to maintain a conservative funding profile, CBNA continues to minimize reliance on unsecured wholesale funding. At March 31, 2021, our wholesale funding consisted primarily of term debt issued by the Parent Company and CBNA. 

Existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements represent another key driver of systemic liquidity conditions and liquidity management practices. The FRB, the OCC, and the FDIC regularly evaluate our liquidity as part of the overall supervisory process. In addition, we are subject to existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements, some of which are subject to further rulemaking, guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators. For further discussion, see &#8220;Regulation and Supervision &#8212; Tailoring of Prudential Requirements&#8221; and &#8220;&#8212;Liquidity Requirements&#8221; in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Liquidity Risk Management and Governance 

Liquidity risk is measured and managed by the Funding and Liquidity unit within our Treasury unit in accordance with policy guidelines promulgated by our Board and the Asset Liability Committee. In managing liquidity risk, the Funding and Liquidity unit delivers regular and comprehensive reporting, including current levels versus threshold limits for a broad set of liquidity metrics and early warning indicators, explanatory commentary relating to emerging risk trends and, as appropriate, recommended remedial strategies. 

Our Funding and Liquidity unit&#8217;s primary goal is to deliver and otherwise maintain prudent levels of operating liquidity (to support expected and projected funding requirements), and contingent liquidity (to support unexpected funding requirements resulting from idiosyncratic, systemic, and combination stress events, and regulatory liquidity requirements) in a timely manner from stable and cost-efficient funding sources. 

We seek to accomplish this goal by funding loans with stable deposits; by prudently controlling dependence on wholesale funding, particularly short-term unsecured funding; and by maintaining ample available liquidity, including a contingent liquidity buffer of unencumbered high-quality loans and securities. As of March 31, 2021: 

&#8226; Core deposits continued to be our primary source of funding and our consolidated period end loan-to-deposits ratio, which excludes LHFS, was 80.7%; 

&#8226; Our cash position, which is defined as cash balance held at the FRB, totaled $13.5 billion; 

&#8226; Our total available liquidity, comprised of contingent liquidity and available discount window capacity, was approximately $80.1 billion; 

&#8226; Contingent liquidity was $50.2 billion, consisting of unencumbered high-quality liquid securities of $22.6 billion, unused FHLB capacity of $14.1 billion, and our cash position of $13.5 billion. Asset liquidity, a component of contingent liquidity, was $36.1 billion, consisting of our cash position of $13.5 billion and unencumbered high-quality liquid securities of $22.6 billion; 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 32 

&#8226; Available discount window capacity, defined as available total borrowing capacity from the FRB based on identified collateral, is secured by non-mortgage commercial and retail loans and totaled $29.9 billion. Use of this borrowing capacity would be considered only during exigent circumstances; and 

&#8226; For a summary of our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 

The Funding and Liquidity unit monitors a variety of liquidity and funding metrics and early warning indicators and metrics, including specific risk thresholds limits. These monitoring tools are broadly classified as follows: 

&#8226; Current liquidity sources and capacities, including cash at the FRBs, free and liquid securities and available and secured FHLB borrowing capacity; 

&#8226; Liquidity stress sources, including idiosyncratic, systemic and combined stresses, in addition to evolving regulatory requirements; and 

&#8226; Current and prospective exposures, including secured and unsecured wholesale funding and spot and cumulative cash-flow gaps across a variety of horizons. 

Further, certain of these metrics are monitored individually for CBNA and for our consolidated enterprise on a daily basis, including cash position, unencumbered securities, asset liquidity, and available FHLB borrowing capacity. In order to identify emerging trends and risks and inform funding decisions, specific metrics are also forecasted over a one-year horizon.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

Our unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in this Report, are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our audited Consolidated Financial Statements. 

An accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on our unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are made using facts and circumstances known at a point in time. Changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates. Our most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below. For additional information regarding fair value measurements, see &#8220;&#8212;Critical Accounting Estimates&#8221; in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

We reserve for expected credit losses on our loan and lease portfolio through the ALLL and for expected credit losses in our unfunded lending commitments through other liabilities. Collectively, the ALLL and allowance for expected credit losses in unfunded lending commitments are referred to as the ACL. 

Changes in the ACL are reflected in net income through provision for credit losses. Changes in the credit risk profile of our loans and leases result in changes in provision expense with a resulting change, net of charge-offs and recoveries, in the ACL balance. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 33 

The ACL is often the most critical of all the accounting estimates for banking institutions like us. The ACL is maintained at a level we believe to be appropriate to absorb expected lifetime credit losses over the contractual life of the loan and lease portfolios and on the unfunded lending commitments. Our determination of the ACL is based on periodic evaluation of the loan and lease portfolios and unfunded lending commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable considering a number of relevant underlying factors, including key assumptions and evaluation of quantitative and qualitative information. 

Key assumptions used in our ACL measurement process include the use of a two-year reasonable and supportable economic forecast period followed by a one-year period during which the expected credit losses revert to long-term historical macroeconomic inputs. 

The evaluation of quantitative and qualitative information is performed through assessments of groups of assets that share similar risk characteristics and certain individual loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics with the collective group. Loans are grouped generally by product type (e.g., commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, residential mortgage, etc.), and significant loan portfolios are assessed for credit losses using econometric models. The evaluation process is inherently imprecise and subjective as it requires significant management judgment based on underlying factors that are susceptible to change, sometimes materially and rapidly. 

The quantitative evaluation of the adequacy of the ACL utilizes a single economic forecast as its foundation, and is primarily based on econometric models that use known or estimated data as of the balance sheet date and forecasted data over the reasonable and supportable period. Known and estimated data include current probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default (for commercial), timing and amount of expected draws (for unfunded lending commitments), FICO, LTV, term and time on books (for retail loans), mix and level of loan balances, delinquency levels, assigned risk ratings, previous loss experience, current business conditions, amounts and timing of expected future cash flows, and factors particular to a specific commercial credit such as competition, business and management performance. Forward-looking economic assumptions include real gross domestic product, unemployment rate, interest rate curve, and changes in collateral values. This data is aggregated to estimate expected credit losses over the contractual life of the loans and leases, adjusted for expected prepayments. In highly volatile economic environments historical information, such as commercial customer financial statements or consumer credit ratings, may not be as important to estimating future expected losses as forecasted inputs to the models. 

The ACL may also be affected materially by a variety of qualitative factors that we consider to reflect our current judgment of various events and risks that are not measured in our statistical procedures including uncertainty related to the economic forecasts used in the modeled credit loss estimates, loan growth, back testing results, credit underwriting policy exceptions, regulatory and audit findings, and peer comparisons. The qualitative allowance is further informed for certain industry sectors and certain loan classes by alternative scenarios to support the period-end ACL balance. We recognize that this approach may not be suitable in certain economic environments and differing analysis may be requested at management&#8217;s discretion. Due in part to its subjectivity, the qualitative evaluation may be materially impacted during periods of economic uncertainty and late breaking events could lead to revision of reserves to reflect management&#8217;s best estimate of expected credit losses. 

The measurement process results in specific or pooled allowances for loans, leases and unfunded lending commitments, and qualitative allowances that are judgmentally determined and applied across the portfolio. 

There are certain loan portfolios that may not need an econometric model to enable us to calculate management&#8217;s best estimate of the expected credit losses. Less data intensive, non-modeled approaches to estimating losses are considered more efficient and practical for portfolios that have lower levels of outstanding balances (e.g., runoff or closed portfolios, and new products or products that are not significant to our overall credit risk exposure). 

The ACL decreased from $2.7 billion at December 31, 2020 to $2.4 billion at March 31, 2021, reflecting a reserve release of $298 million. 

To determine the ACL as of March, 31, 2021, we utilized an economic forecast that generally reflects real GDP growth of approximately 3.2% over 2021, returning to fourth quarter 2019 real GDP levels by the last quarter of 2021. The forecast also projects the unemployment rate to be in the range of 6.3% to 7.0% throughout 2021. Overall, this forecast reflects an improved macroeconomic outlook as compared to December 31, 2020. In addition to judgment applied at the commercial portfolio as a whole, we continued to apply management 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 34 

judgment to adjust the modeled reserves in the commercial industry sectors most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns, including CRE retail and hospitality and casual dining. 

Our determination of the ACL is sensitive to changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions during the reasonable and supportable period. To illustrate, we applied a more pessimistic scenario than that described above which assumes that challenges in wide-spread distribution and acceptance of vaccines cause COVID-19 related hospitalization and fatality rates to be higher than base case. The decline in consumer spending from associated reductions in travel and an increase in state and local government restrictions cause real GDP to drop and unemployment to rise beyond our current forecast. This pessimistic scenario reflects real GDP growth of approximately 2.5% and unemployment in the range of 8% to 8.5% over 2021. Excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments, this scenario would result in a quantitative lifetime loss estimate of approximately 1.2x our period end ACL, or an increase of approximately $350 million. 

Because several quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in determining the ACL, this sensitivity analysis does not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the ACL or even what the ACL would be under these economic circumstances. The sensitivity is intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment and the corresponding impact to modeled loss estimates. The hypothetical determination does not incorporate the impact of management judgment or other qualitative factors that could be applied in the actual estimation of the ACL, and does not imply any expectation of future deterioration in our loss rates. 

To provide additional context regarding sensitivity to more pessimistic scenarios, our ACL balance of $2.4 billion represents 28% of the $8.6 billion of nine-quarter losses projected in the Federal Reserve run of the December 2020 Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario (the &#8220;Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario&#8221;), which forecasted more protracted unemployment and GDP declines compared with our ACL calculation. Our ACL calculation also included the impacts of government stimulus. 

Comparatively, our ACL represents 47% of the $5.1 billion of projected losses in the Company run results of the Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario. Losses projected under the Company run Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario are lower than the Federal Reserve run results due to methodology and modeling differences. As an example, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s models did not recognize contractual loss sharing arrangements in the merchant loan portfolio. In addition, both the Company run and Federal Reserve run results include incremental losses associated with loan originations assumed post-June 30, 2020. In contrast, our March 31, 2021 ACL balance considers only existing loans and lines of credit as of the reporting date. 

While the recovery path is clearer than it was at the end of the fourth quarter 2020, significant future uncertainty still exists, including progress in the rollout, acceptance, and effectiveness of COVID-19-related vaccines. It remains difficult to estimate how changes in economic forecasts might affect our ACL because such forecasts consider a wide variety of variables and inputs, and changes in the variables and inputs may not occur at the same time or in the same direction, and such changes may have differing impacts by product types. Further, the variables and inputs may be idiosyncratically affected by existing or future monetary and fiscal stimulus programs and forbearance and other customer accommodation efforts. Nevertheless, changes in one or multiple of the key variables may have a material impact to our estimation of expected credit losses. 

We continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19, vaccination efforts, and related policy measures on the economy and the resulting potentially material effects on the ACL.

RISK GOVERNANCE 

We are committed to maintaining a strong, integrated, and proactive approach to the management of all risks to which we are exposed in pursuit of our business objectives. A key aspect of our Board&#8217;s responsibility as the main decision making body is setting our risk appetite to ensure that the levels of risk that we are willing to accept in the attainment of our strategic business and financial objectives are clearly understood. 

To enable our Board to carry out its objectives, it has delegated authority for risk management activities, as well as governance and oversight of those activities, to a number of Board and executive management level risk committees. The Executive Risk Committee (&#8220;ERC&#8221;), chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, is responsible for oversight of risk across the enterprise and actively considers our inherent material risks, analyzes our overall risk profile and seeks confirmation that the risks are being appropriately identified, assessed and mitigated. Reporting to the ERC are the following additional committees covering specific areas of risk: Compliance and Operational Risk Committee, Model Risk Committee, Credit Policy Committee, Asset Liability Committee, Business Initiatives Review Committee, and the Conduct and Ethics Committee. 

There have been no significant changes in our risk governance practices, risk framework, risk appetite, or credit risk as described in &#8220;&#8212;Risk Governance&#8221; in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

MARKET RISK 

Market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and/or other relevant market rates or prices. Modest market risk arises from trading activities that serve customer needs, including hedging of interest rate and foreign exchange risk. As described below, more material market risk arises from our non-trading banking activities, such as loan origination and deposit-gathering. We have established enterprise-wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor and report market risk. We actively manage market risk for both non-trading and trading activities. 

Non-Trading Risk 

We are exposed to market risk as a result of non-trading banking activities. This market risk is substantially composed of interest rate risk, as we have no commodity risk and de minimis direct currency and equity risk. We also have market risk related to capital markets loan originations, as well as the valuation of our MSRs. There have been no significant changes in our sources of interest rate risk, interest rate risk practices, risk framework, metrics or assumptions as described in &#8220;&#8212;Market Risk &#8212; Non-Trading Risk&#8221; in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

The table below reports net interest income exposures against a variety of interest rate scenarios. Our policies involve measuring exposures as a percentage change in net interest income over the next year due to either instantaneous or gradual parallel changes in rates relative to the market implied forward yield curve. As the following table illustrates, our balance sheet is asset sensitive; net interest income would benefit from an increase in interest rates, while exposure to a decline in interest rates is within limit. While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates is included in this analysis, we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and therefore have a more modest impact. 

The table below presents the sensitivity of net interest income to various parallel yield curve shifts from the market implied forward yield curve: 

Table 25: Sensitivity of Net Interest Income Estimated % Change in Net Interest Income over 12 Months Basis points March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Instantaneous Change in Interest Rates &#160; &#160; 200 17.6 % 21.2 % 100 9.1 11.2 -25 (2.3) (2.7) Gradual Change in Interest Rates 200 8.5 10.8 100 4.3 5.5 -25 (1.3) (1.5) 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 36 

We continue to manage asset sensitivity within the scope of our policy and changing market conditions. Asset sensitivity against a 200 basis point gradual increase in rates decreased to 8.5% at March 31, 2021 from 10.8% at December 31, 2020, driven by the purchase of $7.0 billion of receive-fixed/pay-variable interest rate swaps and forecasted changes in balance sheet activity. Current levels of asset sensitivity are elevated relative to our core sensitivity profile due to meaningful increases in cash and deposit balances as a result of monetary and fiscal stimulus programs. In light of the yield curve steepening experienced in first quarter 2021, asset sensitivity has been reduced as we continue to balance near term net interest income considerations with the potential future benefit of rising short-term rates. Changes in interest rates can affect the risk positions, which impact the repricing sensitivity or beta of the deposit base as well as the cash flows on assets that allow for early payoff without a penalty. The risk position is managed within our risk limits, and long-term view of interest rates through occasional adjustments to securities investments, interest rate swaps and mix of funding. 

We use a valuation measure of exposure to structural interest rate risk, Economic Value of Equity (&#8220;EVE&#8221;), as a supplement to net interest income simulations. EVE complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure over a long-term horizon. EVE measures the extent to which the economic value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. This analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with non-contractual maturities. The change in value is expressed as a percentage of regulatory capital. 

We use interest rate swap contracts to manage the interest rate exposure to variability in the interest cash flows on our floating-rate assets and floating-rate wholesale funding, and to hedge market risk on fixed-rate capital markets debt issuances.

(1) Asset Liability Management (&#8220;ALM&#8221;) strategies used to manage interest rate exposures include interest rate swap contracts used to manage exposure to the variability in the interest cash flows on our floating-rate commercial loans and floating-rate wholesale funding, as well as the variability in the fair value of AFS securities. 

(2) December 31, 2020 includes $1.8 billion of forward-starting, pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were terminated in the first quarter of 2021. 

Using the interest rate curve at March 31, 2021, the estimated net contribution to net interest income related to our ALM hedge strategies is approximately $93 million for the full-year 2021 compared to $133 million for the full-year 2020 which represents a decrease of $40 million. This amount could differ from amounts actually recognized due to changes in interest rates, hedge de-designations, and the addition of other hedges subsequent to March 31, 2021. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 37 

The following table presents the pre-tax net gains (losses) recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income relating to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges:

(1) Using the interest rate curve at March 31, 2021, with respect to cash flow hedge strategies, we estimate that approximately $94 million will be reclassified from AOCI to net interest income over the next 12 months. 

LIBOR Transition 

As previously disclosed, many of our lending products, securities, derivatives, and other financial transactions utilize the LIBOR benchmark rate and will be impacted by its planned discontinuance. In late 2018, we formed a LIBOR Transition Program designed to guide the organization through the planned discontinuation of LIBOR. The Program, with direction and oversight from our Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for developing, maintaining and executing against a coordinated strategy to ensure a timely and orderly transition from LIBOR. The Program is structured to address various initiatives including program governance, transition management, communications, exposure management, new alternative reference rate product delivery, risk management, contract remediation, operations and technology readiness, accounting and reporting, as well as tax and regulation impacts. We have identified and are monitoring the risks associated with the LIBOR transition on a quarterly basis. 

The ARRC recommended that banks be systemically and operationally capable of supporting transactions in alternative reference rates, such as SOFR, by the end of September 2020. Guided by this milestone, we are systemically and operationally prepared to support alternative reference rate transactions. On March 5, 2021, the Financial Conduct Authority (&#8220;FCA&#8221;) formally announced the future cessation or loss of representation of the LIBOR benchmark settings currently published by the Intercontinental Exchange (&#8220;ICE&#8221;) Benchmark Administration. Further, the FCA stated that the 1-week and 2-month U.S. dollar LIBOR rates will cease as of December 31, 2021 and all other U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors will cease as of June 30, 2023. With the FRB, OCC, and FDIC (collectively, the agencies) supporting this announcement, the LIBOR Transition Program adjusted LIBOR transition activities accordingly. The agencies are still urging market participants to stop entering into new U.S. dollar LIBOR contracts as soon as practicable, but no later than the end of 2021. We are continuing all efforts to move new originations to alternative reference rates over the course of 2021. However, our plans for legacy contract remediation now extend through mid-2023. More broadly, program governance remains robust, and progress has been made in the above-outlined initiatives as management continues to closely monitor industry and regulatory developments pertaining to the transition. 

C apital Markets 

A key component of our capital markets activities is the underwriting and distribution of corporate credit facilities to partially finance mergers and acquisitions transactions for our clients. We have a rigorous risk management process around these activities, including a limit structure capping our underwriting risk, our potential loss, and sub limits for specific asset classes. Further, the ability to approve underwriting exposure is delegated only to senior level individuals in the credit risk management and capital markets organizations with each transaction adjudicated in the Loan Underwriting Approval Committee. 

Mortgage Servicing Rights &#160; 

We have market risk associated with the value of residential MSRs, which are impacted by various types of inherent risks, including duration, basis, convexity, volatility and yield curve. 

As part of our overall risk management strategy relative to the fair market value of the MSRs, we enter into various free-standing derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, interest rate swaptions, interest rate futures, and forward contracts to purchase mortgage-backed securities to economically hedge the changes in fair value. As of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the fair value of our MSRs was $893 million and $658 million, respectively, and the total notional amount of related derivative contracts was $15.0 billion and $11.4 billion, 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 38 

respectively. Gains and losses on MSRs and the related derivatives used for hedging are included in mortgage banking fees on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

As with our traded market risk-based activities, earnings at-risk excludes the impact of MSRs. MSRs are captured under our single price risk management framework that is used for calculating a management value at risk that is consistent with the definition used by banking regulators, as defined below. 

Trading Risk 

We are exposed to market risk primarily through client facilitation activities including derivatives and foreign exchange products as well as underwriting and market making activities. Exposure is created as a result of changes in interest rates and related basis spreads and volatility, foreign exchange rates, and credit spreads on a select range of interest rates, foreign exchange, commodities, corporate bonds and secondary loan instruments. These trading activities are conducted through CBNA and CCMI. There have been no significant changes in our market risk governance, market risk measurement, or market risk practices including VaR, stressed VaR, sensitivity analysis, stress testing, or VaR model review and validation as described in &#8220;&#8212;Market Risk &#8212; Trading Risk&#8221; in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Market Risk Regulatory Capital 

The U.S. banking regulators&#8217; &#8220;Market Risk Rule&#8221; covers the calculation of market risk capital. For the purposes of the Market Risk Rule, all of our client facing trades and associated hedges maintain a net low risk and do qualify as &#8220;covered positions.&#8221; The internal management VaR measure is calculated based on the same population of trades that is utilized for regulatory VaR.

VaR Backtesting 

Backtesting is one form of validation of the VaR model and is run daily. The Market Risk Rule requires a comparison of our internal VaR measure to the actual net trading revenue (excluding fees, commissions, reserves, intra-day trading and net interest income) for each day over the preceding year (the most recent 250 business days). Any observed loss in excess of the VaR number is taken as an exception. The level of exceptions determines the multiplication factor used to derive the VaR and SVaR-based capital requirement for regulatory reporting purposes, when applicable. We perform sub-portfolio backtesting as required under the Market Risk Rule, using models approved by our banking regulators, for interest rate, credit spread, and foreign exchange positions.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

Basis of Presentation 

The unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements, including the Notes presented in this document of Citizens Financial Group, Inc., have been prepared in accordance with GAAP interim reporting requirements, and therefore do not include all information and Notes included in the audited Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP. These unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes presented in this document should be read in conjunction with the Company&#8217;s audited Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes included in the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K. The Company&#8217;s principal business activity is banking, conducted through its banking subsidiary, CBNA. 

The unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and subsidiaries in which the Company has a controlling financial interest. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The Company has evaluated its unconsolidated entities and does not believe that any entity in which it has an interest, but does not currently consolidate, meets the requirements to be consolidated as a variable interest entity. The unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near-term relate to the determination of the ACL and the fair value of MSRs.

The Company regularly enters into security repurchase agreements with unrelated counterparties, which involve the transfer of a security from one party to another, and a subsequent transfer of substantially the same security back to the original party. These repurchase agreements are typically short-term in nature and are 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 51 

accounted for as secured borrowed funds on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company recognized no offsetting of short-term receivables or payables as of March 31, 2021 or December 31, 2020. The Company offsets certain derivative assets and derivative liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For further information, see Note 8. 

Securitizations of mortgage loans retained in the investment portfolio were $ 81 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. There were no securitizations of mortgage loans retained in the investment portfolio for the three months ended March 31, 2020. These securitizations include a substantive guarantee by a third party. In 2021, the guarantors were FNMA and FHLMC. The debt securities received from the guarantors are classified as AFS. 

Impairment 

As of March 31, 2021, the Company concluded that 71 % of HTM securities met the zero expected credit loss criteria; therefore, no ACL was recognized. For the remaining 29 %, the lifetime expected credit losses were determined to be insignificant based on the modeling of the Company&#8217;s credit loss position in the security. The Company monitors the credit exposure through the use of credit quality indicators. For these securities, the Company uses external credit ratings or an internally derived credit rating when an external rating is not available. All securities were determined to be investment grade at March 31, 2021. 

The following tables present AFS mortgage-backed debt securities with fair values below their respective carrying values, separated by the duration the securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position:

Citizens does not currently have the intent to sell these debt securities, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell these debt securities prior to recovery of their amortized cost bases. Citizens has determined that credit losses are not expected to be incurred on the agency and non-agency MBS identified with unrealized losses as of March 31, 2021. The unrealized losses on these debt securities reflect non-credit-related factors driven by changes in interest rates. Therefore, the Company has determined that these debt securities are not impaired. 

NOTE 3 - LOANS AND LEASES 

Loans held for investment are reported at the amount of their outstanding principal, net of charge-offs, unearned income, deferred loan origination fees and costs, and unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans. 

Loans and leases are disclosed in portfolio segments and classes. The Company&#8217;s loan and lease portfolio segments are commercial and retail. The classes of loans and leases are: commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, leases, residential mortgages, home equity, automobile, education and other retail.

NOTE 4 - ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, NONACCRUING LOANS AND LEASES, AND CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK 

Allowance for Credit Losses &#160; 

Management&#8217;s estimate of expected credit losses in the Company&#8217;s loan and lease portfolios is recorded in the ALLL and the allowance for unfunded lending commitments (collectively the ACL). See Note 5 in the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of the ACL reserve methodology and estimation techniques as of December 31, 2020. There were no significant changes to the ACL reserve methodology in the three months ended March 31, 2021. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 53 

The following table presents a summary of changes in the ALLL and the allowance for unfunded lending commitments for the three months ended March 31, 2021: 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 (in millions) Commercial Retail Total Allowance for loan and lease losses, beginning of period $ 1,233 &#160; $ 1,210 &#160; $ 2,443 &#160; Charge-offs ( 134 ) ( 93 ) ( 227 ) Recoveries 30 &#160; 39 &#160; 69 &#160; Net charge-offs ( 104 ) ( 54 ) ( 158 ) Provision charged to income 17 &#160; ( 108 ) ( 91 ) Allowance for loan and lease losses, end of period $ 1,146 &#160; $ 1,048 &#160; $ 2,194 &#160; Allowance for unfunded lending commitments, beginning of period $ 186 &#160; $ 41 &#160; $ 227 &#160; Provision for unfunded lending commitments ( 21 ) ( 28 ) ( 49 ) Allowance for unfunded lending commitments, end of period $ 165 &#160; $ 13 &#160; $ 178 &#160; 

The difference in ACL as of March 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020 was due to higher net charge-offs of $ 158 million, as detailed below, coupled with a negative provision for credit losses for $ 140 million. This reflected strong credit performance across the retail and commercial loan portfolios, and improvement in the macroeconomic outlook. Overall, an ending ACL balance of $ 2.4 billion at March 31, 2021 compared to $ 2.7 billion at December 31, 2020. 

The increase in commercial net charge-offs of $ 60 million in the three months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020 was driven by higher charge-offs in finance and insurance, including one large charge-off related to a financial sponsor, and CRE. Retail net charge-offs were down $ 39 million in the three months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020 as a result of government stimulus and forbearance programs. 

To determine the ACL as of March, 31, 2021, Citizens utilized an economic forecast that generally reflects real GDP growth of approximately 3.2% over 2021, returning to fourth quarter 2019 real GDP levels by the last quarter of 2021. The forecast also projects the unemployment rate to be in the range of 6.3% to 7.0% throughout 2021. Overall, this forecast reflects an improved macroeconomic outlook as compared to December 31, 2020. In addition to judgment applied at the commercial portfolio as a whole, Citizens continued to apply management judgment to adjust the modeled reserves in the commercial industry sectors most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns, including CRE retail and hospitality and casual dining. 

Accrued interest receivable on loans and leases is excluded from asset balances used to calculate the ACL. Loans in COVID-19 pandemic-related forbearance programs continue to accrue interest during the forbearance period; a reserve is established for interest income expected to be uncollectible following forbearance. Accrued interest reversed against interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was $ 1 million and $ 6 million for commercial and retail, respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2020, these reversals were $ 1 million and $ 5 million for commercial and retail, respectively.

Credit Quality Indicators 

Loan and lease portfolio segments and classes, excluding LHFS, are presented by credit quality indicator and vintage year. Citizens defines the vintage date for the purpose of this disclosure as the date of the most recent credit decision. In general, renewals are categorized as new credit decisions and reflect the renewal date as the vintage date. Loans modified in a TDR are considered to be a continuation of the original loan and vintage date corresponds with the initial loan origination date. 

For commercial loans and leases, Citizens utilizes regulatory classification ratings to monitor credit quality. Regulatory classification ratings are assigned at loan origination and are periodically re-evaluated by Citizens utilizing a risk-based approach, or at any time management becomes aware of information affecting the borrowers' ability to fulfill their obligations. Both quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in this review process. Loans with a &#8220;pass&#8221; rating are those that the Company believes will be fully repaid in accordance with the contractual loan terms. Commercial loans and leases that are &#8220;criticized&#8221; are those that have some weakness or potential weakness that indicate an increased probability of future loss. &#8220;Criticized&#8221; loans are grouped into three categories, &#8220;special mention,&#8221; &#8220;substandard&#8221; and &#8220;doubtful.&#8221; Special mention loans have potential weaknesses that, if left uncorrected, may result in deterioration of the Company&#8217;s credit position at some future date. Substandard loans are inadequately protected loans; these loans have well-defined weaknesses that could hinder normal repayment or collection of the debt. Doubtful loans have the same weaknesses as substandard, with the added characteristics that the possibility of loss is high and collection of the full amount of the loan is improbable.

For retail loans, Citizens utilizes credit scores provided by FICO and the loan&#8217;s payment and delinquency status to monitor credit quality. Management believes FICO credit scores are considered the strongest indicator of credit losses over the contractual life of the loan as the scores are based on current and historical national industry-wide consumer level credit performance data, and assist management in predicting the borrower&#8217;s future payment performance.

(2) Includes modifications that consist of multiple concessions, one of which is a maturity extension (unless one of the other concessions was an interest rate reduction). 

(3) Includes modifications other than interest rate reductions or maturity extensions, such as lowering scheduled payments for a specified period of time, principal forgiveness, and capitalizing arrearages. Also included are the following: deferrals, trial modifications, certain bankruptcies, loans in forbearance and prepayment plans. Modifications can include the deferral of accrued interest resulting in post modification balances being higher than pre-modification. 

The net change to ALLL resulting from modifications of loans for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 was $ 0 million and $ 4 million, respectively. Charge-offs may also be recorded on TDRs. Citizens recorded $ 2 million of charge-offs related to TDRs for each of the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. 

A payment default refers to a loan that becomes 90 days or more past due under the modified terms. Loan data includes loans meeting the criteria that were paid off in full, charged off, or sold prior to March 31, 2021 and 2020. For commercial loans, the amortized cost basis of TDRs that defaulted within 12 months of their modification date was $ 22 million and $ 13 million in the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 61 

respectively. For retail loans, there were $ 15 million and $ 11 million of loans which defaulted within 12 months of their restructuring date for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

Concentrations of Credit Risk 

Most of the Company&#8217;s lending activity is with customers located in the New England, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions. Generally, loans are collateralized by assets including real estate, inventory, accounts receivable, other personal property and investment securities. As of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, Citizens had a significant amount of loans collateralized by residential and commercial real estate. There were no significant concentration risks within the commercial loan or retail loan portfolios. Exposure to credit losses arising from lending transactions may fluctuate with fair values of collateral supporting loans, which may not perform according to contractual agreements. The Company&#8217;s policy is to collateralize loans to the extent necessary; however, unsecured loans are also granted on the basis of the financial strength of the applicant and the facts surrounding the transaction. 

Certain loan products, including residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, and credit cards, have contractual features that may increase credit exposure to the Company in the event of an increase in interest rates or a decline in housing values. These products include loans that exceed 90 % of the value of the underlying collateral (high LTV loans), interest-only residential mortgages, and loans with low introductory rates. The following tables present balances of loans with these characteristics:

NOTE 5 - MORTGAGE BANKING AND OTHER 

The Company sells residential mortgages to GSEs and other parties, who may issue securities backed by pools of such loans. The Company retains no beneficial interests in these sales, but may retain the servicing rights for the loans sold. The Company is obligated to subsequently repurchase a loan if the purchaser discovers a representation or warranty violation such as noncompliance with eligibility or servicing requirements, or customer fraud that should have been identified in a loan file review. 

The Company recognizes the right to service residential mortgage loans for others, or MSRs, as separate assets, which are presented in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, when purchased or when servicing is contractually separated from the underlying mortgage loans by sale with servicing rights retained. The following table summarizes activity related to residential mortgage loans sold with servicing rights retained:

The Company records MSRs at fair value method each reporting date with any changes in fair value during the period recorded in mortgage banking fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The unpaid principal balance of the related residential mortgage loans was $ 81.8 billion and $ 81.2 billion as of March 31, 2021 and 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 62 

December 31, 2020, respectively. The Company manages an active hedging strategy to manage the risk associated with changes in the value of the MSR portfolio, which includes the purchase of freestanding derivatives. 

The following table summarizes changes in MSRs recorded using the fair value method: 

As of and for the Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions) 2021 2020 Fair value as of beginning of the period $ 658 &#160; $ 642 &#160; Transfers upon election of fair value method (1)

(1) Effective January 1, 2020, the Company elected to account for all MSRs previously accounted for under the amortization method under the fair value method. 

(2) Represents changes in value of the MSRs due to i) passage of time including the impact from both regularly scheduled loan principal payments and partial 

paydowns, and ii) loans that paid off during the period. 

(3) Represents changes in value primarily driven by market conditions. These changes are recorded in mortgage banking fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

The fair value of MSRs is estimated by using the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration actual and expected mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rates, contractual servicing fee income, servicing costs, default rates, ancillary income, and other economic factors, which are determined based on current market interest rates. The valuation does not attempt to forecast or predict the future direction of interest rates. 

The sensitivity analysis below presents the impact to current fair value of an immediate 50 basis point and 100 basis point adverse change in key economic assumptions and the decline in fair value if the respective adverse change was realized. These sensitivities are hypothetical, with the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the MSRs calculated independently without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (e.g., changes in interest rates, which drive changes in prepayment rates, could result in changes in the discount rates), which may amplify or counteract the sensitivities. The primary risk inherent in the Company&#8217;s MSRs is an increase in prepayments of the underlying mortgage loans serviced, which is largely dependent upon movements in market interest rates.

Citizens accounts for derivatives in its mortgage banking operations at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as derivative assets or derivative liabilities, depending on whether the derivative had a positive (asset) or negative (liability) fair value as of the balance sheet date. The Company&#8217;s mortgage banking derivatives include commitments to originate mortgages held for sale, certain loan sale agreements, and other financial instruments that meet the definition of a derivative. Refer to Note 8 for additional information. 

Other Serviced Loans 

From time to time, Citizens engages in other servicing relationships. The following table presents the unpaid principal balance of other serviced loans:

NOTE 6 - VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES 

&#160; Citizens is involved in various entities that are considered VIEs, including investments in limited partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects, limited liability companies that sponsor renewable energy projects or asset-backed securities, and lending to special purpose entities. Citizens&#8217; maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these entities is limited to the balance sheet carrying amount of its investment in equity and asset-backed securities, unfunded commitments, and outstanding principal balance of loans to special purpose entities. A summary of these investments is presented below: 

(in millions) March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Lending to special purpose entities included in loans and leases $ 1,269 &#160; $ 1,295 &#160; LIHTC investment included in other assets 1,776 &#160; 1,687 &#160; LIHTC unfunded commitments included in other liabilities 874 &#160; 875 &#160; Investment in asset-backed securities included in HTM securities 854 &#160; 893 &#160; Renewable energy investments included in other assets 459 &#160; 403 &#160; 

Lending to Special Purpose Entities 

Citizens provides lending facilities to third-party sponsored special purpose entities. Because the sponsor for each respective entity has the power to direct how proceeds from the Company are utilized, as well as maintains responsibility for any associated servicing commitments, Citizens is not the primary beneficiary of these entities. Accordingly, Citizens does not consolidate these VIEs on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the lending facilities had aggregate unpaid principal balances of $ 1.3 billion in each period, and undrawn commitments to extend credit of $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.5 billion, respectively. 

Low Income Housing Tax Credit Partnerships 

The purpose of the Company&#8217;s equity investments is to assist in achieving the goals of the Community Reinvestment Act and to earn an adequate return of capital. LIHTC partnerships are managed by unrelated general partners that have the power to direct the activities which most significantly affect the performance of the partnerships. Citizens is therefore not the primary beneficiary of any LIHTC partnerships. Accordingly, Citizens does not consolidate these VIEs and accounts for these investments in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Citizens applies the proportional amortization method to account for its LIHTC investments. Under the proportional amortization method, the Company applies a practical expedient and amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the tax credits received in the current period as compared to the total tax credits expected to be received over the life of the investment. The amortization and tax benefits are included as a component of income tax expense. The tax credits received are reported as a reduction of income tax expense (or an increase to income tax benefit) related to these transactions. 

The following table presents other information related to the Company&#8217;s affordable housing tax credit investments: 

Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions) 2021 2020 Tax credits included in income tax expense $ 51 &#160; $ 41 &#160; Other tax benefits included in income tax expense 12 &#160; 10 &#160; Total tax benefit included in income tax expense 63 &#160; 51 &#160; Less: Amortization expense included in income tax expense 53 &#160; 43 &#160; Net benefit from affordable housing tax credit investments included in income tax expense $ 10 &#160; $ 8 &#160; 

No LIHTC investment impairment losses were recognized three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

Asset-backed securities &#160; 

Citizens invests in certain asset-backed securities that are sponsored by legal entities determined to be VIEs. Each reporting period, Citizens is required to evaluate any changes in its involvement with the VIEs that issue the asset-backed securities to determine if the Company is required to consolidate the VIE. As of March 31, 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 64 

2021, the Company concluded, based on the fact that the activities which most significantly affect the performance of the VIE are controlled by the equity holder in the VIE, and not by Citizens; therefore, Citizens is not the primary beneficiary of the VIE and does not consolidate the VIE. The Company accounts for its investment in the debt issued by these entities as HTM asset-backed securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Renewable Energy Entities 

The Company&#8217;s investments in renewable energy entities provide benefits from a return generated by government incentives plus other tax attributes that are associated with tax ownership (e.g., tax depreciation). As a tax equity investor, Citizens does not have the power to direct the activities which most significantly affect the performance of these entities and therefore is not the primary beneficiary of any renewable energy entities. Accordingly, Citizens does not consolidate these VIEs and accounts for these investments in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

NOTE 7 - BORROWED FUNDS 

Short-term borrowed funds 

Short-term borrowed funds were $ 70 million and $ 243 million as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

Advances, lines of credit, and letters of credit from the FHLB are collateralized primarily by residential mortgages and home equity products at least sufficient to satisfy the collateral maintenance level established by the FHLB. The utilized borrowing capacity for FHLB advances and letters of credit was $ 2.8 billion and $ 3.2 billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The Company&#8217;s available FHLB borrowing capacity was $ 14.1 billion and $ 13.9 billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Citizens can also borrow from the FRB discount window to meet short-term liquidity requirements. Collateral, including certain loans, is pledged to support this borrowing capacity. At March 31, 2021, the Company&#8217;s unused secured borrowing capacity was approximately $ 66.6 billion, which includes unencumbered securities, FHLB borrowing capacity, and FRB discount window capacity. 

The following table presents a summary of maturities for the Company&#8217;s long-term borrowed funds at March 31, 2021:

NOTE 8 - DERIVATIVES 

In the normal course of business, Citizens enters into a variety of derivative transactions to meet the financing needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. These transactions include interest rate swap contracts, interest rate options, foreign exchange contracts, residential loan commitment rate locks, interest rate future contracts, swaptions, certain commodities, forward commitments to sell TBAs, forward sale contracts and purchase options. The Company does not use derivatives for speculative purposes. 

The Company&#8217;s derivative instruments are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in derivative assets and derivative liabilities at fair value. Certain derivatives are cleared through a central clearing house. Cleared derivatives represent contracts executed bilaterally with counterparties in the OTC market that are novated to a central clearing house who then becomes our counterparty. OTC-cleared derivative instruments are typically settled in cash each day based on the prior day value. Information regarding the valuation methodology and inputs used to estimate the fair value of the Company&#8217;s derivative instruments is described in Note 19 in the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K. 

Derivative assets and derivative liabilities are netted by counterparty on the Consolidated Balance Sheets if a &#8220;right of setoff&#8221; has been established in a master netting agreement between the Company and the counterparty. This netted derivative asset or liability position is also netted against the fair value of any cash collateral that has been pledged or received in accordance with a master netting agreement.

(1) The notional or contractual amount of interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange contracts is the amount upon which interest and other payments under the contract are based. For interest rate contracts, the notional amount is typically not exchanged. Therefore, notional amounts should not be taken as the measure of credit or market risk, as they do not measure the true economic risk of these contracts. 

(2) Amounts represent the impact of enforceable master netting agreements that allow the Company to net settle positive and negative positions as well as collateral paid and received. 

The Company&#8217;s derivative transactions are internally divided into three sub-groups: institutional, customer and residential loan. Certain derivative transactions within these sub-groups are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges, as described below: 

Derivatives Designated As Hedging Instruments 

The Company&#8217;s institutional derivatives qualify for hedge accounting treatment. The net interest accruals on interest rate swaps designated in a fair value or cash flow hedge relationship are treated as an adjustment to interest income or interest expense of the item being hedged. The Company formally documents at inception all hedging relationships, as well as risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various accounting hedges. Additionally, the Company monitors the effectiveness of its hedge relationships during the duration of the hedge period. The methods utilized to assess hedge effectiveness vary based on hedge relationship and the Company monitors each relationship to ensure that management&#8217;s initial intent continues to be satisfied. The Company discontinues hedge accounting treatment when it is determined that a derivative is not expected to be, or has ceased to be, effective as a hedge and subsequently reflects changes in the fair value of the derivative in earnings after termination of the hedge relationship. 

Fair Value Hedges 

In a fair value hedge, changes in the fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged asset or liability attributable to the risk being hedged are recognized in the same income statement line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations when the changes in fair value occur. 

Citizens has outstanding interest rate swap agreements utilized to manage the interest rate exposure on its long-term borrowings, certain fixed rate residential mortgages and AFS debt securities. Certain fair value hedges have been designated as a last-of-layer hedge, which affords the Company the ability to execute a fair value hedge of the interest rate risk associated with a portfolio of similar prepayable assets whereby the last dollar amount estimated to remain in the portfolio of assets is identified as the hedged item. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 67 

The following table presents the change in fair value of interest rate contracts designated as fair value hedges, as well as the change in fair value of the related hedged items attributable to the risk being hedged, included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations:

(1) The Company designated $ 2.0 billion as the hedged amount (from a closed portfolio of prepayable financial assets with an amortized cost basis of $ 9.5 billion and $ 10.9 billion as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively) in a last-of-layer hedging relationship, which commenced in the third quarter of 2019. 

Cash Flow Hedges 

In a cash flow hedge, the entire change in the fair value of the interest rate swap included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness is initially recorded in OCI and is subsequently reclassified from OCI to current period earnings (interest income or interest expense) in the same period that the hedged item affects earnings. 

Citizens has outstanding interest rate swap agreements designed to hedge a portion of the Company&#8217;s floating-rate assets, and liabilities. All of these swaps have been deemed highly effective cash flow hedges. During the next 12 months, there are $ 94 million in pre-tax net gains on derivative instruments included in OCI expected to be reclassified to net interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. This amount could differ from amounts actually recognized due to changes in interest rates, hedge de-designations, and the addition of other hedges subsequent to March 31, 2021. 

The following table presents the pre-tax net gains (losses) recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income relating to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges:

Derivatives Not Designated As Hedging Instruments 

Economic Hedges 

The Company&#8217;s economic hedges include those related to offsetting customer derivatives, residential mortgage loan derivatives (including interest rate lock commitments and forward sales commitments) and derivatives to hedge its residential MSR portfolio. Customer derivatives include interest rate, foreign exchange 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 68 

and commodity derivative contracts designed to meet the hedging and financing needs of the Company&#8217;s customers, and are economically hedged by the Company to offset its market exposure. Interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage loans that will be held for sale are considered derivative instruments, and are economically hedged by entering into forward sale commitments to manage changes in fair value due to interest rate risk. Residential MSR portfolio derivatives are entered to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of the Company&#8217;s MSR asset.

Commitments to Extend Credit 

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers in accordance with conditions contractually agreed upon in advance. Generally, the commitments have fixed expiration dates or termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash requirements. 

Letters of Credit 

Letters of credit in the table above reflect commercial, standby financial and standby performance letters of credit. Financial and performance standby letters of credit are issued by the Company for the benefit of its customers. They are used as conditional guarantees of payment to a third party in the event the customer either fails to make specific payments (financial) or fails to complete a specific project (performance). The Company&#8217;s exposure to credit loss in the event of counterparty nonperformance in connection with the above instruments is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. Generally, letters of credit are collateralized by cash, accounts receivable, inventory or investment securities. Credit risk associated with letters of credit is considered in determining the appropriate amounts of allowances for unfunded commitments. Standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit are issued for terms of up to ten years and one year , respectively. 

Other Commitments 

Citizens has additional off-balance sheet arrangements that are summarized below: 

&#8226; Marketing Rights - During 2003, Citizens entered into a 25 -year agreement to acquire the naming and marketing rights of a baseball stadium in Pennsylvania. 

&#8226; Loans sold with recourse - Citizens is an originator and servicer of residential mortgages and routinely sells such mortgage loans in the secondary market and to GSEs. In the context of such sales, the Company makes certain representations and warranties regarding the characteristics of the underlying loans and, as a result, may be contractually required to repurchase such loans or indemnify certain parties against losses for certain breaches of those representations and warranties. The Company also sells the government guaranteed portion of certain SBA loans to outside investors, for which it retains the servicing rights. 

&#8226; Risk Participation Agreements - RPAs are guarantees issued by the Company to other parties for a fee, whereby the Company agrees to participate in the credit risk of a derivative customer of the other party. The current amount of credit exposure is spread out over multiple counterparties. RPAs generally have terms ranging from one year to five years ; however, certain outstanding agreements have terms as long as nine years . 

Contingencies 

The Company operates in a legal and regulatory environment that exposes it to potentially significant risks. A certain amount of litigation ordinarily results from the nature of the Company&#8217;s banking and other businesses. The Company is a party to legal proceedings, including class actions. The Company is also the subject of investigations, reviews, subpoenas, and regulatory matters arising out of its normal business operations, which, in some instances, relate to concerns about fair lending, unfair and/or deceptive practices, mortgage-related issues, and mis-selling of certain products. In addition, the Company engages in discussions with relevant governmental and regulatory authorities on a regular and ongoing basis regarding various issues, and any issues discussed or identified may result in investigatory or other action being taken. Litigation and regulatory matters may result in settlements, damages, fines, penalties, public or private censure, increased costs, required remediation, restrictions on business activities, or other impacts on the Company. 

In these disputes and proceedings, the Company contests liability and the amount of damages as appropriate. Given their complex nature, and based on the Company's experience, it may be years before some of these matters are finally resolved. Moreover, before liability can be reasonably estimated for a claim, numerous legal and factual issues may need to be examined, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, and by addressing novel or unsettled legal issues relevant to the proceedings in question. The Company cannot predict with certainty if, how, or when such claims will be resolved or what the eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, may be, particularly for claims that are at an early stage in their development or where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages. The Company recognizes a provision for a claim when, in the opinion of management after seeking legal advice, 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 71 

it is probable that a liability exists and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In many proceedings, however, it is not possible to determine whether any loss is probable or to estimate the amount of any loss. 

Based on information currently available, the advice of legal counsel and other advisers, and established reserves, management believes that the aggregate liabilities, if any, potentially arising from these proceedings will not have a materially adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements. 

NOTE 12 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 

Citizens measures or monitors many of its assets and liabilities on a fair value basis. Fair value is used on a recurring basis for assets and liabilities for which fair value is the required or elected measurement basis of accounting. Additionally, fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to evaluate assets for impairment or for disclosure purposes. Nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve the application of lower of cost or market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. Citizens also applies the fair value measurement guidance to determine amounts reported for certain disclosures in this Note for assets and liabilities that are not required to be reported at fair value in the financial statements. 

Fair Value Option 

Citizens elected to account for residential mortgage LHFS and certain commercial and industrial, and commercial real estate LHFS at fair value. The following table presents the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate unpaid principal balance of LHFS measured at fair value:

For more information on the election of the fair value option for these assets see Note 19 in the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K. 

Recurring Fair Value Measurements 

Citizens utilizes a variety of valuation techniques to measure its assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. For more information on the valuation techniques utilized to measure recurring fair value see Note 19 in the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K. 

Derivatives - Commodities Contracts 

The fair value of commodity derivatives uses the mid-point of market observable quoted prices as an input into the fair value model. The model uses the observed market prices combined with other market observed inputs to derive the fair value of the instrument, which generally classifies it as Level 2 instrument. This type of derivative is exposed to counterparty risk; therefore, the Company adjusts the fair value of the contract by the credit valuation adjustment.
