Forward-Looking Statements 

&#160; 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbor for "forward-looking statements" provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may include statements that expressly or implicitly predict future results, performance, or events. Statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. You can find many of these statements by looking for words such as "anticipates," "expects," "believes," "estimates," "intends," and "forecast," and words or phrases of similar meaning. 

We make forward-looking statements including, but not limited to, statements made about the combined company&#8217;s prospects and results following the merger with Umpqua Holdings Corporation and the merger of Columbia State Bank into Umpqua Bank, completed in the first quarter of 2023; derivatives and hedging; the results and performance of models and economic assumptions used in our calculation of the ACL; projected sources of funds and the Company's liquidity position and deposit level and types; our securities portfolio; loan sales; adequacy of our ACL, including the reserve for unfunded commitments; provision for credit losses; non-performing loans and future losses; our commercial real estate portfolio, its collectability and subsequent charge-offs; resolution of non-accrual loans; mortgage volumes and the impact of rate changes; the economic environment; inflation and interest rates generally; litigation; dividends; junior subordinated debentures; fair values of certain assets and liabilities, including MSR values and sensitivity analyses; tax rates; deposit pricing; and the effect of accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting methodology. 

Forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and are generally beyond our control.

Executive Overview 

The following is a discussion of our results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the applicable prior periods. 

Financial Performance 

Comparison of current quarter to prior quarter 

&#160; 

&#8226; Earnings per diluted common share was $0.57 for the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to $0.59 for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The decrease for the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the prior period, was primarily driven by a $14.7 million increase in the provision for credit losses, as well as a decrease in non-interest income driven by quarterly fluctuations in fair value adjustments and MSR hedging activity. This unfavorable change was partially offset by a decrease in non-interest expense, largely due to a decrease in salaries and benefits as well as decreases in the majority of the non-interest expense categories as a result of ongoing strategic actions taken to reduce our non-interest expense run rate. Net interest income increased due to higher income earned on loans and investment securities, including accretion income, and lower borrowing costs, offset partially by increased deposit expense. 

&#160; 

&#8226; Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, was 3.56% for the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to 3.52% for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was driven by higher yields on loans and investment securities, including the benefit of accretion income, which offset a modest increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits. 

&#8226; Non-interest income was $44.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to $50.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The decline was driven by fluctuations in fair value adjustments and MSR hedging activity, which collectively resulted in a net fair value loss of $9.7 million in the second quarter compared to a net fair value loss of $3.9 million in the first quarter. 

&#8226; Non-interest expense was $279.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to $287.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The decrease is mainly due to a decrease in salaries and employee benefits, largely driven by a $7.7 million reversal of a compensation-related accrual, as well as decreases in the majority of the non-interest expense categories as a result of recent expense reduction initiatives and lower other expense items compared to expense items in the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by restructuring expenses. 

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

&#8226; Earnings per diluted common share was $1.17 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to $0.65 for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, was primarily driven by a decrease in the provision for credit losses, due to the initial provision for historical Columbia non-PCD loans that was recorded in the first quarter of 2023. Non-interest expense also decreased, primarily due to lower expenses related to the Merger. 

&#160; 

&#8226; Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, was 3.54% for the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to 3.99% for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period was due to higher funding costs that reflect deposit repricing and a shift in product mix. Net interest income decreased to $850.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $858.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, due to higher rates on interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by higher average yields on interest-earning assets and higher average balances due to the Merger. 

&#8226; Non-interest income was $95.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to $94.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The change was fairly flat but included increases in most categories, largely due to the impact of six months as a combined company compared to only four months as a combined company for the prior year period. These increases were partially offset by fluctuations in fair value adjustments and MSR hedging activity, which collectively resulted in a net fair value loss of $13.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to a net fair value loss of $8.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023.

&#8226; Non-interest expense was $566.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to $671.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease for the six months ended June 30, 2024 reflects a decrease in merger and restructuring expenses of $126.4 million, partially offset by an increase in amortization of intangible assets added in connection with the Merger. The expense impact of the six months as a combined company for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to only four months as a combined company for the prior year period, was largely offset by merger-related cost savings realized throughout 2023. 

Comparison of current period end to prior year end 

&#8226; Total loans and leases were $37.7 billion as of June 30, 2024, an increase of $268.0 million, as compared to December 31, 2023. The increase in total loans and leases was primarily in the commercial real estate and commercial loan balances and was driven by commercial line utilization and construction project activity in the period. 

&#160; 

&#8226; Total deposits were $41.5 billion as of June 30, 2024, a decrease of $83.7 million, as compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease was driven by customer deposits due in part to seasonally anticipated customer tax payments, offset by targeted deposit campaigns run by our branch network. 

&#160; 

&#8226; Total consolidated assets were $52.0 billion as of June 30, 2024 compared to $52.2 billion as of December 31, 2023. 

Credit Quality 

&#8226; Non-performing assets increased to $155.9 million, or 0.30% of total assets, as of June 30, 2024, compared to $113.9 million, or 0.22% of total assets, as of December 31, 2023. Non-performing loans and leases were $153.1 million, or 0.41% of total loans and leases, as of June 30, 2024, compared to $112.9 million, or 0.30% of total loans and leases, as of December 31, 2023. The increase in non-performing assets during the quarter was driven by the expiration of certain COVID-related designations within the residential mortgage portfolio. 

&#8226; The allowance for credit losses was $438.6 million as of June 30, 2024, a decrease of $25.5 million compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses was due to changes in the economic assumptions used in credit models and a recalibration in the first quarter of 2024 of our CECL calculation for non-homogeneous commercial loans and leases and residential development loans. 

&#8226; The Company had a provision for credit losses of $31.8 million and $49.0 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively. This compares to a provision for credit losses of $17.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and $121.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the prior quarter was mainly due to reserve release during the three months ended March 31, 2024 associated with the recalibration of our CECL calculation. The six months ended June 30, 2023 included an $88.4 million initial provision for historical Columbia non-PCD loans related to the Merger. This initial provision, as well as changes in the economic assumptions used in credit models and a recalibration of our CECL calculation in the first quarter of 2024, contributed to the change when compared to the same period in the current year. 

Liquidity 

&#8226; Total cash and cash equivalents were $2.1 billion as of June 30, 2024, a decrease of $93.7 million from December 31, 2023. The Company manages its cash position as part of management's strategy to maintain a high-quality liquid asset position to support balance sheet flexibility, fund growth in lending and investment portfolios, and deleverage non-deposit liabilities as economic conditions permit. 

&#8226; Including secured off-balance sheet lines of credit, total available liquidity was $19.1 billion as of June 30, 2024, representing 37% of total assets, 46% of total deposits, and 140% of uninsured deposits. 

Capital and Growth Initiatives 

&#8226; The Company's total risk-based capital ratio was 12.2% and its common equity tier 1 ("CET1") capital ratio was 10.0% as of June 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the Company's total risk-based capital ratio was 11.9% and its CET1 capital ratio was 9.6%.

&#8226; Columbia paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.36 per common share to shareholders on June 10, 2024. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Our critical accounting estimates are described in detail in the Critical Accounting Estimates section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024. The condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP and follow general practices within the financial services industry, in which the Company operates. This preparation requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions, and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, actual results could differ from the estimates, assumptions, and judgments reflected in the financial statements. Certain estimates inherently have a greater reliance on the use of assumptions and judgments and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Management believes that the estimates for ACL, business combinations, and goodwill are important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations and require difficult, subjective, or complex judgments. There have been no material changes in the methodology of these estimates during the six months ended June 30, 2024. 

Results of Operations 

Columbia's financial results for any periods ended prior to February 28, 2023, the Merger Date, reflect UHC results only on a standalone basis. Accordingly, Columbia's reported financial results for the first quarter of 2023 reflect only UHC financial results through the closing of the Merger. As a result of these two factors, Columbia's financial results for the six months ended June 2023 may not be directly comparable to prior or future reported periods. 

Comparison of current quarter to prior quarter 

The Company had net income of $120.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to net income of $124.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The decrease in net income is mainly attributable to an increase in provision for credit losses and a decrease in non-interest income, partially offset by a decrease in non-interest expense and an increase in net interest income. The increase of $14.7 million in provision for credit losses reflects the recalibration of our CECL calculation that took place during the three months ended March 31, 2024, providing a benefit to the first quarter of 2024's provision for credit losses, as well as credit migration trends and changes in the economic forecasts used in credit models. The decrease of $5.7 million in non-interest income was primarily driven by quarterly fluctuations in fair value adjustments and MSR hedging activity. The increase of $4.1 million in net interest income reflects higher income earned on loans and investment securities, including accretion income, and lower borrowing costs. The decrease of $8.3 million in non-interest expense is mainly due to a decrease in salaries and employee benefits, largely driven by a reversal of a compensation-related accrual, as well as decreases in the majority of the non-interest expense categories as a result of recent expense reduction initiatives. This favorable change was partially offset by an increase in merger and restructuring expense, which included $12.0 million in restructuring expenses during the three months ended June 30, 2024. The Company conducted an enterprise-wide evaluation of our operations during the first quarter of 2024, which resulted in consolidated positions and simplified reporting and organizational structures, with changes expected to be carried out through the third quarter of 2024 to achieve a core expense run rate for the fourth quarter of 2024 of $965 million to $985 million annualized. As of June 30, 2024, 91% of identified cost savings have been realized. The expected core expense run rate excludes CDI amortization, merger and restructuring expense, exit and disposal costs, and the FDIC special assessment. 

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

For the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company had net income of $244.2 million, compared to net income of $119.3 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in net income is mainly attributable to decreases in non-interest expense and provision for credit losses, partially offset by a decrease in net interest income. The $104.6 million decrease in non-interest expense is primarily due to a decrease in merger and restructuring expenses, as the bulk of the merger expenses associated with the Merger were recognized in 2023. The decrease of $72.6 million in provision for credit losses was impacted by the initial provision of $88.4 million for historical Columbia non-PCD loans that was recorded in the first quarter of 2023. The decrease of $7.9 million in net interest income was due to higher rates on interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by higher average yields on interest-earning assets and a larger average balance sheet for the six months ended June 30, 2024.

The following table presents the return on average assets (GAAP), average common shareholders' equity (GAAP), and average tangible common shareholders' equity (non-GAAP) for the periods indicated. For each period presented, the table includes the calculated ratios based on reported net income. To the extent return on average common shareholders' equity is used to compare our performance with other financial institutions that do not have merger and acquisition-related intangible assets, we believe it is beneficial to also consider the return on average tangible common shareholders' equity. This measure is useful for evaluating the performance of a business as it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization. Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity is also used as part of our incentive compensation program for our executive officers. The return on average tangible common shareholders' equity is calculated by dividing net income by average shareholders' common equity less average goodwill and other intangible assets, net (excluding MSR). The return on average tangible common shareholders' equity is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should be viewed in conjunction with the return on average common shareholders' equity.

Additionally, management believes tangible common equity and the tangible common equity ratio are meaningful measures of capital adequacy. Columbia believes the exclusion of certain intangible assets in the computation of tangible common equity and the tangible common equity ratio provides a meaningful base for period-to-period and company-to-company comparisons, which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results and capital of the Company. Tangible common equity is calculated as total shareholders' equity less goodwill and other intangible assets, net (excluding MSR). In addition, tangible assets are total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets, net (excluding MSR). The tangible common equity ratio is calculated as tangible common shareholders' equity divided by tangible assets. Tangible common equity and the tangible common equity ratio are considered non-GAAP financial measures and should be viewed in conjunction with total shareholders' equity and the total shareholders' equity ratio.

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not reviewed or audited. Although we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP. 

Net Interest Income 

Comparison of current quarter to prior quarter 

Net interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was $427.4 million, an increase of $4.1 million compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase was driven by an $11.3 million increase in interest income, largely driven by higher income earned on loans and investment securities, including accretion income, and lower borrowing costs. This was partially offset by $8.9 million in higher deposit costs. Targeted pricing actions limited the increase in Columbia's cost of interest-bearing deposits between periods. 

The net interest margin (net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets) on a fully tax-equivalent basis was 3.56% for the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to 3.52% for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The expansion was driven by higher yields on loans and investment securities, including the benefit of accretion income, which offset a modest increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits. The yield on loans and leases for the three months ended June 30, 2024 increased by 7 basis points compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024. 

The cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the three months ended June 30, 2024 increased by 6 basis points compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024, due to rising cost of funds on deposits and product mix shift to higher cost money market and time deposits. This was partially offset by a lower cost for borrowings, as the Company was able to utilize the more favorable rates associated with the FRB BTFP for the full quarter ended June 30, 2024. 

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

&#160; 

Net interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was $850.8 million, a decrease of $7.9 million compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease is due to higher rates on interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by higher average yields on interest-earning assets and a larger average balance sheet for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period as a result of the Merger. 

Table of Contents 

The net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis was 3.54% for the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to 3.99% for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period was due to higher funding costs that reflect deposit repricing, and a shift in product mix. 

The yield on loans and leases for the six months ended June 30, 2024 increased by 40 basis points, as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily attributable to the rising interest rate environment and purchase accounting accretion and amortization related to the Merger. 

The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 109 basis points for the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, due to a higher mix of higher-cost time deposits, as well as rising interest rates. Our net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in the yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds. 

Between March 2022 and July 2023, the Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 5.25%. During that period, our net interest margin expanded as our asset sensitive balance sheet became increasingly profitable due to active rate increases by the Federal Reserve and the lagged impact to deposit pricing. Since the Federal Reserve ceased increasing the federal funds rate, we have experienced an increase in our funding costs that outpaces the increase in our earning asset yields as our deposits have continued to reprice higher and our funding base has experienced a shift toward higher-cost sources as Federal Reserve actions have reduced available liquidity within the banking industry. As a result, our net interest margin has contracted since July 2023 due to the impact of higher funding costs and minimal change to the average yield on earning assets. Further, the impact of balance sheet composition changes and the higher interest rate environment has shifted the interest rate sensitivity position of the balance sheet to a liability sensitive position as of June 30, 2024 from an asset sensitive position at the onset of the rising rate environment.

Provision for Credit Losses 

&#160; 

Comparison of current quarter to prior quarter 

The Company had a $31.8 million provision for credit losses for the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to a $17.1 million provision for the three months ended March 31, 2024. As an annualized percentage of average outstanding loans and leases, the provision for credit losses recorded for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was 0.34%, as compared to 0.18% for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The change in provision for credit losses reflects credit migration trends and changes in the economic forecasts used in credit models. Further, during the first quarter of 2024, we recalibrated the commercial CECL model to be more reflective of the post-Merger loan portfolio after a full year operating as a combined organization, which benefited the provision for credit losses. 

For the three months ended June 30, 2024, net charge-offs were $30.4 million, as compared to $44.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. As an annualized percentage of average outstanding loans and leases, net charge-offs for the three months ended June 30, 2024 were 0.32%, as compared to 0.47% for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Net charge-offs in the FinPac portfolio were $24.7 million in the second quarter, a slight increase from the first quarter, and net charge-offs were $5.7 million for the Bank.

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

The Company had a $49.0 million provision for credit losses for the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to $121.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily driven by the $88.4 million initial provision for historical Columbia non-PCD loans that was recorded in the first quarter of 2023. As an annualized percentage of average outstanding loans and leases, the provision for credit losses recorded for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was 0.26%, as compared to 0.73% for the six months ended June 30, 2023. During the first quarter of 2024, we recalibrated the commercial CECL model to be more reflective of the post-Merger loan portfolio after a full year operating as a combined organization. We believe the recalibrated model is more reflective of the quality of our underwriting and borrower profiles. 

For the six months ended June 30, 2024, net charge-offs were $74.4 million, as compared to $44.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. As an annualized percentage of average outstanding loans and leases, net charge-offs for the six months ended June 30, 2024 were 0.40%, as compared to 0.27% for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Net charge-offs in the FinPac portfolio were $48.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to $42.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Net charge-offs were $25.9 million for the Bank for the six months ended June 30, 2024, and activity was impacted by a single commercial credit. 

Typically, loans in a non-accrual status will not have an allowance for credit loss as they will be written down to their net realizable value or charged-off. However, the net realizable value for homogeneous leases and equipment finance agreements are determined by the loss given default calculated by the CECL model, and therefore homogeneous leases and equipment finance agreements on non-accrual will have an allowance for credit loss amount until they become 181 days past due, at which time they are charged-off. The non-accrual leases and equipment finance agreements of $23.2 million as of June 30, 2024 have a related allowance for credit losses of $20.4 million, with the remaining loans written-down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less estimated costs to sell, and are expected to be resolved with no additional material loss, absent further decline in market prices. 

Non-Interest Income

Comparison of current quarter to prior quarter 

Other income for the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024, decreased primarily due to interest rate fluctuations resulting in the current quarter including a loss on the fair value of certain loans held for investment of $10.1 million as compared to loss of $2.4 million for the prior quarter. These fair value adjustments are inversely influenced by the change in longer- term interest rates. The increase in service charges on deposits, which include treasury management fee income, card-based fees, and financial services and trust revenue, reflect the Company&#8217;s focus on generating growth in sustainable core fee income that results from needs-based solutions for new and existing customers. 

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

Other income for the six months ended June 30, 2024 decreased, as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to interest rate fluctuations resulting in a loss on the fair value of certain loans held for investment of $12.5 million in the current period as compared to a gain of $2.5 million in the prior year period. The decrease was partially offset by the impact of rate fluctuations on swap derivatives with a gain in the current period compared to a loss in the prior year period, resulting in a favorable change of $3.9 million, as well as the Company&#8217;s focus on generating growth in core product income by supporting the needs of our customers.

Comparison of current quarter to prior quarter 

Salaries and employee benefits decreased during the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024, due primarily to a $7.7 million reversal of a compensation-related accrual. 

Merger and restructuring expense increased during the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily due to restructuring expense of $12.0 million during the quarter, which was primarily severance payments. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company conducted a comprehensive evaluation of our operations, resulting in streamlined roles and simplified reporting and organizational structures. These actions contributed to expense reductions in the second quarter. 

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

Intangible amortization increased during the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to the current year including six months of amortization associated with the core deposit intangible asset added as a result of the Merger, compared to only four months of amortization during the six months ended June 30, 2023. 

Table of Contents 

Merger and restructuring expense decreased during the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023, with the largest drivers of the decrease being lower legal and professional fees and personnel expenses related to the Merger. Columbia closed the Merger and completed the core systems conversion during the first quarter of 2023. The decrease in Merger expenses was partially offset by $12.0 million in restructuring expenses during the six months ended June 30, 2024. 

Income Taxes 

The Company's effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 was 25.4% and 26.0% respectively, as compared to 26.6% and 25.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and June 30, 2023, respectively. The effective tax rates differed from the statutory rate principally because of state taxes, non-deductible FDIC assessments, and income on tax-exempt investment securities.

Investment Securities 

&#160; 

Investment debt securities available for sale were $8.5 billion as of June 30, 2024, compared to $8.8 billion as of December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to paydowns, calls, and maturities of $237.6 million, as well as a decrease of $162.2 million in fair value of investment securities available for sale, due to higher rates during the period.

We review investment securities on an ongoing basis for the presence of impairment, taking into consideration current market conditions, fair value in relationship to cost, extent and nature of the change in fair value, issuer rating changes and trends, whether we intend to sell a security or if it is likely that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost basis of the investment, which may be maturity, and other factors. 

&#160; 

As of June 30, 2024, the available for sale investment portfolio had a net unrealized loss of $595.2 million, which reflects gross unrealized losses of $600.6 million and gross unrealized gains of $5.5 million. Gross unrealized losses consisted primarily of unrealized losses on mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations of $480.6 million. The unrealized losses were attributable to changes in market interest rates or the widening of market spreads subsequent to the initial purchase of these securities and are not attributable to changes in credit quality. In the opinion of management, no ACL was considered necessary on these debt securities as of June 30, 2024. 

Loans and Leases 

&#160; 

Total loans and leases outstanding as of June 30, 2024 were $37.7 billion, an increase of $268.0 million as compared to December 31, 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to organic loan growth of $468.8 million, partially offset by loan sales of $113.6 million and charge-offs of $86.0 million. The loan to deposit ratio was 91% as of June 30, 2024 and 90% as of December 31, 2023.

Commercial Real Estate and Commercial Loans 

Commercial real estate and commercial loans are the largest classifications within earning assets, representing 41% and 20%, respectively, of average earning assets for both the three month periods ended June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The increase in commercial real estate and commercial loan balances between June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was driven by commercial line utilization and construction project activity in the period. Higher commercial real estate term balances reflect projects that transitioned from construction to permanent financing. 

Delinquency and non-accrual loan movements during the quarter reflect an anticipated move toward a normalized credit environment following a phase of exceptional high credit quality. The increase in non-performing assets during the quarter was driven by the expiration of certain COVID-related designations within the residential mortgage portfolio as non-performing loans in commercial portfolios declined. Non-performing loans during the quarter include $64.6 million in government guarantees on the commercial real estate, commercial, and residential portfolios. 

Commercial Real Estate Loans 

The commercial real estate portfolio includes loans to developers and institutional sponsors supporting income-producing or for-sale commercial real estate properties. We seek to mitigate our risk on these loans by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount and underwriting the loan with projected cash flow in excess of the debt service requirement. 

As of June 30, 2024, commercial real estate loans held in our loan portfolio were $19.7 billion, an increase of $268.0 million compared to December 31, 2023. Commercial real estate concentrations are managed with a goal of optimizing geographic and business diversity, primarily in our footprint. 

Loans secured by office properties represented approximately 8% of our total loan portfolio at both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, with a breakout of 57% non-owner occupied, 39% owner occupied, and 4% construction loans for both periods. Excluding floating rate loans, which have already repriced to prevailing rates, only 6% of our office portfolio reprices through 2025. Office properties located in suburban markets secure the majority of our office portfolio as only 6% of non-owner occupied loans are located in downtown core business districts. 

Loans secured by multifamily properties, including construction, represent approximately 20% of the total loan portfolio as of June 30, 2024 and 19% as of December 31, 2023. These assets continue to perform well due to demand for rental properties in our geographic footprint. Although management believes such concentrations have no more than the normal risk of collectability, a substantial decline in the economy in general, material increases in interest rates, changes in tax and rent control policies, tightening credit or refinancing markets, or a decline in real estate values in the Bank's primary geographic footprint in particular, could have an adverse impact on the repayment of these loans.

Commercial Loans and Leases 

Commercial loans are made to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs, equipment purchases, or other projects. We focus on borrowers doing business within our geographic markets. Commercial loans are generally underwritten individually and secured with the assets of the company and/or the personal guarantee of the business owners. Lease and equipment financing products are designed to address the diverse financing needs of small to large companies, primarily for the acquisition of equipment. As of June 30, 2024, commercial loans held in our loan portfolio were $9.8 billion, an increase of $123.7 million compared to December 31, 2023, which is mainly attributable to credit line utilization during the period. 

The leases and equipment finance portfolio represents approximately 17% of the commercial portfolio and 5% of the total loan portfolio. The leasing portfolio has non-performing leases and charge-offs centered in the trucking and transportation portion of the portfolio. Net charge-offs in the FinPac lease portfolio were $24.7 million in the second quarter, largely unchanged from the first quarter, and net charge-offs were down $14.1 million in the remaining commercial portfolio from the prior quarter, largely due to the first quarter including a charge-off centered in a single commercial credit. Delinquency and non-accrual loan movements in the transportation and trucking portfolio over the year were anticipated and a slow recovery is in process for this portfolio.

Residential Real Estate Loans 

Residential real estate loans represent mortgage loans and lines of credit to consumers for the purchase or refinance of a residence. As of June 30, 2024, residential real estate loans held in our loan portfolio were $8.0 billion, a decrease of $120.4 million as compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to loan sales of $80.0 million in residential mortgage loans during the period. 

Consumer Loans 

Consumer loans, including secured and unsecured personal loans, home equity and personal lines of credit, and motor vehicle loans, decreased $3.3 million to $192.4 million as of June 30, 2024, as compared to December 31, 2023.

(2) Excludes certain mortgage loans guaranteed by GNMA, which Columbia has the unilateral right to repurchase but has not done so, totaling $1.0 million as of June 30, 2024 and $1.0 million at December 31, 2023. 

&#160; 

As of June 30, 2024 there were approximately $60.8 million or 0.16% of total loans, modified due to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties, compared to $138.1 million or 0.37% as of December 31, 2023. 

Table of Contents 

A decline in the economic conditions and other factors could adversely impact individual borrowers or the loan portfolio in general. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that loans will not become 90 days or more past due, placed on non-accrual status, restructured, or transferred to other real estate owned in the future. As of June 30, 2024, there was an increase in non-performing loans representative of a more normalized credit environment relative to December 31, 2023. Additionally, the expiration of COVID-related designations within the residential mortgage portfolio contributed to the increase in loans and leases past due 90+ days and accruing.

The provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan and lease losses and the provision for unfunded commitments. The change in the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024, reflects the recalibration of CECL calculation during the first quarter of 2024, which benefited the provision for loan and lease losses, as well as credit migration trends and changes in the economic forecasts used in credit models. The decrease in the provision for the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023, reflects the $88.4 million initial provision for historical Columbia non-PCD loans related to the Merger in 2023. This initial provision, as well as changes in the economic assumptions used in credit models and a recalibration of our CECL calculation in the first quarter of 2024, contributed to the change when compared to the same period in the current year. Net charge-offs were driven by the commercial loan portfolio, comprising $29.4 million of the net charge-offs for the second quarter of 2024 and $42.5 million for the first quarter of 2024. The decrease was largely driven by a single commercial credit charged off during the first quarter. 

The following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases and percent of loans in each category to total loans and leases as of the dates presented:

To calculate the ACL, the CECL models use a forecast of future economic conditions and are dependent upon specific macroeconomic variables that are relevant to each of the Bank's loan and lease portfolios. For the second quarter of 2024, the Bank used Moody's Analytics' May 2024 baseline economic forecast, which shows a worsening economic situation from the forecast used in the prior quarter. Refer to Note 5 - Allowance for Credit Losses for further information on key components of the forecast. The models for calculating the ACL are sensitive to changes to economic variables, which could result in volatility as these assumptions change over time. 

We believe that the ACL as of June 30, 2024 is sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio and in credit commitments outstanding as of that date based on the information available. If the economic conditions decline, the Bank may need additional provisions for credit losses in future periods.

Residential MSR are adjusted to fair value quarterly with the change recorded in residential mortgage banking revenue on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The value of servicing rights can fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and other factors. Generally, as interest rates decline and borrowers are able to take advantage of a refinance incentive, prepayments increase, and the total value of existing servicing rights declines as expectations of future servicing fee collections decline. Historically, the fair value of our residential MSR will increase as market rates for mortgage loans rise and decrease if market rates fall. 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $1.0 billion in goodwill, which was recorded as a result of the Merger. Goodwill is recorded in connection with business combinations and represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired. 

As of June 30, 2024, we had other intangible assets of $542.4 million, as compared to $603.7 million at December 31, 2023. As part of a business acquisition, the fair value of identifiable intangible assets such as core deposits, which includes all deposits except certificates of deposit, was recognized at the Merger Date. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized to their estimated residual values over their respective estimated useful lives. The core deposit intangible assets recorded are amortized on an accelerated basis over a period of 10 years using the sum-of-the-years-digits method. Intangible assets are evaluated for impairment if events and circumstances indicate a possible impairment. No impairment losses have been recognized in the periods presented.

Deposits 

Total deposits were $41.5 billion as of June 30, 2024, a decrease of $83.7 million as compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease was driven by customer deposits due in part to anticipated seasonal customer tax payments, partially offset by targeted campaigns run by our branch network. The interest-bearing deposit mix increased mainly due to a migration from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing accounts as customers seek higher rates in the current interest rate environment.

&#160; 

The Company's total core deposits, which are deposits less time deposits greater than $250,000 and all brokered deposits, were $37.2 billion and $37.4 billion as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company's brokered deposits totaled $3.2 billion and $3.1 billion as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

The FDIC generally insures up to $250,000 per depositor for each account ownership category, as defined by the FDIC. Depositors may qualify for coverage of accounts over $250,000 if they have funds in different ownership categories and all applicable FDIC requirements are met. All deposits that an account owner has in the same ownership category at the same bank are added together and insured up to the standard insurance amount. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately $27.9 billion and $28.1 billion, respectively, of the Bank&#8217;s deposits were estimated to be insured. Uninsured deposits are an estimated amount based on the methodologies and assumptions used for the Bank's regulatory requirements. Uninsured deposits were $13.6 billion and $13.5 billion as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of June 30, 2024, total available liquidity was $19.1 billion, or 140% of uninsured deposits. 

Borrowings 

&#160; 

As of June 30, 2024, the Bank had outstanding securities sold under agreements to repurchase of $197.9 million, a decrease of $54.3 million from December 31, 2023. The Bank had outstanding borrowings consisting of advances from the FHLB and FRB of $3.9 billion as of June 30, 2024 and $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2023. The decrease compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 was primarily due to repayment of higher priced borrowings as well as general liquidity management. FHLB advances have fixed rates ranging from 5.10% to 5.25%, all of which are set to mature before the end of the first quarter of 2025. Advances from the FHLB are secured by investment securities and loans secured by real estate. The FRB borrowings have interest rates ranging from 4.76% to 4.93% and mature in January 2025, although the Company has the ability to repay balances prior to maturity without penalty. The FRB borrowings are secured by investment securities. 

Junior and Other Subordinated Debentures 

&#160; 

We had junior and other subordinated debentures with carrying values of $418.0 million and $424.3 million as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease is mainly due to a decline of $6.1 million in fair value for the junior subordinated debentures elected to be carried at fair value. The change in fair value was driven by increases in credit spreads and comparable swap rates during the period. As of June 30, 2024, substantially all of the junior subordinated debentures had interest rates that are adjustable on a quarterly basis based on a spread over three-month term SOFR.

Liquidity and Cash Flow 

&#160; 

The principal objective of our liquidity management program is to maintain the Bank's ability to meet the day-to-day cash flow requirements of our customers who either wish to withdraw funds or to draw upon credit facilities to meet their cash needs. The Bank's liquidity strategy includes maintaining sufficient on-balance sheet liquidity to support balance sheet flexibility, fund growth in lending and investment portfolios, and deleverage non-deposit liabilities as economic conditions permit. As a result, the Company believes that it has sufficient cash and access to borrowings to effectively manage through the current economic conditions, as well as meet its working capital and other needs. The Company will continue to prudently evaluate and maintain liquidity sources, including the ability to fund future loan growth and manage our borrowing sources. 

We monitor the sources and uses of funds daily to maintain an acceptable liquidity position. One source of funds includes public deposits. Individual state laws require banks to collateralize public deposits, typically as a percentage of their public deposit balance in excess of FDIC insurance. Public deposits represented 7% of total deposits at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The amount of collateral required varies by state and may also vary by institution within each state, depending on the individual state's risk assessment of depository institutions. Changes in the pledging requirements for uninsured public deposits may require pledging additional collateral to secure these deposits, drawing on other sources of funds to finance the purchase of assets that would be available to be pledged to satisfy a pledging requirement, or could lead to the withdrawal of certain public deposits from the Bank. 

The Bank&#8217;s diversified deposit base provides a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funding, while reducing the Bank&#8217;s reliance on the wholesale markets. Total deposits were $41.5 billion as of June 30, 2024, compared with $41.6 billion at December 31, 2023. The Bank also has liquidity from excess bond collateral of $3.4 billion. 

In addition to liquidity from core deposits and the repayments and maturities of loans and investment securities, the Bank can sell securities under agreements to repurchase, issue brokered certificates of deposit, or utilize off-balance sheet funding sources. 

The Bank maintains a substantial level of total available liquidity in the form of off-balance sheet funding sources. These liquidity sources include capacity to borrow from uncommitted lines of credit, advances from the FHLB, and the Federal Reserve Bank&#8217;s Discount Window. Availability of the uncommitted lines of credit is subject to federal funds balances available for loan and continued borrower eligibility. These lines are intended to support short-term liquidity needs, and the agreements may restrict consecutive day usage.

The Company is a separate entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. Substantially all of the Company's revenues are obtained from dividends declared and paid by the Bank. There were $180.0 million of dividends paid by the Bank to the Company during the six months ended June 30, 2024. There are statutory and regulatory provisions that limit the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company. FDIC and Oregon Division of Financial Regulation approval is required for quarterly dividends from the Bank to the Company. 

Although we expect the Bank's and the Company's liquidity positions to remain satisfactory during 2024, it is possible that our deposit balances may not be maintained at previous levels due to pricing pressure or customers' behavior in the current economic environment. In addition, in order to generate deposit growth, our pricing may need to be adjusted in a manner that results in increased interest expense on deposits. We may utilize borrowings or other funding sources, which are generally more costly than deposit funding, to support our liquidity levels. 

Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations- The Company participates in many different contractual arrangements which may or may not be recorded on its balance sheet, under which the Company has an obligation to pay certain amounts, provide credit or liquidity enhancements or provide market risk support. Our material contractual obligations are primarily for time deposits and borrowings. As of June 30, 2024, time deposits totaled $6.4 billion, of which $6.2 billion mature in a year or less. Total borrowings as of June 30, 2024 were $3.9 billion all of which mature within one year. These arrangements also include off-balance sheet commitments to extend credit, letters of credit and various forms of guarantees. As of June 30, 2024, our loan commitments were $10.8 billion and letter of credit commitments were $217.2 million. A portion of the commitments will eventually result in funded loans and increase our profitability through net interest income when drawn and unused commitment fees prior to being drawn. Refer to Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies for further information. Financing commitments, letters of credit and deferred purchase commitments are presented at contractual amounts and do not necessarily reflect future cash outflows as many are expected to expire unused or partially used.

Capital Resources 

&#160; 

Shareholders' equity as of June 30, 2024 was $5.0 billion, a decrease of $18.4 million from December 31, 2023. The decrease in shareholders' equity during the six months ended June 30, 2024 was principally due to other comprehensive losses of $115.5 million and cash dividends paid of $151.3 million, partially offset by net income of $244.2 million during the period. 

The Company's dividend policy considers, among other things, earnings, regulatory capital levels, the overall payout ratio and expected asset growth to determine the amount of dividends declared, if any, on a quarterly basis. There is no assurance that future cash dividends on common shares will be declared or increased. We cannot predict the extent of the economic decline that could result in inadequate earnings, regulatory restrictions and limitations, changes to our capital requirements, or a decision to increase capital by retention of earnings, which may result in the inability to pay dividends at previous levels, or at all. 

On May 13, 2024, Columbia declared a cash dividend in the amount of $0.36 per common share based on first quarter 2024 performance, which was paid on June 10, 2024.

The Company is committed to managing capital to maintain strong protection for depositors and creditors and for maximum shareholder benefit. The Company also manages its capital to exceed regulatory capital requirements for banking organizations. The regulatory capital requirements effective for the Company follow Basel III, with the Company being subject to calculating its capital adequacy as a percentage of risk-weighted assets under the standardized approach. 

In 2020, the federal bank regulatory authorities finalized a rule to provide banking organizations that implemented CECL in 2020 the option to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital by up to two years, with a three-year transition period to phase out the cumulative benefit to regulatory capital provided during the two-year delay. The Company elected this capital relief to delay the estimated regulatory capital impact of adopting CECL, relative to the incurred loss methodology's effect on regulatory capital. Currently, the Company is phasing out the cumulative adjustment as calculated at the end of 2021, by adjusting it by 75% in 2022, 50% through 2023, and 25% in 2024, culminating with a fully phased in regulatory capital calculation beginning in 2025. All regulatory ratios exceeded regulatory &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; requirements. 

The following table shows the Company's consolidated and the Bank's capital adequacy ratios compared to the regulatory minimum capital ratio and the regulatory minimum capital ratio needed to qualify as a "well-capitalized" institution, as calculated under regulatory guidelines of the Basel III at the dates presented:
