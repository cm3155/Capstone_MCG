Forward-Looking Statements 

&#160; 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbor for "forward-looking statements" provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may include statements that expressly or implicitly predict future results, performance or events. Statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. You can find many of these statements by looking for words such as "anticipates," "expects," "believes," "estimates," "intends," and "forecast," and words or phrases of similar meaning. 

We make forward-looking statements including, but not limited to, statements made about the combined company&#8217;s prospects and results following the merger with Umpqua Holdings Corporation and the merger of Columbia State Bank into Umpqua Bank (collectively, the &#8220;Mergers&#8221;), completed in the first quarter of 2023; derivatives and hedging; the results and performance of models and economic assumptions used in our calculation of the ACL; projected sources of funds and the Company's liquidity position and deposit level and types; our securities portfolio; loan sales; adequacy of our ACL, including the reserve for unfunded commitments; provision for credit losses; non-performing loans and future losses; our commercial real estate portfolio, its collectability and subsequent charge-offs; resolution of non-accrual loans; mortgage volumes and the impact of rate changes; the economic environment; inflation and interest rates generally; litigation; dividends; junior subordinated debentures; fair values of certain assets and liabilities, including MSR values and sensitivity analyses; tax rates; deposit pricing; and the effect of accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting methodology. 

Forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and are generally beyond our control.

Executive Overview 

The following is a discussion of our results for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the applicable prior periods. 

Financial Performance 

Comparison of current quarter to prior quarter 

&#160; 

&#8226; Earnings per diluted common share was $0.59 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to $0.45 for the three months ended December 31, 2023. The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the prior period, was primarily driven by a $37.8 million decrease in the provision for credit losses, as well as a decrease in non-interest expense largely due to the prior quarter including $32.9 million for the FDIC special assessment. This favorable change was partially offset by a decrease in non-interest income, driven by quarterly fluctuations in fair value adjustments, and net interest income. Net interest income decreased due to higher deposit costs relative to the fourth quarter and lower income earned on investment securities given slower prepayment activity. 

&#160; 

&#8226; Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, was 3.52% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to 3.78% for the three months ended December 31, 2023. The decrease for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was due to the effect of deposit repricing and balance mix shift during the quarter. 

&#8226; Non-interest income was $50.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to $65.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023. The decline was driven by quarterly fluctuations in fair value adjustments and MSR hedging activity, which collectively resulted in a net fair value loss of $3.9 million in the first quarter compared to a net fair value gain of $12.7 million in the fourth quarter. 

&#8226; Non-interest expense was $287.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to $337.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was due to the fourth quarter's larger FDIC special assessment and lower discretionary spending. 

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

&#8226; Earnings per diluted common share was $0.59 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to $(0.09) for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, was primarily driven by a decrease in the provision for credit losses, due to the initial provision for historical Columbia non-PCD loans that was recorded in the first quarter of 2023. Non-interest expense also decreased, primarily due to lower merger-related expenses, and net interest income increased, primarily due to a full quarter operating as a combined company compared to only one month as a combined company for the prior year period. 

&#160; 

&#8226; Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, was 3.52% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to 4.08% for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the prior year period was due to higher funding costs, deposit repricing, and a shift in product mix. Net interest income increased to $423.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $374.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, partly reflecting a larger average balance sheet for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the prior year period, as a result of the full quarter as a combined company compared to only one month as a combined company for the prior year period, in addition to higher average yields on interest-earning assets. 

&#8226; Non-interest income was $50.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to $54.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease was driven by quarterly fluctuations in fair value adjustments and MSR hedging activity, which collectively resulted in a net fair value loss of $3.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to a net fair value gain of $8.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. This decline was partially offset by small increases in other categories, which were impacted by the full quarter as a combined company compared to only one month as a combined company for the prior year period.

&#8226; Non-interest expense was $287.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to $342.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease for the three months ended March 31, 2024 reflects a decrease in merger-related expenses of $111.4 million, partially offset by increases in amortization of intangible assets added in connection with the Merger and salaries and employee benefits, which were impacted by the full quarter as a combined company compared to only one month as a combined company for the prior year period. 

Comparison of current period end to prior year end 

&#8226; Total loans and leases were $37.6 billion as of March 31, 2024, an increase of $200.5 million, as compared to December 31, 2023. The increase in total loans and leases was primarily in the commercial real estate and commercial loan balances and was driven primarily by commercial line utilization and construction project activity in the quarter. Higher commercial real estate term balances reflect projects that transitioned from construction to permanent financing. 

&#160; 

&#8226; Total deposits were $41.7 billion as of March 31, 2024, an increase of $99.1 million, as compared to December 31, 2023. The increase was due to growth in money market accounts, time deposits, and interest-bearing demand deposits, partially offset by a decline in non-interest-bearing demand deposits. 

&#160; 

&#8226; Total consolidated assets were $52.2 billion as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Credit Quality 

&#8226; Non-performing assets increased to $143.8 million, or 0.28% of total assets, as of March 31, 2024, compared to $113.9 million, or 0.22% of total assets, as of December 31, 2023. Non-performing loans and leases were $142.0 million, or 0.38% of total loans and leases, as of March 31, 2024, compared to $112.9 million, or 0.30% of total loans and leases, as of December 31, 2023. The increase in non-performing assets during the quarter was driven primarily by migration in our SBA portfolio and an owner-occupied commercial real estate property. 

&#8226; The allowance for credit losses was $437.2 million as of March 31, 2024, a decrease of $26.9 million compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses was due to changes in the economic assumptions used in credit models and a recalibration of our CECL calculation for non-homogeneous commercial loans and leases and residential development loans. 

&#8226; The Company had a provision for credit losses of $17.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. This compares to a provision for credit losses of $54.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, and $105.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the prior quarter was mainly due to changes in the economic assumptions and recalibration of our CECL calculation for non-homogeneous commercial loans and leases and residential development loans. The three months ended March 31, 2023 included an $88.4 million initial provision for historical Columbia non-PCD loans related to the Merger. This initial provision, as well as changes in the economic assumptions used in credit models and a recalibration of our CECL calculation, as noted above, which contributed to the change when compared to the same period in the current year. 

Liquidity 

&#8226; Total cash and cash equivalents were $2.2 billion as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company manages its cash position as part of management's strategy to maintain a high-quality liquid asset position to support growth of deposit balances, fund growth in lending and investment portfolios, and deleverage non-deposit liabilities as economic conditions permit. 

&#8226; Including secured off-balance sheet lines of credit, total available liquidity was $18.6 billion as of March 31, 2024, representing 36% of total assets, 45% of total deposits, and 138% of uninsured deposits. 

Capital and Growth Initiatives 

&#8226; The Company's total risk-based capital ratio was 12.0% and its common equity tier 1 ("CET1") capital ratio was 9.8% as of March 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the Company's total risk-based capital ratio was 11.9% and its CET1 capital ratio was 9.6%.

&#8226; Columbia paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.36 per common share to shareholders on March 11, 2024. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Our critical accounting estimates are described in detail in the Critical Accounting Estimates section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024. The condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP and follow general practices within the financial services industry, in which the Company operates. This preparation requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions, and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, actual results could differ from the estimates, assumptions, and judgments reflected in the financial statements. Certain estimates inherently have a greater reliance on the use of assumptions and judgments and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Management believes that the estimates for ACL, business combinations, and goodwill are important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations and require difficult, subjective, or complex judgments. There have been no material changes in the methodology of these estimates during the three months ended March 31, 2024. 

Results of Operations 

Columbia's financial results for any periods ended prior to February 28, 2023, the Merger Date, reflect UHC results only on a standalone basis. Accordingly, Columbia's reported financial results for the first quarter of 2023 reflect only UHC financial results through the closing of the Merger. As a result of these two factors, Columbia's financial results for the first quarter of 2023 may not be directly comparable to prior or future reported periods. 

Comparison of current quarter to prior quarter 

The Company had net income of $124.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to net income of $93.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023. The increase in net income is mainly attributable to a decrease in non-interest expense and a decrease in provision for credit losses, partially offset by decreases in net interest income and non-interest income. The decrease of $49.7 million in non-interest expense is mainly due to a decrease in FDIC assessments, as a result of the FDIC special assessment of $32.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, as well as decreases in all categories as a result of lower discretionary spending and other expense items compared to expense items in the fourth quarter. The Company conducted an enterprise-wide evaluation of our operations during the first quarter of 2024, which resulted in consolidated positions, simplified reporting, and organizational structures. The changes are expected to be carried out in the second and third quarters of 2024 to achieve a core expense run rate for the fourth quarter of 2024 of $965 million to $985 million annualized. The expected core expense run rate excludes CDI amortization, merger-related expenses, exit and disposal costs, and the FDIC special assessment. 

The decrease of $37.8 million in provision for credit losses reflects changes in the economic assumptions used in credit models and a recalibration of our CECL calculation for non-homogeneous commercial loans and leases and residential development loans. The decrease of $30.3 million in net interest income is due to higher interest expense driven by higher average rates and balances in interest-bearing liabilities, in addition to a decrease in interest income, largely driven by lower income earned on investment securities given slower prepayment activity. The Company is actively managing and selectively reducing deposit offered rates. The decrease of $15.2 million in non-interest income was primarily driven by quarterly fluctuations in fair value adjustments and MSR hedging activity. 

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company had net income of $124.1 million, compared to net loss of $14.0 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in net income is mainly attributable to an increase in net interest income, a decrease in provision for credit losses, and a decrease in non-interest expense. The increase of $48.7 million in net interest income was due to higher loan interest income from increasing rates and higher average loan and lease balances, as well as the impact of purchase accounting accretion and amortization. These increases were partially offset by higher funding costs. 

The decrease of $88.4 million in provision for credit losses was driven primarily by the initial provision for historical Columbia non-PCD loans that was recorded in the first quarter of 2023. The decrease of $55.3 million in non-interest expense was due to a decrease in merger-related expenses of $111.4 million, partially offset by increases in amortization of intangible assets of $19.4 million and salaries and employee benefits of $18.5 million, which were impacted by the full quarter as a combined company for the current period compared to only one month as a combined company for the prior year period.

The following table presents the return on average assets (GAAP), average common shareholders' equity (GAAP), and average tangible common shareholders' equity (non-GAAP) for the periods indicated. For each period presented, the table includes the calculated ratios based on reported net income. To the extent return on average common shareholders' equity is used to compare our performance with other financial institutions that do not have merger and acquisition-related intangible assets, we believe it is beneficial to also consider the return on average tangible common shareholders' equity. This measure is useful for evaluating the performance of a business as it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization. Tangible common equity is also used as part of our incentive compensation program for our executive officers. The return on average tangible common shareholders' equity is calculated by dividing net income by average shareholders' common equity less average goodwill and other intangible assets, net (excluding MSR). The return on average tangible common shareholders' equity is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should be viewed in conjunction with the return on average common shareholders' equity.

Additionally, management believes tangible common equity and the tangible common equity ratio are meaningful measures of capital adequacy. Columbia believes the exclusion of certain intangible assets in the computation of tangible common equity and the tangible common equity ratio provides a meaningful base for period-to-period and company-to-company comparisons, which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results and capital of the Company. Tangible common equity is calculated as total shareholders' equity less goodwill and other intangible assets, net (excluding MSR). In addition, tangible assets are total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets, net (excluding MSR). The tangible common equity ratio is calculated as tangible common shareholders' equity divided by tangible assets. Tangible common equity and the tangible common equity ratio are considered non-GAAP financial measures and should be viewed in conjunction with total shareholders' equity and the total shareholders' equity ratio.

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not reviewed or audited. Although we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP. 

Net Interest Income 

Comparison of current quarter to prior quarter 

Net interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $423.4 million, a decrease of $30.3 million compared to the three months ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was driven by a $22.9 million increase in interest expense due to higher average rates and balances in interest-bearing liabilities, in addition to a $7.4 million decrease in interest income, largely driven by lower income earned on investment securities given slower prepayment activity. 

The net interest margin (net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets) on a fully tax-equivalent basis was 3.52% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to 3.78% for the three months ended December 31, 2023. The contraction in net interest margin was driven by higher average deposit costs, which increased at an accelerated pace through the fourth quarter and into January before stabilizing in the latter part of the first quarter. The yield on loans and leases for the three months ended March 31, 2024 remained flat compared to the three months ended December 31, 2023. 

The cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased by 23 basis points compared to the three months ended December 31, 2023, due to rising rates and product mix shift to higher cost money market and time deposits. This was partially offset by a lower cost for borrowings, as the Company was able to utilize the more favorable rates associated with the FRB BTFP. 

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

&#160; 

Net interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $423.4 million, an increase of $48.7 million compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase reflects a larger average balance sheet for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the prior year period as a result of the Merger, in addition to higher average yields on interest-earning assets, partially offset by higher rates on interest-bearing liabilities. 

Table of Contents 

The net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis was 3.52% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to 4.08% for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the prior year period was due to higher funding costs, deposit repricing, and a shift in product mix. 

The yield on loans and leases for the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased by 58 basis points as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily attributable to the rising interest rate environment and purchase accounting accretion and amortization related to the Merger. 

The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 143 basis points for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, due to a higher mix of higher-cost time deposits and term borrowings, as well as rising interest rates. Our net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in the yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds. 

The Federal Reserve increased the target range for the federal funds rate by 5.25% between March 2022 and July 2023, which marked the most recent increase to the federal funds rate. During that period, our net interest margin expanded as our asset sensitive balance sheet became increasingly profitable due to active rate increases by the Federal Reserve and the lagged impact to deposit pricing. Since the Federal Reserve ceased increasing the federal funds rate, we have experienced an increase in our funding costs that outpaces the increase in our earning asset yields as our deposits have continued to reprice higher and our funding base has experienced a shift toward higher-cost sources as Federal Reserve actions have reduced available liquidity within the banking industry. As a result, our net interest margin has contracted since July 2023 due to the impact of higher funding costs and minimal change to the average yield on earning assets.

Provision for Credit Losses 

&#160; 

Comparison of current quarter to prior quarter 

The Company had a $17.1 million provision for credit losses for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to a $54.9 million provision for the three months ended December 31, 2023. As an annualized percentage of average outstanding loans and leases, the provision for credit losses recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was 0.18%, as compared to 0.58% for the three months ended December 31, 2023. The change in provision for credit losses reflects changes in the economic assumptions and recalibration of our CECL calculation for non-homogeneous commercial loans and leases and residential development loans. During the first quarter, we recalibrated the commercial CECL model to be more reflective of the post-Merger loan portfolio after a full year operating as a combined organization. We believe the recalibrated model is more reflective of the quality of our underwriting and borrower profiles. 

Table of Contents 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, net charge-offs were $44.0 million, as compared to $28.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023. As an annualized percentage of average outstanding loans and leases, net charge-offs for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were 0.47%, as compared to 0.31% for the three months ended December 31, 2023. Net charge-offs in the FinPac portfolio were $23.8 million in the first quarter, largely unchanged from the fourth quarter, and net charge-offs were up $14.4 million in the commercial portfolio from the prior quarter, with the increase centered in a single commercial credit. 

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

The Company had a $17.1 million provision for credit losses for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to $105.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease is primarily driven by the $88.4 million initial provision for historical Columbia non-PCD loans that was recorded in the first quarter of 2023. As an annualized percentage of average outstanding loans and leases, the provision for credit losses recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was 0.18%, as compared to 1.43% for the three months ended March 31, 2023. 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, net charge-offs were $44.0 million, as compared to $16.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. As an annualized percentage of average outstanding loans and leases, net charge-offs for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were 0.47%, as compared to 0.23% for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Net charge-offs in the FinPac portfolio were $23.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to $16.4 million the three months ended March 31, 2023, largely in the trucking and transportation portfolio. Net charge-offs were up $18.9 million in the commercial portfolio from the three months ended March 31, 2023, with the increase centered in a single commercial credit. 

Typically, loans in a non-accrual status will not have an allowance for credit loss as they will be written down to their net realizable value or charged-off. However, the net realizable value for homogeneous leases and equipment finance agreements are determined by the loss given default calculated by the CECL model, and therefore homogeneous leases and equipment finance agreements on non-accrual will have an allowance for credit loss amount until they become 181 days past due, at which time they are charged-off. The non-accrual leases and equipment finance agreements of $30.6 million as of March 31, 2024 have a related allowance for credit losses of $26.8 million, with the remaining loans written-down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less estimated costs to sell, and are expected to be resolved with no additional material loss, absent further decline in market prices.

Table of Contents 

Comparison of current quarter to prior quarter 

Other income for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2023, decreased primarily due to interest rate fluctuations resulting in the current quarter including a loss on the fair value of certain loans held for investment of $2.4 million as compared to a gain of $19.4 million for the prior quarter, partially offset by a favorable change of $9.2 million in swap derivatives due to a gain in the current quarter compared to a loss in the prior quarter. These fair value adjustments, including the fair value loss on equity securities, are inversely influenced by the change in longer- term interest rates. 

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

Other income for the three months ended March 31, 2024 decreased as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily due to interest rate fluctuations resulting in a loss on the fair value of certain loans held for investment of $2.4 million in the current period as compared to a gain of $9.5 million in the prior year period. The decrease was partially offset by the impact of rate fluctuations on swap derivatives with a gain in the current period compared to a loss in the prior year period, resulting in a favorable change of $4.7 million. 

Non-Interest Expense

Comparison of current quarter to prior quarter 

FDIC assessments decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2023, due primarily to the fourth quarter of 2023 including $32.9 million in expense related to the FDIC special assessment to replenish the Deposit Insurance Fund following bank closures in 2023, partially offset by an additional $4.8 million in FDIC special assessment expense in the three months ended March 31, 2024. 

The remaining categories of non-interest expense decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2023, due primarily to the renewed focus on expense discipline and lower discretionary spending in order to support improved operating performance. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company conducted a comprehensive evaluation of our operations, resulting in streamlined roles, simplified reporting, and organizational restructuring. The Company anticipates severance and restructuring charges in the second and third quarters of 2024. 

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

Salaries and employee benefits increased for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily due to the current year including a full quarter of salaries and wages as a combined company, compared to only one month as a combined company for the same period in the prior year. 

Table of Contents 

FDIC assessments increased during the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, due primarily to the $4.8 million in expense related to the FDIC special assessment to replenish the Deposit Insurance Fund following bank closures in 2023. 

Intangible amortization increased during the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily due to the current year including a full quarter of amortization associated with the core deposit intangible asset added as a result of the Merger, compared to one month of amortization during the first quarter of 2023. 

Merger-related expenses decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, with the largest drivers of the decrease being lower legal and professional fees and personnel expenses related to the Merger. Columbia closed the Merger and completed the core systems conversion during the first quarter of 2023. 

Income Taxes 

The Company's effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was 26.6%, as compared to 26.4% and 25.8% for the three months ended December 31, 2023, and March 31, 2023, respectively. The effective tax rates differed from the statutory rate principally because of state taxes, non-deductible FDIC assessments, and income on tax-exempt investment securities.

Investment Securities 

&#160; 

Investment debt securities available for sale were $8.6 billion as of March 31, 2024, compared to $8.8 billion as of December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $122.7 million in fair value of investment securities available for sale, due to higher rates during the quarter, as well as sales and paydowns of $110.5 million.

We review investment securities on an ongoing basis for the presence of impairment, taking into consideration current market conditions, fair value in relationship to cost, extent and nature of the change in fair value, issuer rating changes and trends, whether we intend to sell a security or if it is likely that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost basis of the investment, which may be maturity, and other factors. 

&#160; 

As of March 31, 2024, the available for sale investment portfolio had a net unrealized loss of $555.6 million, which reflects gross unrealized losses of $567.9 million and gross unrealized gains of $12.3 million. Gross unrealized losses consisted primarily of unrealized losses on mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations of $456.8 million. The unrealized losses were attributable to changes in market interest rates or the widening of market spreads subsequent to the initial purchase of these securities and are not attributable to changes in credit quality. In the opinion of management, no ACL was considered necessary on these debt securities as of March 31, 2024. 

Loans and Leases 

&#160; 

Total loans and leases outstanding as of March 31, 2024 were $37.6 billion, an increase of $200.5 million as compared to December 31, 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to organic loan growth of $269.4 million, centered in commercial real estate and commercial portfolios. The increase in organic loan growth was partially offset by charge-offs of $49.8 million, due mainly to the FinPac portfolio as well as an increase due to a single credit in the commercial portfolio. The loan to deposit ratio was 90% as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Commercial Real Estate and Commercial Loans 

Commercial real estate and commercial loans are the largest classifications within earning assets, representing 41% and 20%, respectively, of average earning assets for both the three month periods ended March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The increase in commercial real estate and commercial loan balances between March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was driven by commercial line utilization and construction project activity in the quarter. Higher commercial real estate term balances reflect projects that transitioned from construction to permanent financing. 

Delinquency and non-accrual loan movements during the quarter reflect an anticipated move toward a normalized credit environment following a phase of exceptional high credit quality. The increase in non-performing assets during the quarter was driven primarily by deterioration in our SBA portfolio and an owner-occupied commercial real estate property. Non-performing assets during the quarter include $43.0 million in government guarantees on the commercial real estate, commercial, and residential portfolios. 

Commercial Real Estate Loans 

The commercial real estate portfolio includes loans to developers and institutional sponsors supporting income-producing or for-sale commercial real estate properties. We seek to mitigate our risk on these loans by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount and underwriting the loan with projected cash flow in excess of the debt service requirement. 

As of March 31, 2024, commercial real estate loans held in our loan portfolio were $19.6 billion, an increase of $176.7 million compared to December 31, 2023. Commercial real estate concentrations are managed with a goal of optimizing geographic and business diversity, primarily in our footprint. 

Loans secured by office properties represent approximately 8% of our total loan portfolio at March 31, 2024, with a breakout of 59% non-owner occupied, 39% owner occupied, and 2% construction loans. Excluding floating rate loans, which have already repriced to prevailing rates, only 8% of our office portfolio reprices through 2025. Office properties located in suburban markets secure the majority of our office portfolio as only 6% of non-owner occupied loans are located in downtown core business districts. 

Loans secured by multifamily properties, including construction, represent approximately 19% of the total loan portfolio. These assets continue to perform well due to demand for rental properties in our geographic footprint. Although management believes such concentrations have no more than the normal risk of collectability, a substantial decline in the economy in general, material increases in interest rates, changes in tax policies, tightening credit or refinancing markets, or a decline in real estate values in the Bank's primary geographic footprint in particular, could have an adverse impact on the repayment of these loans.

Commercial Loans 

Commercial loans are made to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs, equipment purchases, or other projects. We focus on borrowers doing business within our geographic markets. Commercial loans are generally underwritten individually and secured with the assets of the company and/or the personal guarantee of the business owners. Lease and equipment financing products are designed to address the diverse financing needs of small to large companies, primarily for the acquisition of equipment. As of March 31, 2024, commercial loans held in our loan portfolio were $9.7 billion, an increase of $46.4 million compared to December 31, 2023, which is mainly attributable to credit line utilization during the period. 

The leases and equipment finance portfolio represents approximately 18% of the commercial portfolio and 5% of the total loan portfolio. The leasing portfolio has non-performing leases and charge-offs centered in the trucking and transportation portion of the portfolio. Net charge-offs in the FinPac lease portfolio were $23.8 million in the first quarter, largely unchanged from the fourth quarter, and net charge-offs were up $14.4 million in the commercial portfolio from the prior quarter, with the increase centered in a single commercial credit. Delinquency and non-accrual loan movements in the transportation and trucking portfolio over the year were anticipated and a slow recovery is expected for this portfolio.

Residential Real Estate Loans 

Residential real estate loans represent mortgage loans and lines of credit to consumers for the purchase or refinance of a residence. As of March 31, 2024, residential real estate loans held in our loan portfolio were $8.1 billion, a decrease of $16.0 million as compared to December 31, 2023. 

Consumer Loans 

Consumer loans, including secured and unsecured personal loans, home equity and personal lines of credit, and motor vehicle loans, decreased $6.6 million to $189.2 million as of March 31, 2024, as compared to December 31, 2023.

(2) Includes government guaranteed portion of $11.7 million and $31.3 million for 90 days or greater and non-accrual loans, respectively, as of March 31, 2024. Includes government guaranteed portion of $12.3 million and $19.3 million for 90 days or greater and non-accrual loans, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. 

&#160; 

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were approximately $34.9 million or 0.09% of total loans, modified due to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. 

A decline in the economic conditions and other factors could adversely impact individual borrowers or the loan portfolio in general. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that loans will not become 90 days or more past due, placed on non-accrual status, restructured, or transferred to other real estate owned in the future. As of March 31, 2024, there was an increase in non-performing loans representative of a more normalized credit environment, driven by a migration in our SBA portfolio and an owner-occupied commercial real estate property.

Allowance for Credit Losses 

&#160; 

The ACL totaled $437.2 million as of March 31, 2024, a decrease of $26.9 million from December 31, 2023. The following table shows the activity in the ACL for the periods indicated:

The provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan and lease losses and the provision for unfunded commitments. The change in the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2023, reflects changes in the economic assumptions and recalibration of our CECL calculation for non-homogeneous commercial loans and leases and residential development loans. Net charge-offs in the FinPac portfolio were $23.8 million in the first quarter, largely unchanged from the fourth quarter, and net charge-offs were up $14.4 million in the commercial portfolio from the prior quarter, with the increase centered in a single commercial credit.

To calculate the ACL, the CECL models use a forecast of future economic conditions and are dependent upon specific macroeconomic variables that are relevant to each of the Bank's loan and lease portfolios. For the first quarter of 2024, the Bank used Moody's Analytics' February 2024 baseline economic forecast, which shows a worsening economic situation from the forecast used in the prior quarter. Refer to Note 5 - Allowance for Credit Losses for further information on key components of the forecast. The models for calculating the ACL are sensitive to changes to economic variables, which could result in volatility as these assumptions change over time. 

We believe that the ACL as of March 31, 2024 is sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio and in credit commitments outstanding as of that date based on the information available. If the economic conditions decline, the Bank may need additional provisions for credit losses in future periods. 

Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights

3,117 (6,251) Balance, end of period $ 110,444 $ 109,243 

(1) The changes in valuation inputs and assumptions principally reflect changes in discount rates and prepayment speeds, which are primarily affected by changes in interest rates. 

Table of Contents 

The following table presents information related to our residential serviced loan portfolio as of the dates presented: 

(dollars in thousands) March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 Balance of loans serviced for others $ 8,081,039 $ 8,175,664 MSR as a percentage of serviced loans 1.37 % 1.34 % 

Residential MSR are adjusted to fair value quarterly with the change recorded in residential mortgage banking revenue on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The value of servicing rights can fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and other factors. Generally, as interest rates decline and borrowers are able to take advantage of a refinance incentive, prepayments increase, and the total value of existing servicing rights declines as expectations of future servicing fee collections decline. Historically, the fair value of our residential MSR will increase as market rates for mortgage loans rise and decrease if market rates fall. 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $1.0 billion in goodwill, which was recorded as a result of the Merger. Goodwill is recorded in connection with business combinations and represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired. 

As of March 31, 2024, we had other intangible assets of $571.6 million, as compared to $603.7 million at December 31, 2023. As part of a business acquisition, the fair value of identifiable intangible assets such as core deposits, which includes all deposits except certificates of deposit, was recognized at the Merger Date. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized to their estimated residual values over their respective estimated useful lives. The core deposit intangible assets recorded are amortized on an accelerated basis over a period of 10 years using the sum-of-the-years-digits method. Intangible assets are evaluated for impairment if events and circumstances indicate a possible impairment. No impairment losses have been recognized in the periods presented. 

Deposits 

Total deposits were $41.7 billion as of March 31, 2024, an increase of $99.1 million as compared to December 31, 2023. The increase was due to growth in money market, time deposits, and interest-bearing demand accounts, partially offset by a decline in non-interest-bearing demand deposits. The interest-bearing deposit mix increased mainly due to a migration from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing accounts as customers seek higher rates in the current interest rate environment. 

&#160; 

The following table presents the deposit balances by category as of the dates presented: 

March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 &#160;(dollars in thousands) Amount % Amount % Non-interest-bearing demand $ 13,808,554 34 % $ 14,256,452 34 % Interest-bearing demand 8,095,211 19 % 8,044,432 19 % Money market 10,822,498 26 % 10,324,454 25 % Savings 2,640,060 6 % 2,754,113 7 % Time, greater than $250,000 1,179,498 3 % 1,034,094 2 % Time, $250,000 or less 5,160,339 12 % 5,193,475 13 % Total deposits $ 41,706,160 100 % $ 41,607,020 100 % 

&#160; 

The Company's total core deposits, which are deposits less time deposits greater than $250,000 and all brokered deposits, were $37.4 billion as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company's brokered deposits totaled $3.1 billion as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Table of Contents 

The FDIC generally insures up to $250,000 per depositor for each account ownership category, as defined by the FDIC. Depositors may qualify for coverage of accounts over $250,000 if they have funds in different ownership categories and all applicable FDIC requirements are met. All deposits that an account owner has in the same ownership category at the same bank are added together and insured up to the standard insurance amount. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately $28.2 billion and $28.1 billion, respectively, of the Bank&#8217;s deposits were estimated to be insured. Uninsured deposits are an estimated amount based on the methodologies and assumptions used for the Bank's regulatory requirements. Uninsured deposits were $13.5 billion as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As of March 31, 2024, total available liquidity was $18.6 billion, or 138% of uninsured deposits. 

Borrowings 

&#160; 

As of March 31, 2024, the Bank had outstanding securities sold under agreements to repurchase of $213.6 million, a decrease of $38.5 million from December 31, 2023. The Bank had outstanding borrowings consisting of advances from the FHLB and FRB of $3.9 billion as of March 31, 2024 and $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2023. The decrease compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 was primarily due to repayment of higher priced borrowings as well as general liquidity management. FHLB advances have fixed rates ranging from 5.1% to 5.25% with the majority set to mature before the end of the first quarter of 2025. Advances from the FHLB are secured by investment securities and loans secured by real estate. The FRB borrowings have interest rates ranging from 4.76% to 4.93% and mature within one year of March 31, 2024, although the Company has the ability to repay balances prior to maturity without penalty. The FRB borrowings are secured by investment securities. 

Junior and Other Subordinated Debentures 

&#160; 

We had junior and other subordinated debentures with carrying values of $417.4 million and $424.3 million as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease is mainly due to a decrease of $6.5 million in fair value for the junior subordinated debentures elected to be carried at fair value. The change in fair value was due to an increase in the credit spread and spot curve, partially offset by an increase in the implied forward curve. As of March 31, 2024, substantially all of the junior subordinated debentures had interest rates that are adjustable on a quarterly basis based on a spread over three-month term SOFR. 

Liquidity and Cash Flow 

&#160; 

The principal objective of our liquidity management program is to maintain the Bank's ability to meet the day-to-day cash flow requirements of our customers who either wish to withdraw funds or to draw upon credit facilities to meet their cash needs. The Bank's liquidity strategy includes maintaining sufficient on-balance sheet liquidity to support growth of deposit balances, fund growth in lending and investment portfolios, and deleverage non-deposit liabilities as economic conditions permit. As a result, the Company believes that it has sufficient cash and access to borrowings to effectively manage through the current economic conditions, as well as meet its working capital and other needs. The Company will continue to prudently evaluate and maintain liquidity sources, including the ability to fund future loan growth and manage our borrowing sources. 

We monitor the sources and uses of funds daily to maintain an acceptable liquidity position. One source of funds includes public deposits. Individual state laws require banks to collateralize public deposits, typically as a percentage of their public deposit balance in excess of FDIC insurance. Public deposits represented 7% of total deposits at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The amount of collateral required varies by state and may also vary by institution within each state, depending on the individual state's risk assessment of depository institutions. Changes in the pledging requirements for uninsured public deposits may require pledging additional collateral to secure these deposits, drawing on other sources of funds to finance the purchase of assets that would be available to be pledged to satisfy a pledging requirement, or could lead to the withdrawal of certain public deposits from the Bank. 

The Company&#8217;s diversified deposit base provides a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funding, while reducing the Company&#8217;s reliance on the wholesale markets. Total deposits were $41.7 billion as of March 31, 2024, compared with $41.6 billion at December 31, 2023. The Bank also has liquidity from excess bond collateral of $3.7 billion. 

In addition to liquidity from core deposits and the repayments and maturities of loans and investment securities, the Bank can sell securities under agreements to repurchase, issue brokered certificates of deposit, or utilize off-balance sheet funding sources. 

Table of Contents 

The Bank maintains a substantial level of total available liquidity in the form of off-balance sheet funding sources. These liquidity sources include capacity to borrow from uncommitted lines of credit, advances from the FHLB, and the Federal Reserve Bank&#8217;s Discount Window. Availability of the uncommitted lines of credit is subject to federal funds balances available for loan and continued borrower eligibility. These lines are intended to support short-term liquidity needs, and the agreements may restrict consecutive day usage.

&#160; 

The Company is a separate entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. Substantially all of the Company's revenues are obtained from dividends declared and paid by the Bank. There were $90.0 million of dividends paid by the Bank to the Company in the three months ended March 31, 2024. There are statutory and regulatory provisions that limit the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company. FDIC and Oregon Division of Financial Regulation approval is required for quarterly dividends from the Bank to the Company. 

Although we expect the Bank's and the Company's liquidity positions to remain satisfactory during 2024, it is possible that our deposit balances may not be maintained at previous levels due to pricing pressure or customers' behavior in the current economic environment. In addition, in order to generate deposit growth, our pricing may need to be adjusted in a manner that results in increased interest expense on deposits. We may utilize borrowings or other funding sources, which are generally more costly than deposit funding, to support our liquidity levels. 

Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations- The Company participates in many different contractual arrangements which may or may not be recorded on its balance sheet, under which the Company has an obligation to pay certain amounts, provide credit or liquidity enhancements or provide market risk support. Our material contractual obligations are primarily for time deposits and borrowings. As of March 31, 2024, time deposits totaled $6.3 billion, of which $6.1 billion mature in a year or less. Total borrowings as of March 31, 2024 were $3.9 billion all of which mature within one year. These arrangements also include off-balance sheet commitments to extend credit, letters of credit and various forms of guarantees. As of March 31, 2024, our loan commitments were $11.2 billion. A portion of the commitments will eventually result in funded loans and increase our profitability through net interest income when drawn and unused commitment fees prior to being drawn. Refer to Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies for further information. Financing commitments, letters of credit and deferred purchase commitments are presented at contractual amounts and do not necessarily reflect future cash outflows as many are expected to expire unused or partially used.

Capital Resources 

&#160; 

Shareholders' equity as of March 31, 2024 was $5.0 billion, down slightly from December 31, 2023. The decrease of $37.8 million in shareholders' equity during the three months ended March 31, 2024 was principally due to other comprehensive losses of $86.0 million and cash dividends paid of $75.5 million, partially offset by net income of $124.1 million during the period. 

The Company's dividend policy considers, among other things, earnings, regulatory capital levels, the overall payout ratio and expected asset growth to determine the amount of dividends declared, if any, on a quarterly basis. There is no assurance that future cash dividends on common shares will be declared or increased. We cannot predict the extent of the economic decline that could result in inadequate earnings, regulatory restrictions and limitations, changes to our capital requirements, or a decision to increase capital by retention of earnings, that may result in the inability to pay dividends at previous levels, or at all. 

On February 9, 2024, Columbia declared a cash dividend in the amount of $0.36 per common share based on fourth quarter 2023 performance, which was paid on March 11, 2024.

The Company is committed to managing capital to maintain strong protection for depositors and creditors and for maximum shareholder benefit. The Company also manages its capital to exceed regulatory capital requirements for banking organizations. The regulatory capital requirements effective for the Company follow Basel III, with the Company being subject to calculating its capital adequacy as a percentage of risk-weighted assets under the standardized approach. 

In 2020, the federal bank regulatory authorities finalized a rule to provide banking organizations that implemented CECL in 2020 the option to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital by up to two years, with a three-year transition period to phase out the cumulative benefit to regulatory capital provided during the two-year delay. The Company elected this capital relief to delay the estimated regulatory capital impact of adopting CECL, relative to the incurred loss methodology's effect on regulatory capital. Currently, the Company is phasing out the cumulative adjustment as calculated at the end of 2021, by adjusting it by 75% in 2022, 50% through 2023, and 25% in 2024, culminating with a fully phased in regulatory capital calculation beginning in 2025. All regulatory ratios exceeded regulatory &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; requirements.
