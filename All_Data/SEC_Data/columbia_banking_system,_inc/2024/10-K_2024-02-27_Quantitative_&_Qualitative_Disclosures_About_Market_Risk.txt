 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

&#160; 

Market risk management is an integral part of our risk culture. Our Enterprise Risk Management group is a risk management function that partners with the line of business to identify, measure, and monitor market risks throughout the company. It ensures transparency of significant market risks, monitoring compliance with Board established risk appetite limits and escalates limit exceptions to appropriate executive management and the Board. The various business units are responsible for identification, acceptance, and ownership of the risks and for ensuring that market risk exposures are well-managed and prudent. Market risk is monitored through various measures, such as simulations, and through routine stress testing, sensitivity, and scenario analysis. 

Market risk is the risk that movements in market risk factors, including interest rates, credit spreads and volatilities will reduce our income and the value of our portfolios. These factors influence prospective yields, values, or prices associated with the instrument. Our market risk arises primarily from credit risk and interest rate risk inherent in our investment, lending, and financing activities. 

To manage our credit risk, we rely on various controls, including our underwriting standards and loan policies, internal loan monitoring, and periodic credit reviews, as well as our ACL methodology. Additionally, the Company's Enterprise Risk Management Committee provides board oversight over the Company's loan portfolio risk management functions, and the Audit Committee provides board oversight of the ACL process and reviews and approves the ACL methodology. The Company's Board provides oversight over the Company's investment portfolio and hedging risk management functions. 

Interest rate risk is the potential for loss resulting from adverse changes in the level of interest rates on the Company's net interest income. The absolute level and volatility of interest rates can have a significant impact on our profitability. The objective of interest rate risk management is to identify and manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changing interest rates to achieve our overall financial objectives. We manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through actions that are established by the Asset/Liability Management Committee. The ALCO meets monthly and has responsibility for developing asset/liability management policy, formulating and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and earnings, and reviewing interest rate sensitivity. The Company's Board provides oversight of the asset/liability management process, reviews the results of the interest rate risk analyses prepared for the ALCO, and approves the asset/liability policy on an annual basis. 

We measure our interest rate risk position monthly. The primary tools we use to measure our interest rate risk are net interest income simulation analyses and economic value of equity (fair value of financial instruments) modeling. The results of these analyses are reviewed by the ALCO monthly. If hypothetical changes to interest rates cause changes to our simulated net interest income simulation or economic value of equity modeling outside of our pre-established internal limits, we may adjust the asset and liability size or mix in an effort to bring our interest rate risk exposure within our established limits. 

Net Interest Income Simulation 

Interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of our interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. These repricing characteristics are the time frames within which the interest-bearing assets and liabilities are subject to change in interest rates either at replacement, repricing, or maturity during the life of the instruments. Interest rate sensitivity management focuses on the maturity structure of assets and liabilities and their repricing characteristics during periods of changes in market interest rates. 

An interest rate simulation model is used to estimate the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates. This model has inherent limitations, and these results are predicated on assumptions for interest rates, loan and investment pricing, loan and investment prepayments, deposit decay and deposit rate movements. Our primary analysis assumes a static balance sheet, both in terms of the total size and mix of our balance sheet, meaning cash flows from the maturity or repricing of assets and liabilities are redeployed in the same instrument at modeled rates. We employ estimates based upon assumptions for each scenario, including changes in the size or mix of the balance sheet, new volume rates for new balances, the rate of prepayments, and the correlation of pricing to changes in the interest rate environment. For example, for interest-bearing deposit balances we utilize a repricing "beta" assumption, which is an estimate for the change in interest-bearing deposit costs given a change in the short-term market interest rates. 

Our simulation beta estimates in both rising and falling rate environments are generally consistent with cumulative betas utilized in the current rising rate cycle. The following table shows the beta realized in the current rising rate market cycle.

Loan repricing characteristics are a significant component of interest rate sensitivity. Variable and adjustable-rate loans may or may not contain a rate floor, which impacts the sensitivity of the instrument based on repricing timing and the magnitude of the change in interest rate. The following tables show certain pricing characteristics including rate type, maturity, and floor detail of the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2023:

(3) Loans were grouped into three buckets: (1) No Floor: no contractual floor on the loan; (2) At Floor: current rate = floor; (3) Above Floor: current rate exceeds floor. The amount above the floor was based on the current margin plus the current index assuming the loan repriced on December 31, 2023. The adjustable loans may not reprice until well into the future, depending on the timing and size of interest rate changes. 

Changes that could vary significantly from our assumptions include loan and deposit growth or contraction, changes in the mix of our earning assets or funding sources, and future asset/liability management decisions, all of which may have significant effects on our net interest income. Also, some of the assumptions made in the simulation model may not materialize and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur. In addition, the simulation model does not take into account actions management could undertake to mitigate the impact a change in interest rates may have on our credit risk profile, loan prepayment estimates and spread relationships, which can change regularly. Actions we could undertake include, but are not limited to, growing or contracting the balance sheet, changing the composition of the balance sheet, or changing our pricing strategies for loans or deposits. 

The estimated impact on our net interest income over a time horizon of one year as of December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 are indicated in the table below. For the scenarios shown, the interest rate simulation assumes a parallel and sustained shift in market interest rates ratably over a twelve-month period and no change in the composition or size of the balance sheet. For example, the "up 200 basis points" scenario is based on a theoretical increase in market rates of 16.7 basis points per month for twelve months applied to the balance sheet of December 31 for each respective year.

##TABLE_START As of December 31, 

2023 2022 2021 Up 300 basis points (2.1) % 1.7 % 9.7 % Up 200 basis points (1.4) % 1.1 % 6.3 % Up 100 basis points (0.7) % 0.6 % 3.0 % Down 100 basis points 0.6 % (2.4) % (1.2) % Down 200 basis points 1.1 % (5.1) % (2.4) % Down 300 basis points 1.6 % (7.8) % (3.1) % ##TABLE_END

Our interest rate risk sensitivity at December 31, 2023 is minimal. Our projections indicate that in rising and falling interest rate environments the Company's net interest income would decrease or increase by a very modest amount. In 2021 and 2022, we were "asset-sensitive" meaning we expected our net interest income to increase as market rates increased and to decrease as market rates decreased. The change in sensitivity as of December 31, 2023, from the prior year was due to the impact of increasing interest rates resulting from Federal Reserve monetary policy and changes in funding and asset mixes. The mix shift of deposits from non-interest-bearing deposits to higher beta funding sources was a significant contributor of the change. 

It should be noted that prior to 2022, although net interest income simulation results are presented for down rate scenarios, most market rates would have reached zero before declining the full 100 basis points, and our simulation floors rates at zero and assumes they do not go negative. 

Interest rate sensitivity in the first year of the net interest income simulation for increasing interest rate scenarios is negatively impacted by the cost of non-maturity deposits repricing immediately while interest earnings assets (primarily the loan and leases held for investment portfolio) reprice at a slower rate based upon the instrument repricing characteristics. As a result, interest sensitivity in increasing interest rates scenarios improves in subsequent years as these assets reprice. Conversely, in a declining interest scenario, net interest income is negatively impacted by assets repricing lower. Deposit products reprice lower but certain low interest rate products remain at or hit their floors during the forecast horizon. 

Management also prepares and reviews the long-term trends of the net interest income simulation to measure and monitor risk. This analysis assumes the same rate shift over the first year of the scenario as described above and holding steady thereafter. The estimated impact on our net interest income over the first and second-year time horizons as it relates to our balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 is indicated in the table below. 

Interest Rate Simulation Impact on Net Interest Income 

##TABLE_START As of December 31, 2023 Year 1 Year 2 Up 300 basis points (2.1) % (1.9) % Up 200 basis points (1.4) % (1.1) % Up 100 basis points (0.7) % (0.5) % Down 100 basis points 0.6 % 0.1 % Down 200 basis points 1.1 % (0.2) % Down 300 basis points 1.6 % (0.8) % ##TABLE_END

In general, we view the net interest income model results as more relevant to the Company's current operating profile (a going concern), and we primarily manage our balance sheet based on this information. 

Economic Value of Equity 

Another interest rate sensitivity measure we utilize is the quantification of economic value changes for all financial assets and liabilities, given an increase or decrease in market interest rates. This approach provides a longer-term view of interest rate risk, capturing all future expected cash flows. Assets and liabilities with option characteristics are measured based on different interest rate path valuations using statistical rate simulation techniques. The projections are by their nature forward-looking and therefore inherently uncertain and include various assumptions regarding cash flows and discount rates. 

The table below illustrates the effects of various instantaneous market interest rate changes on the fair values of financial assets and liabilities compared to the corresponding carrying values and fair values: 

Interest Rate Simulation Impact on Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities 

##TABLE_START As of December 31, 2023 2022 Up 300 basis points (21.9) % (14.0) % Up 200 basis points (14.6) % (9.4) % Up 100 basis points (7.1) % (4.4) % Down 100 basis points 6.8 % 0.9 % Down 200 basis points 12.0 % 0.1 % Down 300 basis points 15.1 % (2.5) % ##TABLE_END

As of December 31, 2023, our economic value of equity analysis indicates a liability sensitive profile. This suggests a sudden or sustained increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in our estimated economic value of equity, as the decrease in value of our interest earning assets exceeds the economic value change of interest-bearing liabilities. In declining interest rate scenarios, our economic value of equity increases. This occurs as the increase in value of interest earning assets exceeds the decline in economic value of interest-bearing liabilities, including the core deposit intangible. Our overall sensitivity to changes in market interest rates shifted from the prior year, primarily due to the relative level of market interest rates and changes in asset and funding mix during the year. As of December 31, 2023, our estimated economic value of equity (fair value of financial assets and liabilities) was above our book value of equity primarily due to an increase in the economic value core deposit intangible.
