CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Management has identified the accounting policies related to the ACL, business combinations and the valuation and recoverability of goodwill as critical to an understanding of our financial statements. These policies and related estimates are discussed in &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; under the headings &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses,&#8221; &#8220;Business Combinations&#8221; and &#8220;Valuation and Recoverability of Goodwill&#8221; in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have not been any material changes in our critical accounting policies as compared to those disclosed in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Our results of operations are dependent to a large degree on our net interest income. We also generate noninterest income from our broad range of products and services including treasury management, wealth management and debit and credit cards. Our operating expenses consist primarily of compensation and employee benefits, occupancy, data processing and software and legal and professional fees. Like most financial institutions, our interest income and cost of funds are affected significantly by general economic conditions, particularly changes in market interest rates, and by government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. 

Earnings Summary 

Comparison of current quarter to prior year period 

The Company reported net income for the third quarter of $53.0 million or $0.74 per diluted common share, compared to $44.7 million or $0.63 per diluted common share for the third quarter of 2020. Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2021 was $132.5 million, an increase of $7.8 million from the prior year period. The increase was primarily a result of an increase in interest income from securities. 

The company recorded no provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2021 compared to a provision of $7.4 million for the third quarter of 2020. The decrease in provision expense for the third quarter of 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020 was principally the result of an improved economic forecast as the economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Noninterest income for the current quarter was $24.0 million, an increase of $1.5 million from the prior year period. The increase was largely due to a gain on the sale of our health savings accounts to a third party in addition to higher card revenue and financial services and trust revenue, partially offset by a decrease in mortgage banking revenue. 

Total noninterest expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2021 was $90.0 million, an increase of $4.9 million from the prior year period. This increase was primarily driven by higher legal and professional fees and data processing and software expense.

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

The Company reported net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 of $159.9 million or $2.24 per diluted common share, compared to $95.9 million or $1.35 per diluted common share for the same period in 2020. Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was $382.0 million, an increase of $13.0 million from the prior year period. The increase was primarily a result of an increase in interest income from securities and a reduction in interest expense on FHLB advances and deposits, partially offset by a decline in interest income from loans. 

The provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was a recapture of $6.3 million compared to a provision of $82.4 million for the first nine months of 2020. The decrease in the provision for the first nine months of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 was due to an improved economic forecast as the economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, which had its onset during the prior year-to-date period. 

Noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was $69.9 million, a decrease of $11.1 million from the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to the prior year period including a $16.4 million gain from the sale and upward adjustment to the carrying value of the Visa Class B restricted shares to the market price, partially offset by increases in card revenue and financial services and trust revenue. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, noninterest expense was $257.7 million, an increase of $7.5 million from $250.2 million for the same period in 2020. The increase from the prior year period was most attributable to increases in compensation and employee benefits expenses and legal and professional fees.

Comparison of current quarter to prior year period 

Net interest income for the third quarter of 2021 was $132.5 million, up from $124.7 million for the same quarter in 2020. The increase was mainly due to an increase in interest income from securities due to higher average balances. 

The Company&#8217;s net interest margin (tax equivalent) decreased to 3.17% in the third quarter of 2021, from 3.47% for the prior year period. This decrease was driven by lower average rates on securities and a higher ratio of taxable securities to our overall interest-earning assets, which was partially offset by higher loan yields, impacted by accelerated fee recognition due to substantial PPP loan forgiveness and payoffs. The Company&#8217;s operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) 1 decreased to 3.16% from 3.46% during the third quarter of 2020. The decrease was due to the items previously noted for the decrease in the net interest margin. 

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was $382.0 million, compared to $369.0 million for the prior year period. The increase was mainly due to an increase in interest income from securities and a reduction in interest expense on FHLB advances and deposits, partially offset by a decrease in interest income for loans. The increase in interest income from securities was due to higher average balances. The decrease in interest expense was due to lower average balances of FHLB advances and lower rates on deposits. The decline in interest income from loans was mainly due to lower average rates. 

1 Operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the &#8220;Non-GAAP financial measures&#8221; section in this Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Table of Contents 

The Company&#8217;s net interest margin (tax equivalent) decreased to 3.21% for the first nine months of 2021, from 3.69% for the prior year period. The decrease in the Company&#8217;s net interest margin (tax equivalent) was driven by lower average rates on loans and securities as well as a higher ratio of taxable securities to our overall earning assets. The Company&#8217;s operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) 2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was 3.20% compared to 3.69% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The decrease was due to the items previously noted for the decrease in the net interest margin. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

Comparison of current quarter to prior year period 

During the third quarter of 2021, the Company recorded no net provision for credit losses compared to a $7.4 million net provision during the third quarter of 2020. This was principally the result of an improved economic forecast as the economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The net provision recapture for credit losses recorded during the current quarter also reflected management&#8217;s ongoing assessment of the credit quality of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio. Other factors affecting the provision include net charge-offs, credit quality migration, and the size and composition of the loan portfolio and changes in the economic environment during the third quarter of 2021. The amount of provision was calculated in accordance with the Company&#8217;s methodology for determining the ACL, discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 1. Financial Statements (unaudited)&#8221; of this report. 

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

The provision recapture for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was $6.3 million compared to a net provision of $82.4 million during the same period in 2020. The decrease in the provision for the first nine months of 2021 was due to the same factors discussed above for the quarterly provision for credit losses and the prior year provision was driven by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The amount of provision was calculated in accordance with the Company&#8217;s methodology for determining the ACL, discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 1. Financial Statements (unaudited)&#8221; of this report.

Comparison of current quarter to prior year period 

Noninterest income was $24.0 million for the third quarter of 2021, compared to $22.5 million for the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $750 thousand gain related to the sale of our health savings accounts to a third party which was recorded to other noninterest income, as well as higher card revenue and financial services revenue partially offset by a decrease in mortgage banking due to a decrease in the mortgage pipeline and total volume of funded loans.

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, noninterest income was $69.9 million compared to $80.9 million for the same period in 2020, a decrease of $11.1 million. The decrease was principally due to the sale of 17,360 shares of Visa Class B restricted stock during the second quarter of 2020 for a gain of $3.0 million, which resulted in an observable market price. As a result, the Company wrote up its remaining 77,683 Visa Class B restricted shares to fair value resulting in a gain of $13.4 million, for a total gain of $16.4 million. Based on the existing transfer restriction and uncertainty regarding the outcome of Visa&#8217;s litigation that must be settled before the Visa Class B restricted shares may be converted into publicly traded Visa Class A common shares, the shares were previously carried at a zero-cost basis. This decrease was offset by increases in card revenue and financial services and trust revenue.

(1) The Company completed the acquisition of Bank of Commerce on October 1, 2021. See Note 16 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 1. Financial Statements (unaudited)&#8221; of this report for further information regarding this transaction. 

Comparison of current quarter to prior year period 

Noninterest expense was $90.0 million for the third quarter of 2021, an increase of $4.9 million from $85.1 million for the prior year period. This increase was mostly attributable to increases in legal and professional fees and data processing and software expense. The increase in legal and professional fees was due to the acquisition-related professional services associated with our acquisition of Bank of Commerce. With this acquisition there is an expectation of elevated acquisition-related expenses for the next several quarters. 

Table of Contents 

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, noninterest expense was $257.7 million, compared to $250.2 million for the same period in 2020, an increase of $7.5 million. The increase from the prior year period was mostly attributable to increases in compensation and employee benefits expense and legal and professional fees. The largest increases in compensation and employee benefits were stock compensation, incentives and commissions while the increase in legal and professional fees was the result of acquisition-related professional fees associated with our acquisition of Bank of Commerce. 

The provision for unfunded loan commitments for the periods indicated are as follows: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 (in thousands) Provision for unfunded loan commitments $ 500 $ 800 $ 2,200 $ 4,600 

Income Taxes 

We recorded an income tax provision of $13.5 million for the third quarter of 2021, compared to a provision of $9.9 million for the same period in 2020, with effective tax rates of 20% and 18% for the third quarter of 2021 and 2020, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, we recorded income tax provisions of $40.6 million and $21.4 million, respectively, with effective tax rates of 20% for the current year and 18% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate remains lower than the statutory tax rate due to tax-exempt income from municipal securities, BOLI and certain loan receivables. For additional information, please refer to the Company&#8217;s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION 

Total assets were $18.60 billion at September 30, 2021, an increase of $2.02 billion from December 31, 2020. Cash and cash equivalents increased $243.7 million. Loans increased $93.7 million during the first nine months of 2021, which was primarily the result of new loan production partially offset by loan payments and a decrease in line utilization. Debt securities available for sale were $4.83 billion at September 30, 2021, a decrease of $378.2 million from December 31, 2020 which was due to maturities and repayments and the Company transferring securities with a fair value of $2.01 billion from the available for sale classification to the held to maturity classification, partially offset by purchases. Total liabilities were $16.28 billion as of September 30, 2021, an increase of $2.04 billion from December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in demand and other noninterest-bearing deposits supported by PPP loan funds being deposited into our clients&#8217; deposit accounts at the Bank, stimulus funds being distributed by the federal government and reduced expenditures by consumers and business clients. 

Investment Securities 

At September 30, 2021, the Company&#8217;s investment portfolio primarily consisted of debt securities available for sale totaling $4.83 billion compared to $5.21 billion at December 31, 2020 and debt securities held to maturity of $2.08 billion at September 30, 2021. The decrease in the debt securities available for sale from year-end is due to a transfer of securities with a fair value of $2.01 billion from the available for sale classification to the held to maturity classification, $2.41 billion in purchases, partially offset by $612.9 million in maturities, repayments and sales, a $134.2 million decline in unrealized gains and $27.6 million in premium amortization. The increase in debt securities held to maturity from year-end is due to the $2.01 billion transfer of securities into the held to maturity classification and purchases of $112.4 million, partially offset by $42.7 million in premium amortization and a $6.7 million decrease in unrealized gains. The average duration of our debt securities available for sale was approximately 4 years and 9 months at September 30, 2021. The average duration of our debt securities held to maturity was approximately 5 years and 7 months at September 30, 2021. These durations take into account calls, where appropriate, and consensus prepayment speeds. 

The investment securities are used by the Company as a component of its balance sheet management strategies. From time-to-time, securities may be sold to reposition the portfolio in response to strategies developed by the Company&#8217;s asset liability management committee. In accordance with our investment strategy, management monitors market conditions with a view to realize gains on its available for sale securities portfolio when prudent. 

Table of Contents 

The Company performs a quarterly assessment to determine whether a decline in fair value below amortized cost exists. Amortized cost includes adjustments made to the cost of an investment for accretion, amortization, collection of cash and previous credit losses recognized in earnings. 

When the fair value of an available for sale debt security falls below the amortized cost basis, it is evaluated to determine if any of the decline in value is attributable to credit loss. Decreases in fair value attributable to credit loss would be recorded directly to earnings with a corresponding allowance for credit losses, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. If the credit quality subsequently improves, the allowance would be reversed up to a maximum of the previously recorded credit losses. If the Company intends to sell an impaired available for sale debt security, or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security prior to recovering the amortized cost basis, the entire fair value adjustment would be immediately recognized in earnings with no corresponding allowance for credit losses. 

At September 30, 2021, the market value of debt securities available for sale had a net unrealized gain of $58.2 million compared to a net unrealized gain of $212.6 million at December 31, 2020. The change in valuation was the result of fluctuations in market interest rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2021, in addition to there being less securities classified as available for sale at September 30, 2021 than December 31, 2020 as a result of the aforementioned transfer to the held to maturity classification. At September 30, 2021, the Company had $2.56 billion of debt securities available for sale with gross unrealized losses of $30.2 million; however, we did not consider these investment securities to have an indicated credit loss. 

All of the Company&#8217;s debt securities held to maturity were issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. These securities carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government, are widely recognized as &#8220;risk free,&#8221; and have a long history of zero credit loss. Therefore, the Company did not record an allowance for credit losses for these securities as of September 30, 2021. 

The following table sets forth our securities portfolio by type for the dates indicated: 

September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 (in thousands) Debt securities available for sale: U.S. government agency and government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations $ 3,378,861 $ 3,814,387 Other asset-backed securities 415,909 357,479 State and municipal securities 781,173 753,572 U.S. government agency and government-sponsored enterprise securities 255,976 284,696 Total debt securities available for sale, at fair value $ 4,831,919 $ 5,210,134 Debt securities held to maturity: U.S. government agency and government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations $ 2,075,158 $ &#8212; Total debt securities held to maturity, at amortized cost $ 2,075,158 $ &#8212; Equity securities 13,425 13,425 Total investment securities $ 6,920,502 $ 5,223,559

Credit Risk Management 

The extension of credit in the form of loans or other credit substitutes to individuals and businesses is one of our principal business activities. Our policies, as well as applicable laws, and regulations, require risk analysis as well as ongoing portfolio and credit management. We manage our credit risk through lending limit constraints, credit review, approval policies, and extensive, ongoing internal monitoring. We also manage credit risk through diversification of the loan portfolio by type of loan, type of industry and type of borrower and by limiting the aggregation of debt to a single borrower. 

In analyzing our existing portfolio, we review our consumer and residential loan portfolios by their performance as a pool of loans, since no single loan is individually significant or judged by its risk rating, size or potential risk of loss. In contrast, the monitoring process for the commercial business, real estate construction, and commercial real estate portfolios includes periodic reviews of individual loans with risk ratings assigned to each loan and performance judged on a loan-by-loan basis. 

Table of Contents 

We review these loans to assess the ability of our borrowers to service all interest and principal obligations and, as a result, the risk rating may be adjusted accordingly. In the event that full collection of principal and interest is not reasonably assured, the loan is appropriately downgraded and, if warranted, placed on nonaccrual status even though the loan may be current as to principal and interest payments. Additionally, we assess whether an individually measured allowance is required for collateral dependent nonaccrual loans with balances equal to or greater than $500,000 and with respect to which foreclosure is probable. For the individually measured collateral dependent nonaccrual loan, the allowance for credit losses is equal to the difference between amortized cost of the loan and the determined value of the collateral. However, if the determined value of the collateral is greater than the amortized cost of the loan, no allowance for credit losses will be added for these loans. 

For additional discussion on our methodology in managing credit risk within our loan portfolio, see the &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; section in this Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of the Company&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Loan policies, credit quality criteria, portfolio guidelines and other controls are established under the guidance of our Chief Credit Officer and approved, as appropriate, by the Board of Directors. Credit Administration, together with the management loan committee, has the responsibility for administering the credit approval process. As another part of its control process, we use an internal credit review and examination function to provide reasonable assurance that loans and commitments are made and maintained as prescribed by our credit policies. Examinations are performed to ensure continued performance and proper risk assessment. 

Loan Portfolio Analysis 

Our wholly owned banking subsidiary Columbia State Bank is a full service commercial bank, which originates a wide variety of loans, and focuses its lending efforts on originating commercial real estate and commercial business loans. The following table sets forth our loan portfolio by type of loan for the dates indicated: 

September 30, 2021 % of Total December 31, 2020 % of Total (dollars in thousands) Commercial loans: Commercial real estate $ 4,088,484 42.9 % $ 4,062,313 43.0 % Commercial business 3,436,351 36.1 % 3,597,968 38.2 % Agriculture 815,985 8.6 % 779,627 8.3 % Construction 326,569 3.4 % 268,663 2.8 % Consumer loans: One-to-four family residential real estate 823,877 8.7 % 683,570 7.3 % Other consumer 30,119 0.3 % 35,519 0.4 % Total loans $ 9,521,385 100.0 % $ 9,427,660 100.0 % Loans held for sale $ 11,355 $ 26,481 

Total loans increased $93.7 million from year-end 2020. This increase includes $543.3 million of new PPP loans as well as new non-PPP loan originations, partially offset by $857.9 million of PPP loan pay downs and forgiveness from the SBA as well as contractual payments and prepayments on non-PPP loans. The PPP loans were originated to provide financial support to small and medium-size businesses to cover payroll and certain other expenses during the COVID-19 pandemic. To further assist our borrowers, the Company also offered loan deferrals to support borrowers during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The following table provides additional detail related to the Company&#8217;s COVID-19 deferrals:

Commercial Real Estate Loans: Commercial real estate loans are secured by properties located within our primary market areas and typically, have loan-to-value ratios of 80% or lower at origination. Our underwriting standards for commercial and multifamily residential loans generally require that the loan-to-value ratio for these loans not exceed 75% of appraised value, cost, or discounted cash flow value, as appropriate, and that commercial properties maintain debt coverage ratios (net operating income divided by annual debt servicing) of 1.2 or better. However, underwriting standards can be influenced by competition and other factors. We endeavor to maintain the highest practical underwriting standards while balancing the need to remain competitive in our lending practices. 

Commercial Business Loans: Our commercial business lending is directed toward meeting the credit and related deposit and treasury management needs of small to medium sized businesses. Commercial and industrial loans are primarily underwritten based on the identified cash flows of the borrower&#8217;s operations and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower and/or the strength of the guarantor. The majority of these loan provide financing for working capital and capital expenditures. Loan terms, including, loan maturity, fixed or adjustable interest rate and collateral considerations, are based on factors such as the loan purpose, collateral type and industry and are underwritten on an individual loan basis. 

Agriculture Loans: Agricultural lending includes agricultural real estate and production loans and lines of credit within our primary market area. We are committed to our Pacific Northwest communities offering seasonal and longer-term loans and operating lines of credit by lending officers with expertise in the agricultural communities we serve. Typical loan-to-value ratios on term loans can range from 55% to 80% depending upon the type of loan. Operating lines of credit require the borrower to provide a 20% to 25% equity investment. The debt coverage ratio is generally 1.25 or better on all term loans. 

Construction Loans: We originate a variety of real estate construction loans. Underwriting guidelines for these loans vary by loan type but include loan-to-value limits, term limits and loan advance limits, as applicable. Our underwriting guidelines for commercial and multifamily residential real estate construction loans generally require that the loan-to-value ratio not exceed 75% and stabilized debt coverage ratios (net operating income divided by annual debt service) of 1.2 or better. As noted above, underwriting standards can be influenced by competition and other factors. However, we endeavor to maintain the highest practical underwriting standards while balancing the need to remain competitive in our lending practices. 

One-to-four Family Residential Real Estate Loans: One-to-four family residential loans, including home equity loans and lines of credit, are secured by properties located within our primary market areas and, typically, have loan-to-value ratios of 80% or lower at origination. 

Other Consumer Loans: Consumer loans include automobile loans, boat and recreational vehicle financing, and other miscellaneous personal loans. 

Foreign Loans: The Company has no material foreign activities. Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s loans and unfunded commitments are geographically concentrated in its service areas within the states of Washington, Oregon and Idaho. 

For additional information on our loan portfolio, including amounts pledged as collateral on borrowings, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 1. Financial Statements (unaudited)&#8221; of this report. 

Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming assets consist of: (i) nonaccrual loans, which generally are loans placed on a nonaccrual basis when the loan becomes past due 90 days or when there are otherwise serious doubts about the collectability of principal or interest within the existing terms of the loan, (ii) OREO and (iii) OPPO, if applicable. 

Table of Contents 

The following table sets forth, at the dates indicated, information with respect to our nonaccrual loans and total nonperforming assets:

At September 30, 2021, nonperforming assets were $24.6 million, compared to $35.4 million at December 31, 2020. Nonperforming assets decreased $10.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2021, primarily due to decreases in commercial real estate and agriculture nonaccrual loans. For information on OREO, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 1. Financial Statements (unaudited)&#8221; of this report.

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The ACL is an accounting estimate of expected credit losses in our loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The provision for credit losses is the expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income to adjust the ACL to the levels deemed appropriate by management, as measured by the Company&#8217;s credit loss estimation methodologies. The allowance for unfunded commitments and letters of credit is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated expected losses related to these unfunded credit facilities at the balance sheet date. 

At September 30, 2021, our ACL was $142.8 million, or 1.50% of total loans (excluding loans held for sale). This compares with an ACL of $149.1 million, or 1.58% of total loans (excluding loans held for sale) at December 31, 2020 and an ACL of $157.0 million or 1.62% of total loans (excluding loans held for sale) at September 30, 2020. The decrease from year end was primarily due to an improved economic forecast as the economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic. The ACL at September 30, 2021 does not include a reserve for the PPP loans as they are fully guaranteed by the SBA. 

The following table provides an analysis of the Company&#8217;s ACL at the dates and the periods indicated: &#160; Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, &#160; 2021 2020 2021 2020 (dollars in thousands) Beginning Balance $ 142,988 $ 151,546 $ 149,140 $ 83,968 Impact of adopting ASC 326 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 1,632 Charge-offs: Commercial loans: Commercial real estate &#8212; &#8212; (316) (101) Commercial business (1,183) (3,164) (5,493) (10,290) Agriculture &#8212; (1,269) (122) (5,995) Consumer loans: One-to-four family residential real estate &#8212; (16) (146) (26) Other consumer (296) (133) (808) (599) Total charge-offs (1,479) (4,582) (6,885) (17,011) Recoveries: Commercial loans: Commercial real estate 518 65 570 92 Commercial business 328 1,124 4,416 2,795 Agriculture 6 27 23 69 Construction 8 11 575 688 Consumer loans: One-to-four family residential real estate 203 1,301 757 2,005 Other consumer 213 76 489 330 Total recoveries 1,276 2,604 6,830 5,979 Net charge-offs (203) (1,978) (55) (11,032) Provision (recapture) for credit losses &#8212; 7,400 (6,300) 82,400 Ending balance 142,785 156,968 142,785 156,968 Total loans, net at end of period, excluding loans held for sale $ 9,521,385 $ 9,688,947 $ 9,521,385 $ 9,688,947 ACL to period-end loans 1.50 % 1.62 % 1.50 % 1.62 % Allowance for unfunded commitments and letters of credit Beginning Balance $ 10,000 $ 8,800 $ 8,300 $ 3,430 Impact of adopting ASC 326 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 1,570 Net changes in the allowance for unfunded commitments and letters of credit 500 800 2,200 4,600 Ending balance $ 10,500 $ 9,600 $ 10,500 $ 9,600

Liquidity and Sources of Funds 

Our primary sources of funds are customer deposits. Additionally, we utilize advances from the FHLB, borrowings from the FRB, sweep repurchase agreements, subordinated debentures assumed in acquisitions and a revolving line of credit to supplement our funding needs. These funds, together with loan repayments, loan sales, retained earnings, equity and other borrowed funds are used to make loans, to acquire securities, meet deposit withdrawals and maturing liabilities, to acquire other assets and to fund continuing operations. 

Deposit Activities 

Our deposit products include a wide variety of transaction accounts, savings accounts and time deposit accounts. We have established a branch system to serve our consumer and business depositors. Deposits increased $2.08 billion from December 31, 2020. The second round of PPP loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 had an impact on our deposits, as our clients deposited these funds into their accounts. In addition, management&#8217;s strategy for funding asset growth is to make use of public funds and brokered and other wholesale deposits on an as-needed basis. The Company participates in the CD Option of IntraFi Network Deposits program, which is a network that allows participating banks to offer extended FDIC deposit insurance coverage on time deposits. The Company also participates in a similar program to offer extended FDIC deposit insurance coverage on money market accounts. These extended deposit insurance programs are generally available only to existing customers and are not used as a means of generating additional liquidity. At September 30, 2021, brokered deposits, reciprocal money market accounts and other wholesale deposits (excluding public funds) totaled $802.5 million, or 5.0% of total deposits, compared to $605.9 million or 4.4% at year-end 2020. These deposits have varied maturities. 

The following table sets forth the Company&#8217;s deposit base by type of product for the dates indicated:

Borrowings 

We rely on FHLB advances and FRB borrowings as another source of both short and long-term funding. FHLB advances and FRB borrowings are secured by investment securities, and residential, commercial and commercial real estate loans. At both September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we had FHLB advances of $7.4 million. 

We also utilize wholesale and retail repurchase agreements to supplement our funding sources. Our wholesale repurchase agreements are secured by mortgage-backed securities. At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we had deposit customer sweep-related repurchase agreements of $40.0 million and $73.9 million, respectively, which mature on a daily basis. 

Subordinated debentures are another source of funding. The Company assumed $35.0 million in aggregate principal amount with its acquisition of Pacific Continental on November 1, 2017. These subordinated debentures, which are unsecured, were callable on June 30, 2021 and have a stated maturity date of June 30, 2026. 

The Company has a $15.0 million short-term credit facility with an unaffiliated bank. This facility provides the Company additional liquidity, if needed, for various corporate activities including the repurchase of shares of Columbia Banking System, Inc. common stock. At both September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, there was no balance associated with this credit facility. The credit agreement requires the Company to comply with certain covenants including those related to asset quality and capital levels. The Company was in compliance with all covenants associated with this facility at September 30, 2021. 

Management anticipates we will continue to rely on FHLB advances, FRB borrowings, the short-term credit facility and wholesale and retail repurchase agreements in the future. We will use those funds primarily to make loans and purchase securities. 

Contractual Obligations, Commitments &#38; Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We are party to many contractual financial obligations, including repayments of borrowings, operating and equipment lease payments, off-balance sheet commitments to extend credit and investments in affordable housing partnerships. At September 30, 2021, we had commitments to extend credit of $3.13 billion compared to $2.83 billion at December 31, 2020. 

Capital Resources 

Shareholders&#8217; equity at September 30, 2021 was $2.32 billion, compared to $2.35 billion at December 31, 2020. Shareholders&#8217; equity was 12% and 14% of total period-end assets at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

Regulatory Capital 

In July 2013, the federal bank regulators approved the Capital Rules (as discussed in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K, &#8220;Item 1. Business&#8212;Supervision and Regulation and &#8212;Regulatory Capital Requirements&#8221;), which implement the Basel III capital framework and various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, which were fully phased in as of January 1, 2019. As of September 30, 2021, we and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements under the Capital Rules. 

FDIC regulations set forth the qualifications necessary for a bank to be classified as &#8220;well-capitalized,&#8221; primarily for assignment of FDIC insurance premium rates. Failure to qualify as &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; can negatively impact a bank&#8217;s ability to expand and to engage in certain activities. The Company and the Bank qualified as &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

As part of its response to the impact of COVID-19, the U.S. federal regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that provided the option to temporarily delay certain effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three year transition period. The interim final rule allows bank holding companies and banks to delay for two years 100% of the day one impact of adopting CECL and 25% of the cumulative change in the reported allowance for credit losses since adopting CECL. The Company elected to adopt the interim final rule. As a result, certain capital ratios and amounts as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 exclude the impact of the increased allowance for credit losses related to the adoption of CECL.

Stock Repurchase Program 

As described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to 3.5 million shares, up to a maximum aggregate purchase price of $100.0 million. There were no share repurchases during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2021. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

The Company considers operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) to be a useful measurement as it more closely reflects the ongoing operating performance of the Company. Additionally, presentation of the operating net interest margin allows readers to compare certain aspects of the Company&#8217;s net interest margin to other organizations that may not have had significant acquisitions. Despite the usefulness of the operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) to the Company, there is no standardized definition for it and, as a result, the Company&#8217;s calculations may not be comparable with other organizations. The Company encourages readers to consider its Consolidated Financial Statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. 

The following table reconciles the Company&#8217;s calculation of the operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) to the net interest margin (tax equivalent) for the periods indicated: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 (dollars in thousands) Operating net interest margin non-GAAP reconciliation: Net interest income (tax equivalent) (1) $ 134,439 $ 126,554 $ 387,737 $ 374,579 Adjustments to arrive at operating net interest income (tax equivalent): Incremental accretion income on acquired loans (884) (1,665) (2,795) (4,831) Premium amortization on acquired securities 422 701 1,474 2,803 Interest reversals on nonaccrual loans (2) &#8212; 393 &#8212; 1,854 Operating net interest income (tax equivalent) (1) $ 133,977 $ 125,983 $ 386,416 $ 374,405 Average interest earning assets $ 16,820,771 $ 14,492,435 $ 16,143,956 $ 13,549,356 Net interest margin (tax equivalent) (1) 3.17 % 3.47 % 3.21 % 3.69 % Operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) (1) 3.16 % 3.46 % 3.20 % 3.69 % 

__________ 

(1) Tax-exempt interest income has been adjusted to a tax equivalent basis. The amount of such adjustment was an addition to net interest income of $1.9 million and $1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and an addition to net interest income of $5.7 million and $5.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
