CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Management has identified the accounting policies related to the ACL, business combinations and the valuation and recoverability of goodwill as critical to an understanding of our financial statements. These policies and related estimates are discussed in &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; under the headings &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses,&#8221; &#8220;Business Combinations&#8221; and &#8220;Valuation and Recoverability of Goodwill&#8221; in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have not been any material changes in our critical accounting policies as compared to those disclosed in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Our results of operations are dependent to a large degree on our net interest income. We also generate noninterest income from our broad range of products and services including treasury management, wealth management and debit and credit cards. Our operating expenses consist primarily of compensation and employee benefits, occupancy, data processing and legal and professional fees. Like most financial institutions, our interest income and cost of funds are affected significantly by general economic conditions, particularly changes in market interest rates, and by government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. 

COVID-19 Update 

We continue to adapt to evolving COVID-19 guidance from federal, state and local healthcare officials as the availability of vaccines increases throughout the Northwest. Efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus in all of our locations continue to include our enhanced cleaning protocols, social distancing and the use of face coverings. These protocols continue to prove effective in keeping our branches open, allowing us to continue to serve existing and new clients without disruption. 

Vaccine availability continued to improve throughout the quarter in all areas of our footprint. We periodically updated team members on vaccination information to help reduce the confusion stemming from the diversity of approaches to availability and scheduling in each county. These communications directed employees to state and local government resources for support with scheduling appointments as well as information on the safety and efficacy of the vaccines. 

Support for team members with school-aged children continued throughout the quarter as school districts migrated from distanced learning arrangements to a hybrid approach combining distanced learning with two or three days per week of in-person learning. We continued to provide flexibility through a variety of options including shift changes, temporary remote work assignments and other accommodations to help team members navigate the changes successfully. 

For additional information on the impact and potential impact of COVID-19 on our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations, see Part II Item 1A &#8220;Risk Factors &#8221; of this report. 

Earnings Summary 

Comparison of current quarter to prior year period 

The Company reported net income for the first quarter of $51.9 million or $0.73 per diluted common share, compared to $14.6 million or $0.20 per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2020. Net interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was $124.0 million, an increase of $1.6 million from the prior year period. The increase was primarily a result of a reduction in interest expense on FHLB advances and deposits partially offset by a decline in interest income on loans. 

The provision for credit losses for the first quarter of 2021 was a recapture of $800 thousand compared to a provision of $41.5 million for the first quarter of 2020. The decrease in provision expense for the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 was principally the result of improved economic forecast as the economy is recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Noninterest income for the current quarter was $23.2 million, an increase of $2.0 million from the prior year period. The increase was principally due to an increase in loan revenue partially offset by a decrease in deposit account and treasury management fees. 

Total noninterest expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 was $83.6 million, a decrease of $712 thousand from the prior year period. This decrease was primarily driven by lower compensation and employee benefits expense partially offset by increases in data process and software and regulatory premiums.

__________ 

(1) Nonaccrual loans have been included in the tables as loans carrying a zero yield. Amortized net deferred loan fees and net unearned discounts on acquired loans were included in the interest income calculations. The amortization of net deferred loan fees was $8.3 million and $2.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The incremental accretion income on acquired loans was $1.1 million and $1.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

(2) Tax-exempt income is calculated on a tax equivalent basis. The tax equivalent yield adjustment to interest earned on loans was $1.2 million and $1.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The tax equivalent yield adjustment to interest earned on tax exempt securities was $733 thousand and $612 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

The following table sets forth the total dollar amount of change in interest income and interest expense. The changes have been segregated for each major category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities into amounts attributable to changes in volume and changes in rates. Changes attributable to the combined effect of volume and interest rates have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to interest rates:

__________ 

(1) The change in interest not due solely to volume or rate has been allocated in proportion to the absolute dollar amount of the change in each. 

Comparison of current quarter to prior year period 

Net interest income for the first quarter of 2021 was $124.0 million, up from $122.4 million for the same quarter in 2020. The increase was primarily a result of a reduction in interest expense on FHLB advances and deposits, partially offset by a decline in interest income on loans. The decrease in interest expense was due to lower average balances of FHLB advances and lower rates on deposits. The decline in interest income from loans was mainly due to lower average rates. 

The Company&#8217;s net interest margin (tax equivalent) decreased to 3.31% in the first quarter of 2021, from 4.00% for the prior year period. This decrease was driven by higher average interest-earning deposits with banks at an average rate of 10 basis points as well as lower rates on the loan and securities portfolios. The Company&#8217;s operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) (1) decreased to 3.30% from 4.02% during the first quarter of 2020. The decrease was due to the items previously noted for the decrease in the net interest margin.

Provision for Credit Losses 

Comparison of current quarter to prior year period 

During the first quarter of 2021, the Company recorded an $800 thousand net provision recapture for credit losses compared to a $41.5 million net provision during the first quarter of 2020. The decrease in provision expense and resulting recapture for the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 was principally the result of an improved economic forecast as the economy is recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The net provision recapture for credit losses recorded during the current quarter also reflected management&#8217;s ongoing assessment of the credit quality of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio. Other factors affecting the provision include net charge-offs, credit quality migration, and the size and composition of the loan portfolio and changes in the economic environment during the first quarter of 2021. The amount of provision was calculated in accordance with the Company&#8217;s methodology for determining the ACL, discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 1. Financial Statements (unaudited)&#8221; of this report. 

Noninterest Income 

The following table presents the significant components of noninterest income and the related dollar and percentage change from period to period: 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 2020 $ Change % Change (dollars in thousands) Deposit account and treasury management fees $ 6,358 $ 7,788 $ (1,430) (18) % Card revenue 3,733 3,518 215 6 % Financial services and trust revenue 3,381 3,065 316 10 % Loan revenue 7,369 4,590 2,779 61 % Bank owned life insurance 1,560 1,596 (36) (2) % Investment securities gains, net &#8212; 249 (249) (100) % Other 765 401 364 91 % Total noninterest income $ 23,166 $ 21,207 $ 1,959 9 % 

Comparison of current quarter to prior year period 

Noninterest income was $23.2 million for the first quarter of 2021, compared to $21.2 million for the same period in 2020. The increase was principally due to an increase in loan revenue partially offset by a decrease in deposit account and treasury management fees. The increase in loan revenue was due to mortgage banking revenue, which increased due to higher loan volume and increased premium per loan on sold loans. The decrease in deposit account and treasury management fees was driven by a decrease in overdraft fees of $988 thousand compared to the same quarter in 2020 due to an overall decrease in the number of transactions amidst the pandemic as well as clients generally carrying higher cash balances in their deposit accounts.

__________ 

1) Percentage changes greater than +/- 1000% are considered not meaningful and are presented as &#8220;N/M.&#8221; 

Comparison of current quarter to prior year period 

Noninterest expense was $83.6 million for the first quarter of 2021, a decrease of $712 thousand from $84.3 million for the prior year period. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in compensation and employee benefits expense partially offset by increases in data processing and software expense and regulatory premiums. The decrease in compensation and employee benefits expense is most attributable to labor costs related to the origination of PPP loans, which are capitalized and amortized as a reduction to interest income over the life of the loan. The increase in data processing and software expense was driven by additional data processing expense associated with PPP loans. The increase in regulatory premiums was the result of the Bank utilizing a portion of its Small Bank Assessment Credit during the first quarter of 2020 to pay for FDIC deposit insurance premiums. The final portion of the credit was utilized during the second quarter of 2020. 

The provision for unfunded loan commitments for the periods indicated are as follows: 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 2020 (in thousands) Provision for unfunded loan commitments $ 1,500 $ 1,000 

Income Taxes 

We recorded an income tax provision of $12.5 million for the first quarter of 2021, compared to a provision of $3.2 million for the same period in 2020, with effective tax rates of 19% and 18% for the first quarter of 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our effective tax rate remains lower than the statutory tax rate due to tax-exempt income from municipal securities, BOLI and certain loan receivables. For additional information, please refer to the Company&#8217;s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.

FINANCIAL CONDITION 

Total assets were $17.34 billion at March 31, 2021, an increase of $750.3 million from December 31, 2020. Cash and cash equivalents increased $230.7 million. Loans increased $248.7 million during the first three months of 2021, which was primarily the result of new loan production, supplemented by PPP loans, partially offset by loan payments and a decrease in line utilization. Debt securities available for sale were $5.50 billion at March 31, 2021, an increase of $286.2 million from December 31, 2020. Total liabilities were $15.06 billion as of March 31, 2021, an increase of $822.9 million from December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in demand and other noninterest-bearing deposits driven by PPP loan funds being deposited into our clients&#8217; deposit accounts. 

Investment Securities 

At March 31, 2021, the Company&#8217;s investment portfolio primarily consisted of debt securities available for sale totaling $5.50 billion compared to $5.21 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase in the debt securities portfolio from year-end is due to $608.9 million in purchases, offset by $180.4 million in maturities, repayments and sales, a $133.7 million decline in unrealized gains and $8.6 million in premium amortization. The average duration of our debt securities investment portfolio was approximately 4 years and 11 months at March 31, 2021. This duration takes into account calls, where appropriate and consensus prepayment speeds. 

The investment securities are used by the Company as a component of its balance sheet management strategies. From time-to-time, securities may be sold to reposition the portfolio in response to strategies developed by the Company&#8217;s asset liability management committee. In accordance with our investment strategy, management monitors market conditions with a view to realize gains on its available for sale securities portfolio when prudent. 

The Company performs a quarterly assessment to determine whether a decline in fair value below amortized cost exists. Amortized cost includes adjustments made to the cost of an investment for accretion, amortization, collection of cash and previous credit losses recognized in earnings. 

When the fair value of an available for sale debt security falls below the amortized cost basis, it is evaluated to determine if any of the decline in value is attributable to credit loss. Decreases in fair value attributable to credit loss would be recorded directly to earnings with a corresponding allowance for credit losses, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. If the credit quality subsequently improves, the allowance would be reversed up to a maximum of the previously recorded credit losses. If the Company intends to sell an impaired available for sale debt security, or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security prior to recovering the amortized cost basis, the entire fair value adjustment would be immediately recognized in earnings with no corresponding allowance for credit losses. 

At March 31, 2021, the market value of debt securities available for sale had a net unrealized gain of $78.9 million compared to a net unrealized gain of $212.6 million at December 31, 2020. The change in valuation was the result of fluctuations in market interest rates during the three months ended March 31, 2021. At March 31, 2021, the Company had $2.32 billion of debt securities available for sale with gross unrealized losses of $58.8 million; however, we did not consider these investment securities to have an indicated credit loss. 

The following table sets forth our securities portfolio by type for the dates indicated:

Credit Risk Management 

The extension of credit in the form of loans or other credit substitutes to individuals and businesses is one of our principal commerce activities. Our policies, as well as applicable laws, and regulations, require risk analysis as well as ongoing portfolio and credit management. We manage our credit risk through lending limit constraints, credit review, approval policies, and extensive, ongoing internal monitoring. We also manage credit risk through diversification of the loan portfolio by type of loan, type of industry and type of borrower and by limiting the aggregation of debt to a single borrower. 

In analyzing our existing portfolio, we review our consumer and residential loan portfolios by their performance as a pool of loans, since no single loan is individually significant or judged by its risk rating, size or potential risk of loss. In contrast, the monitoring process for the commercial business, real estate construction, and commercial real estate portfolios includes periodic reviews of individual loans with risk ratings assigned to each loan and performance judged on a loan-by-loan basis. 

We review these loans to assess the ability of our borrowers to service all interest and principal obligations and, as a result, the risk rating may be adjusted accordingly. In the event that full collection of principal and interest is not reasonably assured, the loan is appropriately downgraded and, if warranted, placed on nonaccrual status even though the loan may be current as to principal and interest payments. Additionally, we assess whether an individually measured allowance is required for collateral dependent nonaccrual loans with balances equal to or greater than $500,000 and with respect to which foreclosure is probable. For the individually measured collateral dependent nonaccrual loan, the allowance for credit losses is equal to the difference between amortized cost of the loan and the determined value of the collateral. However, if the determined value of the collateral is greater than the amortized cost of the loan, no allowance for credit losses will be added for these loans. 

For additional discussion on our methodology in managing credit risk within our loan portfolio, see the &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; section in this Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of the Company&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Loan policies, credit quality criteria, portfolio guidelines and other controls are established under the guidance of our Chief Credit Officer and approved, as appropriate, by the Board of Directors. Credit Administration, together with the management loan committee, has the responsibility for administering the credit approval process. As another part of its control process, we use an internal credit review and examination function to provide reasonable assurance that loans and commitments are made and maintained as prescribed by our credit policies. Examinations are performed to ensure continued performance and proper risk assessment. 

Loan Portfolio Analysis

Total loans increased $248.7 million from year-end 2020. This increase includes $494.8 million of new PPP loans, partially offset by $250.7 million of PPP loan pay downs and forgiveness from the SBA. The PPP loans were originated to provide financial support to small and medium-size businesses to cover payroll and certain other expenses during the COVID-19 pandemic. To further assist our borrowers, the Company also offered loan deferrals to support borrowers during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The following table provides additional detail related to the Company&#8217;s COVID-19 deferrals:

Commercial Real Estate Loans: Commercial real estate loans are secured by properties located within our primary market areas and typically, have loan-to-value ratios of 80% or lower at origination. Our underwriting standards for commercial and multifamily residential loans generally require that the loan-to-value ratio for these loans not exceed 75% of appraised value, cost, or discounted cash flow value, as appropriate, and that commercial properties maintain debt coverage ratios (net operating income divided by annual debt servicing) of 1.2 or better. However, underwriting standards can be influenced by competition and other factors. We endeavor to maintain the highest practical underwriting standards while balancing the need to remain competitive in our lending practices. 

Commercial Business Loans: We are committed to providing competitive commercial lending in our primary market area. Management expects a continued focus within its commercial lending products and to emphasize, in particular, relationship banking with businesses and business owners. 

Agriculture Loans: Agricultural lending includes agricultural real estate and production loans and lines of credit within our primary market area. We are committed to our Pacific Northwest communities offering seasonal and longer-term loans and operating lines of credit by lending officers with expertise in the agricultural communities we serve. Typical loan-to-value ratios on term loans can range from 55% to 80% depending upon the type of loan. Operating lines of credit require the borrower to provide a 20% to 25% equity investment. The debt coverage ratio is generally 1.25:1 or better on all term loans. 

Construction Loans: We originate a variety of real estate construction loans. Underwriting guidelines for these loans vary by loan type but include loan-to-value limits, term limits and loan advance limits, as applicable. Our underwriting guidelines for commercial and multifamily residential real estate construction loans generally require that the loan-to-value ratio not exceed 75% and stabilized debt coverage ratios (net operating income divided by annual debt service) of 1.2 or better. As noted above, underwriting standards can be influenced by competition and other factors. However, we endeavor to maintain the highest practical underwriting standards while balancing the need to remain competitive in our lending practices. 

One-to-four Family Residential Real Estate Loans: One-to-four family residential loans, including home equity loans and lines of credit, are secured by properties located within our primary market areas and, typically, have loan-to-value ratios of 80% or lower at origination.

Other Consumer Loans: Consumer loans include automobile loans, boat and recreational vehicle financing, and other miscellaneous personal loans. 

Foreign Loans: The Company has no material foreign activities. Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s loans and unfunded commitments are geographically concentrated in its service areas within the states of Washington, Oregon and Idaho. 

For additional information on our loan portfolio, including amounts pledged as collateral on borrowings, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 1. Financial Statements (unaudited)&#8221; of this report. 

Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming assets consist of: (i) nonaccrual loans, which generally are loans placed on a nonaccrual basis when the loan becomes past due 90 days or when there are otherwise serious doubts about the collectability of principal or interest within the existing terms of the loan, (ii) OREO and (iii) OPPO, if applicable. 

The following table sets forth, at the dates indicated, information with respect to our nonaccrual loans and total nonperforming assets: 

March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands) Nonperforming assets Nonaccrual loans: Commercial loans: Commercial real estate $ 7,317 $ 7,712 Commercial business 13,551 13,222 Agriculture 10,629 11,614 Construction 191 217 Consumer loans: One-to-four family residential real estate 1,751 2,001 Other consumer 142 40 Total nonaccrual loans 33,581 34,806 OREO and OPPO 521 553 Total nonperforming assets $ 34,102 $ 35,359 Loans, net of unearned income $ 9,676,318 $ 9,427,660 Total assets $ 17,335,116 $ 16,584,779 Nonperforming loans to period-end loans 0.35 % 0.37 % Nonperforming assets to period-end assets 0.20 % 0.21 % 

At March 31, 2021, nonperforming assets were $34.1 million, compared to $35.4 million at December 31, 2020. Nonperforming assets decreased $1.3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily due to a $1.0 million decrease in nonaccrual agriculture loans. For information on OREO, see Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 1. Financial Statements (unaudited)&#8221; of this report.

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The ACL is an accounting estimate of expected credit losses in our loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The provision for credit losses is the expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income to adjust the ACL to the levels deemed appropriate by management, as measured by the Company&#8217;s credit loss estimation methodologies. The allowance for unfunded commitments and letters of credit is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated expected losses related to these unfunded credit facilities at the balance sheet date. 

At March 31, 2021, our ACL was $148.3 million, or 1.53% of total loans (excluding loans held for sale). This compares with an ACL of $149.1 million, or 1.58% of total loans (excluding loans held for sale) at December 31, 2020 and an ACL of $122.1 million or 1.37% of total loans (excluding loans held for sale) at March 31, 2020. The decrease from year end was primarily due to a slight improvement in the economic outlook, which remains impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our borrowers. The ACL at March 31, 2021 does not include a reserve for the PPP loans as they are fully guaranteed by the SBA.

Liquidity and Sources of Funds 

Our primary sources of funds are customer deposits. Additionally, we utilize advances from the FHLB, borrowings from the FRB, sweep repurchase agreements, subordinated debentures assumed in acquisitions and a revolving line of credit to supplement our funding needs. These funds, together with loan repayments, loan sales, retained earnings, equity and other borrowed funds are used to make loans, to acquire securities, meet deposit withdrawals and maturing liabilities, to acquire other assets and to fund continuing operations. 

In addition, we have a shelf registration statement on file with the SEC registering an unspecified amount of any combination of debt or equity securities, depository shares, purchase contracts, units and warrants in one or more offerings. Specific information regarding the terms of and the securities being offered will be provided at the time of any offering. Proceeds from any future offerings are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the repayment of debt, repurchasing or redeeming outstanding securities, working capital, funding future acquisitions or other purposes identified at the time of any offering. 

Deposit Activities 

Our deposit products include a wide variety of transaction accounts, savings accounts and time deposit accounts. We have established a branch system to serve our consumer and business depositors. Deposits increased $897.6 million from December 31, 2020. The second round of PPP loans during the three months ended March 31, 2021 had an impact on our deposits, as our clients deposited these funds into their deposit accounts. In addition, management&#8217;s strategy for funding asset growth is to make use of public funds and brokered and other wholesale deposits on an as-needed basis. The Company participates in the CD Option of IntraFi Network Deposits program, which is a network that allows participating banks to offer extended FDIC deposit insurance coverage on time deposits. The Company also participates in a similar program to offer extended FDIC deposit insurance coverage on money market accounts. These extended deposit insurance programs are generally available only to existing customers and are not used as a means of generating additional liquidity. At March 31, 2021, brokered deposits, reciprocal money market accounts and other wholesale deposits (excluding public funds) totaled $665.9 million, or 4.5% of total deposits, compared to $605.9 million or 4.4% at year-end 2020. These deposits have varied maturities. 

The following table sets forth the Company&#8217;s deposit base by type of product for the dates indicated:

Borrowings 

We rely on FHLB advances and FRB borrowings as another source of both short and long-term funding. FHLB advances and FRB borrowings are secured by investment securities, and residential, commercial and commercial real estate loans. At both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we had FHLB advances of $7.4 million. 

We also utilize wholesale and retail repurchase agreements to supplement our funding sources. Our wholesale repurchase agreements are secured by mortgage-backed securities. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we had deposit customer sweep-related repurchase agreements of $38.6 million and $73.9 million, respectively, which mature on a daily basis. 

Subordinated debentures are another source of funding. The Company assumed $35.0 million in aggregate principal amount with its acquisition of Pacific Continental on November 1, 2017. These subordinated debentures, which are unsecured, are callable on June 30, 2021 and have a stated maturity date of June 30, 2026. 

The Company has a $15.0 million short-term credit facility with an unaffiliated bank. This facility provides the Company additional liquidity, if needed, for various corporate activities including the repurchase of shares of Columbia Banking System, Inc. common stock. At both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, there was no balance associated with this credit facility. The credit agreement requires the Company to comply with certain covenants including those related to asset quality and capital levels. The Company was in compliance with all covenants associated with this facility at March 31, 2021. 

Management anticipates we will continue to rely on FHLB advances, FRB borrowings, the short-term credit facility and wholesale and retail repurchase agreements in the future. We will use those funds primarily to make loans and purchase securities. 

Contractual Obligations, Commitments &#38; Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We are party to many contractual financial obligations, including repayments of borrowings, operating and equipment lease payments, off-balance sheet commitments to extend credit and investments in affordable housing partnerships. At March 31, 2021, we had commitments to extend credit of $2.96 billion compared to $2.83 billion at December 31, 2020. 

Capital Resources 

Shareholders&#8217; equity at March 31, 2021 was $2.28 billion, compared to $2.35 billion at December 31, 2020. Shareholders&#8217; equity was 13% and 14% of total period-end assets at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

Regulatory Capital 

In July 2013, the federal bank regulators approved the Capital Rules (as discussed in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K, &#8220;Item 1. Business&#8212;Supervision and Regulation and &#8212;Regulatory Capital Requirements&#8221;), which implement the Basel III capital framework and various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, which were fully phased in as of January 1, 2019. As of March 31, 2021, we and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements under the Capital Rules. 

FDIC regulations set forth the qualifications necessary for a bank to be classified as &#8220;well-capitalized,&#8221; primarily for assignment of FDIC insurance premium rates. Failure to qualify as &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; can negatively impact a bank&#8217;s ability to expand and to engage in certain activities. The Company and the Bank qualified as &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

As part of its response to the impact of COVID-19, the U.S. federal regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that provided the option to temporarily delay certain effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three year transition period. The interim final rule allows bank holding companies and banks to delay for two years 100% of the day one impact of adopting CECL and 25% of the cumulative change in the reported allowance for credit losses since adopting CECL. The Company elected to adopt the interim final rule. As a result, capital ratios and amounts as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 exclude the impact of the increased allowance for credit losses related to the adoption of CECL.

Stock Repurchase Program 

As described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to 3.5 million shares, up to a maximum aggregate purchase price of $100.0 million. There were no share repurchases during the three months ended March 31, 2021. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

The Company considers operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) to be a useful measurement as it more closely reflects the ongoing operating performance of the Company. Additionally, presentation of the operating net interest margin allows readers to compare certain aspects of the Company&#8217;s net interest margin to other organizations that may not have had significant acquisitions. Despite the usefulness of the operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) to the Company, there is no standardized definition for it and, as a result, the Company&#8217;s calculations may not be comparable with other organizations. The Company encourages readers to consider its Consolidated Financial Statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. 

The following table reconciles the Company&#8217;s calculation of the operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) to the net interest margin (tax equivalent) for the periods indicated: 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 2020 (dollars in thousands) Operating net interest margin non-GAAP reconciliation: Net interest income (tax equivalent) (1) $ 125,889 $ 124,333 Adjustments to arrive at operating net interest income (tax equivalent): Incremental accretion income on acquired loans (1,055) (1,491) Premium amortization on acquired securities 520 1,127 Interest reversals on nonaccrual loans (2) &#8212; 788 Operating net interest income (tax equivalent) (1) $ 125,354 $ 124,757 Average interest earning assets $ 15,419,371 $ 12,487,550 Net interest margin (tax equivalent) (1) 3.31 % 4.00 % Operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) (1) 3.30 % 4.02 % 

__________ 

(1) Tax-exempt interest income has been adjusted to a tax equivalent basis. The amount of such adjustment was an addition to net interest income of $1.9 million for each of the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

(2) Beginning 2021, interest reversals on nonaccrual loans is no longer a component of this non-GAAP measure.
