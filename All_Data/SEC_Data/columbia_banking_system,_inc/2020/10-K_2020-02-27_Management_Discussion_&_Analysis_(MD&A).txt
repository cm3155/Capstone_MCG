 ITEM 7. 

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

##TABLE_END This discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this report. In the following discussion, unless otherwise noted, references to increases or decreases in average balances in items of income and expense for a particular period and balances at a particular date refer to the comparison with corresponding amounts for the period or date for the previous year. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

We have established certain accounting policies in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements that are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our significant accounting policies are presented in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this report. Certain of these policies require the use of judgments, estimates and economic assumptions which may prove inaccurate or are subject to variation that may significantly affect our reported results of operations and financial position for the periods presented or in future periods. Management believes that the judgments, estimates and economic assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time. We consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses 

The ALLL is an accounting estimate of incurred credit losses in our loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The primary components of the allowance are 1) loans collectively evaluated for impairment in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 450, Contingencies (&#8220;ASC 450&#8221;), 2) loans individually determined to be impaired in accordance with the FASB ASC Subtopic 310-10, Receivables: Overall (&#8220;ASC 310-10&#8221;) and 3) loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality in accordance with FASB ASC Subtopic 310-30, Receivables: Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality (&#8220;ASC 310-30&#8221;). 

The measure of estimated credit losses for the ASC 450 component is based upon the loss experience over a historical base period adjusted for a loss emergence period. The loss emergence period is an estimate of the period that it takes, on average, for us to identify the amount of loss incurred for a loan that has suffered a loss-causing event. Management then considers the effects of the following qualitative factors to ensure our allowance reflects the inherent losses in the loan portfolio:

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

External factors. 

##TABLE_END These qualitative factors have a high degree of subjectivity and changes in any of the factors could have a significant impact on our calculation of the allowance. The qualitative adjustment by loan segment is based upon management's assessment of inherent losses within a range between the weighted historical loss factor by segment and the maximum consecutive quarterly losses in the relevant loss emergence period by segment over the historical base period. 

The measure of estimated credit losses for the ASC 310-10 component begins if, based upon current information and events, we believe it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or when a loan has been modified in a TDR. When a loan has been identified as impaired, the amount of impairment will be measured using discounted cash flows, except when it is determined that the remaining source of repayment for the loan is the operation or liquidation of the underlying collateral. In these cases, the current fair value of the collateral, reduced by costs to sell, will be used in place of discounted cash flows. As a final alternative, the observable market price of the debt may be used to assess impairment. The Company predominantly uses the fair value of collateral approach based upon a reliable valuation. 

Our allowance policy and the judgments, estimates and economic assumptions involved are described in greater detail in the &#8220;Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Commitments and Letters of Credit&#8221; section of this discussion and in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this report.

Adoption of Allowance for Credit Losses - ASC 326 

In accordance with ASU 2016-13, the Company was required to adopt ASC 326 as of January 1, 2020. The allowance for credit losses under ASC 326 is an accounting estimate of expected losses over the contractual life of assets carried at amortized cost within the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The ASU requires a financial asset (or group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. 

The quantitative allowance is calculated using a discounted cash flow approach with a probability of default methodology. The probability of default is an assumption derived from regression models which determine the relationship between historical defaults and certain economic variables. The Company determines a reasonable and supportable forecast and applies that forecast to the model to determine defaults over the forecast period. Following the forecast period, the economic variables used to calculate the probability of default revert to a historical average. Other assumptions relevant to the discounted cash flow model to derive the quantitative allowance include the loss given default, which is the estimate of loss for a defaulted loan, and the discount rate applied to future cash flows. The model calculates the net present value of each loan using both the contractual and expected cash flows, respectively. 

In addition to the quantitative portion of the allowance for credit losses, the Company also considers the effects of the following qualitative factors in its calculation of expected losses in the loan portfolio:

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

External factors. 

##TABLE_END These qualitative factors are based in quantitative factors but also include a high degree of subjectivity and changes in any of the factors could have a significant impact on our calculation of the allowance. 

Loans for which repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of collateral are considered collateral-dependent. The allowance for credit losses for collateral-dependent loans is measured on the basis of the fair value of the collateral when foreclosure is probable. 

Business Combinations 

The Company applies the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Under the acquisition method, the acquiring entity in a business combination recognizes the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Management utilizes prevailing valuation techniques appropriate for the asset or liability being measured in determining these fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over amounts allocated to assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Where amounts allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is greater than the purchase price, a bargain purchase gain is recognized. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

Valuation and Recoverability of Goodwill 

Goodwill represented $765.8 million of our $14.08 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2019 . The Company has a single reporting unit. We review goodwill for impairment annually, during the third quarter, and also test for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting unit below its carrying amount. Such events and circumstances may include among others: a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the general business climate; significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within the reporting unit; and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill and could have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Under the Intangibles &#8211; Goodwill and Other topic of the FASB ASC, the testing for impairment may begin with an assessment of qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. When required, the goodwill impairment test involves a two-step process. In step one, we would test goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the reporting unit, goodwill is not deemed to be impaired, and no further testing is necessary. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit were to exceed the fair value of the reporting unit, we would perform a second test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. To measure the amount of any impairment loss, we would determine the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination. Specifically, we would allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit in a hypothetical calculation that would determine the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill, we would record an impairment charge for the difference. 

The accounting estimates related to our goodwill require us to make considerable assumptions about fair values. Our assumptions regarding fair values require significant judgment about economic and industry factors and the growth and earnings prospects of the Bank. Changes in these judgments, either individually or collectively, may have a significant effect on the estimated fair values. 

Based on the results of the annual goodwill impairment test, we determined that no goodwill impairment charges were required as our single reporting unit&#8217;s fair value significantly exceeded its carrying amount. As of December 31, 2019 , we determined there were no events or circumstances which would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting unit below its carrying amount.

2019 Financial Summary 

Income Statement 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Consolidated net income for 2019 was $194.5 million , or $2.68 per diluted common share, compared with net income of $172.9 million , or $2.36 per diluted common share, in 2018 . 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9702; 

Net interest income for 2019 increased 3% to $493.4 million compared to $478.8 million for 2018 . Interest income was $530.0 million in 2019 , compared to $497.1 million in 2018 . The increase was primarily due to income from higher average loan and securities balances and higher rates on loans. Interest expense increased $18.3 million from $18.2 million in 2018 , due to higher rates on interest-bearing deposits and higher average FHLB balances. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9702; 

Provision for loan and lease losses was $3.5 million in 2019 , compared to $14.8 million in 2018 . The decline in provision expense for 2019 reflects a decrease in both nonaccrual loans and net loan charge-offs. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9702; 

Noninterest income was $97.2 million for 2019 , an increase from $88.3 million for 2018 . The increase in 2019 was primarily due to gains on the sales of owned real estate and BOLI benefits. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9702; 

Noninterest expense increased $5.0 million to $345.5 million for 2019 due primarily to higher compensation and employee benefits and legal and professional fees partially offset by decreases in other noninterest, net cost (benefit) of OREO, regulatory premiums and amortization of intangibles. 

##TABLE_END Balance Sheet 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Total assets at December 31, 2019 were $14.08 billion , up 8% , or $984.4 million from $13.10 billion at the end of 2018 .

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense. Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis expressed as a percentage of average total interest-earning assets is referred to as the net interest margin, which represents the average net effective yield on interest-earning assets. 

Table of Contents 

The following table sets forth the average balances of all major categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the total dollar amounts of interest income on interest-earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and average cost of interest-bearing liabilities by category and in total, net interest income, net interest spread, net interest margin and the ratio of average interest-earning assets to interest-earning liabilities:

Nonaccrual loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield. Amortized net deferred loan fees and unearned net discounts on acquired loans were included in the interest income calculations. The amortization of net deferred loan fees was $8.4 million in 2019 , $9.3 million in 2018 and $7.1 million in 2017 . The accretion of net unearned discounts on certain acquired loans was $7.8 million in 2019 , $10.9 million in 2018 , and $8.7 million in 2017 . 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) 

Incremental accretion on PCI loans is also included in loan interest earned. The incremental accretion income on PCI loans was $1.3 million in 2019 , $1.6 million in 2018 and $4.1 million in 2017 . 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) 

Yields are shown on a fully taxable equivalent basis. The tax equivalent yield adjustment to interest earned on loans was $5.5 million , $4.6 million and $6.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , respectively. The tax equivalent yield adjustment to interest earned on tax exempt securities was $2.9 million , $3.2 million and $5.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , respectively. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) 

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a $1.8 million adjustment to premium amortization, which decreased interest income on taxable securities.

Net interest income is impacted by the volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate), interest rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume) and the mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The following table shows changes in net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis between 2019 and 2018 , as well as between 2018 and 2017 broken down between volume and rate. Changes attributable to the combined effect of volume and interest rates have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to interest rates:

__________ 

(1) For tax exempt loans and tax exempt securities, the amount of our tax equivalent adjustment for 2018 was impacted by the lower federal corporate tax rate. As a result, our tax equivalent adjustments for tax exempt loans and tax exempt securities were $4.7 million and $3.3 million lower, respectively, than they would have been utilizing the prior federal corporate tax rate. This change in federal corporate tax rate negatively impacted our 2018 net interest margin (tax equivalent) by 7 basis points. 

(2) Beginning in 2019, interest-bearing public funds, other than certificates of deposit, are presented separately in this table. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. 

Table of Contents 

Incremental accretion income represents the amount of interest income recorded on acquired loans above the contractual rate stated in the individual loan notes. The additional interest income stems from the net discount established at the time these loan portfolios were acquired. The following table shows the impact to interest income of incremental accretion income as well as the net interest margin and operating net interest margin for the periods presented:

(1) Operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) is a Non-GAAP financial measure. See Non-GAAP financial measures section of &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations. &#8221; 

Comparison of 2019 with 2018 

Taxable-equivalent net interest income totaled $501.8 million in 2019 , compared with $486.7 million for 2018 . The increase in net interest income during 2019 resulted from the increase in the size of the loan and securities portfolios as well as the increase in yield on the loan portfolio. The increase in net interest income was partially offset by higher interest rates paid on interest-bearing deposits combined with higher balances of interest-bearing liabilities. 

The Company&#8217;s net interest margin (tax equivalent) decreased from 4.33% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 4.24% for the current year due primarily to higher rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and FHLB advances and $3.5 million less accretion income. The Company&#8217;s operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) decreased from 4.30% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 4.23% for the current year due to higher volumes and higher rates paid on deposits and FHLB advances. 

For a discussion of the methodologies used by management in recording interest income on loans, please see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this report. 

Comparison of 2018 with 2017 

Taxable-equivalent net interest income totaled $486.7 million in 2018 , compared with $380.1 million for 2017 . The increase in net interest income during 2018 resulted from the increase in the size of the loan and securities portfolios, primarily due to the Pacific Continental acquisition. The increase in net interest income was partially offset by higher interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities combined with higher balances of interest-bearing liabilities due to the acquisition. 

The Company&#8217;s net interest margin (tax equivalent) increased from 4.18% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 4.33% for the year ended December 31, 2018 due primarily to higher yields on loans as well as higher loan volumes, partially offset by both the rise in rates paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities as well as the balance in these liabilities. The Company&#8217;s operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) increased from 4.15% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 4.30% for 2018 due to higher volumes and rates on loans. 

Provision for Loan and Lease Losses 

The Company accounts for the credit risk associated with lending activities through its &#8220;ALLL&#8221; and &#8220;Provision for loan and lease losses.&#8221; The provision is the expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income to adjust the allowance to the levels deemed appropriate by management, as determined through its application of the Company&#8217;s allowance methodology procedures. For discussion of the methodology used by management in determining the adequacy of the ALLL, see the &#8220; Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Commitments and Letters of Credit &#8221; and &#8220; Critical Accounting Policies &#8221; sections of this discussion. 

Table of Contents 

The Company recorded provision expense of $3.5 million , $14.8 million and $8.6 million in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The provision recorded in 2019 included management&#8217;s ongoing assessment of the credit quality of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio. Factors affecting the provision include net charge-offs, credit quality migration, and size and composition of the loan portfolio and changes in the economic environment during the period. See &#8220; Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Commitments and Letters of Credit &#8221; section of this discussion for further information on factors considered by the Company in assessing the credit quality of the loan portfolio and establishing the ALLL. 

For the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , net loan charge-offs amounted to $2.9 million , $7.0 million , and $3.0 million , respectively.

##TABLE_END Comparison of 2019 with 2018 

The $8.9 million increase in noninterest income was due to increased other noninterest income and higher investment securities gains, partially offset by a decline in card revenue. The increase in other noninterest income was due to current year gains of $6.6 million as a result of the sale of three real estate parcels as well as $3.1 million in BOLI benefits. There were no similar benefits realized in 2018. The decrease in card revenue was due to the Company being subject to the interchange fee cap imposed under the Dodd-Frank Act beginning on July 1, 2018. 

Comparison of 2018 with 2017 

The $21.4 million decrease in noninterest income was principally from the $14.0 million gain on sale of the merchant card services portfolio on July 1, 2017. As a result of the merchant card services portfolio sale, we now share with the buyer in merchant services revenue and include such amounts in &#8220;Card revenue.&#8221; The decrease was also attributable to lower card revenue as we became subject to the interchange fee cap imposed under the Dodd-Frank Act on July 1, 2018, and the change to net presentation of interchange revenue pursuant to the adoption of new revenue recognition accounting guidance, which became effective on January 1, 2018. Specifically, $5.0 million of payment card network expenses for 2018 that would have historically been presented in &#8220;other noninterest expense&#8221; are now presented in &#8220;card revenue.&#8221; Partially offsetting these decreases to noninterest income was an increase in deposit account and treasury management fees of $5.7 million , or 19% .

##TABLE_END

__________ 

(1) Beginning the first quarter of 2019, B&#38;O taxes were reported separately from other taxes, licenses and fees, which are now reported under &#8220;other noninterest expense.&#8221; Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. 

(2) In the first quarter of 2018, there was a change to net presentation of interchange revenue pursuant to the adoption of new revenue recognition accounting guidance on January 1, 2018. As a result, card revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 includes card network expenses of $4.5 million and $5.0 million, respectively, that would have historically been presented in other noninterest expense.

__________ 

(1) The Company completed the acquisition of Pacific Continental on November 1, 2017. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this report for further information regarding this acquisition. 

Comparison of 2019 with 2018 

Noninterest expense was $345.5 million in 2019 , an increase of $5.0 million over 2018 . Included in noninterest expense were $8.7 million of acquisition-related expenses in 2018. After removing the effect of acquisition-related expenses, noninterest expense increased $13.7 million due to higher compensation and employee benefits and legal and professional fees. These increases were partially offset by decreases in other noninterest and OREO expenses as well as decreases in regulatory premiums and amortization of intangibles. The increases in compensation and employee benefits were driven by increases in salaries, group insurance and other compensation and incentive expenses. The increase in legal and professional fees was due to an increase in professional fees related to our digital initiative strategy. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in OREO expenses which was driven by a gain on the sale of OREO in 2019 compared to a loss on the sale of OREO in 2018. Other noninterest expenses decreased due to a recapture of the provision for off-balance sheet reserves recognized in 2019 compared to a provision for off-balance sheet reserves reported in 2018. The reduction in regulatory premiums was due to the utilization of a portion of our FDIC Small Bank Assessment Credit during the last half of 2019 and the decrease in the amortization of intangibles was a result of the amortization of our CDI asset. 

Comparison of 2018 with 2017 

Noninterest expense was $340.5 million in 2018 , an increase of $49.5 million , or 17% , over 2017 . Included in noninterest expense were $8.7 million of acquisition-related expenses compared to $17.2 million in 2017. After removing the effect of acquisition-related expenses, noninterest expense increased $58.0 million due to higher compensation and employee benefits, amortization of intangibles, legal and professional fees, and other expenses. The increases in compensation and employee benefits and amortization of intangibles were driven by increases in salaries, benefits, and payroll taxes and amortization of core deposit intangibles. These increases were primarily due to the Pacific Continental acquisition, as 2018 included the full year of the acquired bank expenses compared to the inclusion of only two months of expenses in 2017. The increase in legal and professional fees was driven mainly by an increase in treasury management and legal fees related to nonperforming loans. Other noninterest expense increased due to increases in software expense and sponsorships and other charitable contributions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in merchant processing expense. As a result of the 2017 sale of our merchant card services portfolio, we no longer directly incur merchant processing costs. 

Table of Contents 

Income Tax 

For the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , we recorded income tax provisions of $47.2 million , $39.0 million and $65.2 million , respectively. The effective tax rate was 20% in 2019 , 18% in 2018 and 37% in 2017 . Our effective tax rate for 2019 and 2018 were positively impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which was enacted on December 22, 2017. On January 1, 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced the federal tax rate for corporations from 35% to 21% and changed or limited certain deductions. Our effective tax rate for 2017 was impacted by the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets pursuant to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. As a result of the lower corporate tax rate, during 2017, we recorded a re-measurement charge of $12.2 million to reduce our deferred tax assets. For 2019 and 2018, our effective tax rates were less than the 21% federal statutory rates, respectively, primarily due to tax-exempt municipal investment securities income, tax-exempt earnings from bank owned life insurance, and income from loans with favorable tax attributes. For additional information, see Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this report. 

Financial Condition 

Our total assets increased 8% to $14.08 billion at December 31, 2019 from $13.10 billion at December 31, 2018 . Increases in debt securities available for sale, loans, FHLB stock and other assets were partially offset by decreases in cash and cash equivalents and other intangible assets. Our available-for-sale debt securities portfolio increased $578.7 million as a result of purchases of securities throughout the year. The loan portfolio, net of the allowance for loan losses, increased $351.4 million as new loan production outpaced loan payoffs and our FHLB stock increased $22.2 million as a result of the required purchase of FHLB stock related to the increase in our FHLB advances. Other assets increased due to the addition of the right of use asset resulting from the adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8221; of this report for further information regarding ASU 2016-02, Leases . Partially offsetting these increases were decreases in cash and cash equivalents and other intangible assets. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $29.9 million while other intangible assets decreased $10.5 million due to the amortization of the CDI resulting from the acquisition of Pacific Continental Bank. 

Liabilities increased $858.1 million , or 8% to $11.92 billion due to increases in FHLB advances, deposits, the adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases and increases in interest rate swap derivatives during the year. FHLB advances increased $553.9 million to $953.5 million and deposit balances increased $226.6 million to $10.68 billion to supplement the growth in our loan and securities portfolios. Other liabilities increased $74.4 million , or 69% to $181.7 million . The increase in other liabilities was primarily due to the addition of a lease liability resulting from the adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases and the increase in our interest rate swap derivative contracts. Total shareholders&#8217; equity increased $126.3 million to $2.16 billion . This increase was a combination of increases in net income less cash dividends paid to common shareholders, unrealized gains on debt securities available for sale and the addition of the interest rate collar partially offset by treasury shares purchased during the year. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this report for further information regarding the interest rate collar. 

Investment Portfolio 

We invest in securities to generate revenue for the Company, to manage liquidity while minimizing interest rate risk and to provide collateral for certain public deposits and short-term borrowings. The amortized cost amounts represent the Company&#8217;s original cost for the investments, adjusted for accumulated amortization or accretion of any yield adjustments related to the security. The estimated fair values are the amounts we believe the securities could be sold for as of the dates indicated. At December 31, 2019 , gross unrealized losses in our securities portfolio were $20.4 million related to 288 separate available for sale securities. Based on past experience with these types of securities and our own financial performance, we do not currently intend to sell any securities in a loss position nor does available evidence suggest it is more likely than not that management will be required to sell any securities currently in a loss position before the recovery of the amortized cost basis. We review these investments for other-than-temporary impairment on an ongoing basis. 

Our investment portfolio increased $578.7 million from the prior year due to purchases of $1.20 billion and $86.2 million in net unrealized gain offset by maturities, repayments and sales of $685.4 million and premium amortization of $19.0 million. 

At December 31, 2019 , U.S. government agency and government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations comprised 77% of our investment portfolio, other asset-backed securities were 5%, state and municipal securities were 13% and government agency and government-sponsored enterprise securities were 5%. Our entire investment portfolio is categorized as available for sale and carried on our balance sheet at fair value. The average duration of our investment portfolio was approximately 4 years and 8 months at December 31, 2019 . This duration takes into account calls, where appropriate, and consensus prepayment speeds.

Activity based stock is stock we are required to purchase and hold in order to obtain an advance or participate in FHLB mortgage programs. The Company&#8217;s activity based stock purchase requirement is measured as a percentage of our advance proceeds. At December 31, 2019 , the Company held $48.1 million of FHLB Class B stock, $10.0 million of which was membership stock and the remaining $38.1 million was activity based.

##TABLE_END

At December 31, 2019 , total loans, gross of the ALLL were $8.74 billion compared with $8.39 billion in the prior year, an increase of $352.0 million , or 4.2% from the previous year. The increase in the loan portfolio was the result of organic loan production, partially offset by contractual payments and prepayments. Total loans, net of the ALLL, represented 62% and 63% of total assets at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 

Commercial Business Loans: We are committed to providing competitive commercial lending in our primary market areas. Management expects a continued focus within its commercial lending products and to emphasize, in particular, relationship banking with businesses and business owners. 

Real Estate Loans: One-to-four family residential loans are secured by properties located within our primary market areas and, typically, have loan-to-value ratios of 80% or lower at origination. Our underwriting standards for commercial and multifamily residential loans generally require that the loan-to-value ratio for these loans not exceed 75% of appraised value, cost, or discounted cash flow value, as appropriate, and that commercial properties maintain debt coverage ratios (net operating income divided by annual debt servicing) of 1.2 or better. However, underwriting standards can be influenced by competition and other factors. We endeavor to maintain the highest practical underwriting standards while balancing the need to remain competitive in our lending practices. 

Real Estate Construction Loans: We originate a variety of real estate construction loans. Underwriting guidelines for these loans vary by loan type but include loan-to-value limits, term limits and loan advance limits, as applicable. 

Our underwriting guidelines for commercial and multifamily residential real estate construction loans generally require that the loan-to-value ratio not exceed 75% and stabilized debt coverage ratios (net operating income divided by annual debt servicing) of 1.2 or better. As noted above, underwriting standards can be influenced by competition and other factors. However, we endeavor to maintain the highest practical underwriting standards while balancing the need to remain competitive in our lending practices. 

Consumer Loans: Consumer loans include automobile loans, boat and recreational vehicle financing, home equity and home improvement loans and miscellaneous personal loans. 

Foreign Loans: The Company has no material foreign activities. Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s loans and unfunded commitments are geographically concentrated in its service areas within the states of Washington, Oregon and Idaho. 

Table of Contents 

Purchased Credit Impaired Loans: PCI loans are comprised of loans and loan commitments acquired in connection with the 2011 FDIC-assisted acquisitions of First Heritage Bank and Summit Bank, as well as the 2010 FDIC-assisted acquisitions of Columbia River Bank and American Marine Bank. PCI loans are generally accounted for under ASC Topic 310-30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality (&#8220;ASC 310-30&#8221;). The Company did not acquire any loans accounted for under ASC 310-30 during 2019 or 2018 .

Risk Elements 

The extension of credit in the form of loans or other credit substitutes to individuals and businesses is one of our principal commerce activities. Our policies, applicable laws, and regulations require risk analysis as well as ongoing portfolio and credit management. We manage our credit risk through lending limit constraints, credit review, approval policies, and extensive, ongoing internal monitoring. We also manage credit risk through diversification of the loan portfolio by type of loan, type of industry, type of borrower, and by limiting the aggregation of debt to a single borrower. 

In analyzing our existing portfolio, we review our consumer and residential loan portfolios by their performance as a pool of loans, since no single loan is individually significant or judged by its risk rating, size or potential risk of loss. In contrast, the monitoring process for the commercial business, real estate construction, and commercial real estate portfolios includes periodic reviews of individual loans with risk ratings assigned to each loan and performance judged on a loan by loan basis. 

We review these loans to assess the ability of our borrowers to service all interest and principal obligations and, as a result, the risk rating may be adjusted accordingly. In the event that full collection of principal and interest is not reasonably assured, the loan is appropriately downgraded and, if warranted, placed on nonaccrual status even though the loan may be current as to principal and interest payments. Additionally, we assess whether an impairment of a loan warrants specific reserves or a write-down of the loan. For additional discussion on our methodology in managing credit risk within our loan portfolio, see &#8220;Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Commitments and Letters of Credit&#8221; section and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this report. 

Table of Contents 

Loan policies, credit quality criteria, portfolio guidelines and other controls are established under the guidance of our Chief Credit Officer and approved, as appropriate, by the board of directors. Credit Administration, together with the management loan committee, has the responsibility for administering the credit approval process. As another part of its control process, we use an internal credit review and examination function to provide reasonable assurance that loans and commitments are made and maintained as prescribed by our credit policies. This includes a review of documentation when the loan is initially extended and subsequent examination to ensure continued performance and proper risk assessment. 

Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming assets consist of: (i) nonaccrual loans, which generally are loans placed on a nonaccrual basis when the loan becomes past due 90 days or when there are otherwise serious doubts about the collectability of principal or interest within the existing terms of the loan, (ii) OREO, and (iii) OPPO, if applicable. Nonperforming assets totaled $33.6 million , or 0.24% of year end assets at December 31, 2019 , compared to $60.9 million , or 0.46% of year end assets at December 31, 2018 . 

The following table sets forth information with respect to our nonaccrual loans, total nonperforming assets, accruing loans past-due 90 days or more and potential problem loans:

##TABLE_END

Loans are considered impaired when based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or when a loan has been modified in a TDR. A loan is classified as a TDR when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties that lead to a restructuring of the loan, and the Company grants concessions to the borrower in the restructuring that it would not otherwise consider. These concessions may include interest rate reductions, principal forgiveness, extension of maturity date and other actions intended to minimize potential losses. Generally, a nonaccrual loan that is restructured remains on nonaccrual status for a period of six months to demonstrate that the borrower can meet the restructured terms. If the borrower&#8217;s performance under the new terms is not reasonably assured, the loan remains classified as a nonaccrual loan. 

The assessment for impairment occurs when and while such loans are designated as classified per the Company&#8217;s internal risk rating system or when and while such loans are on nonaccrual. All nonaccrual loans greater than $500,000 and all TDR loans are considered impaired and analyzed individually on a quarterly basis. Classified loans with an outstanding balance greater than $500,000 are evaluated for potential impairment on a quarterly basis. The Company&#8217;s policy is to record cash receipts on impaired loans first as reductions in principal and then as interest income. 

The following table summarizes impaired loan financial data at December 31, 2019 and 2018 :

##TABLE_END

Impaired loans with a carrying amount of $32.0 million at December 31, 2019 were subject to specific allocations of ALLL of $461 thousand and charge-offs of $7.2 million during the year. Collateral dependent impaired loans without specific allocations at December 31, 2019 and 2018 either had collateral which exceeded the carrying value of the loans or reflected a partial charge-off to the market value of collateral (less costs to sell), as of the most recent appraisal date . Restructured loans accruing interest totaled $9.7 million and $15.3 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

When a loan with unique risk characteristics has been identified as being impaired, the amount of impairment will be measured by the Company using discounted cash flows, except when it is determined that the remaining source of repayment for the loan is the operation or liquidation of the underlying collateral. In these cases, the current fair value of the collateral, reduced by costs to sell, will be used in place of discounted cash flows. As a final alternative, the observable market price of the debt may be used to assess impairment. Predominately, the Company uses the fair value of collateral approach based upon a reliable valuation. 

Table of Contents 

When a loan secured by real estate migrates to nonperforming and impaired status and it does not have a market valuation less than one year old, the Company secures an updated market valuation by a third-party appraiser that is reviewed by the Company&#8217;s on-staff appraiser. Subsequently, the asset will be appraised annually by a third-party appraiser or the Company&#8217;s on-staff appraiser. The evaluation may occur more frequently if management determines that there has been increased market deterioration within a specific geographical location. Upon receipt and verification of the market valuation, the Company will record the loan at the lower of cost or market (less costs to sell) by recording a charge-off to the ALLL or by designating a specific reserve in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 

For additional information on our nonperforming loans, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this report. 

Other Real Estate and Other Personal Property Owned: As of December 31, 2019 , there was $552 thousand in OREO and OPPO, which was primarily comprised of property from foreclosed real estate loans which decreased $5.5 million from $6.0 million at December 31, 2018 . The decrease was primarily driven by $5.7 million in OREO sales. Properties acquired by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure are transferred to OREO and are recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell, at the date of transfer of the property. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value at the time of the transfer, the difference is charged to the ALLL. The fair value of the OREO property is based upon current appraisal. Subsequent losses that result from the ongoing periodic valuation of these properties are charged to the net cost of operation of OREO expense in the period in which they are identified. In general, improvements to the OREO are capitalized and holding costs are charged to the net cost of operation of OREO as incurred. 

Potential Problem Loans: Potential problem loans are loans which are currently performing and are not on nonaccrual status, restructured or impaired, but about which there are significant doubts as to the borrower&#8217;s future ability to comply with repayment terms and which may later be included in nonaccrual, past due, restructured or impaired loans. Potential problem loans totaled $72.5 million at year end 2019 , compared to $26.6 million at year end 2018 . The increase in potential problem loans in 2019 was driven by a large commercial business loan and a large income property multifamily loan. 

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Commitments and Letters of Credit 

The ALLL is an accounting estimate of incurred credit losses in our loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The provision for loan and lease losses is the expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income to adjust the allowance to the levels deemed appropriate by management, as measured by the Company&#8217;s credit loss estimation methodologies. The ALLL for unfunded commitments and letters of credit is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses related to these unfunded credit facilities at the balance sheet date.

Table of Contents 

At December 31, 2019 , our ALLL was $84.0 million , or 0.96% of total loans (excluding loans held for sale). This compares with an allowance of $83.4 million , or 0.99% of total loans (excluding loans held for sale) at December 31, 2018 . 

We have used the same methodology for ALLL calculations during 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . Adjustments to the percentages of the ALLL allocated to loan categories are made based on trends with respect to delinquencies and problem loans within each loan class. The Company reviews the ALLL quantitative and qualitative methodology on a quarterly basis and makes adjustments when appropriate. We continue to make revisions to our ALLL as necessary to maintain adequate reserves. The Company carefully monitors the loan portfolio and continues to emphasize the importance of credit quality while continuously strengthening loan monitoring systems and controls.

_________ 

(1) For periods prior to June 30, 2018, CDARS and reciprocal money market accounts were considered to be brokered deposits by regulatory authorities and were reported as such on quarterly Call Reports. With the passage of the EGRRCPA in May 2018, these items are no longer considered brokered deposits. 

(2) Beginning 2019, interest-bearing public funds, other than certificates of deposit, are presented separately in this table. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. 

Deposits totaled $10.68 billion at December 31, 2019 compared to $10.46 billion at December 31, 2018 . Noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing deposits, brokered deposits and reciprocal money market accounts provide a stable source of low cost funding. 

At December 31, 2019 , brokered deposits, other wholesale deposits and reciprocal money market accounts (excluding public funds) totaled $329.5 million or 3.1% of total deposits compared to $395.2 million or 3.8% of total deposits, at year end 2018 . The reciprocal money market account program is similar to the CDARS &#174; program. CDARS &#174; is a network that allows participating banks to offer extended FDIC deposit insurance coverage on time deposits. These extended deposit insurance programs are generally available only to existing customers and are not used as a means of generating additional liquidity. 

At December 31, 2019 , public funds held by the Company totaled $529.4 million compared to $456.6 million at December 31, 2018 . Uninsured public funds balances increased from $394.8 million at December 31, 2018 to $468.3 million at December 31, 2019 . The Company is required to collateralize 50% of Washington state and 40% of Oregon state uninsured public funds. For additional information regarding the collateral for these deposits, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this report.

__________ 

(1) Beginning in 2019, interest-bearing public funds, other than certificates of deposit, are presented separately in this table. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. 

Borrowings 

Borrowed funds provide an additional source of funding for loan growth. Our borrowed funds consist primarily of borrowings from the FHLB and FRB, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, subordinated debentures and a revolving line of credit. FHLB and FRB borrowings are secured by our loan portfolio and investment securities. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are secured by investment securities. Subordinated debentures are unsecured and the revolving line of credit is available, if necessary, and requires the Company to comply with certain covenants including those related to asset quality and capital levels. For additional information on our borrowings, see Notes 12 , 13, 14 , and 15 , to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this report. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

In the normal course of business, the Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. The Company evaluates each client&#8217;s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. 

Table of Contents 

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a client as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since a portion of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. 

The Company had off-balance sheet loan commitments aggregating $2.67 billion and $2.62 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Standby letters of credit were $25.7 million at December 31, 2019 , a decrease from $28.3 million at December 31, 2018 . In addition, there were no commitments under commercial letters of credit used to facilitate customers&#8217; trade transactions and other off-balance sheet liabilities at December 31, 2019 and 2018 . 

Contractual Obligations 

We are party to many contractual financial obligations, including repayments of deposits and borrowings and payments for operating leases. The table below presents certain future financial obligations of the Company: &#160;

__________ 

(1) In the banking industry, interest-bearing obligations are principally used to fund interest-earning assets. As such, interest charges on contractual obligations were excluded from reported amounts, as the potential cash outflows would have corresponding cash inflows from interest-earning assets. 

For additional information regarding our contractual obligations, see Notes 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this report. 

Liquidity and Sources of Funds 

In general, our primary sources of funds are net income, loan repayments, maturities and principal payments on investment securities, customer deposits, advances from the FHLB and the FRB, securities repurchase agreements, subordinated debentures and a revolving line of credit available, if necessary. These funds are used to make loans, purchase investments, meet deposit withdrawals and maturing liabilities and cover operational expenses. Scheduled loan repayments and client deposits have proven to be a relatively stable source of funds while other deposit inflows and unscheduled loan prepayments are influenced by interest rate levels, competition and general economic conditions. We manage liquidity through monitoring sources and uses of funds on a daily basis and had unused credit lines with the FHLB and the FRB of $1.96 billion and $209.1 million , respectively, at December 31, 2019 , that are available to us as a supplemental funding source. The holding company&#8217;s sources of funds are dividends from its banking subsidiary which are used to fund dividends to shareholders, purchase treasury shares and cover operating expenses. 

In addition, we have a shelf registration statement on file with the SEC registering an unspecified amount of any combination of debt or equity securities, depositary shares, purchase contracts, units and warrants in one or more offerings. Specific information regarding the terms of and the securities being offered will be provided at the time of any offering. Proceeds from any future offerings are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the repayment of debt, repurchasing or redeeming outstanding securities, working capital, funding future acquisitions or other purposes identified at the time of any offering. 

Table of Contents 

Capital 

Our shareholders&#8217; equity increased to $2.16 billion at December 31, 2019 , from $2.03 billion at December 31, 2018 . Shareholders&#8217; equity was 15.34% and 15.53% of total assets at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Dividends per common share were $1.40 and $1.14 , for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 

Regulatory Capital. In July 2013, the federal bank regulators approved the Capital Rules (as discussed in &#8220;Item 1. Business&#8212;Supervision and Regulation&#8212;Regulatory Capital Requirements&#8221;), which implement the Basel III capital framework and various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, which were fully phased in as of January 1, 2019. 

Basel III also introduced a new capital conservation buffer, composed entirely of CET1, on top of the minimum risk- weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets, Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets or total capital to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The Company and the Bank are required to maintain such additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of CET1, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%, and (iii) total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%. The Company and the Bank met all such capital requirements as of December 31, 2019. 

In addition, FDIC regulations set forth the qualifications necessary for a bank to be classified as &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; (as discussed in &#8220;Item 1. Business&#8212;Supervision and Regulation&#8212;Prompt Corrective Action Framework&#8221;), primarily for assignment of FDIC insurance premium rates. Failure to qualify as &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; can negatively impact a bank&#8217;s ability to expand and to engage in certain activities. The Company and the Bank qualified as &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; at December 31, 2019 and 2018 . 

The following table sets forth the Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s capital ratios at December 31, 2019 and 2018 :

Stock Repurchase Program 

On November 14, 2018, the board of directors approved a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to 2.9 million shares, up to a maximum aggregate purchase price of $100.0 million. On October 23, 2019, the board of directors extended the duration of the stock repurchase program through early May 2020. The Company intends to purchase the shares from time to time in the open market, in private transactions, by direct or derivative purchases or other transactions under conditions which allow such repurchases to be accretive to EPS while maintaining capital ratios that exceed the guidelines for a well-capitalized financial institution. The Company repurchased 1.5 million shares of common stock totaling $50.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 .

(1) Dividends paid per common share as a percentage of earnings per diluted common share 

Subsequent to year end, on January 23, 2020 , the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.28 per share and a special cash dividend of $0.22 per share payable on February 19, 2020 , to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 5, 2020 . 

Applicable federal and Washington state regulations restrict capital distributions, including dividends, by the Company&#8217;s banking subsidiary. Such restrictions are tied to the institution&#8217;s capital levels after giving effect to distributions. Our ability to pay cash dividends is substantially dependent upon receipt of dividends from the Bank. In addition, the payment of cash dividends is subject to Federal regulatory requirements for capital levels and other restrictions. In this regard , current guidance from the Federal Reserve provides, among other things, that dividends per share on the Company&#8217;s common stock generally should not exceed EPS, measured over the previous four fiscal quarters. 

Reference &#8220;Item 6. Selected Financial Data&#8221; of this report for our return on average assets, return on average equity and average common equity to average assets ratios for all reported periods. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

In addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the Company considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Tangible common equity to tangible assets, and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets. 

##TABLE_END The Company believes these measures are useful because they reflect the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation of these measures allows readers to compare certain aspects of the Company&#8217;s capitalization to other organizations. These ratios differ from capital measures defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes shareholders&#8217; equity associated with preferred securities, the nature and extent of which varies across organizations. Additionally, these measures present capital adequacy inclusive and exclusive of accumulated other comprehensive income. These calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by banking regulators for both absolute and comparative purposes. 

Because GAAP in the United States of America do not include capital ratio measures, the Company believes there are no comparable GAAP financial measures to these tangible common equity ratios. The following table reconciles the Company&#8217;s calculation of these measures to amounts reported under GAAP. 

Table of Contents 

Despite the importance of these measures to the Company, there are no standardized definitions for them and, as a result, the Company&#8217;s calculations may not be comparable with other organizations. The Company encourages readers to consider its Consolidated Financial Statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

The Company also considers operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) to be a useful measurement as it closely reflects the ongoing operating performance of the Company. Additionally, presentation of the operating net interest margin allows readers to compare certain aspects of the Company&#8217;s net interest margin to other organizations that may not have had significant acquisitions. Despite the usefulness of the operating net interest margin to the Company, there is no standardized definition for it and, as a result, the Company&#8217;s calculations may not be comparable with other organizations. The Company encourages readers to consider its Consolidated Financial Statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. 

The following table reconciles the Company&#8217;s calculation of the operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) to the net interest margin (tax equivalent) for the periods indicated:
