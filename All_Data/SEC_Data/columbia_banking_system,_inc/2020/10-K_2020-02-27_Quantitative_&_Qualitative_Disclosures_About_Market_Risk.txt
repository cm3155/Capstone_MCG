 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Interest Rate Sensitivity 

We are exposed to interest rate risk, which is the risk that changes in prevailing interest rates will adversely affect assets, liabilities, capital, income and expenses at different times or in different amounts. Generally, there are four sources of interest rate risk as described below: 

Repricing risk &#8212;Repricing risk is the risk of adverse consequences from a change in interest rates that arises because of differences in the timing of when those interest rate changes affect an institution&#8217;s assets and liabilities. 

Basis risk &#8212;Basis risk is the risk of adverse consequence resulting from unequal changes in the spread between two or more rates for different instruments with the same maturity. 

Yield curve risk &#8212;Yield curve risk is the risk of adverse consequence resulting from unequal changes in the spread between two or more rates for different maturities for the same instrument. 

Option risk &#8212;In banking, option risks are known as borrower options to prepay loans and depositor options to make deposits, withdrawals, and early redemptions. Option risk arises whenever bank products give customers the right, but not the obligation, to alter the quantity or the timing of cash flows. 

An Asset/Liability Management Committee is responsible for developing, monitoring and reviewing asset/liability processes, interest rate risk exposures, strategies and tactics and reporting to the board of directors. It is the responsibility of the board of directors to establish policies and interest rate limits and approve these policies and interest rate limits annually. It is the responsibility of management to execute the approved policies, develop and implement risk management strategies and to report to the board of directors on a regular basis. We maintain an asset/liability management policy that provides guidelines for controlling exposure to interest rate risk. The policy guidelines direct management to assess the impact of changes in interest rates upon both earnings and capital. The guidelines establish limits for interest rate risk sensitivity. 

Interest Rate Risk Sensitivity 

A number of measures are used to monitor and manage interest rate risk, including income simulations and interest sensitivity (gap) analysis. An income simulation model is the primary tool used to assess the direction and magnitude of changes in net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates. Basic assumptions in the model include prepayment speeds on mortgage-related assets, cash flows and maturities of other investment securities, loan and deposit volumes and pricing. These assumptions are inherently subjective and may not be realized and, as a result, actual results will differ from our projections. In addition, variances in the timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, overall market conditions including volumes and pricing, changes in management strategies, among other factors will also result in variances between the projected and actual results. 

Based on the results of the simulation model as of December 31, 2019 , we would expect decreases in net interest income of $2.9 million and $22.4 million in year one and year two, respectively, if interest rates gradually decrease from current rates by 100 basis points. We would expect an increase in net interest income of $517 thousand and $21.4 million in year one and year two, respectively, if interest rates gradually increase from current rates by 200 basis points. 

On January 23, 2019, the Company entered into an interest rate collar derivative transaction with a $500.0 million notional based on one month LIBOR. The Company has designated this as a cash flow hedge. This transaction was entered into to minimize the decrease in net interest income if interest rates decline over the next five years. 

The analysis of an institution&#8217;s interest rate gap (the difference between the repricing of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities during a given period of time) is one standard tool for the measurement of the exposure to interest rate risk. We believe that because interest rate gap analysis does not address all factors that can affect earnings performance, it should be used in conjunction with other methods of evaluating interest rate risk. 

The table on the following page sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing, and the resulting interest rate gap of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities at December 31, 2019 . The amounts in the table are derived from our internal data and are based upon regulatory reporting formats. Therefore, they may not be consistent with financial information appearing elsewhere herein that has been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

The estimates for net interest income sensitivity and interest rate gap could be significantly affected by external factors such as changes in prepayment assumptions, early withdrawal of deposits and competition. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while other types may lag changes in market interest rates. 

Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, have features that restrict changes in the interest rates of such assets both on a short-term basis and over the lives of such assets. Further, in the event of a change in market interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the tables. Finally, the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable-rate debt may decrease in the event of a substantial increase in market interest rates.

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices 

The impact of inflation on our operations is increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution&#8217;s performance than the effect of general levels of inflation. Although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services, increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates.

LIBOR Transition 

In anticipation of the discontinuance of LIBOR, management has assessed the use of LIBOR in its loan portfolio, investment securities and interest rate derivatives and is evaluating the impact that the discontinuance of LIBOR may have on the Company. Current actions include the implementation of loan substitute language for new and renewed LIBOR based loans. We are considering the use of other indexes for some of our consumer loans. We are in discussions with our counterparties and tracking industry developments to follow the form and likely timing of the LIBOR transition. We are working on a plan for fulfilling our loan collateral needs with an alternative rate index as the transition date becomes known. This is likely to require some additional costs and litigation risk may rise with contract renewals, if needed. 

Please refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this report for further information regarding the interest rate derivatives. As FASB and the IRS have proposed hedge accounting and taxation relief with regards to the transition, the Company does not anticipate any material impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of the transition away from LIBOR.
