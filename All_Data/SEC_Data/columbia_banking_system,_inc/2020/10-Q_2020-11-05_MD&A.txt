CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This quarterly report on Form 10-Q may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions that are not historical facts, and statements identified by words such as &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;projects,&#8221; &#8220;seeks,&#8221; &#8220;estimates&#8221; or the negative version of those words or other comparable words or phrases of a future or forward-looking nature, as well as the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company&#8217;s business, operations, financial performance and prospects.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Management has identified the accounting policies related to the ACL, business combinations and the valuation and recoverability of goodwill as critical to an understanding of our financial statements. These policies and related estimates are discussed in &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; under the headings &#8220;Adoption of Allowance for Credit Losses - ASC 326,&#8221; &#8220;Business Combinations&#8221; and &#8220;Valuation and Recoverability of Goodwill&#8221; in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have not been any material changes in our critical accounting policies as compared to those disclosed in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Our results of operations are dependent to a large degree on our net interest income. We also generate noninterest income from our broad range of products and services including treasury management, wealth management and debit and credit cards. Our operating expenses consist primarily of compensation and employee benefits, occupancy, data processing and legal and professional fees. Like most financial institutions, our interest income and cost of funds are affected significantly by general economic conditions, particularly changes in market interest rates, and by government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. 

COVID-19 Update 

We continue to monitor the spread of COVID-19 in our communities and adapt to changes in guidance from local healthcare officials. The measures we have taken to mitigate opportunities for spread and provide a safe environment for our team members and clients have been effective. 

Our response employs a multi-layered approach to safety that includes disinfecting protocols, social distancing and remote work options. Where practical, team members with underlying health conditions or those who are caretakers of family with underlying health conditions continue to work remotely. We continue to limit unnecessary travel and have broadly integrated the use of video conferencing as well as virtual collaboration and online learning tools to facilitate training and meetings as well as internal and client-facing events. 

Branch lobbies across the footprint have remained open for standard business hours to serve clients throughout the quarter. Teams routinely carry out our safety protocols, which include disinfecting areas at regular intervals as well as maintaining social distancing and face covering requirements that meet or exceed the guidance issued by local and regional jurisdictions. The diligence of our team members and their commitment to the safety of their team members and clients has minimized the risk of spread in our facilities and helped us keep operating with minimal disruption. 

We continue to support our team members throughout the pandemic by providing flexibility, regular communication and support resources. We communicate regularly with team members across the Bank to provide new information or updated guidance and to promote support resources available through our benefits offering. Throughout the summer our leaders prepared to support team members with school-aged children returning to distanced learning programs by providing a variety of flexible work options including temporary remote work assignments, shift changes, and other accommodations. These adjustments have afforded many team members the support needed to help ease the pressures of distanced learning requirements. Responding to these temporary challenges with a variety of flexible options while upholding client service standards has also allowed us to retain existing talent. 

Our participation in the Small Business Administration&#8217;s (SBA) Paycheck Protection Program has entered a new phase as clients begin submitting requests for loan forgiveness. We began processing requests when the SBA formally opened their portal in mid-August. As of October 26th, we taken over 1,400 applications and approved/submitted nearly 850 of those to the SBA for more than $220.0 million. We continue to process requests on a daily basis, including those utilizing the SBA&#8217;s new simplified application for loans of $50,000 or less. 

For additional information on the impact and potential impact of COVID-19 on our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations, see Part II Item 1A &#8220;Risk Factors &#8221; of this report.

Earnings Summary 

Comparison of current quarter to prior year period 

The Company reported net income for the third quarter of $44.7 million or $0.63 per diluted common share, compared to $50.7 million or $0.70 per diluted common share for the third quarter of 2019. Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2020 was $124.7 million, an increase of $2.3 million from the prior year period. The increase was primarily a result of a reduction in interest expense on deposits and FHLB advances partially offset by a decline in interest income on interest-earning assets. 

The provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2020 was $7.4 million compared to $299 thousand for the third quarter of 2019. The increase in provision expense for the third quarter of 2020 compared to one year ago was principally the result of COVID-19 and the 2020 downturn in the national and global economies. 

Noninterest income for the current quarter was $22.5 million, a decrease of $5.6 million from the prior year period. The decrease was principally due to a decline in other noninterest income from a $5.9 million gain from the sale-leaseback of owned real estate during the third quarter of 2019. In addition, deposit account and treasury management fees decreased $2.4 million compared to the same quarter in 2019. These decreases in noninterest income were partially offset by an increase in loan revenue of $2.8 million, driven by higher mortgage banking revenue. 

Total noninterest expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2020 was $85.1 million, a decrease of $2.0 million from the prior year period. This decrease was primarily driven by lower legal and professional fees and advertising and promotion expenses partially offset by an increase in other noninterest expense. 

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

The Company reported net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 of $95.9 million or $1.35 per diluted common share, compared to $148.3 million or $2.04 per diluted common share for the same period in 2019. Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was $369.0 million, an increase of $411 thousand from the prior year period. The drivers for the first nine months of 2020 were similar to the drivers for the quarterly comparison above. The increase was primarily a result of a reduction in interest expense on deposits and FHLB advances partially offset by a decline in interest income on interest-earning assets. 

The provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was $82.4 million compared to a provision of $1.9 million for the first nine months of 2019. The increase in the provision for the first nine months of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic which has negatively affected the economy and increased unemployment rates. 

Noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was $80.9 million, an increase of $5.6 million from the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to a $16.4 million gain from the sale and upward adjustment to the carrying value of the Visa Class B restricted shares to the market price and an increase in loan revenue. These increases were partially offset by decreases in deposit account and treasury management fees and other noninterest income. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, noninterest expense was $250.2 million, a decrease of $8.3 million from $258.5 million for the same period in 2019. The decrease from the prior year period was driven by lower legal and professional fees and compensation and employee benefits expenses which were partially offset by higher other noninterest expense.

Comparison of current quarter to prior year period 

Net interest income for the third quarter of 2020 was $124.7 million, up from $122.5 million for the same quarter in 2019. The increase was primarily a result of a reduction in interest expense on deposits and FHLB advances partially offset by a decline in interest income on interest-earning assets. The reduction in deposit interest expense was due to the lower interest rate environment while the reduction in interest expense on FHLB advances was principally due to lower average balances of advances. Interest income from securities increased principally due to higher average balances. Partially offsetting these favorable changes to net interest income was a decline in loan interest income due to the lower rate environment. 

The Company&#8217;s net interest margin (tax equivalent) decreased to 3.47% in the third quarter of 2020, from 4.14% for the prior year period. This decrease was driven by higher average interest-earning deposits with banks at an average rate of 10 basis points as well as lower rates on the loan and securities portfolios. The Company&#8217;s operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) (1) decreased to 3.46% from 4.12% during the third quarter of 2019. The decrease was due to the items previously noted for the decrease in the net interest margin. 

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was $369.0 million, relative to $368.6 million for the prior year period. The year-to-date comparison results were similar to the third quarter comparison results as deposit interest expense declined due to the lower rate environment while the decrease in interest expense on FHLB advances was due to both a decline in interest rates and lower average advance balances. The increase in interest income from securities was principally due to higher average balances. Partially offsetting these favorable changes to net interest income was a decline in interest income from loans due to the low rate environment.

(1) Operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the &#8220;Non-GAAP financial measures&#8221; section in this Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis. 

Table of Contents 

The Company&#8217;s net interest margin (tax equivalent) decreased to 3.69% for the first nine months of 2020, from 4.28% for the prior year period. The decrease in the Company&#8217;s net interest margin (tax equivalent) was a result of higher average interest-earning deposits with banks at an average rate of 14 basis points as well as lower rates on our loans and securities. The Company&#8217;s operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was 3.69% compared to 4.28% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The decrease was due to the items previously noted for the decrease in the net interest margin. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

Comparison of current quarter to prior year period 

During the third quarter of 2020, the Company recorded a $7.4 million net provision for credit losses, under the CECL methodology, compared to a $299 thousand net provision, under the previous ALLL methodology, during the third quarter of 2019. The increase in provision expense for the third quarter of 2020 compared to one year ago was principally the result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the downturn in the national and global economies as well as increased unemployment rates. 

The net provision for credit losses recorded during the current quarter also included management&#8217;s ongoing assessment of the credit quality of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio. Other factors affecting the provision include net charge-offs, credit quality migration, and the size and composition of the loan portfolio and changes in the economic environment during the third quarter of 2020. The amount of provision was calculated in accordance with the Company&#8217;s methodology for determining the ACL, discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 1. Financial Statements (unaudited)&#8221; of this report. 

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

The provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was $82.4 million compared to $1.9 million during the same period in 2019. The increase in the provision for the first nine months of 2020 was due to the same factors discussed above for the quarterly provision for credit losses. The amount of provision was calculated in accordance with the Company&#8217;s methodology for determining the ACL, discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 1. Financial Statements (unaudited)&#8221; of this report.

Comparison of current quarter to prior year period 

Noninterest income was $22.5 million for the third quarter of 2020, compared to $28.0 million for the same period in 2019. The decrease was principally due to a $5.9 million gain from the sale-leaseback of owned real estate during the third quarter of 2019, included in other noninterest income in the table above. In addition, treasury management and overdraft fees decreased by $993 thousand and $921 thousand, respectively, compared to the same quarter in 2019. The decrease in overdraft fees was due to an overall decrease in the number of transactions during this pandemic time period as well as clients generally carrying higher cash balances in their deposit accounts. Partially offsetting these decreases in noninterest income was an increase in mortgage banking revenue of $2.3 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to a higher volume of mortgage loans originated and sold. 

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, noninterest income was $80.9 million compared to $75.4 million for the same period in 2019, an increase of $5.6 million. The increase was primarily due to the $16.4 million gain from the sale and write-up of Visa Class B restricted shares to fair value during the second quarter of 2020. Loan revenue increased during the first nine months of 2020 due to increases in investor premiums earned due to a higher volume of mortgage loan originations through our held for sale program and interest rate swap income. These increases were partially offset by the reduction in other noninterest expense due to the gain on the sale-leaseback of owned real estate in the third quarter of 2019 as stated above for the quarterly comparison. In addition, treasury management and overdraft fees declined due to the same reasons stated for the quarterly comparison above.

Comparison of current quarter to prior year period 

Noninterest expense was $85.1 million for the third quarter of 2020, a decrease of $2.0 million from $87.1 million for the prior year period. This decrease was primarily driven by lower legal and professional fees which declined $2.7 million due to lower expenses tied to digital corporate initiatives while advertising and promotion expenses decreased $1.1 million. Partially offsetting these decreases was a $1.2 million increase in the provision for unfunded loan commitments compared to the third quarter of 2019 which is included in other noninterest expense in the table above. 

Table of Contents 

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, noninterest expense was $250.2 million, compared to $258.5 million for the same period in 2019, a decrease of $8.3 million. The decrease from the prior year period was driven by lower legal and professional fees and compensation and employee benefits expenses which were partially offset by higher other noninterest expense. Legal and professional fees were down compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to lower expenses tied to digital corporate initiatives. The decrease in compensation and benefits was due to the deferral of labor costs related to the origination of PPP loans. These labor costs are deferred and amortized as a reduction in interest income over the life of the loan. This decrease was partially offset by increases in salaries and incentive and commission expenses. Partially offsetting these decreases to noninterest expense was an increase in the provision for unfunded loan commitments which is included in other noninterest expense in the table above. 

The provision for unfunded loan commitments for the periods indicated are as follows: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 (in thousands) Provision (recapture) for unfunded loan commitments $ 800 $ (400) $ 4,600 $ (750) 

Income Taxes 

We recorded an income tax provision of $9.9 million for the third quarter of 2020, compared to a provision of $12.4 million for the same period in 2019, with effective tax rates of 18% and 20% for the third quarter of 2020 and 2019, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, we recorded income tax provisions of $21.4 million and $35.3 million, respectively, with effective tax rates of 18% for the current year and 19% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate remains lower than the statutory tax rate due to tax-exempt income from municipal securities, BOLI and certain loan receivables. For additional information, please refer to the Company&#8217;s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION 

Total assets were $16.23 billion at September 30, 2020, an increase of $2.15 billion from December 31, 2019. Cash and cash equivalents increased $682.6 million. Loans increased $945.5 million during the first nine months of 2020, which was primarily the result of new loan production, supplemented by PPP loans, partially offset by a decrease in line utilization and loan payments. Debt securities available for sale were $4.28 billion at September 30, 2020, an increase of $535.6 million from December 31, 2019. Total liabilities were $13.93 billion as of September 30, 2020, an increase of $2.01 billion from December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in deposits driven by PPP loan funds being deposited into our clients&#8217; deposit accounts, partially offset by a decrease in FHLB advances. 

Investment Securities 

At September 30, 2020, the Company&#8217;s investment portfolio primarily consisted of debt securities available for sale totaling $4.28 billion compared to $3.75 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in the debt securities portfolio from year-end is due to $997.0 million in purchases and $157.5 million in net unrealized gain, offset by $600.6 million in maturities, repayments and sales and $18.3 million in premium amortization. The average duration of our debt securities investment portfolio was approximately 4 years and 6 months at September 30, 2020. This duration takes into account calls, where appropriate and consensus prepayment speeds. 

The investment securities are used by the Company as a component of its balance sheet management strategies. From time-to-time, securities may be sold to reposition the portfolio in response to strategies developed by the Company&#8217;s asset liability management committee. In accordance with our investment strategy, management monitors market conditions with a view to realize gains on its available for sale securities portfolio when prudent. 

Table of Contents 

The Company performs a quarterly assessment of the debt securities available for sale in its investment portfolio that have an unrealized loss to determine whether the decline in the fair value of these securities below their amortized cost basis has resulted in a credit loss. A credit loss exists when it becomes probable that the Company will be unable to recover the entire amortized cost basis of its investment. The Company&#8217;s impairment assessment takes into consideration factors such as defaults or deferrals of scheduled interest or principal, external credit ratings and recent downgrades, internal assessment of credit quality and whether the Company intends to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis. If a decline in fair value is determined to result in a credit loss, an allowance is recorded. 

When there are credit losses associated with a debt security and the Company does not have the intent to sell the security and it is more likely than not that it will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis, the Company will separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit-related and the amount related to non-credit factors. The credit-related impairment is recognized in earnings through an allowance and the non-credit-related impairment is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. 

At September 30, 2020, the market value of debt securities available for sale had a net unrealized gain of $200.6 million compared to a net unrealized gain of $43.0 million at December 31, 2019. The change in valuation was the result of fluctuations in market interest rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. At September 30, 2020, the Company had $604.2 million of debt securities available for sale with gross unrealized losses of $5.1 million; however, we did not consider these investment securities to have an indicated credit loss. 

The following table sets forth our securities portfolio by type for the dates indicated:

Credit Risk Management 

The extension of credit in the form of loans or other credit substitutes to individuals and businesses is one of our principal commerce activities. Our policies, as well as applicable laws, and regulations, require risk analysis as well as ongoing portfolio and credit management. We manage our credit risk through lending limit constraints, credit review, approval policies, and extensive, ongoing internal monitoring. We also manage credit risk through diversification of the loan portfolio by type of loan, type of industry and type of borrower and by limiting the aggregation of debt to a single borrower. 

In analyzing our existing portfolio, we review our consumer and residential loan portfolios by their performance as a pool of loans, since no single loan is individually significant or judged by its risk rating, size or potential risk of loss. In contrast, the monitoring process for the commercial business, real estate construction, and commercial real estate portfolios includes periodic reviews of individual loans with risk ratings assigned to each loan and performance judged on a loan-by-loan basis. 

Table of Contents 

We review these loans to assess the ability of our borrowers to service all interest and principal obligations and, as a result, the risk rating may be adjusted accordingly. In the event that full collection of principal and interest is not reasonably assured, the loan is appropriately downgraded and, if warranted, placed on nonaccrual status even though the loan may be current as to principal and interest payments. Additionally, we assess whether an individually measured allowance is required for collateral dependent nonaccrual loans with balances equal to or greater than $500,000 and with respect to which foreclosure is probable. For the individually measured collateral dependent nonaccrual loan, the allowance for credit losses is equal to the difference between amortized cost of the loan and the determined value of the collateral. However, if the determined value of the collateral is greater than the amortized cost of the loan, no allowance for credit losses will be added for these loans. 

For additional discussion on our methodology in managing credit risk within our loan portfolio, see the &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; section in this Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of the Company&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Loan policies, credit quality criteria, portfolio guidelines and other controls are established under the guidance of our Chief Credit Officer and approved, as appropriate, by the Board of Directors. Credit Administration, together with the management loan committee, has the responsibility for administering the credit approval process. As another part of its control process, we use an internal credit review and examination function to provide reasonable assurance that loans and commitments are made and maintained as prescribed by our credit policies. Examinations are performed to ensure continued performance and proper risk assessment. 

Loan Portfolio Analysis 

Our wholly owned banking subsidiary Columbia State Bank is a full service commercial bank, which originates a wide variety of loans, and focuses its lending efforts on originating commercial real estate and commercial business loans.

Total loans increased $945.5 million from year-end 2019. This increase includes $953.2 million of PPP loans, net of $17.1 million in net deferred fees at September 30, 2020. The PPP loans were originated to provide financial support to small and medium-size businesses to cover payroll and certain other expenses during the COVID-19 pandemic. To further assist our borrowers, the Company also offered loan deferrals to support borrowers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Commercial Real Estate Loans: Commercial real estate loans are secured by properties located within our primary market areas and typically, have loan-to-value ratios of 80% or lower at origination. Our underwriting standards for commercial and multifamily residential loans generally require that the loan-to-value ratio for these loans not exceed 75% of appraised value, cost, or discounted cash flow value, as appropriate, and that commercial properties maintain debt coverage ratios (net operating income divided by annual debt servicing) of 1.2 or better. However, underwriting standards can be influenced by competition and other factors. We endeavor to maintain the highest practical underwriting standards while balancing the need to remain competitive in our lending practices. 

Commercial Business Loans: We are committed to providing competitive commercial lending in our primary market area. Management expects a continued focus within its commercial lending products and to emphasize, in particular, relationship banking with businesses and business owners. 

Agriculture Loans: Agricultural lending includes agricultural real estate and production loans and lines of credit within our primary market area. We are committed to our Pacific Northwest communities offering seasonal and longer-term loans and operating lines of credit by lending officers with expertise in the agricultural communities we serve. Typical loan-to-value ratios on term loans can range from 55% to 80% depending upon the type of loan. Operating lines of credit require the borrower to provide a 20% to 25% equity investment. The debt coverage ratio is generally 1.25:1 or better on all term loans. 

Construction Loans: We originate a variety of real estate construction loans. Underwriting guidelines for these loans vary by loan type but include loan-to-value limits, term limits and loan advance limits, as applicable. Our underwriting guidelines for commercial and multifamily residential real estate construction loans generally require that the loan-to-value ratio not exceed 75% and stabilized debt coverage ratios (net operating income divided by annual debt service) of 1.2 or better. As noted above, underwriting standards can be influenced by competition and other factors. However, we endeavor to maintain the highest practical underwriting standards while balancing the need to remain competitive in our lending practices. 

One-to-four Family Residential Real Estate Loans: One-to-four family residential loans, including home equity loans and lines of credit, are secured by properties located within our primary market areas and, typically, have loan-to-value ratios of 80% or lower at origination. 

Other Consumer Loans: Consumer loans include automobile loans, boat and recreational vehicle financing, and other miscellaneous personal loans. 

Foreign Loans: The Company has no material foreign activities. Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s loans and unfunded commitments are geographically concentrated in its service areas within the states of Washington, Oregon and Idaho. 

For additional information on our loan portfolio, including amounts pledged as collateral on borrowings, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 1. Financial Statements (unaudited)&#8221; of this report. 

Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming assets consist of: (i) nonaccrual loans, which generally are loans placed on a nonaccrual basis when the loan becomes past due 90 days or when there are otherwise serious doubts about the collectability of principal or interest within the existing terms of the loan, (ii) OREO and (iii) OPPO, if applicable.

The following table sets forth, at the dates indicated, information with respect to our nonaccrual loans and total nonperforming assets:

At September 30, 2020, nonperforming assets were $47.9 million, compared to $33.6 million at December 31, 2019. Nonperforming assets increased $14.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily due to a $9.9 million increase in nonaccrual agriculture loans and a $6.6 million increase in nonaccrual commercial real estate loans. For information on OREO, see Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 1. Financial Statements (unaudited)&#8221; of this report. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The ACL is an accounting estimate of expected credit losses in our loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The provision for credit losses is the expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income to adjust the ACL to the levels deemed appropriate by management, as measured by the Company&#8217;s credit loss estimation methodologies. The allowance for unfunded commitments and letters of credit is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated expected losses related to these unfunded credit facilities at the balance sheet date. 

At September 30, 2020, our ACL was $157.0 million, or 1.62% of total loans (excluding loans held for sale). This compares with an ALLL of $84.0 million, or 0.96% of total loans (excluding loans held for sale) at December 31, 2019 and an ALLL of $82.7 million or 0.94% of total loans (excluding loans held for sale) at September 30, 2019. The increase was primarily the result of COVID-19 and the 2020 downturn in the national and global economies as well as increased unemployment rates. The ACL at September 30, 2020 does not include a reserve for the PPP loans as they are fully guaranteed by the SBA.

Liquidity and Sources of Funds 

Our primary sources of funds are customer deposits. Additionally, we utilize advances from the FHLB, borrowings from the FRB, sweep repurchase agreements, subordinated debentures assumed in acquisitions and a revolving line of credit to supplement our funding needs. These funds, together with loan repayments, loan sales, retained earnings, equity and other borrowed funds are used to make loans, to acquire securities, meet deposit withdrawals and maturing liabilities, to acquire other assets and to fund continuing operations. 

In addition, we have a shelf registration statement on file with the SEC registering an unspecified amount of any combination of debt or equity securities, depository shares, purchase contracts, units and warrants in one or more offerings. Specific information regarding the terms of and the securities being offered will be provided at the time of any offering. Proceeds from any future offerings are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the repayment of debt, repurchasing or redeeming outstanding securities, working capital, funding future acquisitions or other purposes identified at the time of any offering. 

Deposit Activities 

Our deposit products include a wide variety of transaction accounts, savings accounts and time deposit accounts. We have established a branch system to serve our consumer and business depositors. Deposits increased $2.9 billion from December 31, 2019. The addition of PPP loans during the second quarter had a notable impact on our deposits, as our clients deposited these funds into their deposit accounts. In addition, management&#8217;s strategy for funding asset growth is to make use of public funds and brokered and other wholesale deposits on an as-needed basis. The Company participates in the CDARS &#174; program. CDARS &#174; is a network that allows participating banks to offer extended FDIC deposit insurance coverage on time deposits. The Company also participates in a similar program to offer extended FDIC deposit insurance coverage on money market accounts. These extended deposit insurance programs are generally available only to existing customers and are not used as a means of generating additional liquidity. At September 30, 2020, brokered deposits, reciprocal money market accounts and other wholesale deposits (excluding public funds) totaled $616.9 million, or 4.5% of total deposits, compared to $329.5 million or 3.1% at year-end 2019.

Borrowings 

We rely on FHLB advances and FRB borrowings as another source of both short and long-term funding. FHLB advances and FRB borrowings are secured by investment securities, and residential, commercial and commercial real estate loans. At September 30, 2020, we had FHLB advances of $7.4 million compared to $953.5 million at December 31, 2019. 

We also utilize wholesale and retail repurchase agreements to supplement our funding sources. Our wholesale repurchase agreements are secured by mortgage-backed securities. At September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had deposit customer sweep-related repurchase agreements of $27.0 million and $64.4 million, respectively, which mature on a daily basis. 

Subordinated debentures are another source of funding. The Company assumed $35.0 million in aggregate principal amount with its acquisition of Pacific Continental on November 1, 2017. These subordinated debentures, which are unsecured, are callable on June 30, 2021 and have a stated maturity date of June 30, 2026. 

The Company has a $15.0 million short-term credit facility with an unaffiliated bank. This facility provides the Company additional liquidity, if needed, for various corporate activities including the repurchase of shares of Columbia Banking System, Inc. common stock. At both September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there was no balance associated with this credit facility. The credit agreement requires the Company to comply with certain covenants including those related to asset quality and capital levels. The Company was in compliance with all covenants associated with this facility at September 30, 2020. 

Management anticipates we will continue to rely on FHLB advances, FRB borrowings, the short-term credit facility and wholesale and retail repurchase agreements in the future. We will use those funds primarily to make loans and purchase securities. 

Contractual Obligations, Commitments &#38; Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We are party to many contractual financial obligations, including repayments of borrowings, operating and equipment lease payments, off-balance sheet commitments to extend credit and investments in affordable housing partnerships. At September 30, 2020, we had commitments to extend credit of $3.82 billion compared to $2.70 billion at December 31, 2019. 

Capital Resources 

Shareholders&#8217; equity at September 30, 2020 was $2.30 billion, compared to $2.16 billion at December 31, 2019. Shareholders&#8217; equity was 14% and 15% of total period-end assets at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. 

Regulatory Capital 

In July 2013, the federal bank regulators approved the Capital Rules (as discussed in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, &#8220;Item 1. Business&#8212;Supervision and Regulation and &#8212;Regulatory Capital Requirements&#8221;), which implement the Basel III capital framework and various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, which were fully phased in as of January 1, 2019. As of September 30, 2020, we and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements under the Capital Rules. 

FDIC regulations set forth the qualifications necessary for a bank to be classified as &#8220;well-capitalized,&#8221; primarily for assignment of FDIC insurance premium rates. Failure to qualify as &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; can negatively impact a bank&#8217;s ability to expand and to engage in certain activities. The Company and the Bank qualified as &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. 

As part of its response to the impact of COVID-19, the U.S. federal regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that provided the option to temporarily delay certain effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three year transition period. The interim final rule allows bank holding companies and banks to delay for two years 100% of the day one impact of adopting CECL and 25% of the cumulative change in the reported allowance for credit losses since adopting CECL. The Company elected to adopt the interim final rule. As a result, capital ratios and amounts as of September 30, 2020 exclude the impact of the increased allowance for credit losses related to the adoption of CECL.

Stock Repurchase Program 

As described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to 2.9 million shares, up to a maximum aggregate purchase price of $100.0 million. The share repurchase authorization expired in May of 2020. There were no share repurchases during the three months ended September 30, 2020. The Company repurchased 731 thousand shares of common stock totaling $20.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. For additional information, please see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 1. Financial Statements (unaudited)&#8221; of this report. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

The Company considers operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) to be a useful measurement as it more closely reflects the ongoing operating performance of the Company. Additionally, presentation of the operating net interest margin allows readers to compare certain aspects of the Company&#8217;s net interest margin to other organizations that may not have had significant acquisitions. Despite the usefulness of the operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) to the Company, there is no standardized definition for it and, as a result, the Company&#8217;s calculations may not be comparable with other organizations. The Company encourages readers to consider its Consolidated Financial Statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. 

The following table reconciles the Company&#8217;s calculation of the operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) to the net interest margin (tax equivalent) for the periods indicated: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 (dollars in thousands) Operating net interest margin non-GAAP reconciliation: Net interest income (tax equivalent) (1) $ 126,554 $ 124,572 $ 374,579 $ 374,918 Adjustments to arrive at operating net interest income (tax equivalent):

__________ 

(1) Tax-exempt interest income has been adjusted to a tax equivalent basis. The amount of such adjustment was an addition to net interest income of $1.8 million and $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and an addition to net interest income of $5.6 million and $6.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

(2) Beginning January 2020, incremental accretion income on PCI loans is no longer presented separate from incremental accretion income on other acquired loans. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.
