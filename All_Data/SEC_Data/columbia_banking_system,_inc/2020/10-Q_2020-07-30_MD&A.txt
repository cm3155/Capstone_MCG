CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This quarterly report on Form 10-Q may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions that are not historical facts, and statements identified by words such as &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;projects,&#8221; &#8220;seeks,&#8221; &#8220;estimates&#8221; or the negative version of those words or other comparable words or phrases of a future or forward-looking nature, as well as the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company&#8217;s business, operations, financial performance and prospects. Forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs and expectations of management and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change. In addition to the factors set forth in the section titled &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in this report and the factors set forth in the section titled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s Form 10-K, the following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results expressed or implied by forward-looking statements: 

&#8226; 

national and global economic conditions could be less favorable than expected or could have a more direct and pronounced effect on us than expected and adversely affect our ability to continue internal growth and maintain the quality of our earning assets; 

&#8226; 

the markets where we operate and make loans could face challenges; 

&#8226; 

the risks presented by the economy, which could adversely affect credit quality, collateral values, including real estate collateral, investment values, liquidity and loan originations and loan portfolio delinquency rates; 

&#8226; 

the efficiencies and enhanced financial and operating performance we expect to realize from investments in personnel, acquisitions, and infrastructure may not be realized; 

&#8226; 

interest rate changes could significantly reduce net interest income and negatively affect asset yields and funding sources; 

&#8226; 

the effect of the discontinuation or replacement of LIBOR; 

&#8226; 

projected business increases following strategic expansion could be lower than expected; 

&#8226; 

changes in the scope and cost of FDIC insurance and other coverages; 

&#8226; 

the impact of acquired loans on our earnings; 

&#8226; 

changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the FASB or other regulatory agencies could materially affect our financial statements and how we report those results, and expectations and preliminary analysis relating to how such changes will affect our financial results could prove incorrect; 

&#8226; 

changes in laws and regulations affecting our businesses, including changes in the enforcement and interpretation of such laws and regulations by applicable governmental and regulatory agencies; 

&#8226; 

competition among financial institutions and nontraditional providers of financial services could increase significantly; 

&#8226; 

continued consolidation in the Northwest financial services industry resulting in the creation of larger financial institutions that may have greater resources could change the competitive landscape; 

&#8226; 

the goodwill we have recorded in connection with acquisitions could become impaired, which may have an adverse impact on our earnings and capital; 

&#8226; 

our ability to identify and address cyber-security risks, including security breaches, &#8220;denial of service attacks,&#8221; &#8220;hacking&#8221; and identity theft; 

&#8226; 

any material failure or interruption of our information and communications systems; 

&#8226; 

our ability to keep pace with technological changes; 

&#8226; 

our ability to effectively manage credit risk, interest rate risk, market risk, operational risk, legal risk, liquidity risk and regulatory and compliance risk; 

&#8226; 

failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures; 

&#8226; 

the effect of geopolitical instability, including wars, conflicts and terrorist attacks; 

&#8226; 

our profitability measures could be adversely affected if we are unable to effectively manage our capital; 

&#8226; 

natural disasters, including earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, fires and other unexpected events; 

&#8226; 

the effect of COVID-19 and other infectious illness outbreaks that may arise in the future, which has created significant impacts and uncertainties in U.S. and global markets; 

&#8226; 

changes in governmental policy and regulation, including measures taken in response to economic, business, political and social conditions, including with regard to COVID-19; and 

&#8226; 

the effects of any damage to our reputation resulting from developments related to any of the items identified above. 

You should take into account that forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report. Given the described uncertainties and risks, we cannot guarantee our future performance or results of operations and you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required under federal securities laws.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Management has identified the accounting policies related to the ACL, business combinations and the valuation and recoverability of goodwill as critical to an understanding of our financial statements. These policies and related estimates are discussed in &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; under the headings &#8220;Adoption of Allowance for Credit Losses - ASC 326,&#8221; &#8220;Business Combinations&#8221; and &#8220;Valuation and Recoverability of Goodwill&#8221; in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have not been any material changes in our critical accounting policies as compared to those disclosed in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Our results of operations are dependent to a large degree on our net interest income. We also generate noninterest income from our broad range of products and services including treasury management, wealth management and debit and credit cards. Our operating expenses consist primarily of compensation and employee benefits, occupancy, data processing and legal and professional fees. Like most financial institutions, our interest income and cost of funds are affected significantly by general economic conditions, particularly changes in market interest rates, and by government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. 

COVID-19 Update 

We continue to closely monitor the progress of COVID-19 and to adapt our business in response to the pandemic to provide support for our team members and clients. We are staying in close contact with team members who have concerns or potential exposure in order to determine the best actions to maintain employee and client safety. Team members with the ability to work remotely have been encouraged to continue doing so while branches and offices have implemented disinfecting protocols and social distancing policies. Our comprehensive disinfecting protocols and social distancing and face-covering guidance meet or exceed requirements of all of our health department jurisdictions, and we are updating and adjusting those requirements as the situation evolves, and communicating expectations across our footprint. Our multi-layered safety plan incorporates a lot of flexibility, including remote work when practical, and it is working well to minimize opportunities for infection within the bank. 

Our branch lobbies have remained open and we have encouraged the use of the drive through for social distancing purposes. Branch hours have been adjusted on a case by case basis depending upon employee availability. No branch has had their hours changed or closed for an extended period of time. Our clients have received support through payment deferral programs as well as a variety of options from the SBA including the PPP, the Economic Injury Disaster Loan and other deferral and automatic debt relief programs. Our participation in the PPP will increase our loan balances and loan interest income over the period those loans are outstanding. As of June 30, 2020, we had $941.4 million of PPP loans outstanding and had granted short-term payment deferrals on $1.58 billion of loans. 

We have launched two community focused initiatives in response to the pandemic, putting more than $1 million to work in support of our local communities. The Pass It On Project is designed to provide small businesses more than $500,000 to perform services for community members whose lives have been adversely impacted by the pandemic or the economic downturn it caused. The program will support more than 350 small businesses and many more individuals in the Northwest as we continue to manage through the pandemic and economic recovery. The COVID-19 Community Relief fund put more than $500,000 in the hands of 25 non-profit organizations working to provide relief for those affected by the pandemic in the Northwest. We have also been working with our non-profit community partners by lifting restrictions on sponsorships and contributions to allow organizations to rededicate the funds to COVID-19 response and recovery. 

The measures we have taken in response to the pandemic have enabled us to continue all operations as COVID-19 spread in the Northwest. We continue to monitor the pandemic and adjust our response in concert with local government and healthcare officials. 

For additional information on the impact and potential impact of COVID-19 on our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations, see Part II Item 1A &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; of this report.

Earnings Summary 

Comparison of current quarter to prior year period 

The Company reported net income for the second quarter of $36.6 million or $0.52 per diluted common share, compared to $51.7 million or $0.71 per diluted common share for the second quarter of 2019 . Net interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2020 was $121.9 million , a decrease of $3.3 million from the prior year period. The decrease was a result of a reduction in interest income on loans due to the lower rate environment partially offset by an increase in interest income on loans and securities due to higher average balances. The decrease in interest income was also partially offset by favorable decreases in interest expense from interest-bearing deposits and FHLB advances resulting from lower rates. 

The provision for credit losses for the second quarter of 2020 was $33.5 million compared to $218 thousand for the second quarter of 2019 . The increase in provision expense for the second quarter of 2020 compared to one year ago was principally the result of COVID-19 and the corresponding downturn in local, national and world economies as well as increased unemployment rates. 

Noninterest income for the current quarter was $37.3 million , an increase of $11.6 million from the prior year period. The increase was principally due to the sale of Visa Class B restricted stock that resulted in an observable market price and subsequent upward adjustment to the carrying value of remaining shares for a total gain of $16.4 million. Partially offsetting these gains were decreases in deposit account and treasury management fees and a BOLI benefit that was recognized during the second quarter of 2019 . 

Total noninterest expense for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 was $80.8 million , a decrease of $5.9 million from the prior year period. This decrease was primarily driven by the lower compensation and benefits expense related to the deferral of labor costs for the PPP loans. Legal and professional fees also declined but were partially offset by an increase in other expenses. 

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

The Company reported net income for the six months ended June 30, 2020 of $51.2 million or $0.72 per diluted common share, compared to $97.6 million or $1.33 per diluted common share for the same period in 2019 . Net interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2020 was $244.3 million , a decrease of $1.9 million from the prior year period. The decrease was a result of a reduction in interest income on loans due to the lower rate environment partially offset by increases in interest income on loans and securities due to higher average balances. The decrease in interest income was also partially offset by favorable decreases in interest expense from interest-bearing deposits and FHLB advances primarily resulting from lower rates. 

The provision for credit losses for the six months ended June 30, 2020 was $75.0 million compared to a provision of $1.6 million for the first six months of 2019 . The increase in the provision for the first six months of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic which has negatively affected the economy and increased unemployment rates, similar to the quarterly results above. 

Noninterest income for the six months ended June 30, 2020 was $58.5 million , an increase of $11.1 million from the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to the previously noted $16.4 million gain from the sale and upward adjustment to the carrying value of the Visa Class B restricted shares to the market price and loan revenue. These increases were partially offset by decreases in deposit account and treasury management fees. 

For the six months ended June 30, 2020 , noninterest expense was $165.1 million , a decrease of $6.3 million from $171.4 million for the same period in 2019 . The decrease from the prior year period was driven by lower legal and professional fees, compensation and employee benefits and B&#38;O tax expenses which were partially offset by higher other expenses.

Nonaccrual loans have been included in the tables as loans carrying a zero yield. Amortized net deferred loan fees and net unearned discounts on acquired loans were included in the interest income calculations. The amortization of net deferred loan fees was $5.1 million and $2.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. The incremental accretion income on acquired loans was $1.7 million and $2.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. 

(2) 

Tax-exempt income is calculated on a tax equivalent basis. The tax equivalent yield adjustment to interest earned on loans was $1.2 million and $1.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. The tax equivalent yield adjustment to interest earned on tax exempt securities was $600 thousand and $721 thousand for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 , respectively.

Nonaccrual loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield. Amortized net deferred loan fees and net unearned discounts on acquired loans were included in the interest income calculations. The amortization of net deferred loan fees was $7.5 million and $4.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. The incremental accretion income on acquired loans was $3.2 million and $4.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. 

(2) 

Tax-exempt income is calculated on a tax equivalent basis. The tax equivalent yield adjustment to interest earned on loans was $2.5 million and $2.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. The tax equivalent yield adjustment to interest earned on tax exempt securities was $1.2 million and $1.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 , respectively.

Comparison of current quarter to prior year period 

Net interest income for the second quarter of 2020 was $121.9 million , down from $125.1 million for the same quarter in 2019 . The decrease was a result of a reduction in interest income on loans due to the lower rate environment. This decrease was partially offset by the increase in the average balance of the loan portfolio, an increase in interest income from securities due to higher average balances and decreases in interest expense on interest-bearing deposits and FHLB advances due to lower rates. 

The Company&#8217;s net interest margin (tax equivalent) decreased to 3.64% in the second quarter of 2020 , from 4.40% for the prior year period. This decrease was driven by lower rates on the loan and securities portfolios as well as higher average interest-earning deposits with banks. The Company&#8217;s operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) (1) decreased to 3.64% from 4.38% during the second quarter of 2019 . The decrease was due to the items previously noted for the decrease in the net interest margin. 

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

The results for the first half of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 were similar to the quarterly results. Net interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2020 was $244.3 million , relative to $246.1 million for the prior year period. The decrease in net interest income on loans was due to the lower rate environment partially offset by increases in interest income on loans and securities due to higher average balances. The decrease in interest income was also partially offset by favorable decreases in interest expense from interest-bearing deposits and FHLB advances primarily resulting from lower rates. 

(1) Operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the &#8220;Non-GAAP financial measures&#8221; section in this Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis. 

Table of Contents 

The Company&#8217;s net interest margin (tax equivalent) decreased to 3.82% for the first six months of 2020 , from 4.36% for the prior year period. The decrease in the Company&#8217;s net interest margin (tax equivalent) was a result of lower rates on our loans and securities, partially offset by lower rates on the deposits and FHLB borrowings. The Company&#8217;s operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) for the six months ended June 30, 2020 was 3.82% compared to 4.36% for the six months ended June 30, 2019 . The decrease was due to the items previously noted for the decrease in the net interest margin. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

Comparison of current quarter to prior year period 

During the second quarter of 2020 , the Company recorded a $33.5 million net provision for credit losses, under the CECL methodology, compared to a $218 thousand net provision, under the previous ALLL methodology, during the second quarter of 2019 . The increase in provision expense for the second quarter of 2020 compared to one year ago was principally the result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the corresponding downturn in local, national and world economies as well as increased unemployment rates. As a result, we have increased our reserves for lifetime credit losses. 

The net provision for credit losses recorded during the current quarter also included management&#8217;s ongoing assessment of the credit quality of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio. Other factors affecting the provision include net charge-offs, credit quality migration, and size and composition of the loan portfolio and changes in the economic environment during the second quarter of 2020 . The amount of provision was calculated in accordance with the Company&#8217;s methodology for determining the ACL, discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 1. Financial Statements (unaudited)&#8221; of this report. 

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

The provision for credit losses for the six months ended June 30, 2020 was $75.0 million compared to $1.6 million during the same period in 2019 . The increase in the provision for the first six months of 2020 was due to the same factors discussed above for the quarterly provision for credit losses. The amount of provision was calculated in accordance with the Company&#8217;s methodology for determining the ACL, discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 1. Financial Statements (unaudited)&#8221; of this report.

Comparison of current quarter to prior year period 

Noninterest income was $37.3 million for the second quarter of 2020 , compared to $25.6 million for the same period in 2019 . The increase was principally due to the sale of 17,360 shares of Visa Class B restricted stock for a gain of $3.0 million which resulted in an observable market price. As a result, the Company wrote up its remaining 77,683 Visa Class B restricted shares to fair value resulting in a gain of $13.4 million, for a total gain of $16.4 million. Based on the transfer restrictions and uncertainty of Visa&#8217;s covered litigation, the Visa Class B restricted shares were previously carried at a zero-cost basis. Partially offsetting these gains were decreases of $1.2 million in overdraft fees, $1.1 million in treasury management fees and a $3.0 million BOLI benefit that was recognized during the second quarter of 2019 . The decrease in overdraft fees was due to an overall decrease in the number of transactions during this period as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as clients generally carrying higher balances in their deposit accounts. 

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

For the six months ended June 30, 2020 , noninterest income was $58.5 million compared to $47.3 million for the same period in 2019 , an increase of $11.1 million . The increase was primarily due to the previously noted $16.4 million gain from the sale and write-up of Visa Class B restricted shares to fair value during the second quarter of 2020 . Loan revenue increased during the first half of 2020 due to increases in investor premiums earned due to a higher volume of mortgage loan originations through our held for sale program and interest rate swap income. These increases were partially offset by decreases in treasury management fees and overdraft fees which are included in the deposit account and treasury management fees line item in the table above.

Comparison of current quarter to prior year period 

Noninterest expense was $80.8 million for the second quarter of 2020 , a decrease of $5.9 million from $86.7 million for the prior year period. This decrease was primarily driven by lower compensation and employee benefits and legal and professional expenses partially offset by higher other expenses. The decline in compensation and employee benefits was due to labor costs capitalized related to the origination of PPP loans during the second quarter of 2020 which reduced compensation and benefits expense. These labor costs are capitalized and amortized as a reduction in interest income over the life of the loan. Legal and professional fees also declined compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to lower expenses tied to digital corporate initiatives. Partially offsetting these decreases was a $2.6 million increase in the provision for unfunded loan commitments which is included in other noninterest expense in the table above.

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

For the six months ended June 30, 2020 , noninterest expense was $165.1 million , compared to $171.4 million for the same period in 2019, a decrease of $6.3 million . The decrease from the prior year period was driven by lower legal and professional fees, compensation and employee benefits and B&#38;O tax expenses which were partially offset by higher other expenses. Legal and professional fees were down compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to lower expenses tied to digital corporate initiatives. The decrease in compensation and benefits was similar to the quarterly results which related to the capitalization of labor costs on the origination of PPP loans while B&#38;O taxes were down due to a refund received for taxes paid in prior periods. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in the provision for unfunded loan commitments which is included in other noninterest expense in the table above. 

The provision for unfunded loan commitments for the periods indicated are as follows: &#160;

Income Taxes 

We recorded an income tax provision of $8.2 million for the second quarter of 2020 , compared to a provision of $12.1 million for the same period in 2019 , with effective tax rates of 18% and 19% for the second quarter of 2020 and 2019 , respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 , we recorded income tax provisions of $11.4 million and $22.9 million , respectively, with effective tax rates of 18% for the current year and 19% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate remains lower than the statutory tax rate due to tax-exempt income from municipal securities, BOLI and certain loan receivables. For additional information, please refer to the Company&#8217;s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 . 

FINANCIAL CONDITION 

Total assets were $15.92 billion at June 30, 2020 , an increase of $1.84 billion from December 31, 2019 . Cash and cash equivalents increased $850.0 million . Loans increased $1.03 billion during the first six months of 2020 , which was primarily the result of new loan production, supplemented by PPP loans, partially offset by payments. Debt securities available for sale were $3.69 billion at June 30, 2020 , a decrease of $52.4 million from December 31, 2019 . Total liabilities were $13.64 billion as of June 30, 2020 , an increase of $1.72 billion from December 31, 2019 . The increase was primarily due to an increase in deposits driven by PPP loan funds being deposited into our clients&#8217; deposit accounts, partially offset by a decrease in FHLB advances. 

Investment Securities 

At June 30, 2020 , the Company&#8217;s investment portfolio primarily consisted of debt securities available for sale totaling $3.69 billion compared to $3.75 billion at December 31, 2019 . The decrease in the debt securities portfolio from year-end is due to $458.9 million in maturities, repayments and sales and $12.1 million in premium amortization offset by $259.2 million in purchases and $159.4 million in net unrealized gain. The average duration of our debt securities investment portfolio was approximately 4 years and 6 months at June 30, 2020 . This duration takes into account calls, where appropriate, and consensus prepayment speeds. 

The investment securities are used by the Company as a component of its balance sheet management strategies. From time-to-time, securities may be sold to reposition the portfolio in response to strategies developed by the Company&#8217;s asset liability management committee. In accordance with our investment strategy, management monitors market conditions with a view to realize gains on its available for sale securities portfolio when prudent. 

The Company performs a quarterly assessment of the debt securities available for sale in its investment portfolio that have an unrealized loss to determine whether the decline in the fair value of these securities below their amortized cost basis has resulted in a credit loss. A credit loss exists when it becomes probable that the Company will be unable to recover the entire amortized cost basis of its investment. The Company&#8217;s impairment assessment takes into consideration factors such as defaults or deferrals of scheduled interest or principal, external credit ratings and recent downgrades, internal assessment of credit quality, and whether the Company intends to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis. If a decline in fair value is determined to result in a credit loss, an allowance is recorded. 

Table of Contents 

When there are credit losses associated with a debt security and the Company does not have the intent to sell the security and it is more likely than not that it will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis, the Company will separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit-related and the amount related to non-credit factors. The credit-related impairment is recognized in earnings through an allowance and the non-credit-related impairment is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. 

At June 30, 2020 , the market value of debt securities available for sale had a net unrealized gain of $202.5 million compared to a net unrealized gain of $43.0 million at December 31, 2019 . The change in valuation was the result of fluctuations in market interest rates during the six months ended June 30, 2020 . At June 30, 2020 , the Company had $124.0 million of debt securities available for sale with gross unrealized losses of $1.5 million ; however, we did not consider these investment securities to have an indicated credit loss.

Credit Risk Management 

The extension of credit in the form of loans or other credit substitutes to individuals and businesses is one of our principal commerce activities. Our policies, as well as applicable laws, and regulations, require risk analysis as well as ongoing portfolio and credit management. We manage our credit risk through lending limit constraints, credit review, approval policies, and extensive, ongoing internal monitoring. We also manage credit risk through diversification of the loan portfolio by type of loan, type of industry and type of borrower and by limiting the aggregation of debt to a single borrower. 

In analyzing our existing portfolio, we review our consumer and residential loan portfolios by their performance as a pool of loans, since no single loan is individually significant or judged by its risk rating, size or potential risk of loss. In contrast, the monitoring process for the commercial business, real estate construction, and commercial real estate portfolios includes periodic reviews of individual loans with risk ratings assigned to each loan and performance judged on a loan-by-loan basis. 

We review these loans to assess the ability of our borrowers to service all interest and principal obligations and, as a result, the risk rating may be adjusted accordingly. In the event that full collection of principal and interest is not reasonably assured, the loan is appropriately downgraded and, if warranted, placed on nonaccrual status even though the loan may be current as to principal and interest payments. Additionally, we assess whether an individually measured allowance is required for collateral dependent nonaccrual loans with balances equal to or greater than $500,000 and with respect to which foreclosure is probable. For the individually measured collateral dependent nonaccrual loan, the allowance for credit losses is equal to the difference between amortized cost of the loan and the determined value of the collateral. However, if the determined value of the collateral is greater than the amortized cost of the loan, no allowance for credit losses will be added for these loans. 

For additional discussion on our methodology in managing credit risk within our loan portfolio, see the &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; section in this Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of the Company&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Table of Contents 

Loan policies, credit quality criteria, portfolio guidelines and other controls are established under the guidance of our Chief Credit Officer and approved, as appropriate, by the Board of Directors. Credit Administration, together with the management loan committee, has the responsibility for administering the credit approval process. As another part of its control process, we use an internal credit review and examination function to provide reasonable assurance that loans and commitments are made and maintained as prescribed by our credit policies. Examinations are performed to ensure continued performance and proper risk assessment.

Total loans increased $1.03 billion from year-end 2019 . This increase was primarily the result of providing $941.6 million of PPP loans, net of $19.6 million in net deferred fees at June 30, 2020. The PPP loans were originated to provide financial support to small and medium-size businesses to cover payroll and certain other expenses during the COVID-19 pandemic. To further assist our borrowers, the Company also offered short-term loan modifications to support borrowers during the COVID-19 pandemic. At June 30, 2020 , we had granted short-term payment deferrals on $1.58 billion of loans. The loan portfolio continues to be diversified, with the intent to mitigate risk by monitoring concentration in any one sector.

Commercial Real Estate Loans: Commercial real estate loans are secured by properties located within our primary market areas and typically, have loan-to-value ratios of 80% or lower at origination. Our underwriting standards for commercial and multifamily residential loans generally require that the loan-to-value ratio for these loans not exceed 75% of appraised value, cost, or discounted cash flow value, as appropriate, and that commercial properties maintain debt coverage ratios (net operating income divided by annual debt servicing) of 1.2 or better. However, underwriting standards can be influenced by competition and other factors. We endeavor to maintain the highest practical underwriting standards while balancing the need to remain competitive in our lending practices. 

Commercial Business Loans: We are committed to providing competitive commercial lending in our primary market area. Management expects a continued focus within its commercial lending products and to emphasize, in particular, relationship banking with businesses and business owners. 

Table of Contents 

Agriculture Loans: Agricultural lending includes agricultural real estate and production loans and lines of credit within our primary market area. We are committed to our Pacific Northwest communities offering seasonal and longer-term loans and operating lines of credit by lending officers with expertise in the agricultural communities we serve. Typical loan-to-value ratios on term loans can range from 55% to 80% depending upon the type of loan. Operating lines of credit require the borrower to provide a 20% to 25% equity investment. The debt coverage ratio is generally 1.25:1 or better on all term loans. 

Construction Loans: We originate a variety of real estate construction loans. Underwriting guidelines for these loans vary by loan type but include loan-to-value limits, term limits and loan advance limits, as applicable. Our underwriting guidelines for commercial and multifamily residential real estate construction loans generally require that the loan-to-value ratio not exceed 75% and stabilized debt coverage ratios (net operating income divided by annual debt service) of 1.2 or better. As noted above, underwriting standards can be influenced by competition and other factors. However, we endeavor to maintain the highest practical underwriting standards while balancing the need to remain competitive in our lending practices. 

One-to-four Family Residential Real Estate Loans: One-to-four family residential loans, including home equity loans and lines of credit, are secured by properties located within our primary market areas and, typically, have loan-to-value ratios of 80% or lower at origination. 

Other Consumer Loans: Consumer loans include automobile loans, boat and recreational vehicle financing, and other miscellaneous personal loans. 

Foreign Loans: The Company has no material foreign activities. Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s loans and unfunded commitments are geographically concentrated in its service areas within the states of Washington, Oregon and Idaho. 

For additional information on our loan portfolio, including amounts pledged as collateral on borrowings, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 1. Financial Statements (unaudited)&#8221; of this report. 

Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming assets consist of: (i) nonaccrual loans, which generally are loans placed on a nonaccrual basis when the loan becomes past due 90 days or when there are otherwise serious doubts about the collectability of principal or interest within the existing terms of the loan, (ii) OREO and (iii) OPPO, if applicable.

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The ACL is an accounting estimate of expected credit losses in our loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The provision for credit losses is the expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income to adjust the ACL to the levels deemed appropriate by management, as measured by the Company&#8217;s credit loss estimation methodologies. The allowance for unfunded commitments and letters of credit is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated expected losses related to these unfunded credit facilities at the balance sheet date. 

At June 30, 2020 , our ACL was $151.5 million , or 1.55% of total loans (excluding loans held for sale). This compares with an ALLL of $84.0 million , or 0.96% of total loans (excluding loans held for sale) at December 31, 2019 and an ALLL of $80.5 million or 0.93% of total loans (excluding loans held for sale) at June 30, 2019 . The increase was primarily the result of COVID-19 and the corresponding downturn in the local, national and world economies as well as increased unemployment rates. The ACL at June 30, 2020 does not include a reserve for the PPP loans as they are fully guaranteed by the SBA.

Liquidity and Sources of Funds 

Our primary sources of funds are customer deposits. Additionally, we utilize advances from the FHLB, borrowings from the FRB, sweep repurchase agreements, subordinated debentures assumed in acquisitions and a revolving line of credit to supplement our funding needs. These funds, together with loan repayments, loan sales, retained earnings, equity and other borrowed funds are used to make loans, to acquire securities, meet deposit withdrawals and maturing liabilities, to acquire other assets and to fund continuing operations. 

In addition, we have a shelf registration statement on file with the SEC registering an unspecified amount of any combination of debt or equity securities, depositary shares, purchase contracts, units and warrants in one or more offerings. Specific information regarding the terms of and the securities being offered will be provided at the time of any offering. Proceeds from any future offerings are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the repayment of debt, repurchasing or redeeming outstanding securities, working capital, funding future acquisitions or other purposes identified at the time of any offering. 

Deposit Activities 

Our deposit products include a wide variety of transaction accounts, savings accounts and time deposit accounts. We have established a branch system to serve our consumer and business depositors. Deposits increased $2.40 billion from December 31, 2019 . The addition of PPP loans during the current quarter had a notable impact on our deposits, as our clients deposited these funds into their deposit accounts. In addition, management&#8217;s strategy for funding asset growth is to make use of public funds and brokered and other wholesale deposits on an as-needed basis. The Company participates in the CDARS &#174; program. CDARS &#174; is a network that allows participating banks to offer extended FDIC deposit insurance coverage on time deposits. The Company also participates in a similar program to offer extended FDIC deposit insurance coverage on money market accounts. These extended deposit insurance programs are generally available only to existing customers and are not used as a means of generating additional liquidity. At June 30, 2020 , brokered deposits, reciprocal money market accounts and other wholesale deposits (excluding public funds) totaled $577.7 million , or 4.4% of total deposits, compared to $329.5 million or 3.1% at year-end 2019 . These deposits have varied maturities.

Borrowings 

We rely on FHLB advances and FRB borrowings as another source of both short and long-term funding. FHLB advances and FRB borrowings are secured by investment securities, and residential, commercial and commercial real estate loans. At June 30, 2020 , we had FHLB advances of $157.4 million compared to $953.5 million at December 31, 2019 . 

We also utilize wholesale and retail repurchase agreements to supplement our funding sources. Our wholesale repurchase agreements are secured by mortgage-backed securities. At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , we had deposit customer sweep-related repurchase agreements of $51.5 million and $64.4 million , respectively, which mature on a daily basis. 

Subordinated debentures are another source of funding. The Company assumed $35.0 million in aggregate principal amount with its acquisition of Pacific Continental on November 1, 2017. These subordinated debentures, which are unsecured, are callable on June 30, 2021 and have a stated maturity date of June 30, 2026. 

The Company has a $15.0 million short-term credit facility with an unaffiliated bank. This facility provides the Company additional liquidity, if needed, for various corporate activities including the repurchase of shares of Columbia Banking System, Inc. common stock. At both June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , there was no balance associated with this credit facility. The credit agreement requires the Company to comply with certain covenants including those related to asset quality and capital levels. The Company was in compliance with all covenants associated with this facility at June 30, 2020 . 

Management anticipates we will continue to rely on FHLB advances, FRB borrowings, the short-term credit facility and wholesale and retail repurchase agreements in the future. We will use those funds primarily to make loans and purchase securities. 

Contractual Obligations, Commitments &#38; Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We are party to many contractual financial obligations, including repayments of borrowings, operating and equipment lease payments, off-balance sheet commitments to extend credit and investments in affordable housing partnerships. At June 30, 2020 , we had commitments to extend credit of $2.67 billion compared to $2.70 billion at December 31, 2019 . 

Capital Resources 

Shareholders&#8217; equity at June 30, 2020 was $2.28 billion , compared to $2.16 billion at December 31, 2019 . Shareholders&#8217; equity was 14% and 15% of total period-end assets at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. 

Regulatory Capital 

In July 2013, the federal bank regulators approved the Capital Rules (as discussed in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, &#8220;Item 1. Business&#8212;Supervision and Regulation and &#8212;Regulatory Capital Requirements&#8221;), which implement the Basel III capital framework and various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, which were fully phased in as of January 1, 2019. As of June 30, 2020 , we and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements under the Capital Rules. 

FDIC regulations set forth the qualifications necessary for a bank to be classified as &#8220;well-capitalized,&#8221; primarily for assignment of FDIC insurance premium rates. Failure to qualify as &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; can negatively impact a bank&#8217;s ability to expand and to engage in certain activities. The Company and the Bank qualified as &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . 

As part of its response to the impact of COVID-19, the U.S. federal regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that provided the option to temporarily delay certain effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three year transition period. The interim final rule allows bank holding companies and banks to delay for two years 100% of the day one impact of adopting CECL and 25% of the cumulative change in the reported allowance for credit losses since adopting CECL. The Company elected to adopt the interim final rule. As a result, capital ratios and amounts as of June 30, 2020 exclude the impact of the increased allowance for credit losses related to the adoption of CECL.

Stock Repurchase Program 

As described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to 2.9 million shares, up to a maximum aggregate purchase price of $100.0 million. The share repurchase authorization expired in May of 2020. There were no share repurchases during the three months ended June 30, 2020 . The Company repurchased 731 thousand shares of common stock totaling $20.0 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020 . 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

The Company considers operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) to be a useful measurement as it more closely reflects the ongoing operating performance of the Company. Additionally, presentation of the operating net interest margin allows readers to compare certain aspects of the Company&#8217;s net interest margin to other organizations that may not have had significant acquisitions. Despite the usefulness of the operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) to the Company, there is no standardized definition for it and, as a result, the Company&#8217;s calculations may not be comparable with other organizations. The Company encourages readers to consider its Consolidated Financial Statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. 

The following table reconciles the Company&#8217;s calculation of the operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) to the net interest margin (tax equivalent) for the periods indicated:
