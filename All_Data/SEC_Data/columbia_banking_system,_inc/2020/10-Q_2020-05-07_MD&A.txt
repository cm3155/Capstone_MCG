CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This quarterly report on Form 10-Q may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions that are not historical facts, and statements identified by words such as &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;projects,&#8221; &#8220;seeks,&#8221; &#8220;estimates&#8221; or the negative version of those words or other comparable words or phrases of a future or forward-looking nature, as well as the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company&#8217;s business, operations, financial performance and prospects. Forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs and expectations of management and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change. In addition to the factors set forth in the section titled &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in this report and the factors set forth in the section titled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s Form 10-K, the following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results expressed or implied by forward-looking statements: 

&#8226; 

national and global economic conditions could be less favorable than expected or could have a more direct and pronounced effect on us than expected and adversely affect our ability to continue internal growth and maintain the quality of our earning assets; 

&#8226; 

the markets where we operate and make loans could face challenges; 

&#8226; 

the risks presented by the economy, which could adversely affect credit quality, collateral values, including real estate collateral, investment values, liquidity and loan originations and loan portfolio delinquency rates; 

&#8226; 

the efficiencies and enhanced financial and operating performance we expect to realize from investments in personnel, acquisitions, and infrastructure may not be realized; 

&#8226; 

interest rate changes could significantly reduce net interest income and negatively affect asset yields and funding sources; 

&#8226; 

the effect of changes to or discontinuation or replacement of LIBOR; 

&#8226; 

projected business increases following strategic expansion could be lower than expected; 

&#8226; 

changes in the scope and cost of FDIC insurance and other coverages; 

&#8226; 

the impact of acquired loans on our earnings; 

&#8226; 

changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the FASB or other regulatory agencies could materially affect our financial statements and how we report those results, and expectations and preliminary analysis relating to how such changes will affect our financial results could prove incorrect; 

&#8226; 

changes in laws and regulations affecting our businesses, including changes in the enforcement and interpretation of such laws and regulations by applicable governmental and regulatory agencies; 

&#8226; 

competition among financial institutions and nontraditional providers of financial services could increase significantly; 

&#8226; 

continued consolidation in the Northwest financial services industry resulting in the creation of larger financial institutions that may have greater resources could change the competitive landscape; 

&#8226; 

the goodwill we have recorded in connection with acquisitions could become impaired, which may have an adverse impact on our earnings and capital; 

&#8226; 

our ability to identify and address cyber-security risks, including security breaches, &#8220;denial of service attacks,&#8221; &#8220;hacking&#8221; and identity theft; 

&#8226; 

any material failure or interruption of our information and communications systems; 

&#8226; 

our ability to keep pace with technological changes; 

&#8226; 

our ability to effectively manage credit risk, interest rate risk, market risk, operational risk, legal risk, liquidity risk and regulatory and compliance risk; 

&#8226; 

failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures; 

&#8226; 

the effect of geopolitical instability, including wars, conflicts and terrorist attacks; 

&#8226; 

our profitability measures could be adversely affected if we are unable to effectively manage our capital; 

&#8226; 

natural disasters, including earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, fires and other unexpected events; 

&#8226; 

the effect of COVID-19 and other infectious illness outbreaks that may arise in the future, which has created significant impacts and uncertainties in U.S. and global markets; 

&#8226; 

changes in governmental policy and regulation, including measures taken in response to economic, business, political and social conditions, including with regard to COVID-19; and 

&#8226; 

the effects of any damage to our reputation resulting from developments related to any of the items identified above. 

You should take into account that forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Management has identified the accounting policies related to the ACL, business combinations and the valuation and recoverability of goodwill as critical to an understanding of our financial statements. These policies and related estimates are discussed in &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; under the headings &#8220;Adoption of Allowance for Credit Losses - ASC 326,&#8221; &#8220;Business Combinations&#8221; and &#8220;Valuation and Recoverability of Goodwill&#8221; in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have not been any material changes in our critical accounting policies as compared to those disclosed in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Our results of operations are dependent to a large degree on our net interest income. We also generate noninterest income from our broad range of products and services including treasury management, wealth management and debit and credit cards. Our operating expenses consist primarily of compensation and employee benefits, occupancy, data processing and legal and professional fees. Like most financial institutions, our interest income and cost of funds are affected significantly by general economic conditions, particularly changes in market interest rates, and by government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. 

COVID-19 Update 

We began closely monitoring the progress of COVID-19 early and enacted our pandemic plan in January to provide support for our team members and clients. Our initial steps encouraged employees with underlying health concerns or family members at risk to stay home, allowing them to draw from a pool of emergency sick leave dedicated for pandemic related use. Team members with the ability to work remotely were encouraged to do so while branches and offices began following disinfecting protocols and social distancing policies. All non-exempt employees who continue to work on location were included in an additional premium pay program. Our clients have received support through payment deferral programs as well as a variety of options from the SBA including the Paycheck Protection Program, the Economic Injury Disaster Loan and other deferral and automatic debt relief programs. Our participation in the Paycheck Protection Program will increase our loan balances and loan interest income over the period those loans are outstanding. As of April 30, 2020, we had granted short-term payment deferrals on $1.29 billion of loans. We have also been working with our non-profit community partners by lifting restrictions on sponsorships and contributions to allow organizations to rededicate the funds to COVID-19 response and recovery. 

Advanced preparation and early action enabled us to continue all operations as COVID-19 spread in the Northwest. We continue to monitor the pandemic and adjust our response in concert with local government and healthcare officials. 

For additional information on the impact and potential impact of COVID-19 on our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations, see Part II Item 1A &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; of this report. 

Earnings Summary 

Comparison of current quarter to prior year period 

The Company reported net income for the first quarter of $14.6 million or $0.20 per diluted common share, compared to $45.9 million or $0.63 per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2019 . Net interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2020 was $122.4 million , an increase of $1.4 million from the prior year period. The increase was a result of higher interest income on securities and higher average balances of securities. These increases were also partially offset by higher interest expense due to higher average balances of FHLB advances. 

The provision for credit losses for the first quarter of 2020 was $41.5 million compared to $1.4 million during the first quarter of 2019 . The increase in provision expense for the first quarter of 2020 compared to one year ago was principally the result of the recent COVID-19 pandemic that has created significant volatility in the local, national and world economies. 

Noninterest income for the current quarter was $21.2 million , a decrease of $489 thousand from the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to lower treasury management fees and lower net securities gains partially offset by higher loan revenue during the first quarter of 2020 . 

Total noninterest expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 was $84.3 million , a decrease of $429 thousand from the prior year period. This decrease was primarily driven by lower legal and professional fees, B&#38;O taxes and regulatory premiums partially offset by increases in compensation and employee benefits and other noninterest expense.

Nonaccrual loans have been included in the tables as loans carrying a zero yield. Amortized net deferred loan fees and net unearned discounts on acquired loans were included in the interest income calculations. The amortization of net deferred loan fees was $2.4 million and $2.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. The incremental accretion income on acquired loans was $1.5 million and $2.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. 

(2) 

Tax-exempt income is calculated on a tax equivalent basis. The tax equivalent yield adjustment to interest earned on loans was $1.3 million for both the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 . The tax equivalent yield adjustment to interest earned on tax exempt securities was $612 thousand and $789 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. 

(3) 

Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation to show a separate row for interest-bearing public funds, other than certificates of deposit.

Comparison of current quarter to prior year period 

Net interest income for the first quarter of 2020 was $122.4 million , up from $121.0 million for the same quarter in 2019 . The increase was a result of higher interest income on securities primarily due to $1.9 million of interest income and discount accretion related to the early payoff of three securities and higher average balances of securities. Interest income from loans also had a positive impact as a result of higher average balances although this increase was more than offset by lower interest income due to lower loan rates. The increase in net interest income was partially offset by higher interest expense due to higher average balances of FHLB advances. 

The Company&#8217;s net interest margin (tax equivalent) decreased to 4.00% in the first quarter of 2020 , from 4.32% for the prior year period. This decrease was driven by lower rates on the loan portfolio and higher average balances of FHLB advances. The Company&#8217;s operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) (1) decreased to 4.02% from 4.33% during the first quarter of 2019 . The decrease was due to the items previously noted for the decrease in the net interest margin. 

(1) Operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the &#8220;Non-GAAP financial measures&#8221; section in this Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis.

Provision for Credit Losses 

Comparison of current quarter to prior year period 

Effective January 1, 2020, Columbia adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (&#8220;ASU 2016-13&#8221;) and all related amendments. The ACL under ASU 2016-13 utilizes the CECL methodology which estimates the expected loan losses over the contractual life of the loans in the loan portfolio of the Bank. Prior to January 1, 2020, the ALLL incurred loss methodology was used which estimated the amount of loan losses that had been incurred at the balance sheet date. The day 1 adoption of ASU 2016-13 and related amendments, resulted in an increase of $1.6 million in our ACL, an increase of $1.6 million to our allowance for unfunded commitments and letters of credit and a net-of-tax cumulative-effect adjustment of $2.5 million to decrease the beginning balance of retained earnings. 

During the first quarter of 2020 , the Company recorded a $41.5 million net provision for credit losses, under the CECL methodology, compared to a $1.4 million net provision, under the previous ALLL methodology, during the first quarter of 2019 . The increase in provision expense for the first quarter of 2020 compared to one year ago was principally the result of the recent COVID-19 pandemic that has created significant volatility in the local, national and world economies. With the national guidance regarding social distancing and state and county mandates to shelter or stay at home, many large and small businesses have had to close and there has been a dramatic increase in new unemployment claims. As a result, we have increased our reserves for lifetime credit losses as a result of the economic impact of COVID-19. For additional information on the impact and potential impact of COVID-19 on our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations, see Item 1A &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; of this report. 

The net provision for credit losses recorded during the current quarter also included management&#8217;s ongoing assessment of the credit quality of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio. Other factors affecting the provision include net charge-offs, credit quality migration, and size and composition of the loan portfolio and changes in the economic environment during the first quarter of 2020 . The amount of provision was calculated in accordance with the Company&#8217;s methodology for determining the ACL, discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 1.

Comparison of current quarter to prior year period 

Noninterest income was $21.2 million for the first quarter of 2020 , compared to $21.7 million for the same period in 2019 . The decrease was primarily due to lower deposit account and treasury management fees, principally lower treasury management fees, and lower net investment securities gains partially offset by higher loan revenue during the first quarter of 2020 .

Comparison of current quarter to prior year period 

Noninterest expense was $84.3 million for the first quarter of 2020 , a decrease of $429 thousand from $84.7 million for the prior year period. This decrease was primarily driven by lower legal and professional fees, B&#38;O taxes and regulatory premiums which decreased by $2.5 million , $1.3 million and $950 thousand , respectively. These decreases were partially offset by increases of $2.8 million in compensation and employee benefits expense and $1.1 million in other noninterest expense. The decrease in professional fees was due to lower fees on reciprocal money market accounts as well as lower expenses related to corporate initiatives. B&#38;O tax expense benefited from a refund received in the current quarter for a prior year. Regulatory premiums decreased due to the utilization of $967 thousand of our FDIC Small Bank Assessment Credit. The remaining balance of our credit is $283 thousand but can only be applied towards our future FDIC deposit insurance expense if the fund exceeds its minimum reserve ratio. The increase in compensation and employee benefits was driven by increases in salary expense and incentive and commissions expense. Other noninterest expense increased due to a higher provision for off-balance sheet reserves. 

Income Taxes 

We recorded an income tax provision of $3.2 million for the first quarter of 2020 , compared to a provision of $10.8 million for the same period in 2019 , with effective tax rates of 18% and 19% for the first quarter of 2020 and 2019 , respectively. Our effective tax rate remains lower than the statutory tax rate due to tax-exempt income from municipal securities, BOLI and certain loan receivables. For additional information, please refer to the Company&#8217;s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 . 

FINANCIAL CONDITION 

Total assets were $14.04 billion at March 31, 2020 , a decrease of $41.0 million from December 31, 2019 . Cash and cash equivalents decreased $31.9 million . Loans increased $189.9 million during the first quarter of 2020, which was primarily the result of new loan production and increased seasonal line utilization, partially offset by payments. Debt securities available for sale were $3.55 billion at March 31, 2020 , a decrease of $193.0 million from December 31, 2019 . Total liabilities were $11.82 billion as of March 31, 2020 , a decrease of $94.7 million from December 31, 2019 . The decline was primarily due to a decrease in FHLB advances partially offset by an increase in interest-bearing deposits, specifically public funds, excluding certificates of deposit. 

Investment Securities 

At March 31, 2020 , the Company&#8217;s investment portfolio primarily consisted of debt securities available for sale totaling $3.55 billion compared to $3.75 billion at December 31, 2019 . The decrease in the debt securities portfolio from year-end is due to $328.5 million in maturities, repayments and sales and $5.6 million in premium amortization offset by $103.6 million in net unrealized gain and $37.5 million in purchases. The average duration of our debt securities investment portfolio was approximately 4 years and 9 months at March 31, 2020 . This duration takes into account calls, where appropriate, and consensus prepayment speeds. 

Table of Contents 

The investment securities are used by the Company as a component of its balance sheet management strategies. From time-to-time, securities may be sold to reposition the portfolio in response to strategies developed by the Company&#8217;s asset liability management committee. In accordance with our investment strategy, management monitors market conditions with a view to realize gains on its available for sale securities portfolio when prudent. 

The Company performs a quarterly assessment of the debt securities available for sale in its investment portfolio that have an unrealized loss to determine whether the decline in the fair value of these securities below their amortized cost basis has resulted in a credit loss. A credit loss exists when it becomes probable that the Company will be unable to recover the entire amortized cost basis of its investment. The Company&#8217;s impairment assessment takes into consideration factors such as defaults or deferrals of scheduled interest or principal, external credit ratings and recent downgrades, internal assessment of credit quality, and whether the Company intends to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis. If a decline in fair value is determined to result in a credit loss, an allowance is recorded. 

When there are credit losses associated with an impaired debt security and the Company does not have the intent to sell the security and it is more likely than not that it will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis, the Company will separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit-related and the amount related to non-credit factors. The credit-related impairment is recognized in earnings through an allowance and the non-credit-related impairment is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. 

At March 31, 2020 , the market value of debt securities available for sale had a net unrealized gain of $146.6 million compared to a net unrealized gain of $43.0 million at December 31, 2019 . The change in valuation was the result of fluctuations in market interest rates during the three months ended March 31, 2020 . At March 31, 2020 , the Company had $136.1 million of debt securities available for sale with gross unrealized losses of $1.8 million ; however, we did not consider these investment securities to have an indicated credit loss.

Credit Risk Management 

The extension of credit in the form of loans or other credit substitutes to individuals and businesses is one of our principal commerce activities. Our policies, as well as applicable laws, and regulations, require risk analysis as well as ongoing portfolio and credit management. We manage our credit risk through lending limit constraints, credit review, approval policies, and extensive, ongoing internal monitoring. We also manage credit risk through diversification of the loan portfolio by type of loan, type of industry and type of borrower and by limiting the aggregation of debt to a single borrower. 

In analyzing our existing portfolio, we review our consumer and residential loan portfolios by their performance as a pool of loans, since no single loan is individually significant or judged by its risk rating, size or potential risk of loss. In contrast, the monitoring process for the commercial business, real estate construction, and commercial real estate portfolios includes periodic reviews of individual loans with risk ratings assigned to each loan and performance judged on a loan-by-loan basis. 

Table of Contents 

We review these loans to assess the ability of our borrowers to service all interest and principal obligations and, as a result, the risk rating may be adjusted accordingly. In the event that full collection of principal and interest is not reasonably assured, the loan is appropriately downgraded and, if warranted, placed on nonaccrual status even though the loan may be current as to principal and interest payments. Additionally, we assess whether an individually measured allowance is required for collateral dependent nonaccrual loans with balances equal to or greater than $500,000 and with respect to which foreclosure is probable. For the individually measured collateral dependent nonaccrual loan, the allowance for credit losses is equal to the difference between amortized cost of the loan and the determined value of the collateral. However, if the determined value of the collateral is greater than the amortized cost of the loan, no allowance for credit losses will be added for these loans. 

For additional discussion on our methodology in managing credit risk within our loan portfolio, see the &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; section in this Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of the Company&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Loan policies, credit quality criteria, portfolio guidelines and other controls are established under the guidance of our Chief Credit Officer and approved, as appropriate, by the Board of Directors. Credit Administration, together with the management loan committee, has the responsibility for administering the credit approval process. As another part of its control process, we use an internal credit review and examination function to provide reasonable assurance that loans and commitments are made and maintained as prescribed by our credit policies. Examinations are performed to ensure continued performance and proper risk assessment. 

Loan Portfolio Analysis

Total loans increased $189.9 million from year-end 2019 primarily the result of organic loan production and increased seasonal line utilization, partially offset by principal pay downs. The loan portfolio continues to be diversified, with the intent to mitigate risk by monitoring concentration in any one sector.

Commercial Real Estate Loans: Commercial real estate loans are secured by properties located within our primary market areas and typically, have loan-to-value ratios of 80% or lower at origination. Our underwriting standards for commercial and multifamily residential loans generally require that the loan-to-value ratio for these loans not exceed 75% of appraised value, cost, or discounted cash flow value, as appropriate, and that commercial properties maintain debt coverage ratios (net operating income divided by annual debt servicing) of 1.2 or better. However, underwriting standards can be influenced by competition and other factors. We endeavor to maintain the highest practical underwriting standards while balancing the need to remain competitive in our lending practices. 

Commercial Business Loans: We are committed to providing competitive commercial lending in our primary market areas. Management expects a continued focus within its commercial lending products and to emphasize, in particular, relationship banking with businesses and business owners. 

Agriculture Loans: Agricultural lending includes agricultural real estate and production loans and lines of credit within our primary market areas. We are committed to our Pacific Northwest communities offering seasonal and longer-term loans and operating lines of credit by lending officers with expertise in the agricultural communities we serve. Typical loan-to-value ratios on term loans can range from 55% to 80% depending upon the type of loan. Operating lines of credit require the borrower to provide a 20% to 25% equity investment. The debt coverage ratio is generally 1.25:1 or better on all term loans. 

Construction Loans: We originate a variety of real estate construction loans. Underwriting guidelines for these loans vary by loan type but include loan-to-value limits, term limits and loan advance limits, as applicable. Our underwriting guidelines for commercial and multifamily residential real estate construction loans generally require that the loan-to-value ratio not exceed 75% and stabilized debt coverage ratios (net operating income divided by annual debt servicing) of 1.2 or better. As noted above, underwriting standards can be influenced by competition and other factors. However, we endeavor to maintain the highest practical underwriting standards while balancing the need to remain competitive in our lending practices. 

One-to-four Family Residential Real Estate Loans: One-to-four family residential loans, including home equity loans and lines of credit, are secured by properties located within our primary market areas and, typically, have loan-to-value ratios of 80% or lower at origination. 

Other Consumer Loans: Consumer loans include automobile loans, boat and recreational vehicle financing, and other miscellaneous personal loans. 

Foreign Loans: The Company has no material foreign activities. Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s loans and unfunded commitments are geographically concentrated in its service areas within the states of Washington, Oregon and Idaho. 

For additional information on our loan portfolio, including amounts pledged as collateral on borrowings, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 1. Financial Statements (unaudited)&#8221; of this report. 

Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming assets consist of: (i) nonaccrual loans, which generally are loans placed on a nonaccrual basis when the loan becomes past due 90 days or when there are otherwise serious doubts about the collectability of principal or interest within the existing terms of the loan, (ii) OREO and (iii) OPPO, if applicable.

At March 31, 2020 , nonperforming assets were $48.2 million , compared to $33.6 million at December 31, 2019 . Nonperforming assets increased $14.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020 , primarily due to $10.1 million increase in nonaccrual agriculture loans and a $3.5 million increase in nonaccrual commercial business loans. For information on OREO, see Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 1. Financial Statements (unaudited)&#8221; of this report. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The ACL is an accounting estimate of expected credit losses in our loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The provision for credit losses is the expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income to adjust the ACL to the levels deemed appropriate by management, as measured by the Company&#8217;s credit loss estimation methodologies. The allowance for unfunded commitments and letters of credit is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated expected losses related to these unfunded credit facilities at the balance sheet date. 

At March 31, 2020 , our ACL was $122.1 million , or 1.37% of total loans (excluding loans held for sale). This compares with an ALLL of $84.0 million , or 0.96% of total loans (excluding loans held for sale) at December 31, 2019 and an ALLL of $83.3 million or 0.98% of total loans (excluding loans held for sale) at March 31, 2019 .

Liquidity and Sources of Funds 

Our primary sources of funds are customer deposits. Additionally, we utilize advances from the FHLB, borrowings from the FRB, sweep repurchase agreements, subordinated debentures assumed in acquisitions and a revolving line of credit to supplement our funding needs. These funds, together with loan repayments, loan sales, retained earnings, equity and other borrowed funds are used to make loans, to acquire securities, meet deposit withdrawals and maturing liabilities, to acquire other assets and to fund continuing operations. 

In addition, we have a shelf registration statement on file with the SEC registering an unspecified amount of any combination of debt or equity securities, depositary shares, purchase contracts, units and warrants in one or more offerings. Specific information regarding the terms of and the securities being offered will be provided at the time of any offering. Proceeds from any future offerings are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the repayment of debt, repurchasing or redeeming outstanding securities, working capital, funding future acquisitions or other purposes identified at the time of any offering. 

Deposit Activities 

Our deposit products include a wide variety of transaction accounts, savings accounts and time deposit accounts. We have established a branch system to serve our consumer and business depositors. In addition, management&#8217;s strategy for funding asset growth is to make use of public funds and brokered and other wholesale deposits on an as-needed basis. The Company participates in the CDARS &#174; program. CDARS &#174; is a network that allows participating banks to offer extended FDIC deposit insurance coverage on time deposits. The Company also participates in a similar program to offer extended FDIC deposit insurance coverage on money market accounts. These extended deposit insurance programs are generally available only to existing customers and are not used as a means of generating additional liquidity. At March 31, 2020 , brokered deposits, reciprocal money market accounts and other wholesale deposits (excluding public funds) totaled $407.4 million , or 3.8% of total deposits, compared to $329.5 million or 3.1% at year-end 2019 . These deposits have varied maturities. 

The following table sets forth the Company&#8217;s deposit base by type of product for the dates indicated:

Borrowings 

We rely on FHLB advances and FRB borrowings as another source of both short and long-term funding. FHLB advances and FRB borrowings are secured by investment securities, and residential, commercial and commercial real estate loans. At March 31, 2020 , we had FHLB and FRB borrowings of $712.5 million compared to $953.5 million at December 31, 2019 . 

We also utilize wholesale and retail repurchase agreements to supplement our funding sources. Our wholesale repurchase agreements are secured by mortgage-backed securities. At March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , we had deposit customer sweep-related repurchase agreements of $29.3 million and $64.4 million , respectively, which mature on a daily basis. 

Subordinated debentures are another source of funding. The Company assumed $35.0 million in aggregate principal amount with its acquisition of Pacific Continental on November 1, 2017. These subordinated debentures, which are unsecured, are callable on June 30, 2021 and have a stated maturity date of June 30, 2026. 

During the second quarter of 2019, the Company entered into a $30.0 million short-term credit facility with an unaffiliated bank. This facility provides the Company additional liquidity, if needed, for various corporate activities including the repurchase of shares of Columbia Banking System, Inc. common stock. At March 31, 2020 , we had a balance of $5.0 million associated with this credit facility and no balance at December 31, 2019 . The credit agreement requires the Company to comply with certain covenants including those related to asset quality and capital levels. The Company was in compliance with all covenants associated with this facility at March 31, 2020 . 

Management anticipates we will continue to rely on FHLB advances, FRB borrowings, the short-term credit facility and wholesale and retail repurchase agreements in the future. We will use those funds primarily to make loans and purchase securities. 

Contractual Obligations, Commitments &#38; Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We are party to many contractual financial obligations, including repayments of borrowings, operating and equipment lease payments, off balance sheet commitments to extend credit and investments in affordable housing partnerships. At March 31, 2020 , we had commitments to extend credit of $2.56 billion compared to $2.70 billion at December 31, 2019 . 

Capital Resources 

Shareholders&#8217; equity at March 31, 2020 was $2.21 billion , compared to $2.16 billion at December 31, 2019 . Shareholders&#8217; equity was 16% and 15% of total period-end assets at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. 

Regulatory Capital 

In July 2013, the federal bank regulators approved the Capital Rules (as discussed in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, &#8220;Item 1. Business&#8212;Supervision and Regulation and &#8212;Regulatory Capital Requirements&#8221;), which implement the Basel III capital framework and various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, which were fully phased in as of January 1, 2019. As of March 31, 2020 , we and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements under the Capital Rules. 

FDIC regulations set forth the qualifications necessary for a bank to be classified as &#8220;well-capitalized,&#8221; primarily for assignment of FDIC insurance premium rates. Failure to qualify as &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; can negatively impact a bank&#8217;s ability to expand and to engage in certain activities. The Company and the Bank qualified as &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . 

As part of its response to the impact of COVID-19, the U.S. federal regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that provided the option to temporarily delay certain effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three year transition period. The interim final rule allows bank holding companies and banks to delay for two years 100% of the day one impact of adopting CECL and 25% of the cumulative change in the reported allowance for credit losses since adopting CECL. The Company elected to adopt the interim final rule. As a result, capital ratios and amounts as of March 31, 2020 exclude the impact of the increased allowance for credit losses related to the adoption of CECL.

Stock Repurchase Program 

As described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to 2.9 million shares, up to a maximum aggregate purchase price of $100.0 million. The Company may purchase the shares from time to time in the open market, in private transactions, by direct or derivative purchases or other transactions, under conditions which allow such repurchases to be accretive to EPS while maintaining capital ratios that exceed the guidelines for a well-capitalized financial institution. The Company repurchased 731 thousand shares of common stock totaling $20.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

The Company considers operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) to be a useful measurement as it more closely reflects the ongoing operating performance of the Company. Additionally, presentation of the operating net interest margin allows readers to compare certain aspects of the Company&#8217;s net interest margin to other organizations that may not have had significant acquisitions. Despite the usefulness of the operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) to the Company, there is no standardized definition for it and, as a result, the Company&#8217;s calculations may not be comparable with other organizations. The Company encourages readers to consider its Consolidated Financial Statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. 

The following table reconciles the Company&#8217;s calculation of the operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) to the net interest margin (tax equivalent) for the periods indicated:
