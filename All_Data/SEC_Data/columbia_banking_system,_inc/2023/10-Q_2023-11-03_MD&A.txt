Forward-Looking Statements 

&#160; 

This Quarterly Report in Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbor for "forward-looking statements" provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may include statements that expressly or implicitly predict future results, performance or events. Statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. You can find many of these statements by looking for words such as "anticipates," "expects," "believes," "estimates," "intends" and "forecast," and words or phrases of similar meaning. 

We make forward-looking statements including, but not limited to, statements made about the combined company&#8217;s prospects and results following the merger with Umpqua Holdings Corporation and the merger of Columbia State Bank into Umpqua Bank (collectively, the &#8220;Mergers&#8221;), completed in the first quarter 2023; LIBOR; derivatives and hedging; the results and performance of models and economic forecasts used in our calculation of the ACL; projected sources of funds and the Company's liquidity position and deposit level and types; our securities portfolio; loan sales; adequacy of our ACL, including the reserve for unfunded commitments; provision for credit losses; non-performing loans and future losses; our commercial real estate portfolio, its collectability and subsequent charge-offs; resolution of non-accrual loans; mortgage volumes and the impact of rate changes; the economic environment; inflation and interest rates generally; litigation; dividends; junior subordinated debentures; fair values of certain assets and liabilities, including MSR values and sensitivity analyses; tax rates; deposit pricing; and the effect of accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting methodology.

Executive Overview 

The following is a discussion of our results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the applicable prior periods. 

Financial Performance 

Comparison of current quarter to prior quarter 

&#160; 

&#8226; Earnings per diluted common share was $0.65 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $0.64 for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the prior period, was primarily driven by a decrease in non-interest expense largely due to a decline in merger-related expenses. This increase was partially offset by an increase in the provision for credit losses, mostly attributable to portfolio mix changes and credit migration trends. 

&#160; 

&#8226; Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, was 3.91% for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to 3.93% for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was due to higher funding costs, partially offset by higher yields on loans and investments. 

&#8226; Non-interest income was $44.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $39.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase was largely driven by a $9.4 million increase in mortgage banking revenue, which was a result of more favorable MSR fair value adjustments compared to the prior quarter and an increase in card-based revenue, partially offset by a decrease in other income driven by an unfavorable fair value adjustment to loans held for investment. 

&#8226; Non-interest expense was $304.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $328.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease reflects the realization of cost savings and includes a $10.7 million decrease in merger-related expenses and a $7.5 million decrease in occupancy and equipment, mainly due to consolidation of 47 branches in the second quarter and realization of cost synergies due to the Merger. 

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

&#8226; Earnings per diluted common share was $1.33 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $1.96 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the prior period, was primarily driven by an increase in interest expense as a result of higher funding costs related to deposit and liability mix shifting and rising interest rates and higher merger-related expenses associated with the Merger, partially offset by higher interest income on loans and leases as a result of additional loans acquired through the Merger. The increase in average diluted shares to 191.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to 129.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, also contributed to the decline. The increase in average diluted shares reflects shares issued on February 28, 2023 in connection with the Merger. 

&#160; 

&#8226; Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, was 3.96% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to 3.48% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to an increase in interest earning asset average balances and yields given upward interest rate movements, with the largest average rate increase in the loan category, as well as seven months of purchase accounting accretion and amortization. These effects were partially offset by higher funding costs. Trends affecting net interest margin had a similar impact on net interest income, which increased to $1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $764.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, partly reflecting a larger balance sheet for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of the Merger. 

&#8226; Non-interest income was $138.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $164.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by a $25.1 million unfavorable change in cumulative fair value adjustments and a $34.0 million decrease in revenue related to origination and sales of residential mortgages, partially offset by increases in service charges on deposits, card-based fees, and financial services and trust revenue, due to seven months of the higher run rate for the combined organization.

&#8226; Non-interest expense was $975.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $540.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 reflects an increase in merger-related expenses of $158.8 million in addition to seven months of the higher expense run rate for the combined organization. 

Comparison of current period to prior year end period 

&#8226; Total loans and leases were $37.2 billion as of September 30, 2023, an increase of $11.0 billion, as compared to December 31, 2022. The increase in total loans was primarily due to $10.9 billion in loans acquired through the Merger. 

&#160; 

&#8226; Total deposits were $41.6 billion as of September 30, 2023, an increase of $14.6 billion, as compared to December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to $15.2 billion in deposits assumed through the Merger, partially offset by declining existing customer balances due primarily to the impact of inflation and market liquidity tightening. 

&#160; 

&#8226; Total consolidated assets were $52.0 billion and $31.8 billion as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The increase was primarily due to $19.2 billion in acquired assets as a result of the Merger, with the bulk of the increase being attributable to loans and investment securities acquired through the Merger and an increase in goodwill of $1.0 billion during the period. 

Credit Quality 

&#8226; Non-performing assets increased to $105.7 million, or 0.20% of total assets, as of September 30, 2023, compared to $58.8 million, or 0.18% of total assets, as of December 31, 2022. Non-performing loans and leases were $104.5 million, or 0.28% of total loans and leases, as of September 30, 2023, compared to $58.6 million, or 0.22% of total loans and leases, as of December 31, 2022. The increases in non-performing assets and non-performing loans primarily reflect assets acquired as a result of the Merger, as well as isolated credit deterioration related to two specific commercial accounts. The ratios are moving toward a more standard credit environment following a phase of exceptionally high quality performance. 

&#8226; The allowance for credit losses was $438.0 million as of September 30, 2023, an increase of $122.7 million compared to December 31, 2022. The increase in the allowance for credit losses was due to the growth of the loan portfolio, largely due to loans acquired through the Merger, and changes in the economic forecasts used in the credit models. Related to the merger, the allowance includes a $26.5 million upward adjustment due to PCD loans acquired through the Merger. 

&#8226; The Company had a provision for credit losses of $36.7 million and $158.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. This compares to a provision for credit losses of $16.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and $51.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the prior quarter was mainly due to changes in the portfolio mix and credit migration trends. The nine months ended September 30, 2023 included an $88.4 million initial provision for historical Columbia non-PCD loans related to the Merger. This initial provision, as well as changes to the economic forecast, contributed to the increase when compared to the same period in the prior year. 

Liquidity 

&#8226; Total cash and cash equivalents were $2.4 billion as of September 30, 2023, an increase of $1.1 billion from December 31, 2022. The increase in cash and cash equivalents is mainly due to a strategic decision to increase on-balance sheet liquidity. 

&#8226; Including secured off-balance sheet lines of credit, total available liquidity was $19.1 billion as of September 30, 2023, representing 37% of total assets, 46% of total deposits, and 142% of uninsured deposits. 

Capital and Growth Initiatives 

&#8226; The Company realized $140 million in annualized cost-savings due to the Merger by the end of the third quarter, exceeding our original $135 million target. 

Table of Contents 

&#8226; The Company's total risk-based capital ratio was 11.6% and its common equity tier 1 ("CET1") capital ratio was 9.5% as of September 30, 2023. As of December 31, 2022, the Company's total risk-based capital ratio was 13.7% and its CET1 capital ratio was 11.0%. The decline in regulatory capital ratios was primarily driven by initial fair value marks related to historical Columbia asset and liability balances as a result of the Merger. 

&#8226; Columbia paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.36 per common share to shareholders on September 11, 2023. 

FDIC Special Assessment 

&#8226; In May 2023, the FDIC released a proposed rule that would impose a special assessment to recover the losses to the deposit insurance fund resulting from the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Under the proposed rule, the assessment base would be the estimated uninsured deposits, as reported in Umpqua Bank and Columbia State Bank's December 31, 2022 Call Reports, excluding the first $5 billion in estimated uninsured deposits, allocated in proportion to each Bank's estimated uninsured deposits. The special assessments would be collected over eight quarters in 2024 and 2025, with the first assessment period beginning January 1, 2024. A final rule is not expected until later in 2023, after a public comment period and the FDIC's final deliberations have concluded. The ultimate impact and timing of recognition will depend on the final outcome of the ongoing FDIC deliberations. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

In preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and revenues and expenses for the period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. 

The condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP and follow general practices within the financial services industry, in which the Company operates. This preparation requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions, and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, actual results could differ from the estimates, assumptions, and judgments reflected in the financial statements. Certain estimates inherently have a greater reliance on the use of assumptions and judgments and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. 

As a result of the Merger, the Company has updated our critical accounting estimates. Management believes the ACL, business combinations and goodwill estimates are important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations and requires difficult, subjective, or complex judgments and, therefore, management considers the following to be critical accounting estimates. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The Bank has established an Allowance for Credit Losses Committee, which is responsible for, among other things, regularly reviewing the ACL methodology, including allowance levels, and ensuring that it is designed and applied in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 

CECL is not prescriptive in the methodology used to determine the expected credit loss estimate. Therefore, management has flexibility in selecting the methodology. However, the expected credit losses must be estimated over a financial asset's contractual term, adjusted for prepayments, utilizing quantitative and qualitative factors. 

The Company utilizes complex models to obtain reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions dependent upon specific macroeconomic variables related to each of the Company's loan and lease portfolios. Loans and leases deemed to be collateral dependent are individually evaluated for loss based on the value of the underlying collateral or a discounted cash flow analysis. 

Table of Contents 

The adequacy of the ACL is monitored on a regular basis and is based on management's evaluation of numerous factors, including: the CECL model outputs; quality of the current loan portfolio; the trend in the loan portfolio's risk ratings; current economic conditions; loan concentrations; loan growth rates; past-due and non-performing trends; evaluation of specific loss estimates for all significant problem loans; historical charge-off and recovery experience; and other pertinent information. As of September 30, 2023, the Bank used Moody's Analytics' August 2023 baseline scenario to estimate the ACL. To assess the sensitivity in the ACL results and, when necessary, to inform qualitative adjustments, the Bank used a second scenario, Moody's Analytics' August S2 scenario, that differs in terms of severity, both favorable and unfavorable. For additional information related to the Company's ACL, see Note 5 in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Because current economic conditions and forecasts can change and future events are inherently difficult to predict, the anticipated amount of estimated credit losses on loans, and therefore the appropriateness of the ACL, could change significantly. It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one economic factor or input might affect the overall allowance because a wide variety of factors and inputs are considered in estimating the allowance and changes in those factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all product types. Additionally, changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others. Management believes that the ACL was adequate as of September 30, 2023. 

Business Combinations and Goodwill 

The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Under this accounting method, the acquired company&#8217;s assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value at the date of the acquisition, except as provided for by the applicable accounting guidance, and the results of operations of the acquired company are combined with the acquiree&#8217;s results from the date of the acquisition forward. The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired (including identifiable intangible assets) is recorded as goodwill. Management uses significant estimates and assumptions to value such items, including projected cash flows, repayment rates, default rates and losses assuming default, discount rates, and realizable collateral values. The allowance for credit losses for PCD loans is recognized within acquisition accounting. The allowance for credit losses for non-PCD assets is recognized as provision for credit losses in the same reporting period as the acquisition. Fair value adjustments are amortized or accreted into the statement of operations over the estimated life of the acquired assets or assumed liabilities. The purchase date valuations and any subsequent adjustments determine the amount of goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition. The use of different assumptions could produce significantly different valuation results, which could have material positive or negative effects on our results of operations. The carrying value of goodwill recorded must be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, as well as on an interim basis if events or changes indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss must be recognized for any excess of carrying value over fair value of the goodwill. 

The determination of fair values is based on valuations using management&#8217;s assumptions of future growth rates, future attrition, discount rates, multiples of earnings or other relevant factors. In addition, the Company engages third-party specialists to assist in the development of fair values. Preliminary estimates of fair values may be adjusted for a period of time subsequent to the effective time of the acquisition if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the effective time of the acquisition that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. Adjustments recorded during this period are recognized in the current reporting period. Management uses various valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of these assets and liabilities and often involves a significant degree of judgment, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular item being valued. Examples of such items include loans, deposits, identifiable intangible assets, and certain other assets and liabilities. 

Changes in these factors, as well as downturns in economic or business conditions, could have a significant adverse impact on the carrying value of assets, including goodwill and liabilities, which could result in impairment losses affecting our financial statements as a whole and our banking subsidiary in which the goodwill is recorded.

Results of Operations 

As of September 30, 2023, Columbia's financial results for any periods ended prior to February 28, 2023 reflect UHC results only on a standalone basis. In addition, Columbia's reported financial results for the first quarter of 2023 reflect UHC financial results only until the closing of the Merger after the close of business on February 28, 2023. As a result of these two factors, Columbia's financial results for the first, second, and third quarters of 2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023, may not be directly comparable to prior or future reported periods. 

Comparison of current quarter to prior quarter 

The Company had net income of $135.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to net income of $133.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in net income is mainly attributable to a decrease in non-interest expense and an increase in non-interest income, partially offset by an increase in provision for credit loss and a decrease in net interest income. The decrease in non-interest expense is mainly due to reductions in merger-related expenses, occupancy and equipment and salaries and employee benefits, all impacted by realized cost synergies due to the Merger. The increase in non-interest income was primarily due to an increase in card-based fees and a favorable change in cumulative fair value adjustments and MSR hedging activity. The increase in provision for credit loss was due to portfolio mix changes and credit migration trends. The decrease in net interest income was a result of higher funding costs, partially offset by higher average yields on loans and investments as well as purchase accounting accretion and amortization that was $77.3 million for the quarter, as compared to $74.4 million in the previous quarter. At September 30, 2023, the remaining discount on acquired loans and securities was $1.2 billion; the discount is expected to accrete into income over time, providing a build to capital. 

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company had net income of $255.2 million, compared to net income of $253.8 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase was mainly attributable to an increase in net interest income, partially offset by increases in non-interest expense and the provision for credit losses, as well as a decrease in non-interest income. The increase in net interest income was due to higher loan interest income from increasing rates and higher average loan and lease balances, as well as the addition of historical Columbia portfolios. In addition to the favorable impact of higher interest rates, the increase in net interest income is due to the impact of purchase accounting accretion and amortization that was $184.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was partially offset by higher funding costs. The increase in non-interest expense was mainly driven by higher merger-related expenses, salaries and employee benefits and intangible amortization, all of which were impacted by the Merger. The change in the provision was primarily due to the initial provision for historical Columbia non-PCD loans, in addition to changes in the economic forecast. The decrease in non-interest income is primarily due to a decrease in residential mortgage banking revenue as compared to the prior year, driven by an unfavorable change in fair value of MSR asset and lower revenue from the origination and sale of residential mortgages given lower volumes due to rising interest rates. This unfavorable change was partially offset by a favorable change in the fair value of certain loans held for investment and higher customer-related income due primarily to the Merger.

The following table presents the return on average assets, average common shareholders' equity and average tangible common shareholders' equity for the periods indicated. For each period presented, the table includes the calculated ratios based on reported net income. To the extent return on average common shareholders' equity is used to compare our performance with other financial institutions that do not have merger and acquisition-related intangible assets, we believe it is beneficial to also consider the return on average tangible common shareholders' equity. The return on average tangible common shareholders' equity is calculated by dividing net income by average shareholders' common equity less average goodwill and other intangible assets, net (excluding MSR). The return on average tangible common shareholders' equity is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should be viewed in conjunction with the return on average common shareholders' equity. 

Return on Average Assets, Common Shareholders' Equity and Tangible Common Shareholders' Equity

Additionally, management believes tangible common equity and the tangible common equity ratio are meaningful measures of capital adequacy. Columbia believes the exclusion of certain intangible assets in the computation of tangible common equity and the tangible common equity ratio provides a meaningful base for period-to-period and company-to-company comparisons, which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results and capital of the Company. Tangible common equity is calculated as total shareholders' equity less goodwill and other intangible assets, net (excluding MSR). In addition, tangible assets are total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets, net (excluding MSR). The tangible common equity ratio is calculated as tangible common shareholders' equity divided by tangible assets. Tangible common equity and the tangible common equity ratio are considered non-GAAP financial measures and should be viewed in conjunction with total shareholders' equity and the total shareholders' equity ratio.

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not reviewed or audited. Although we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.

Net Interest Income 

Comparison of current quarter to prior quarter 

Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was $480.9 million, a decrease of $3.1 million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease was driven by a $23.4 million increase in interest expense due to higher average rates, partially offset by a $20.3 million increase in interest income, largely driven by interest and fees on loans and leases primarily due to higher coupon interest rates. 

The net interest margin (net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets) on a fully tax-equivalent basis was 3.91% for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to 3.93% for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest margin resulted from the higher average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, which was partially offset by higher yields on loans and leases. 

The yield on loans and leases for the three months ended September 30, 2023 increased by 13 basis points as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, primarily attributable to the impact of the higher interest rate environment increasing yields on floating and adjustable rate loans. 

The cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the three months ended September 30, 2023 increased by 27 basis points compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, due primarily to rising interest rates. Deposit costs were impacted by the decision to replace a portion of maturing FHLB advances with brokered deposits during the third quarter, which increased the cost of deposits but was fairly neutral to the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. 

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

&#160; 

Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $1.3 billion, an increase of $575.0 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase was due primarily to higher loan interest income from increasing rates and higher average loan and lease balances, attributable to the addition of historical Columbia portfolios and organic growth over the past year, as well as seven months of purchase accounting accretion and amortization, partially offset by higher interest expense as a result of the higher rate environment and higher average balances in deposits, largely due to the Merger, and term borrowings due to market liquidity tightening. 

The net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis was 3.96% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to 3.48% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in net interest margin primarily resulted from an increase in the average yields on interest-earning assets due to the higher rate environment and seven months of purchase accounting accretion and amortization, which more than offset correspondingly higher funding costs. 

The yield on loans and leases for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, increased by 182 basis points as compared to the same period in 2022, primarily attributable to the rising interest rate environment and purchase accounting accretion and amortization related to the Merger. 

The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 212 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the same period in 2022, due to a higher mix of higher-cost time deposits and term borrowings, as well as rising interest rates. Our net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in the yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds.

Provision for Credit Losses 

&#160; 

Comparison of current quarter to prior quarter 

The Company had a $36.7 million provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to a $16.0 million provision for the three months ended June 30, 2023. As an annualized percentage of average outstanding loans and leases, the provision for credit losses recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was 0.39%, as compared to 0.17% for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase relates to portfolio mix changes and credit migration trends. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2023, net charge-offs were $23.1 million, as compared to $28.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. As an annualized percentage of average outstanding loans and leases, net charge-offs for the three months ended September 30, 2023 were 0.25%, as compared to 0.30% for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The majority of net charge-offs related to leases and equipment finance loans included within the commercial loan portfolio.

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

The Company had a $158.3 million provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $51.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase is primarily driven by the initial provision for historical Columbia non-PCD loans, changes in the economic forecast, and organic growth in the loan and lease portfolio. As an annualized percentage of average outstanding loans and leases, the provision for credit losses recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 0.61%, as compared to 0.29% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net charge-offs were $67.9 million, as compared to $18.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. As an annualized percentage of average outstanding loans and leases, net charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were 0.26%, as compared to 0.10% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The majority of net charge-offs relate to leases and equipment finance loans included within the commercial loan portfolio. 

Typically, loans in a non-accrual status will not have an allowance for credit loss as they will be written down to their net realizable value or charged-off. However, the net realizable value for homogeneous leases and equipment finance agreements are determined by the loss given default calculated by the CECL model, and therefore homogeneous leases and equipment finance agreements on non-accrual will have an allowance for credit loss amount until they become 181 days past due, at which time they are charged-off. The non-accrual leases and equipment finance agreements of $28.0 million as of September 30, 2023 have a related allowance for credit losses of $24.5 million, with the remaining loans written-down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less estimated costs to sell, and are expected to be resolved with no additional material loss, absent further decline in market prices.

Comparison of current quarter to prior quarter 

Residential mortgage banking revenue increased $9.4 million as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023. The variance for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, was driven by a $5.3 million gain on the fair value of the MSR asset due to valuation inputs or assumptions compared to a loss of $2.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The loss in the prior quarter was due to the planned sale of approximately one-third of the MSR portfolio, which related to $4.4 billion in serviced loans and was marked to the sales price as of June 30, 2023. In addition to this favorable change, there was a favorable change of $2.9 million related to losses on MSR hedges when compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023. 

Table of Contents 

Other income for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, decreased primarily due to a loss on the fair value of certain loans held for investment of $19.2 million, as compared to a loss of $7.0 million, respectively. The decrease was partially offset by swap derivatives with a larger gain in the current quarter compared to the prior quarter, resulting in a favorable change of $4.4 million. 

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

Services charges on deposits, card-based fees and financial services and trust revenue increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the same period in the prior year, due to the Merger, and seven months of combined operations, which resulted in higher income. 

Residential mortgage banking revenue decreased $96.1 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The variance for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022, was driven by a lower gain during the current year period of $129,000 on fair value of the MSR asset due to valuation inputs or assumptions, compared to a fair value gain of $67.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. In addition, revenue from origination and sale of mortgages decreased by $33.3 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022 due to a 78% decline in closed loan volume of for-sale mortgages. 

Origination volume is generally linked to the level of interest rates. When rates fall, origination volume would be expected to be elevated relative to historical levels. When rates rise, origination volume would be expected to decline. The MSR asset value is also sensitive to interest rates, and generally falls with lower rates and rises with higher rates, resulting in fair value losses and gains, respectively, due to changes in valuation inputs or assumptions, where applicable. 

In the latter part of 2022, Management made a number of structural changes within the mortgage banking segment intended to reduce expenses, limit the impact of fair value changes to the income statement, and moderate portfolio mortgage growth. Included in these actions, which were undertaken to improve profitability and enhance strategic balance sheet management, was the initiation of MSR hedges which were put in place with the intention of minimizing the interest rate risk of MSRs and reducing net income volatility related to changes in fair value of MSR assets due to valuation inputs or assumptions. Management notes that mortgages remain an important product for the bank and for our customers, though we expect a smaller impact on the financial statements in the future as we downsized the scale of mortgage operations. 

Other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022, due to a favorable change in the loss on the fair value of certain loans held for investment resulting from a loss of $16.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to a loss of $62.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The favorable change between periods was partially offset by a decrease in swap derivatives with a smaller gain for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the prior year period, resulting in an unfavorable change $15.5 million, as well as other miscellaneous fluctuations in income.

Comparison of current quarter to prior quarter 

Occupancy and equipment, net decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, due primarily to equipment upgrades that were done in the prior quarter and not repeated in the third quarter. 

Merger-related expenses decreased $10.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, with the largest driver being premises and equipment expenses due to the second quarter of 2023 having elevated lease and fixed asset write-offs associated with branch consolidations.

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

Salaries and employee benefits increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to the current year including seven months of expenses as a combined company with a larger employee base. 

Occupancy and equipment, net increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022, due mainly to an increase in branch locations and software costs related to the Merger. 

FDIC assessments increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022, due mainly to the impact of having a larger balance sheet as a result of the Merger, in addition to an increase in the deposit insurance assessment rates by two basis points for all insured depository institutions in 2023. 

Intangible amortization increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to amortization associated with the core deposit intangible added as a result of the Merger. 

Merger-related expenses increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022, with the largest driver being legal and professional fees and personnel fees, which were primarily accrued in the first quarter. Refer to Note 2 - Business Combination for the breakout of merger-related expenses. 

Other expense increased as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022, which included an increase of $9.1 million related to state and local taxes due to locations added with the Merger, as well as other miscellaneous fluctuations in other expenses. 

Income Taxes 

The Company's effective tax rate for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2023 was 26.2% and 25.8%, respectively, as compared to 24.6% and 24.9%, for the same periods in the prior year. The effective tax rate differed from the statutory rate principally because of state taxes, non-deductible FDIC assessments and income on tax-exempt investment securities.

FINANCIAL CONDITION 

&#160; 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents were $2.4 billion as of September 30, 2023, compared to $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2022. The increase of interest-bearing cash and temporary investments reflects funding by short-term borrowings to maintain a higher on-balance sheet level of liquidity. 

Investment Securities 

&#160; 

Investment debt securities available for sale were $8.5 billion as of September 30, 2023, compared to $3.2 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to the addition of $6.2 billion in securities acquired at fair value through the Merger, which were categorized as available for sale. Following the close of the Merger, we restructured a portion of the historical Columbia securities portfolio during the first week of March by selling $1.2 billion of securities and purchasing $919.2 million of securities with the proceeds. The restructure transactions resulted in no gain or loss on the statement of operations. Purchases included agencies, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized mortgage obligation. The restructuring reduced the potential adverse impact to net interest income in a declining interest rate environment as this scenario presents more risk to net interest income than a "higher-for-longer" interest rate scenario. The increase was slightly offset by a decrease of $334.3 million in the fair value of investment securities, due to increasing rates during the period.

&#160; 

The net unrealized loss on historical Columbia securities was eliminated as of February 28, 2023 as part of the reverse merger method of accounting; however, historical Umpqua Bank balances were not marked as part of the Merger. As of September 30, 2023, the available for sale investment portfolio had a net unrealized loss of $876.4 million, which reflects gross unrealized losses of $876.5 million and gross unrealized gains of $100,000. Gross unrealized losses consisted primarily of unrealized losses on mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations of $679.8 million. The unrealized losses were attributable to changes in market interest rates or the widening of market spreads subsequent to the initial purchase of these securities and are not attributable to changes in credit quality. In the opinion of management, no ACL was considered necessary on these debt securities as of September 30, 2023.

Loans and Leases 

&#160; 

Total loans and leases outstanding as of September 30, 2023 were $37.2 billion, an increase of $11.0 billion as compared to December 31, 2022. The increase is primarily attributable to the addition of $10.9 billion in loans acquired through the Merger, noting that net organic growth during the period was partially offset by sales of $698.4 million in loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We elected to sell $649.9 million in non-relationship jumbo residential mortgage, commercial, and commercial real estate loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as these loans were transactional in nature. As of September 30, 2023, $620.6 million of these loans were sold and $29.3 million were classified as held for sale with settlement pending. The loan to deposit ratio as of September 30, 2023 was 89%, as compared to 97% as of December 31, 2022.

&#160; 

As of September 30, 2023, there were approximately $48.6 million or 0.13% of total loans, modified due to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. 

A decline in the economic conditions and other factors could adversely impact individual borrowers or the loan portfolio in general. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that loans will not become 90 days or more past due, placed on non-accrual status, restructured, or transferred to other real estate owned in the future. As of September 30, 2023, there was an increase in nonperforming loans representative of a more normalized credit environment.

The provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan and lease losses and the provision for unfunded commitments. The increase in the three months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, is due to portfolio mix changes and credit migration trends. The increase in the provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022, is due to the initial provision for historical Columbia non-PCD loans, organic growth in the loan and lease portfolios, as well as updates to the economic forecasts used in credit models.

To calculate the ACL, the CECL models use a forecast of future economic conditions and are dependent upon specific macroeconomic variables that are relevant to each of the Bank's loan and lease portfolios. For the third quarter of 2023, the Bank used Moody's Analytics' August 2023 baseline economic forecast, which shows a worsening economic situation from the forecast used in the prior quarter. Refer to Note 5 - Allowance for Credit Losses for further information on key components of the forecast. The models for calculating the ACL are sensitive to changes to economic variables, which could result in volatility as these assumptions change over time. 

We believe that the ACL as of September 30, 2023 is sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio and in credit commitments outstanding as of that date based on the information available. If the economic conditions decline, the Bank may need additional provisions for credit losses in future periods.

(1) The changes in valuation inputs and assumptions principally reflect changes in discount rates and prepayment speeds, which are primarily affected by changes in interest rates. 

Table of Contents 

The following table presents information related to our residential serviced loan portfolio as of the dates presented: 

(dollars in thousands) September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Balance of loans serviced for others $ 8,240,950 $ 13,020,189 MSR as a percentage of serviced loans 1.43 % 1.42 % 

Residential MSR are adjusted to fair value quarterly with the change recorded in residential mortgage banking revenue. The value of servicing rights can fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and other factors. Generally, as interest rates decline and borrowers are able to take advantage of a refinance incentive, prepayments increase, and the total value of existing servicing rights declines as expectations of future servicing fee collections decline. Historically, the fair value of our residential MSR will increase as market rates for mortgage loans rise and decrease if market rates fall. 

Due to changes to inputs in the valuation model, including changes in discount rates and prepayment speeds, the fair value of the MSR asset increased by $5.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to a decrease of $2.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and increased $129,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to an increase of $67.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. In September 2023, the Company closed the sale of $57.5 million in mortgage servicing rights associated with $4.4 billion of residential mortgage loans serviced for others. 

The fair value of the MSR asset decreased by $4.8 million for both the three months ended September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023 due to the passage of time, including the impact of regularly scheduled repayments, paydowns and payoffs and decreased by $14.5 million compared to a decrease of $15.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively. 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

On February 28, 2023, the Company completed the Merger which resulted in $1.0 billion in goodwill, as compared to no goodwill at December 31, 2022. Goodwill is recorded in connection with business combinations and represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired. 

At September 30, 2023, we had other intangible assets of $636.9 million, as compared to $4.7 million at December 31, 2022. As part of a business acquisition, the fair value of identifiable intangible assets such as core deposits, which includes all deposits except certificates of deposit, was recognized at the Merger Date. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized to their estimated residual values over their respective estimated useful lives and are also reviewed for impairment. The core deposit intangible assets recorded are amortized on an accelerated basis over a period of 10 years using the sum-of-the-years-digits method. 

Deposits 

Total deposits were $41.6 billion at September 30, 2023, an increase of $14.6 billion, as compared to December 31, 2022. The increase is attributable to the addition of $15.2 billion in deposits related to the Merger, partially offset by declining existing customer balances due primarily to the impact of inflation and market liquidity tightening.

The Company's total core deposits, which are deposits less time deposits greater than $250,000 and all brokered deposits, were $37.6 billion at September 30, 2023, compared to $25.6 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase in total core deposits between periods was driven by the same factors that contributed to the change in total deposits. The Company's brokered deposits totaled $3.1 billion at September 30, 2023, compared to $866.9 million at December 31, 2022. 

Uninsured deposits at September 30, 2023 totaled $13.5 billion, as compared to $10.1 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by balances added with the Merger. Uninsured deposits are an estimated amount based on the methodologies and assumptions used for the Bank's regulatory requirements. We reviewed our methodologies and assumptions following the industry events that brought the level of uninsured deposits into focus during the first half of 2023, which resulted in the reclassification of select balances. At September 30, 2023, total available liquidity was $19.1 billion, or 142% of uninsured deposits.

At September 30, 2023, the Bank had outstanding securities sold under agreements to repurchase of $258.4 million, a decrease of $50.4 million from December 31, 2022. The Bank had outstanding borrowings consisting of advances from the FHLB of $4.0 billion at September 30, 2023 and $906.2 million at December 31, 2022. The increase was due mainly to the addition of $2.3 billion in FHLB advances from the Merger and an additional $765.0 million in net short-term advances borrowed during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These borrowings were used to fund liquidity for the period. FHLB advances have fixed rates ranging from 4.97% to 5.64% with the majority set to mature before the end of 2023 and the remainder in the first quarter of 2024. Advances from the FHLB are secured by investment securities and loans secured by real estate. 

Columbia has a $35.0 million short-term credit facility with an unaffiliated bank. As of September 30, 2023, $35.0 million was outstanding at a variable rate of 7.83%, with a maturity date of November 25, 2023. The credit agreement requires the Company to comply with certain covenants, including those related to asset quality and capital levels. The Company was in compliance with all covenants associated with this facility at September 30, 2023. 

Junior and Other Subordinated Debentures 

&#160; 

We had junior and other subordinated debentures with carrying values of $439.5 million and $411.5 million at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The increase is mainly due to the addition of $10.0 million in subordinated debt and $10.3 million in junior subordinated debt due to the Merger and an $8.5 million increase in fair value for the junior subordinated debentures elected to be carried at fair value. The change in fair value was due to the implied forward curve shifting higher, partially offset by an increase in the credit spread and spot curve. As of September 30, 2023, substantially all of the junior subordinated debentures had interest rates that are adjustable on a quarterly basis based on a spread over three-month term SOFR. These instruments are covered under federal legislation, and the Federal Reserve&#8217;s regulations implementing that legislation, which allowed us to replace the LIBOR index with forward term SOFR, plus the statutorily prescribed tenor spread adjustment. Accordingly, these instruments transitioned from LIBOR to SOFR as of July 1, 2023. 

Liquidity and Cash Flow 

&#160; 

The principal objective of our liquidity management program is to maintain the Bank's ability to meet the day-to-day cash flow requirements of our customers who either wish to withdraw funds or to draw upon credit facilities to meet their cash needs. The Bank's liquidity strategy includes maintaining a sufficient on-balance sheet liquidity position to provide flexibility, to grow deposit balances and fund growth in lending and investment portfolios, as well as to deleverage non-deposit liabilities as economic conditions permit. As a result, the Company believes that it has sufficient cash and access to borrowings to effectively manage through the current economic conditions, as well as meet its working capital and other needs. The Company will continue to prudently evaluate and maintain liquidity sources, including the ability to fund future loan growth and manage our borrowing sources.

We monitor the sources and uses of funds on a daily basis to maintain an acceptable liquidity position. One source of funds includes public deposits. Individual state laws require banks to collateralize public deposits, typically as a percentage of their public deposit balance in excess of FDIC insurance. Public deposits represented 6% and 7% of total deposits at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The amount of collateral required varies by state and may also vary by institution within each state, depending on the individual state's risk assessment of depository institutions. Changes in the pledging requirements for uninsured public deposits may require pledging additional collateral to secure these deposits, drawing on other sources of funds to finance the purchase of assets that would be available to be pledged to satisfy a pledging requirement, or could lead to the withdrawal of certain public deposits from the Bank. The Company&#8217;s diversified deposit base provides a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funding, while reducing the Company&#8217;s reliance on the wholesale markets. Total deposits were $41.6 billion at September 30, 2023, compared with $27.1 billion at December 31, 2022. The Bank also has liquidity from excess bond collateral of $4.8 billion. 

In addition to liquidity from core deposits and the repayments and maturities of loans and investment securities, the Bank can sell securities under agreements to repurchase, issue brokered certificates of deposit, or utilize off-balance sheet funding sources. 

The Bank maintains a substantial level of total available liquidity in the form of off-balance sheet funding sources. These liquidity sources include capacity to borrow from the FHLB, the Federal Reserve Bank&#8217;s Discount Window, the new Bank Term Funding Program, created in 2023, as well as uncommitted lines of credit. Availability of these lines is subject to federal funds balances available for loan and continued borrower eligibility. These lines are intended to support short-term liquidity needs, and the agreements may restrict consecutive day usage.

&#160; 

The Company is a separate entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. Substantially all of the Company's revenues are obtained from dividends declared and paid by the Bank. There were $228.0 million of dividends paid by the Bank to the Company in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. There are statutory and regulatory provisions that limit the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company. FDIC and Oregon Division of Financial Regulation approval is required for quarterly dividends from Umpqua Bank to the Company. As of September 30, 2023, the Company also has a $35.0 million short-term credit facility with an unaffiliated bank that was fully utilized to provide the Company additional liquidity. 

&#160; 

Although we expect the Bank's and the Company's liquidity positions to remain satisfactory during 2023, it is possible that our deposit balances may not be maintained at previous levels due to pricing pressure or customers' behavior in the current economic environment. In addition, in order to generate deposit growth, our pricing may need to be adjusted in a manner that results in increased interest expense on deposits. We may utilize borrowings or other funding sources, which are generally more costly than deposit funding, to support our liquidity levels.

Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations- The Company participates in many different contractual arrangements which may or may not be recorded on its balance sheet, under which the Company has an obligation to pay certain amounts, provide credit or liquidity enhancements or provide market risk support. Our material contractual obligations are primarily for time deposits and borrowings. As of September 30, 2023, time deposits totaled $5.8 billion, of which $5.5 billion matures in a year or less. Total borrowings as of September 30, 2023 were $4.0 billion all of which matures within one year. These arrangements also include off-balance sheet commitments to extend credit, letters of credit and various forms of guarantees. At September 30, 2023, our loan commitments were $11.6 billion. A portion of the commitments will eventually result in funded loans and increase our profitability through net interest income when drawn and unused commitment fees prior to being drawn. Refer to Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies for further information. Financing commitments, letters of credit and deferred purchase commitments are presented at contractual amounts and do not necessarily reflect future cash outflows as many are expected to expire unused or partially used.

Capital Resources 

&#160; 

Shareholders' equity at September 30, 2023 was $4.6 billion. The increase in shareholders' equity during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was principally due to the increase in common stock of $2.3 billion as a result of the Merger and net income of $255.2 million during the period, partially offset by other comprehensive loss of $253.6 million and cash dividends paid of $197.0 million. 

The Company's dividend policy considers, among other things, earnings, regulatory capital levels, the overall payout ratio and expected asset growth to determine the amount of dividends declared, if any, on a quarterly basis. There is no assurance that future cash dividends on common shares will be declared or increased. We cannot predict the extent of the economic decline that could result in inadequate earnings, regulatory restrictions and limitations, changes to our capital requirements, or a decision to increase capital by retention of earnings, that may result in the inability to pay dividends at previous levels, or at all. 

On August 14, 2023, Columbia declared a cash dividend in the amount of $0.36 per common share based on second quarter 2023 performance, which was paid on September 11, 2023. 

The following table presents cash dividends declared and dividend payout ratios (dividends declared per common share divided by basic earnings per common share) for the periods indicated: &#160; Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended &#160; September 30, 2023 June 30, 2023 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022

The Company is committed to managing capital to maintain strong protection for depositors and creditors and for maximum shareholder benefit. The Company also manages its capital to exceed regulatory capital requirements for banking organizations. The regulatory capital requirements effective for the Company follow Basel III, with the Company being subject to calculating its capital adequacy as a percentage of risk-weighted assets under the standardized approach. 

In 2020, the federal bank regulatory authorities finalized a rule to provide banking organizations that implemented CECL in 2020 the option to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital by up to two years, with a three-year transition period to phase out the cumulative benefit to regulatory capital provided during the two-year delay. The Company elected this capital relief to delay the estimated regulatory capital impact of adopting CECL, relative to the incurred loss methodology's effect on regulatory capital. Currently, the Company is phasing out the cumulative adjustment as calculated at the end of 2021, by adjusting it by 75% in 2022, 50% through 2023, and 25% in 2024, culminating with a fully phased in regulatory capital calculation beginning in 2025. All regulatory ratios exceeded regulatory &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; requirements. 

The following table shows the Company's consolidated and the Bank's capital adequacy ratios compared to the regulatory minimum capital ratio and the regulatory minimum capital ratio needed to qualify as a "well-capitalized" institution, as calculated under regulatory guidelines of the Basel III at the dates presented:
