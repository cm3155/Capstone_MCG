Forward-Looking Statements 

&#160; 

This Quarterly Report in Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbor for "forward-looking statements" provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may include statements that expressly or implicitly predict future results, performance or events. Statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. You can find many of these statements by looking for words such as "anticipates," "expects," "believes," "estimates," "intends" and "forecast," and words or phrases of similar meaning.

General 

Columbia Banking System, Inc. (referred to in this report as &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;the Company&#8221; and &#8220;Columbia&#8221;) is a registered financial holding company. Columbia completed its previously-announced merger with Umpqua Holdings Corporation on February 28, 2023. This combined two premier banks in the Northwest to create one of the largest banks headquartered in the West. Columbia completed its core systems conversion on March 20, 2023, and branch consolidations are scheduled to occur through the second quarter of 2023. 

Through our wholly-owned banking subsidiary Umpqua Bank (&#8220;the Bank&#8221;), we provide a broad range of banking, private banking, mortgage and other financial services to corporate, institutional, small business, and individual customers. FinPac, a commercial equipment leasing company, is a Bank subsidiary. The Company&#8217;s subsidiary Columbia Trust Company (&#8220;Columbia Trust&#8221;) is an Oregon trust company that provides agency, fiduciary and other related trust services with offices in Washington, Oregon and Idaho. Along with its subsidiaries, the Company is subject to the regulations of state and federal agencies and undergoes regular examinations by these regulatory agencies. 

The vast majority of the Bank&#8217;s loans and deposits are within its service areas in Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, and Utah. Umpqua Bank is an Oregon state-chartered commercial bank, the deposits of which are insured in whole or in part by the FDIC. 

Executive Overview 

The following is a discussion of our results for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to the applicable prior periods. 

Financial Performance 

&#160; 

&#8226; Earnings per diluted common share was $(0.09) for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to $0.64 for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The decrease for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to the prior period, was primarily driven by an increase in non-interest expense largely due to merger-related expenses associated with the Merger, as well as an increase in provision expense due to the initial provision for non-PCD loans added with the Merger. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in net interest income as a result of there being one month of income as a combined organization, in addition to the net favorable impact of higher interest rates. 

&#160; 

&#8226; Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, was 4.08% for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to 4.01% for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was due to an increase in interest earning asset yields given upward interest rate movements, with the largest average rate increase in the loan category as well as one month of purchase accounting accretion and amortization. These effects were partially offset by higher funding costs. Trends affecting net interest margin had a similar impact on net interest income, which increased to $374.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $305.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. 

&#8226; Non-interest income was $54.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to $34.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. While results benefited from one month as a combined organization, the increase was primarily driven by a $16.2 million favorable change in cumulative fair value adjustments and MSR hedging activity. 

&#8226; Non-interest expense was $342.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to $195.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2023 reflects one month of the higher expense rate of the combined organization as well as an increase in merger-related expenses, which accounted for $104.3 million of the $147.8 million linked-quarter increase. 

&#8226; Total loans and leases were $37.1 billion as of March 31, 2023, an increase of $10.9 billion, as compared to December 31, 2022. The increase in total loans was primarily due to acquired loans associated with the Merger. 

&#160; 

&#8226; Total deposits were $41.6 billion as of March 31, 2023, an increase of $14.5 billion, as compared to December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to $15.2 billion in deposits assumed through the Merger, partially offset by declining existing customer balances due primarily to the impact of inflation and market liquidity tightening. 

&#160; 

&#8226; Total consolidated assets were $54.0 billion and $31.8 billion as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The increase was primarily due to $19.2 billion in acquired assets as a result of the Merger, with the bulk of the increase being attributable to loans and investment securities. 

Credit Quality 

&#8226; Non-performing assets increased to $76.0 million, or 0.14% of total assets, as of March 31, 2023, compared to $58.8 million, or 0.18% of total assets, as of December 31, 2022. Non-performing loans and leases were $75.6 million, or 0.20% of total loans and leases, as of March 31, 2023, compared to $58.6 million, or 0.22% of total loans and leases, as of December 31, 2022. The increases in non-performing assets and non-performing loans primarily reflect assets acquired as a result of the Merger. 

&#8226; The allowance for credit losses was $436.5 million as of March 31, 2023, an increase of $121.1 million compared to December 31, 2022. The increase in the allowance for credit losses was due to the growth of the loan portfolio, largely due to loans acquired through the Merger, and changes in the economic forecasts used in the credit models. The allowance also includes a $26.5 million adjustment related to PCD loans acquired through the Merger. 

&#8226; The Company had a provision for credit losses of $105.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. This compares to a provision for credit losses of $32.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The increase was mainly due to the $88.4 million initial provision for historical Columbia non-PCD loans related to the Merger, in addition to changes in the economic forecast. 

Liquidity 

&#8226; Total cash and cash equivalents was $3.6 billion as of March 31, 2023, an increase of $2.3 billion from December 31, 2022. The increase in cash and cash equivalents is mainly due to a strategic decision to increase on-balance sheet liquidity. 

&#8226; Including secured off-balance sheet lines of credit, total available liquidity was $17.9 billion as of March 31, 2023, representing 33% of total assets, 43% of total deposits, and 121% of uninsured deposits. 

Capital and Growth Initiatives 

&#8226; The Merger closed on February 28, 2023. Columbia completed its core systems conversion on March 20, 2023, and branch consolidations are scheduled to occur through the second quarter of 2023. 

&#8226; The Company's total risk-based capital ratio was 10.9% and its common equity tier 1 ("CET1") capital ratio was 8.9% as of March 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2022, the Company's total risk-based capital ratio was 13.7% and its CET1 capital ratio was 11.0%. The decline in regulatory capital ratios was primarily driven by initial fair value marks related to historical Columbia asset and liability balances as a result of the Merger. 

&#8226; UHC paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per common share to shareholders on February 21, 2023. The per share amount has been adjusted as a result of the adjustment to common shares outstanding based on the Exchange Ratio. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

In preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and revenues and expenses for the period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. 

The condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP and follow general practices within the financial services industry, in which the Company operates. This preparation requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions, and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, actual results could differ from the estimates, assumptions, and judgments reflected in the financial statements. Certain estimates inherently have a greater reliance on the use of assumptions and judgments and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. 

As a result of the Merger, the Company has updated our critical accounting estimates. Management believes the ACL, business combinations and goodwill estimates are important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations and requires difficult, subjective, or complex judgments and, therefore, management considers the following to be critical accounting estimates. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The Bank has established an Allowance for Credit Losses Committee, which is responsible for, among other things, regularly reviewing the ACL methodology, including allowance levels, and ensuring that it is designed and applied in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 

CECL is not prescriptive in the methodology used to determine the expected credit loss estimate. Therefore, management has flexibility in selecting the methodology. However, the expected credit losses must be estimated over a financial asset's contractual term, adjusted for prepayments, utilizing quantitative and qualitative factors. 

The Company utilizes complex models to obtain reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions dependent upon specific macroeconomic variables related to each of the Company's loan and lease portfolios. Loans and leases deemed to be collateral dependent are individually evaluated for loss based on the value of the underlying collateral or a discounted cash flow analysis. 

The adequacy of the ACL is monitored on a regular basis and is based on management's evaluation of numerous factors, including: the CECL model outputs; quality of the current loan portfolio; the trend in the loan portfolio's risk ratings; current economic conditions; loan concentrations; loan growth rates; past-due and non-performing trends; evaluation of specific loss estimates for all significant problem loans; historical charge-off and recovery experience; and other pertinent information. As of March 31, 2023, the Bank used Moody's Analytics February 2023 Baseline scenario to estimate the ACL. To assess the sensitivity in the ACL results and, when necessary, to inform qualitative adjustments, the Bank used a second scenario, Moody's Analytics February 2023 S2 scenario, that differs in terms of severity within the variables, both favorable and unfavorable. For additional information related to the Company's ACL, see Note 5 in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Because current economic conditions and forecasts can change and future events are inherently difficult to predict, the anticipated amount of estimated credit losses on loans, and therefore the appropriateness of the ACL, could change significantly. It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one economic factor or input might affect the overall allowance because a wide variety of factors and inputs are considered in estimating the allowance and changes in those factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all product types. Additionally, changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others. Management believes that the ACL was adequate as of March 31, 2023. 

Business Combinations and Goodwill 

The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Under this accounting method, the acquired company&#8217;s assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value at the date of the acquisition, except as provided for by the applicable accounting guidance, and the results of operations of the acquired company are combined with the acquiree&#8217;s results from the date of the acquisition forward. The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired (including identifiable intangible assets) is recorded as goodwill. Management uses significant estimates and assumptions to value such items, including projected cash flows, repayment rates, default rates and losses assuming default, discount rates, and realizable collateral values. The allowance for credit losses for PCD loans is recognized within acquisition accounting. The allowance for credit losses for non-PCD assets is recognized as provision for credit losses in the same reporting period as the acquisition. Fair value adjustments are amortized or accreted into the statement of operations over the estimated life of the acquired assets or assumed liabilities. The purchase date valuations and any subsequent adjustments determine the amount of goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition. The use of different assumptions could produce significantly different valuation results, which could have material positive or negative effects on our results of operations. The carrying value of goodwill recorded must be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, as well as on an interim basis if events or changes indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss must be recognized for any excess of carrying value over fair value of the goodwill. 

The determination of fair values is based on valuations using management&#8217;s assumptions of future growth rates, future attrition, discount rates, multiples of earnings or other relevant factors. In addition, the Company engages third-party specialists to assist in the development of fair values. Preliminary estimates of fair values may be adjusted for a period of time subsequent to the effective time of the acquisition if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the effective time of the acquisition that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. Adjustments recorded during this period are recognized in the current reporting period. Management uses various valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of these assets and liabilities and often involves a significant degree of judgment, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular item being valued. Examples of such items include loans, deposits, identifiable intangible assets, and certain other assets and liabilities. 

Changes in these factors, as well as downturns in economic or business conditions, could have a significant adverse impact on the carrying value of assets, including goodwill and liabilities, which could result in impairment losses affecting our financial statements as a whole and our banking subsidiary in which the goodwill is recorded. 

Results of Operations 

As of March 31, 2023, Columbia's financial results for any periods ended prior to February 28, 2023 reflect UHC results only on a standalone basis. In addition, Columbia's reported financial results for the first quarter of 2023 reflect UHC financial results only until the closing of the Merger after the close of business on February 28, 2023. As a result of these two factors, Columbia's financial results for the first quarter of 2023 may not be directly comparable to prior or future reported periods. 

Comparison of current quarter to prior quarter 

The Company had net loss of $14.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to net income of $83.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in net income is mainly attributable to an increase in non-interest expense and an increase in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by an increase in net interest income. The increase in non-interest expense is mainly due to increases in merger-related expenses, salaries and benefits, and intangible amortization, all of which were impacted by the Merger. The change in the provision was mainly driven by $88.4 million in initial provision for historical Columbia non-PCD loans, in addition to changes in the economic forecast. The increase in net interest income is mainly due to there being one month of higher income as a result of the Merger, in addition to the net favorable impact of higher interest rates. 

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company had net loss of $14.0 million, a decrease in net income of $105.2 million, as compared to the same period in the prior year, mainly attributable to increases in non-interest expense, provision for credit loss and a decrease in non-interest income, partially offset by an increase in net interest income. The increase in non-interest expense was driven by increased merger-related expenses, salaries and employee benefits, and intangible amortization, all of which were impacted by the Merger. The change in the provision of $100.7 million was mainly driven by the initial provision for historical Columbia non-PCD loans, in addition to changes in the economic forecast. The decrease in non-interest income is primarily due to a decrease of $53.0 million in residential mortgage banking revenue as compared to the prior year, due to lower revenue from the origination and sale of residential mortgages given lower volumes and gain on sale margins due to rising interest rates. The increase in net interest income was due primarily to higher loan interest income from increasing rates and higher average loan and lease balances, as well as the addition of historical Columbia portfolios, partially offset by higher funding costs. 

The following table presents the return on average assets, average common shareholders' equity and average tangible common shareholders' equity for the three months ended March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022, and March 31, 2022, respectively. For each period presented, the table includes the calculated ratios based on reported net income. To the extent return on average common shareholders' equity is used to compare our performance with other financial institutions that do not have merger and acquisition-related intangible assets, we believe it is beneficial to also consider the return on average tangible common shareholders' equity. The return on average tangible common shareholders' equity is calculated by dividing net income by average shareholders' common equity less average goodwill and other intangible assets, net (excluding MSR). The return on average tangible common shareholders' equity is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should be viewed in conjunction with the return on average common shareholders' equity. 

Return on Average Assets, Common Shareholders' Equity and Tangible Common Shareholders' Equity 

&#160; Three Months Ended &#160;(dollars in thousands) March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 March 31, 2022 Return on average assets (0.14) % 1.04 % 1.21 % Return on average common shareholders' equity (1.70) % 13.50 % 13.62 % Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity (2.09) % 13.53 % 13.66 % Calculation of average common tangible shareholders' equity: &#160; &#160; Average common shareholders' equity $ 3,349,761 $ 2,438,639 $ 2,715,059 Less: average goodwill and other intangible assets, net 623,042 5,298 8,407 Average tangible common shareholders' equity $ 2,726,719 $ 2,433,341 $ 2,706,652 

Additionally, management believes tangible common equity and the tangible common equity ratio are meaningful measures of capital adequacy. Columbia believes the exclusion of certain intangible assets in the computation of tangible common equity and tangible common equity ratio provides a meaningful base for period-to-period and company-to-company comparisons, which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results and capital of the Company. Tangible common equity is calculated as total shareholders' equity less goodwill and other intangible assets, net (excluding MSR). In addition, tangible assets are total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets, net (excluding MSR). The tangible common equity ratio is calculated as tangible common shareholders' equity divided by tangible assets. Tangible common equity and the tangible common equity ratio are considered non-GAAP financial measures and should be viewed in conjunction with total shareholders' equity and the total shareholders' equity ratio. 

The following table provides a reconciliation of ending shareholders' equity (GAAP) to ending tangible common equity (non-GAAP), and ending assets (GAAP) to ending tangible assets (non-GAAP) as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022:

&#160; 

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not reviewed or audited. Although we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP. 

Net Interest Income 

Comparison of current quarter to prior quarter 

Net interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $374.7 million, an increase of $69.2 million compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022. The increase was driven by a $91.2 million increase in the total interest and fees on loans and leases and a $21.6 million increase in interest on taxable investments, mainly due to higher coupon interest rates and the addition of historical Columbia portfolios as a result of the Merger. Higher interest income was partially offset by an increase of $54.5 million in interest expense due to migration to higher-cost deposits and borrowings and the addition of historical Columbia balances. 

The net interest margin (net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets) on a fully tax-equivalent basis was 4.08% for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to 4.01% for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The increase in net interest margin primarily resulted from an increase in the average yields for each category within interest-earning assets given upward interest rate movements, partially offset by higher funding costs. 

The yield on loans and leases for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased by 63 basis points as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022, primarily attributable to the impact of the higher interest rate environment increasing yields on floating and adjustable rate loans, as well as one month of purchase accounting accretion and amortization related to the Merger. 

The cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased by 77 basis points compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022, due primarily to rising interest rates, changes in the deposit mix to higher rate products and the increase in outstanding term borrowings. 

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

&#160; 

Net interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $374.7 million, an increase of $145.9 million compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase was due primarily to higher loan interest income from increasing rates and higher average loan and lease balances, attributable to the addition of historical Columbia portfolios and organic growth over the past year. 

The net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis was 4.08% for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to 3.14% for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase in net interest margin primarily resulted from an increase in the average yields on interest-earning assets due to the higher rate environment, which more than offset correspondingly higher funding costs. 

The yield on loans and leases for the three months ended March 31, 2023, increased by 176 basis points as compared to the same period in 2022, primarily attributable to the rising interest rate environment. 

The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 164 basis points for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to the same period in 2022, due to a higher mix of higher-cost deposits and term borrowings. Our net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in the yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds. 

The following table presents condensed average balance sheet information, together with interest income and yields on average interest-earning assets, and interest expense and rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities for the three months ended March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022, and March 31, 2022:

Provision for Credit Losses 

&#160; 

Comparison of current quarter to prior quarter 

The Company had a $105.5 million provision for credit losses for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to a $32.9 million provision for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The March 31, 2023 provision reflects an initial provision of $88.4 million for historical Columbia non-PCD loans, in addition to changes in the economic forecast. As an annualized percentage of average outstanding loans and leases, the provision for credit losses recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was 1.43%, as compared to 0.51% for the three months ended December 31, 2022. 

For the three months ended March 31, 2023, net charge-offs were $16.7 million, as compared to $12.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. As an annualized percentage of average outstanding loans and leases, net charge-offs for the three months ended March 31, 2023 were 0.23%, as compared to 0.19% for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The majority of net charge-offs related to leases and equipment finance loans, included within the commercial loan portfolio. 

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

The Company had a $105.5 million provision for credit losses for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to $4.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase is primarily driven by the initial provision for historical Columbia non-PCD loans, changes in the economic forecast and organic growth in the loan and lease portfolio. As an annualized percentage of average outstanding loans and leases, the provision for credit losses recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was 1.43%, as compared to 0.09% for the three months ended March 31, 2022. 

For the three months ended March 31, 2023, net charge-offs were $16.7 million, as compared to $5.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. As an annualized percentage of average outstanding loans and leases, net charge-offs for the three months ended March 31, 2023 were 0.23%, as compared to 0.10% for the three months ended March 31, 2022.The majority of net charge-offs relate to leases and equipment finance loans, included within the commercial loan portfolio. 

Typically, loans in a non-accrual status will not have an allowance for credit loss as they will be written down to their net realizable value or charged-off. However, the net realizable value for homogeneous leases and equipment finance agreements are determined by the loss given default calculated by the CECL model, and therefore homogeneous leases and equipment finance agreements on non-accrual will have an allowance for credit loss amount until they become 181 days past due, at which time they are charged-off. The non-accrual leases and equipment finance agreements of $31.0 million as of March 31, 2023 have a related allowance for credit losses of $28.4 million, with the remaining loans written-down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less estimated costs to sell, and are expected to be resolved with no additional material loss, absent further decline in market prices. 

Non-Interest Income 

&#160; 

The following table presents the key components of non-interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022, as well as the comparison of the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022: Three Months Ended Three Months Ended (in thousands) March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Change Amount Change Percent March 31, 2022 Change Amount Change Percent Service charges on deposits $ 14,312 $ 12,139 $ 2,173 18 % $ 11,583 $ 2,729 24 % Card-based fees 11,561 9,017 2,544 28 % 8,708 2,853 33 % Financial services and trust revenue 1,297 25 1,272 nm 11 1,286 nm Residential mortgage banking revenue, net 7,816 (1,812) 9,628 nm 60,786 (52,970) (87) % Gain on sale of debt securities, net &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; nm 2 (2) (100) % Gain (loss) on equity securities, net 2,416 284 2,132 nm (2,661) 5,077 (191) % Gain on loan and lease sales, net 940 1,531 (591) (39) % 2,337 (1,397) (60) % Bank owned life insurance income 2,790 2,033 757 37 % 2,087 703 34 % Other income (losses) 13,603 11,662 1,941 17 % (2,884) 16,487 nm Total non-interest income $ 54,735 $ 34,879 $ 19,856 57 % $ 79,969 $ (25,234) (32) % 

The increase in non-interest income is generally higher due to there being one month of higher income as result of the Merger, which included one month of combined operations. 

Comparison of current quarter to prior quarter 

Residential mortgage banking revenue increased $9.6 million as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022. The variance for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022, was driven by a loss of $2.9 million on the fair value of the MSR asset due to valuation inputs or assumptions compared to a loss of $9.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. In addition, there was a gain of $2.7 million on the MSR hedge for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to a loss of $348,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022. 

Other income for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022, increased primarily due to a gain on the fair value on certain loans held for investment of $9.5 million, as compared to a gain of $4.2 million, respectively. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in swap customer fee revenue and related income of $3.1 million as well as a $1.2 million unfavorable change in the loss on swap derivatives over the period. 

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

Residential mortgage banking revenue decreased $53.0 million compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022. The variance for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022, was driven by a loss of $2.9 million on the fair value of the MSR asset due to valuation inputs or assumptions compared to a fair value gain of $40.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The variance between periods was also driven by an 80% decline in closed loan volume of for-sale mortgages, which was the primary driver of a $13.3 million decrease in revenue from the origination and sale of mortgages compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. 

Origination volume is generally linked to the level of interest rates. When rates fall, origination volume would be expected to be elevated relative to historical levels. When rates rise, origination volume would be expected to decline. The MSR asset value is also sensitive to interest rates, and generally falls with lower rates and rises with higher rates, resulting in fair value losses and gains, respectively, due to changes in valuation inputs or assumptions, where applicable. In August 2022, a MSR hedge was put in place with the intention of minimizing the interest rate risk of MSRs and reducing net income volatility related to changes in fair value of MSR assets due to valuation inputs or assumptions. 

Other income for the three months ended March 31, 2023 decreased as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022, due mainly to a gain on the fair value of certain loans held for investment of $9.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to a fair value loss of $21.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The favorable change between periods was partially offset by a decrease in swap customer fee revenue and related income of $6.9 million as well as a $10.6 million unfavorable change related to swap derivatives between periods. 

The following table presents our residential mortgage banking revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022, and March 31, 2022:

The following table presents the key elements of non-interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022, as well as the comparison of the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022: Three Months Ended Three Months Ended &#160;(in thousands) March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Change Amount Change Percent March 31, 2022 Change Amount Change Percent Salaries and employee benefits $ 136,092 $ 107,982 $ 28,110 26 % $ 113,138 $ 22,954 20 % Occupancy and equipment, net 41,700 34,021 7,679 23 % 34,829 6,871 20 % Communications 3,026 2,548 478 19 % 2,754 272 10 % Marketing 1,059 988 71 7 % 2,398 (1,339) (56) % Services 12,843 12,229 614 5 % 11,337 1,506 13 % FDIC assessments 6,113 3,487 2,626 75 % 4,516 1,597 35 % Intangible amortization 12,660 1,019 11,641 nm 1,025 11,635 nm Merger-related expenses 115,898 11,637 104,261 nm 2,278 113,620 nm Other expenses 13,427 21,071 (7,644) (36) % 10,155 3,272 32 % Total non-interest expense $ 342,818 $ 194,982 $ 147,836 76 % $ 182,430 $ 160,388 88 % nm = Not meaningful 

The increase in non-interest expense is generally higher due to there being one month of higher expense as result of the Merger, which included one month of combined operations. 

Comparison of current quarter to prior quarter 

The increase in net interest expense is mainly due to there being one month of higher expense as result of the Merger, in addition to the net favorable impact of higher interest rates. 

Salaries and employee benefits increased during the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to additional expenses associated with the larger employee base as a result of the Merger with one month as a combined organization. 

Intangible amortization increased during the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to one month of amortization associated with the core deposit intangible added as a result of the Merger. 

Merger-related expenses increased $104.3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022 with the largest driver being legal and professional fees. 

Other expenses decreased as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to a decrease of $6.4 million in state and local taxes due to an adjustment in 2022, as well as other miscellaneous fluctuations in other expenses. 

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 

Salaries and employee benefits increased for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to additional expenses associated with the larger employee base as a result of the Merger. 

Intangible amortization increased during the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to amortization associated with the core deposit intangible added as a result of the Merger. 

Merger-related expenses were $115.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to $2.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 with the largest driver being legal and professional fees. Refer to Note 2 - Business Combination for the breakout of Merger expenses. 

Other expense increased as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to an increase of $2.1 million in state and local taxes, as well as other miscellaneous fluctuations in other expenses. 

Income Taxes 

&#160; 

The Company's consolidated effective tax rate as a percentage of pre-tax (loss) income for the three months ended March 31, 2023, was 25.8% as compared to 26.2% for the three months ended December 31, 2022, and 25.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The effective tax rate differed from the statutory rate principally because of state taxes and income on tax-exempt investment securities. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION 

&#160; 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents were $3.6 billion as of March 31, 2023, compared to $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2022. The increase of interest-bearing cash and temporary investments reflects funding by short-term borrowings. 

Investment Securities 

&#160; 

Investment debt securities available for sale were $9.2 billion as of March 31, 2023, compared to $3.2 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase was due to the addition of $6.2 billion in securities acquired through the Merger, which were categorized as available for sale at quarter end. Following the close of the Merger, we restructured a portion of the historical Columbia securities portfolio during the first week of March by selling $1.2 billion of securities and purchasing $919.2 million of securities with the proceeds. The restructure transactions resulted in no gain or loss on the statement of operations. Purchases included agencies, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized mortgage obligation. The restructuring reduced the potential adverse impact to net interest income in a declining interest rate environment.

&#160; 

The net unrealized loss on historical Columbia securities was eliminated as of February 28, 2023 as part of the reverse merger method of accounting; however, historical Umpqua Bank balances were not marked as part of the Merger. The available for sale investment portfolio had a net unrealized loss of $396.7 million as of March 31, 2023, which reflects gross unrealized gains of $94.1 million and gross unrealized losses of $490.8 million. Gross unrealized losses consisted primarily of unrealized losses on mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations of $382.6 million. The unrealized losses were attributable to changes in market interest rates or the widening of market spreads subsequent to the initial purchase of these securities and are not attributable to changes in credit quality. In the opinion of management, no ACL was considered necessary on these debt securities as of March 31, 2023. 

Loans and Leases 

&#160; 

Total loans and leases outstanding as of March 31, 2023 were $37.1 billion, an increase of $10.9 billion as compared to December 31, 2022. The increase is attributable to the addition of $10.9 billion in loans acquired through the Merger. The loan to deposit ratio as of March 31, 2023 was 89%, as compared to 97% as of December 31, 2022. 

The following table presents the concentration distribution of the loan and lease portfolio, net of deferred fees and costs, as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022:

&#160; 

As of March 31, 2023, there were approximately $12.9 million or 0.03% of total loans, modified due to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. 

A decline in the economic conditions and other factors could adversely impact individual borrowers or the loan portfolio in general. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that loans will not become 90 days or more past due, placed on non-accrual status, restructured, or transferred to other real estate owned in the future. 

Allowance for Credit Losses

(1) Includes $88.4 million initial provision related to non-PCD loans acquired during the period. 

The provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan and lease losses and the provision for unfunded commitments. The increase in the provision is due to the $88.4 million initial provision for historical Columbia non-PCD loans, as well as updates to the economic forecasts used in credit models. 

The following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases and percent of loans in each category to total loans and leases as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022:

To calculate the ACL, the CECL models use a forecast of future economic conditions and are dependent upon specific macroeconomic variables that are relevant to each of the Bank's loan and lease portfolios. For the first quarter of 2023, the Bank used Moody's Analytics' February baseline economic forecast, which shows a worsening economic situation from the forecast used in the prior quarter. Key components include U.S. real GDP average annualized growth of 1.3% in 2023, 2.2% in 2024, 2.7% in 2025 and 2.6% in 2026 and an average unemployment rate of 3.5% in 2023, 3.9% in 2024, 4.0% in 2025 and 4.1% in 2026. The forecasted average federal funds rate is expected to be 4.8% in 2023, 4.2% in 2024, 3.2% in 2025 and 2.5% in 2026. The models for calculating the ACL are sensitive to changes in these and other economic variables, which could result in volatility as these assumptions change over time. 

We believe that the ACL as of March 31, 2023 is sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio and in credit commitments outstanding as of that date based on the information available. If the economic conditions decline, the Bank may need additional provisions for credit losses in future periods. 

Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights 

&#160; 

The following table presents the changes in our residential MSR portfolio for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022: 

Three Months Ended 

&#160; &#160; (in thousands) 

March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Balance, beginning of period $ 185,017 $ 196,177 Additions for new MSR capitalized 1,601 3,740 Changes in fair value: Changes due to collection/realization of expected cash flows over time (4,881) (4,986) Changes due to valuation inputs or assumptions (1) 

(2,937) (9,914) Balance, end of period $ 178,800 $ 185,017 

(1) The changes in valuation inputs and assumptions principally reflect changes in discount rates and prepayment speeds, which are primarily affected by changes in interest rates. 

Information related to our residential serviced loan portfolio as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was as follows: 

(dollars in thousands) March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Balance of loans serviced for others $ 12,914,046 $ 13,020,189 MSR as a percentage of serviced loans 1.38 % 1.42 % 

Residential MSR are adjusted to fair value quarterly with the change recorded in residential mortgage banking revenue. The value of servicing rights can fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and other factors. Generally, as interest rates decline and borrowers are able to take advantage of a refinance incentive, prepayments increase, and the total value of existing servicing rights declines as expectations of future servicing fee collections decline. Historically, the fair value of our residential MSR will increase as market rates for mortgage loans rise and decrease if market rates fall. Mortgage rates decreased only slightly during the quarter, however due to the difference in the portfolio's average interest rates and the current mortgage rates, MSR assets are holding their value. 

Due to changes to inputs in the valuation model including changes in discount rates and prepayment speeds, the fair value of the MSR asset decreased by $2.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to a decrease of $9.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The fair value of the MSR asset decreased by $4.9 million, due to the passage of time, including the impact of regularly scheduled repayments, paydowns and payoffs during the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to a decrease of $5.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. 

&#160; 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

On February 28, 2023, the Company completed the Merger which resulted in $1.0 billion in goodwill, as compared to no goodwill at December 31, 2022. Goodwill is recorded in connection with business combinations and represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired. 

At March 31, 2023, we had other intangible assets of $702.3 million, as compared to $4.7 million at December 31, 2022. As part of a business acquisition, the fair value of identifiable intangible assets such as core deposits, which includes all deposits except certificates of deposit, was recognized at the Merger Date. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized to their estimated residual values over their respective estimated useful lives, and are also reviewed for impairment. The core deposit intangible assets recorded are amortized on an accelerated basis over a period of 10 years. 

Deposits 

Total deposits were $41.6 billion at March 31, 2023, an increase of $14.5 billion, as compared to December 31, 2022. The increase is attributable to the addition of $15.2 billion in deposits related to the Merger, offset by declining existing customer balances due primarily to the impact of inflation and market liquidity tightening. 

&#160; 

The following table presents the deposit balances by category as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022: 

March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 &#160;(dollars in thousands) Amount % Amount % Non-interest bearing demand $ 17,215,781 41 % $ 10,288,849 38 % Interest bearing demand 5,900,462 14 % 4,080,469 15 % Money market 10,681,422 26 % 7,721,011 29 % Savings 3,469,112 9 % 2,265,052 8 % Time, greater than $250,000 800,765 2 % 582,838 2 % Time, $250,000 or less 3,518,805 8 % 2,127,393 8 % Total deposits $ 41,586,347 100 % $ 27,065,612 100 % 

&#160; 

The Company's total core deposits, which are deposits less time deposits greater than $250,000 and all brokered deposits, were $39.2 billion at March 31, 2023, compared to $25.6 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase in total core deposits between periods was driven by the same factors that contributed to the change in total deposits. The Company's brokered deposits totaled $1.6 billion at March 31, 2023, compared to $866.9 million at December 31, 2022. 

Uninsured deposits at March 31, 2023 totaled $14.8 billion, as compared to $10.6 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by balances added with the Merger. Uninsured deposits are an estimated amount based on the methodologies and assumptions used for the Bank's regulatory requirements. We reviewed our methodologies and assumptions following the industry events that brought the level of uninsured deposits into focus in March 2023, which resulted in the reclassification of select balances, including collateralized public funds, which are no longer included in our uninsured balance calculations. At March 31, 2023, total available liquidity was $17.9 billion, or 121% of uninsured deposits. 

Borrowings 

&#160; 

At March 31, 2023, the Bank had outstanding securities sold under agreements to repurchase of $271.0 million, a decrease of $37.7 million from December 31, 2022. The Bank had outstanding borrowings consisting of advances from the FHLB of $5.9 billion at March 31, 2023 and $906.2 million at December 31, 2022. The increase was due mainly to the addition of $2.3 billion in FHLB advances from the Merger and an additional $2.8 billion in net short-term advances borrowed during the period, which were used to fund liquidity for the quarter. FHLB advances have fixed rates ranging from 4.97% to 5.38% and are set to mature before the end of 2023. Advances from the FHLB are secured by investment securities and loans secured by real estate. 

Columbia has a $50.0 million short-term credit facility with an unaffiliated bank. As of March 31, 2023, $50.0 million was outstanding at a variable rate of 6.38% and expires on May 25, 2023. The credit agreement requires the Company to comply with certain covenants, including those related to asset quality and capital levels. The Company was in compliance with all covenants associated with this facility at March 31, 2023. 

Junior and Other Subordinated Debentures 

&#160; 

We had Junior and other subordinated debentures with carrying values of $405.8 million and $411.5 million at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The decrease is mainly due to the $25.8 million decline in fair value for the junior subordinated debentures elected to be carried at fair value, which is due to an increase in the discount rate primarily due to an increase in the credit spread. The decrease was partially offset by the addition of $10.0 million in subordinated debt and $10.3 million in junior subordinated debt due to the Merger. As of March 31, 2023, substantially all of the junior subordinated debentures had interest rates that are adjustable on a quarterly basis based on a spread over three-month LIBOR. These instruments mature after June 2023, and are covered under federal legislation, and the Federal Reserve&#8217;s regulations implementing that legislation, that will allow us to replace the LIBOR index with forward Term SOFR, plus the statutorily prescribed tenor spread adjustment. 

Liquidity and Cash Flow 

&#160; 

The principal objective of our liquidity management program is to maintain the Bank's ability to meet the day-to-day cash flow requirements of our customers who either wish to withdraw funds or to draw upon credit facilities to meet their cash needs. The Bank's liquidity strategy includes maintaining a sufficient on-balance sheet liquidity position to provide flexibility, to grow deposit balances and fund growth in lending and investment portfolios, as well as to deleverage non-deposit liabilities as economic conditions permit. As a result, the Company believes that it has sufficient cash and access to borrowings to effectively manage through the current economic conditions, as well as meet its working capital and other needs. The Company will continue to prudently evaluate and maintain liquidity sources, including the ability to fund future loan growth and manage our borrowing sources. 

We monitor the sources and uses of funds on a daily basis to maintain an acceptable liquidity position. One source of funds includes public deposits. Individual state laws require banks to collateralize public deposits, typically as a percentage of their public deposit balance in excess of FDIC insurance. Public deposits represented 6% and 7% of total deposits at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The amount of collateral required varies by state and may also vary by institution within each state, depending on the individual state's risk assessment of depository institutions. Changes in the pledging requirements for uninsured public deposits may require pledging additional collateral to secure these deposits, drawing on other sources of funds to finance the purchase of assets that would be available to be pledged to satisfy a pledging requirement, or could lead to the withdrawal of certain public deposits from the Bank. In addition to liquidity from core deposits and the repayments and maturities of loans and investment securities, the Bank can utilize established uncommitted federal funds lines of credit, sell securities under agreements to repurchase, borrow on a secured basis from the FHLB or issue brokered certificates of deposit. The Company&#8217;s diversified deposit base provides a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funding, while reducing the Company&#8217;s reliance on the wholesale markets. Total deposits were $41.6 billion at March 31, 2023, compared with $27.1 billion at December 31, 2022. The Bank also has liquidity from excess bond collateral of $4.8 billion. 

&#160; 

The Bank had available lines of credit with the FHLB totaling $5.5 billion at March 31, 2023, subject to certain collateral requirements, namely the amount of pledged loans and investment securities. The Bank had available lines of credit with the Federal Reserve totaling $1.3 billion, subject to certain collateral requirements, namely the amount of certain pledged loans. The Bank also has access to the FRB Bank Term Funding Program with an available line of credit of $2.3 billion, subject to certain collateral requirements, namely the amount of pledged investment securities. The Bank had uncommitted federal funds line of credit agreements with additional financial institutions totaling $600.0 million at March 31, 2023. Availability of these lines is subject to federal funds balances available for loan and continued borrower eligibility. These lines are intended to support short-term liquidity needs, and the agreements may restrict consecutive day usage. 

&#160; 

The Company is a separate entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. Substantially all of the Company's revenues are obtained from dividends declared and paid by the Bank. There were $48.0 million of dividends paid by the Bank to the Company in the three months ended March 31, 2023. There are statutory and regulatory provisions that limit the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company. FDIC and Oregon Division of Financial Regulation approval is required for quarterly dividends from Umpqua Bank to the Company. As of March 31, 2023, the Company also has a $50.0 million short-term credit facility with an unaffiliated Bank that was fully utilized to provide the Company additional liquidity. 

&#160; 

Although we expect the Bank's and the Company's liquidity positions to remain satisfactory during 2023, it is possible that our deposit balances may not be maintained at previous levels due to pricing pressure or customers' behavior in the current economic environment. In addition, in order to generate deposit growth, our pricing may need to be adjusted in a manner that results in increased interest expense on deposits. We may utilize borrowings or other funding sources, which are generally more costly than deposit funding, to support our liquidity levels. 

Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations- The Company participates in many different contractual arrangements which may or may not be recorded on its balance sheet, under which the Company has an obligation to pay certain amounts, provide credit or liquidity enhancements or provide market risk support. Our material contractual obligations are primarily for time deposits and borrowings. As of March 31, 2023, time deposits totaled $4.3 billion, of which $2.4 billion matures in a year or less. Total borrowings as of March 31, 2023 were $6.0 billion all of which matures within 1 year. These arrangements also include off-balance sheet commitments to extend credit, letters of credit and various forms of guarantees. At March 31, 2023, our loan commitments were $12.0 billion, however a portion of the commitments will eventually result in funded loans and increase our profitability through net interest income when drawn and unused commitment fees prior to being drawn. Refer to Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies for further information. Financing commitments, letters of credit and deferred purchase commitments are presented at contractual amounts and do not necessarily reflect future cash outflows as many are expected to expire unused or partially used.

Capital Resources 

&#160; 

Shareholders' equity at March 31, 2023 was $4.9 billion. The increase in shareholders' equity during the three months ended March 31, 2023 was principally due to the increase in common stock of $2.3 billion as a result of the Merger. This was offset by cash dividends paid of $45.9 million and a net loss of $14.0 million during the period. 

The Company's dividend policy considers, among other things, earnings, regulatory capital levels, the overall payout ratio and expected asset growth to determine the amount of dividends declared, if any, on a quarterly basis. There is no assurance that future cash dividends on common shares will be declared or increased. We cannot predict the extent of the economic decline that could result in inadequate earnings, regulatory restrictions and limitations, changes to our capital requirements, or a decision to increase capital by retention of earnings, that may result in the inability to pay dividends at previous levels, or at all. 

On January 11, 2023, UHC declared a cash dividend in the amount of $0.35 per common share based on fourth quarter 2022 performance, which was paid on February 6, 2023. UHC accelerated its dividend declaration timeline in January 2023 ahead of the anticipated merger with Columbia. Historically, UHC declared quarterly cash dividends later in the quarter, and Columbia intends to adopt this timeline given the Merger. 

The following table presents cash dividends declared and dividend payout ratios (dividends declared per common share divided by basic earnings per common share) for the three months ended March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022, and March 31, 2022: &#160; Three Months Ended &#160; March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 March 31, 2022 Dividend declared per common share $ 0.35 $ 0.35 $ 0.35 Dividend payout ratio nm 55 % 49 % 

The Company is committed to managing capital to maintain strong protection for depositors and creditors and for maximum shareholder benefit. The Company also manages its capital to exceed regulatory capital requirements for banking organizations. The regulatory capital requirements effective for the Company follow Basel III, with the Company being subject to calculating its capital adequacy as a percentage of risk-weighted assets under the standardized approach. 

In 2020, the federal bank regulatory authorities finalized a rule to provide banking organizations that implemented CECL in 2020 the option to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital by up to two years, with a three-year transition period to phase out the cumulative benefit to regulatory capital provided during the two-year delay. The Company elected this capital relief to delay the estimated regulatory capital impact of adopting CECL, relative to the incurred loss methodology's effect on regulatory capital. Currently, the Company is phasing out the cumulative adjustment as calculated at the end of 2021, by adjusting it by 75% in 2022, 50% through 2023, and 25% in 2024, culminating with a fully phased in regulatory capital calculation beginning in 2025. All regulatory ratios exceeded regulatory &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; requirements. 

The following table shows the Company's consolidated and the Bank's capital adequacy ratios compared to the regulatory minimum capital ratio and the regulatory minimum capital ratio needed to qualify as a "well-capitalized" institution, as calculated under regulatory guidelines of the Basel III at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022:
