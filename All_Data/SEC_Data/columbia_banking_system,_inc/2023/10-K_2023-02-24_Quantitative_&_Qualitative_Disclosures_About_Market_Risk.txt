 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Interest Rate Sensitivity 

We are exposed to interest rate risk, which is the risk that changes in prevailing interest rates will adversely affect assets, liabilities, capital, income and expenses at different times or in different amounts. Generally, there are four sources of interest rate risk as described below: 

Repricing risk &#8212;Repricing risk is the risk of adverse consequences from a change in interest rates that arises because of differences in the timing of when those interest rate changes affect an institution&#8217;s assets and liabilities. 

Basis risk &#8212;Basis risk is the risk of adverse consequence resulting from unequal changes in the spread between two or more rates for different instruments with the same maturity. 

Yield curve risk &#8212;Yield curve risk is the risk of adverse consequence resulting from unequal changes in the spread between two or more rates for different maturities for the same instrument. 

Option risk &#8212;In banking, option risks are known as borrower options to prepay loans and depositor options to make deposits, withdrawals, and early redemptions. Option risk arises whenever bank products give customers the right, but not the obligation, to alter the quantity or the timing of cash flows. Option risk is also present in the investment portfolio as mortgage-backed securities could prepay or callable bonds could be called. 

An Asset/Liability Management Committee is responsible for developing, monitoring and reviewing asset/liability processes, interest rate risk exposures, strategies and tactics and reporting to the board of directors. It is the responsibility of the board of directors to establish policies and interest rate limits and approve these policies and interest rate limits annually. It is the responsibility of management to execute the approved policies, develop and implement risk management strategies and to report to the board of directors on a regular basis. We maintain an asset/liability management policy that provides guidelines for controlling exposure to interest rate risk. The policy guidelines direct management to assess the impact of changes in interest rates upon both earnings and capital. The guidelines establish limits for interest rate risk sensitivity. 

Interest Rate Risk Sensitivity 

We use a number of measures are used to monitor and manage interest rate risk, including income simulations and interest sensitivity (gap) analysis. An income simulation model is the primary tool used to assess the direction and magnitude of changes in net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates. Basic assumptions in the model include prepayment speeds on mortgage-related assets, cash flows and maturities of other investment securities, loan and deposit volumes and pricing. These assumptions are inherently subjective and may not be realized and, as a result, actual results will differ from our projections. In addition, variances in the timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, overall market conditions including volumes and pricing, changes in management strategies, among other factors will also result in variances between projected and actual results. 

The following table summarizes the expected impact on net interest income over a one or two year period if interest rates gradually increased or decreased during the first year, based on the results of the simulation model as of December 31, 2022: 

##TABLE_START Year one Year two Change in basis points (bps) Change in net interest income % Change in net interest income Change in net interest income % Change in net interest income (dollars in thousands) +200 $ 6,420 0.99 % $ 43,017 6.27 % -100 $ (6,445) (0.99) % $ (31,589) (4.61) % ##TABLE_END

The projections are based on the current interest rate environment and a stable balance sheet. Market interest rates increased substantially during 2022 with short-term interest rates increasing substantially more than long-term interest rates resulting in an inverted yield curve at year end. Due to the rise in short-term interest rates, the majority of our floating rate loans are no longer constrained by interest rate floors. However our ability to reprice deposits downward is still limited given our low cost of funds. 

Our asset sensitivity decreased since the prior quarter and year ends mainly due to the decline in deposits during the quarter and the corresponding increase in short-term FHLB borrowings. Balance sheet projections for this analysis include the sales of branches and a corresponding increase in borrowings. The net impact of the change in funding mix was a decrease in the duration of funding, which reduced the net interest income benefits of rising interest rates but also reduced our exposure to falling interest rates. Prudent management of deposit rates and balances will be the key driver in realizing the projected asset sensitivity. 

Net interest income sensitivity excludes the amortization of premiums, discounts and deferred fees on the existing loan portfolio although the amortization of the collar is included in loan interest income. 

On January 23, 2019, the Company entered into an interest rate collar derivative transaction with a $500.0 million notional based on 1-month LIBOR. In October 2020, the collar was terminated and resulted in a $34.4 million realized gain that was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of deferred income taxes. The gain will amortize into interest income through February 2024, which is in line with the initial term of the interest rate collar. The gain will be amortized in this manner as long as the cash flows pertaining to the hedged item are expected to occur. 

The analysis of an institution&#8217;s interest rate gap (the difference between the repricing of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities during a given period of time) is one standard tool for the measurement of the exposure to interest rate risk. We believe that because interest rate gap analysis does not address all factors that can affect earnings performance, it should be used in conjunction with other methods of evaluating interest rate risk. 

The table on the following page sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing, and the resulting interest rate gap of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities at December 31, 2022. The amounts in the table are derived from our internal data and are based upon SEC reporting formats. Therefore, they may not be consistent with financial information appearing elsewhere herein that has been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 

The estimates for net interest income sensitivity and interest rate gap could be significantly affected by external factors such as changes in prepayment assumptions, early withdrawal of deposits and competition. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while other types may lag changes in market interest rates. 

Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, have features that restrict changes in the interest rates of such assets both on a short-term basis and over the lives of such assets. Further, in the event of a change in market interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the tables. Finally, the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable-rate debt may decrease in the event of a substantial increase in market interest rates.

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices 

The impact of inflation on our operations is increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution&#8217;s performance than the effect of general levels of inflation. Although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services, increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates. 

LIBOR Transition 

Management has discontinued use of LIBOR in new contracts, including loans, investment securities and interest rate derivatives. Current actions include the implementation of substitute language for legacy LIBOR-based loans to transition to SOFR before June 2023, at which point LIBOR will no longer be an option for Columbia Bank to use. This is likely to require some additional costs and litigation risk may rise with contract renewals. We are in discussions with our counterparties and tracking industry developments to ensure a smooth transition for clients and competitive loan pricing. 

Please refer to Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this report for further information regarding the interest rate derivatives. As the FASB and the IRS have proposed hedge accounting and taxation relief with regards to the transition, the Company does not anticipate any material impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of the transition away from LIBOR.
