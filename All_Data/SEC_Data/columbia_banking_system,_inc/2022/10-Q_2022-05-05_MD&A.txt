CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

Management has identified the accounting policies related to the ACL, business combinations and the valuation and recoverability of goodwill as critical to an understanding of our financial statements. These policies and related estimates are discussed in &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; under the headings &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses,&#8221; &#8220;Business Combinations&#8221; and &#8220;Valuation and Recoverability of Goodwill&#8221; in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have not been any material changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to those disclosed in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Our results of operations are dependent to a large degree on our net interest income. We also generate noninterest income from our broad range of products and services including treasury management, wealth management and debit and credit cards. Our operating expenses consist primarily of compensation and employee benefits, occupancy, data processing and software and legal and professional fees. Like most financial institutions, our interest income and cost of funds are affected significantly by general economic conditions, particularly changes in market interest rates, and by government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. 

In November 2020, the SEC issued Final Rule 33-10890, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis, Selected Financial Data and Supplementary Financial Information, which modernizes and simplifies certain disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K. One update to Item 303 of Regulation S-K allows registrants to compare the results of the most recently completed quarter to the results of either the immediately preceding quarter or the corresponding quarter of the preceding year. We have adopted this change, as management believes that comparing current quarter results to those of the immediately preceding quarter is more useful in identifying current business trends and provides a more meaningful comparison. Additionally, in the first filing after the adoption of this rule change, we are required to disclose a comparison of the results for the current quarter and the corresponding quarter of the preceding fiscal year. Accordingly, we have compared the results for the three months ended March 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2021, where applicable throughout this Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis. 

Earnings Summary 

Comparison of current quarter to prior quarter 

The Company reported net income for the first quarter of $57.5 million or $0.74 per diluted common share, compared to $42.9 million or $0.55 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter of 2021. Net interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2022 was $146.2 million, an increase of $677 thousand from the prior quarter. The increase was primarily a result of higher interest income related to increased yield for the securities portfolio substantially driven by lower premium amortization. 

Table of Contents 

The Company recorded a $7.8 million recapture for credit losses for the first quarter of 2022 compared to a net provision of $11.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. The decrease in provision expense for the first quarter of 2022 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 was primarily related to improved credit quality. The prior quarter&#8217;s net provision was recorded primarily due to the initial allowance for non-PCD loans acquired in the Bank of Commerce acquisition. 

Noninterest income for the current quarter was $24.2 million, a decrease of $60 thousand from the prior quarter. The decrease was largely due to lower loan fees and mortgage banking revenue partially offset by financial services and trust revenue and other noninterest income including a gain on the sale of loans of $868 thousand for the current quarter. 

Total noninterest expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2022 was $105.1 million, an increase of $2.4 million from the prior quarter. Acquisition-related expenses in the current quarter were $7.1 million compared to $11.8 million for the prior quarter. Taking this into consideration, the largest contributor to the increase in noninterest expense for the current quarter is related to compensation and employee benefits that can be attributed to higher 401k and payroll tax expenses, which are typically elevated in the first quarter. The increase was also attributable to a $500 thousand provision for unfunded loan commitments recorded in the current quarter compared to a $2.0 million recapture recorded in the prior quarter. Higher data processing and software expenses partially offset by lower professional services expense were also drivers of the current quarter increase. 

Comparison of current quarter to prior year period 

The Company reported net income for the first quarter of $57.5 million or $0.74 per diluted common share, compared to $51.9 million or $0.73 per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2021. Net interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2022 was $146.2 million, an increase of $22.2 million from the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to increases in interest income from loans and securities, which were a result of higher average balances partially related to the Bank of Commerce acquisition. 

The Company recorded a $7.8 million recapture for credit losses for the first quarter of 2022 compared to a provision recapture of $800 thousand for the first quarter of 2021. The increase in net provision recapture for the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021 was principally the result of improved credit quality. 

Noninterest income for the current quarter was $24.2 million, an increase of $1.0 million from the prior year period. The increase was largely due to increases associated with other noninterest income, financial services and trust revenue and card revenue offset by lower mortgage banking revenue due to lower overall mortgage production and decreased premium on loan sales as a result of the higher rate environment. 

Total noninterest expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2022 was $105.1 million, an increase of $21.5 million from the prior year period. This increase was primarily driven by higher compensation and employee benefits due to our acquisition of Bank of Commerce in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the prior year period having substantial labor costs capitalized for PPP loan originations. Increased acquisition-related expenses related to legal and professional fees, occupancy and data processing and software also contributed to the increase from the prior year period.

(1) Nonaccrual loans have been included in the tables as loans carrying a zero yield. Amortized net deferred loan fees and net unearned discounts on acquired loans were included in the interest income calculations. The amortization of net deferred loan fees was $4.2 million, $6.2 million and $8.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2021, respectively. The net incremental amortization on acquired loans was $350 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to net incremental accretion of $16 thousand and $1.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2021, respectively. 

(2) Tax-exempt income is calculated on a tax equivalent basis. The tax equivalent yield adjustment to interest earned on loans was $1.1 million for both the three months ended March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 and $1.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The tax equivalent yield adjustment to interest earned on tax exempt securities was $990 thousand, $917 thousand and $733 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2021, respectively.

(1) The change in interest not due solely to volume or rate has been allocated in proportion to the absolute dollar amount of the change in each. 

Comparison of current quarter to prior quarter 

Net interest income for the first quarter of 2022 was $146.2 million, up from $145.5 million for the fourth quarter in 2021. The increase was mainly due to higher interest income related to increased yield on the securities portfolio substantially driven by lower premium amortization partially offset by lower yield on the loan portfolio. Also contributing was lower interest expense as a result of the $35.0 million repayment of subordinated debentures in the prior quarter. 

The Company&#8217;s net interest margin (tax equivalent) increased to 3.12% in the first quarter of 2022, from 3.05% for the prior quarter. This increase was driven by higher yields on securities driven by substantially lower premium amortization partially offset by lower yield on the loan portfolio. A stronger earning assets mix with a lower ratio of low-yield interest-earning deposits with banks was also a contributing factor to the improved net interest margin. The Company&#8217;s operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) 1 increased to 3.15% from 3.08% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. The increase was also due to higher yields on securities and a stronger earnings mix as noted above. 

Comparison of current quarter to prior year period 

Net interest income for the first quarter of 2022 was $146.2 million, up from $124.0 million for the same quarter in 2021. The increase was mainly due to an increase in interest income from loans and securities due to higher average balances partially related to the Bank of Commerce acquisition. 

1 Operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the &#8220;Non-GAAP financial measures&#8221; section in this Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis. 

Table of Contents 

The Company&#8217;s net interest margin (tax equivalent) decreased to 3.12% in the first quarter of 2022, from 3.31% for the prior year period. This decrease was driven by lower average rates on loans. The Company&#8217;s operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) decreased to 3.15% from 3.30% compared to the first quarter of 2021, which was also due to lower average rates on loans. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

Comparison of current quarter to prior quarter 

During the first quarter of 2022, the Company recorded a $7.8 million recapture for credit losses for the first quarter of 2022 compared to a net provision of $11.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. The decrease in provision expense for the first quarter of 2022 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 was related to improved credit quality. The prior quarter&#8217;s net provision was recorded due to the initial allowance for non-PCD loans acquired in the Bank of Commerce acquisition. 

Comparison of current quarter to prior year period 

During the first quarter of 2022, the Company recorded a $7.8 million recapture for credit losses compared to an $800 thousand net provision recapture during the first quarter of 2021. This was principally the result of credit quality improvement. 

The net provision recapture for credit losses recorded during the current quarter also reflected management&#8217;s ongoing assessment of the credit quality of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio. Other factors affecting the provision include net charge-offs, credit quality migration and the size and composition of the loan portfolio and changes in the economic environment during the first quarter of 2022. The amount of provision was calculated in accordance with the Company&#8217;s methodology for determining the ACL, discussed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 1. Financial Statements (unaudited)&#8221; of this report.

Comparison of current quarter to prior quarter 

Noninterest income was $24.2 million for the first quarter of 2022, a decrease of $60 thousand from the prior quarter. This decrease was due to lower loan fees and mortgage banking revenue partially offset by higher financial services and trust revenue and other noninterest income including a gain on the sale of loans of $868 thousand in the current quarter. 

Comparison of current quarter to prior year period 

Noninterest income was $24.2 million for the first quarter of 2022, compared to $23.2 million for the same period in 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases associated with other noninterest income, financial services and trust revenue and card revenue offset by lower mortgage banking revenue due to lower overall mortgage production and decreased premium on loan sales as a result of the higher rate environment.

Comparison of current quarter to prior quarter 

Noninterest expense was $105.1 million for the first quarter of 2022, an increase of $2.4 million from $102.6 million for the prior quarter. Acquisition-related expenses in the current quarter were $7.1 million compared to $11.8 million for the prior quarter. Taking this into consideration, the largest contributor to the increase in noninterest expense for the current quarter is related to compensation and employee benefits that can be attributed to higher 401k and payroll tax expenses, which are typically elevated in the first quarter. The increase was also attributable to a $500 thousand provision for unfunded loan commitments recorded in the current quarter compared to a $2.0 million recapture recorded in the prior quarter. Higher data processing and software expenses partially offset by lower professional services expense were also drivers of the current quarter increase. 

Comparison of current quarter to prior year period 

Noninterest expense was $105.1 million for the first quarter of 2022, an increase of $21.5 million from $83.6 million for the prior year period. This increase was mostly attributable to higher compensation and employee benefits due to our acquisition of Bank of Commerce in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the prior year period having substantial labor costs capitalized for PPP loan originations. Increased acquisition-related expenses related to legal and professional fees, occupancy and data processing and software also contributed to the increase from the prior year period. 

The provision for unfunded loan commitments for the periods indicated are as follows: 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 March 31, 2021 (in thousands) Provision for unfunded loan commitments $ 500 $ (2,000) $ 1,500 

Income Taxes 

We recorded an income tax provision of $15.6 million for the first quarter of 2022, compared to a provision of $13.1 million and $12.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2021, respectively. The effective tax rate was 21%, 23% and 19% for the three months ended March 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2021, respectively. For additional information, please refer to the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION 

Total assets were $20.96 billion at March 31, 2022, an increase of $18.6 million from December 31, 2021. Cash and cash equivalents increased $147.8 million. Loans increased $117.7 million during the first three months of 2022, which was primarily the result of new loan production partially offset by loan payments. Debt securities available for sale were $5.53 billion at March 31, 2022, a decrease of $383.6 million from December 31, 2021 which was primarily due to fair value movement. Total liabilities were $18.60 billion as of March 31, 2022, an increase of $246.6 million from December 31, 2021 primarily due to an increase in interest-bearing deposits. 

Investment Securities 

At March 31, 2022, the Company&#8217;s investment portfolio primarily consisted of debt securities available for sale totaling $5.53 billion compared to $5.91 billion at December 31, 2021 and debt securities held to maturity of $2.20 billion at March 31, 2022 compared to $2.15 billion at December 31, 2021. The decrease in the debt securities available for sale from year-end is due to a $338.7 million decline in unrealized gains, $221.7 million in maturities and repayments, and $7.0 million in premium amortization, partially offset by $183.8 million in purchases. The increase in debt securities held to maturity from year-end is due to purchases of $97.7 million, partially offset by $38.9 million in maturities and repayments and $4.7 million in premium amortization. The average duration of our debt securities available for sale was approximately 5 years and 1 month at March 31, 2022. The average duration of our debt securities held to maturity was approximately 5 years and 9 months at March 31, 2022. These durations take into account calls, where appropriate, and consensus prepayment speeds. 

The investment securities are used by the Company as a component of its balance sheet management strategies. From time-to-time, securities may be sold to reposition the portfolio in response to strategies developed by the Company&#8217;s asset liability management committee. In accordance with our investment strategy, management monitors market conditions with a view to realize gains on its available for sale securities portfolio when prudent. 

Table of Contents 

The Company performs a quarterly assessment to determine whether a decline in fair value below amortized cost exists. Amortized cost includes adjustments made to the cost of an investment for accretion, amortization, collection of cash and previous credit losses recognized in earnings. 

When the fair value of an available for sale debt security falls below the amortized cost basis, it is evaluated to determine if any of the decline in value is attributable to credit loss. Decreases in fair value attributable to credit loss would be recorded directly to earnings with a corresponding allowance for credit losses, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. If the credit quality subsequently improves, the allowance would be reversed up to a maximum of the previously recorded credit losses. If the Company intends to sell an impaired available for sale debt security, or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security prior to recovering the amortized cost basis, the entire fair value adjustment would be immediately recognized in earnings with no corresponding allowance for credit losses. 

At March 31, 2022, the market value of debt securities available for sale had a net unrealized loss of $325.8 million compared to a net unrealized gain of $13.0 million at December 31, 2021. The change in valuation was the result of fluctuations in market interest rates during the three months ended March 31, 2022. At March 31, 2022, the Company had $4.68 billion of debt securities available for sale with gross unrealized losses of $337.5 million; however, we did not consider these investment securities to have an indicated credit loss. 

All of the Company&#8217;s debt securities held to maturity were issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. These securities carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government, are widely recognized as &#8220;risk free,&#8221; and have a long history of zero credit loss. Therefore, the Company did not record an allowance for credit losses for these securities as of March 31, 2022. 

The following table sets forth our securities portfolio by type for the dates indicated: 

March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (in thousands) Debt securities available for sale: U.S. government agency and government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations $ 3,407,654 $ 3,745,601 Other asset-backed securities 408,047 463,063 State and municipal securities 938,965 997,291 U.S. government agency and government-sponsored enterprise securities 239,274 252,576 U.S. government securities 173,342 157,536 Non-agency collateralized mortgage securities 360,089 294,932 Total debt securities available for sale, at fair value $ 5,527,371 $ 5,910,999 Debt securities held to maturity: U.S. government agency and government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations $ 2,202,437 $ 2,148,327 Total debt securities held to maturity, at amortized cost $ 2,202,437 $ 2,148,327 Equity securities 13,425 13,425 Total investment securities $ 7,743,233 $ 8,072,751

Credit Risk Management 

The extension of credit in the form of loans or other credit substitutes to individuals and businesses is one of our principal business activities. Our policies and applicable laws and regulations require risk analysis as well as ongoing portfolio and credit management. We manage our credit risk through lending limit constraints, credit review, approval policies and extensive, ongoing internal monitoring. We also manage credit risk through diversification of the loan portfolio by type of loan, type of industry and type of borrower and by limiting the aggregation of debt to a single borrower. 

Table of Contents 

In analyzing our existing portfolio, we review our consumer and residential loan portfolios by their performance as a pool of loans, since no single loan is individually significant or judged by its risk rating, size or potential risk of loss. In contrast, the monitoring process for the commercial business, real estate construction and commercial real estate portfolios includes periodic reviews of individual loans with risk ratings assigned to each loan and performance judged on a loan-by-loan basis. 

We review these loans to assess the ability of our borrowers to service all interest and principal obligations and, as a result, the risk rating may be adjusted accordingly. In the event that full collection of principal and interest is not reasonably assured, the loan is appropriately downgraded and, if warranted, placed on nonaccrual status even though the loan may be current as to principal and interest payments. Additionally, we assess whether an individually measured allowance is required for collateral dependent nonaccrual loans with balances equal to or greater than $500,000 and with respect to which foreclosure is probable. For the individually measured collateral dependent nonaccrual loan, the allowance for credit losses is equal to the difference between amortized cost of the loan and the determined value of the collateral. However, if the determined value of the collateral is greater than the amortized cost of the loan, no allowance for credit losses will be added for these loans. 

For additional discussion on our methodology in managing credit risk within our loan portfolio, see the &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; section in this Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of the Company&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Loan policies, credit quality criteria, portfolio guidelines and other controls are established under the guidance of our Chief Credit Officer and approved, as appropriate, by the Board of Directors. Credit Administration, together with the management loan committee, has the responsibility for administering the credit approval process. As another part of its control process, we use an internal credit review and examination function to provide reasonable assurance that loans and commitments are made and maintained as prescribed by our credit policies. Examinations are performed to ensure continued performance and proper risk assessment. 

Loan Portfolio Analysis 

Our wholly owned banking subsidiary Columbia State Bank is a full service commercial bank, which originates a wide variety of loans, and focuses its lending efforts on originating commercial real estate and commercial business loans. 

The following table provides additional detail related to the net premium (discount) of acquired and purchased loans by acquisition: 

March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (in thousands) Acquisition: Bank of Commerce $ 11,377 $ 12,923 Pacific Continental (4,773) (5,306) All other purchased and acquired net premium 5,082 5,031 Total net premium at period end $ 11,686 $ 12,648 

Commercial Real Estate Loans: Commercial real estate loans are secured by properties located within our primary market areas and typically, have loan-to-value ratios of 80% or lower at origination. Our underwriting standards for commercial and multifamily residential loans generally require that the loan-to-value ratio for these loans not exceed 75% of appraised value, cost, or discounted cash flow value, as appropriate, and that commercial properties maintain debt coverage ratios (net operating income divided by annual debt servicing) of 1.2 or better. However, underwriting standards can be influenced by competition and other factors. We endeavor to maintain the highest practical underwriting standards while balancing the need to remain competitive in our lending practices. 

Commercial Business Loans: Our commercial business lending is directed toward meeting the credit and related deposit and treasury management needs of small to medium sized businesses. Commercial and industrial loans are primarily underwritten based on the identified cash flows of the borrower&#8217;s operations and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower and/or the strength of the guarantor. The majority of these loan provide financing for working capital and capital expenditures. Loan terms, including, loan maturity, fixed or adjustable interest rate and collateral considerations, are based on factors such as the loan purpose, collateral type and industry and are underwritten on an individual loan basis. 

Table of Contents 

Agriculture Loans: Agricultural lending includes agricultural real estate and production loans and lines of credit within our primary market area. We are committed to our Pacific Northwest communities offering seasonal and longer-term loans and operating lines of credit by lending officers with expertise in the agricultural communities we serve. Typical loan-to-value ratios on term loans can range from 55% to 80% depending upon the type of loan. Operating lines of credit require the borrower to provide a 20% to 25% equity investment. The debt coverage ratio is generally 1.25 or better on all term loans. 

Construction Loans: We originate a variety of real estate construction loans. Underwriting guidelines for these loans vary by loan type but include loan-to-value limits, term limits and loan advance limits, as applicable. Our underwriting guidelines for commercial and multifamily residential real estate construction loans generally require that the loan-to-value ratio not exceed 75% and stabilized debt coverage ratios (net operating income divided by annual debt service) of 1.2 or better. As noted above, underwriting standards can be influenced by competition and other factors. However, we endeavor to maintain the highest practical underwriting standards while balancing the need to remain competitive in our lending practices. 

One-to-four Family Residential Real Estate Loans: One-to-four family residential loans, including home equity loans and lines of credit, are secured by properties located within our primary market areas and, typically, have loan-to-value ratios of 80% or lower at origination. 

Other Consumer Loans: Consumer loans include automobile loans, boat and recreational vehicle financing and other miscellaneous personal loans. 

Foreign Loans: The Company has no material foreign activities. Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s loans and unfunded commitments are geographically concentrated in its service areas within the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho and California. 

For additional information on our loan portfolio, including amounts pledged as collateral on borrowings, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 1. Financial Statements (unaudited)&#8221; of this report. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The ACL is an accounting estimate of expected credit losses in our loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The provision for credit losses is the expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income to adjust the ACL to the levels deemed appropriate by management, as measured by the Company&#8217;s credit loss estimation methodologies. The allowance for unfunded commitments and letters of credit is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated expected losses related to these unfunded credit facilities at the balance sheet date. 

At March 31, 2022, our ACL was $146.9 million, or 1.37% of total loans (excluding loans held for sale). This compares with an ACL of $155.6 million, or 1.46% of total loans (excluding loans held for sale) at December 31, 2021 and an ACL of $148.3 million or 1.53% of total loans (excluding loans held for sale) at March 31, 2021. The decrease from year end was primarily due to significant improvement in portfolio risk ratings as well as the percentage of problem loans to total loans reaching pre-pandemic levels. The ACL at March 31, 2022 does not include a reserve for the PPP loans as they are fully guaranteed by the SBA. 

For additional information on our allowances for credit losses and allowance for unfunded commitments and letters of credit, as well as the credit quality of the loan portfolio, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220; I tem 1. Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited ) &#8221; of this report.

Liquidity and Sources of Funds 

Our primary sources of funds are customer deposits. Additionally, we utilize advances from the FHLB, borrowings from the FRB, sweep repurchase agreements, subordinated debentures and junior subordinated debentures assumed in acquisitions and a revolving line of credit to supplement our funding needs. These funds, together with loan repayments, loan sales, retained earnings, equity and other borrowed funds are used to make loans, to acquire securities, meet deposit withdrawals and maturing liabilities, to acquire other assets and to fund continuing operations. 

In addition, we have a shelf registration statement on file with the SEC registering an unspecified amount of any combination of debt or equity securities, depository shares, purchase contracts, units and warrants in one or more offerings. Specific information regarding the terms of and the securities being offered will be provided at the time of any offering. Proceeds from any future offerings are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the repayment of debt, repurchasing or redeeming outstanding securities, working capital, funding future acquisitions or other purposes identified at the time of any offering. 

Deposit Activities 

Our deposit products include a wide variety of transaction accounts, savings accounts and time deposit accounts. We have established a branch system to serve our consumer and business depositors. Deposits increased $289.1 million from December 31, 2021. Management&#8217;s strategy for funding asset growth is to make use of public funds and brokered and other wholesale deposits on an as-needed basis. The Company participates in the CD Option of IntraFi Network Deposits program, which is a network that allows participating banks to offer extended FDIC deposit insurance coverage on time deposits. The Company also participates in a similar program to offer extended FDIC deposit insurance coverage on money market accounts. These extended deposit insurance programs are generally available only to existing customers and are not used as a means of generating additional liquidity. At March 31, 2022, brokered deposits, reciprocal money market accounts and other wholesale deposits (excluding public funds) totaled $1.11 billion, or 6.1% of total deposits, compared to $821.7 million or 4.6% at year-end 2021. These deposits have varied maturities. 

The following table sets forth the Company&#8217;s deposit base by type of product for the dates indicated: 

March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Balance % of Total Balance % of Total (dollars in thousands) Demand and other noninterest-bearing $ 8,790,138 48.1 % $ 8,856,714 49.1 % Money market 3,501,723 19.1 % 3,525,299 19.6 % Interest-bearing demand 2,103,053 11.5 % 1,999,407 11.1 % Savings 1,637,451 8.9 % 1,617,546 9.0 % Interest-bearing public funds, other than certificates of deposit 775,048 4.2 % 779,146 4.3 % Certificates of deposit, less than $250,000 239,863 1.3 % 249,120 1.4 % Certificates of deposit, $250,000 or more 145,372 0.8 % 160,490 0.9 % Certificates of deposit insured by the CD Option of IntraFi Network Deposits 32,608 0.2 % 35,611 0.2 % Reciprocal money market accounts 1,073,405 5.9 % 786,046 4.4 % Subtotal $ 18,298,661 100.0 % $ 18,009,379 100.0 % Valuation adjustment resulting from acquisition accounting $ 552 $ 736 Total deposits $ 18,299,213 $ 18,010,115

Borrowings 

We rely on FHLB advances and FRB borrowings as another source of both short and long-term funding. FHLB advances and FRB borrowings are secured by investment securities and residential, commercial and commercial real estate loans. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had FHLB advances of $7.3 million and $7.4 million, respectively. 

We also utilize wholesale and retail repurchase agreements to supplement our funding sources. Our wholesale repurchase agreements are secured by mortgage-backed securities. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had deposit customer sweep-related repurchase agreements of $44.2 million and $86.0 million, respectively, which mature on a daily basis. 

Subordinated debentures and junior subordinated debentures are another source of funding. On October 1, 2021, with its acquisition of Bank of Commerce, the Company assumed $10.0 million in aggregate principal amount of subordinated debentures, which are unsecured, and mature on December 10, 2025. Also assumed through the Bank of Commerce acquisition were $10.3 million of trust preferred obligations which are redeemable at the Company&#8217;s option on any March 15, June 15, September 15, or December 15. 

The Company has a $15.0 million short-term credit facility with an unaffiliated bank. This facility provides the Company additional liquidity, if needed, for various corporate activities including the repurchase of shares of Columbia Banking System, Inc. common stock. At both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there was no balance associated with this credit facility. The credit agreement requires the Company to comply with certain covenants including those related to asset quality and capital levels. The Company was in compliance with all covenants associated with this facility at March 31, 2022. 

Management anticipates we will continue to rely on FHLB advances, FRB borrowings, the short-term credit facility and wholesale and retail repurchase agreements in the future. We will use those funds primarily to make loans and purchase securities. 

Contractual Obligations, Commitments &#38; Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We are party to many contractual financial obligations, including repayments of borrowings, operating and equipment lease payments, off-balance sheet commitments to extend credit and investments in affordable housing partnerships. At March 31, 2022, we had commitments to extend credit of $3.67 billion compared to $3.54 billion at December 31, 2021. 

Capital Resources 

Shareholders&#8217; equity at March 31, 2022 was $2.36 billion, compared to $2.59 billion at December 31, 2021. Shareholders&#8217; equity was 11% and 12% of total period-end assets at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

Regulatory Capital 

In July 2013, the federal bank regulators approved the Capital Rules (as discussed in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K, &#8220;Item 1. Business&#8212;Supervision and Regulation and &#8212;Regulatory Capital Requirements&#8221;), which implement the Basel III capital framework and various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, which were fully phased in as of January 1, 2019. As of March 31, 2022, we and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements under the Capital Rules. 

FDIC regulations set forth the qualifications necessary for a bank to be classified as &#8220;well-capitalized,&#8221; primarily for assignment of FDIC insurance premium rates. Failure to qualify as &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; can negatively impact a bank&#8217;s ability to expand and to engage in certain activities. The Company and the Bank qualified as &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

As part of its response to the impact of COVID-19, the U.S. federal regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that provided the option to temporarily delay certain effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three year transition period. The interim final rule allows bank holding companies and banks to delay for two years 100% of the day one impact of adopting CECL and 25% of the cumulative change in the reported allowance for credit losses since adopting CECL. The Company elected to adopt the interim final rule. As a result, certain capital ratios and amounts as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 have a reduced impact of the increased allowance for credit losses related to the adoption of CECL.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

The Company considers operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) to be a useful measurement as it more closely reflects the ongoing operating performance of the Company. Additionally, presentation of the operating net interest margin allows readers to compare certain aspects of the Company&#8217;s net interest margin to other organizations that may not have had significant acquisitions. Despite the usefulness of the operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) to the Company, there is no standardized definition for it and, as a result, the Company&#8217;s calculations may not be comparable with other organizations. The Company encourages readers to consider its Consolidated Financial Statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. 

The following table reconciles the Company&#8217;s calculation of the operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) to the net interest margin (tax equivalent) for the periods indicated: 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 March 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands) Operating net interest margin non-GAAP reconciliation: Net interest income (tax equivalent) (1) $ 148,268 $ 147,574 $ 125,889 Adjustments to arrive at operating net interest income (tax equivalent): Incremental accretion income on acquired loans 350 (16) (1,055) Premium amortization on acquired securities 1,031 1,278 520 Operating net interest income (tax equivalent) (1) $ 149,649 $ 148,836 $ 125,354 Average interest earning assets $ 19,266,644 $ 19,186,398 $ 15,419,371 Net interest margin (tax equivalent) (1) 3.12 % 3.05 % 3.31 % Operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) (1) 3.15 % 3.08 % 3.30 % 

__________ 

(1) Tax-exempt interest income has been adjusted to a tax equivalent basis. The amount of such adjustment was an addition to net interest income of $2.1 million for both the three months ended March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, and $1.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021.
