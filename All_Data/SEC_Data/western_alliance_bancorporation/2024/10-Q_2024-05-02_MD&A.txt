Recent Banking Industry and Market Developments 

Banking Industry 

In November 2023, the FDIC approved a final rule implementing a special assessment to recover losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund associated with protecting uninsured depositors following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The assessment base is equal to an institution&#8217;s estimated uninsured deposits as of December 31, 2022, adjusted to exclude the first $5 billion of estimated uninsured deposits. The special assessment will be collected over an eight-quarter collection period, at a quarterly rate of 3.36 basis points, with the first quarterly assessment period beginning on January 1, 2024. The amount of the total special assessment is subject to adjustment and will not be finalized by the FDIC until after termination of the receiverships. The Company recognized a charge of $17.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due to an adjustment of the loss estimate. 

Market Developments 

The Company's loan portfolio includes significant credit exposure to the CRE market, with CRE related loans comprising approximately 32% and 33% of total loans at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Approximately 16% of CRE loans, excluding construction and land loans, were owner occupied at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and approximately 5% were non-owner occupied office loans at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As elevated focus on the evolving industry dynamics facing the CRE market have emerged over the past year, the Company has been proactive in establishing enhanced monitoring policies and procedures as it relates to its CRE loans and has undertaken actions to limit growth of its CRE portfolio, as further discussed in &#8220;Item 1. Business, Lending Activities &#8211; Asset Quality&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. While the Company has not incurred significant charge-offs on its CRE portfolio to date, CRE market conditions may worsen, which could result in deterioration of asset quality in this portfolio.

For all banks and bank holding companies, asset quality plays a significant role in the overall financial condition of the institution and results of operations. The Company measures asset quality in terms of nonaccrual loans as a percentage of gross loans and net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans. Net charge-offs are calculated as the difference between charged-off loans and recovery payments received on previously charged-off loans. The following table summarizes the Company's key asset quality metrics for loans HFI: 

March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 (dollars in millions) Nonaccrual loans $ 399 &#160; $ 273 Repossessed assets 8 &#160; 8 Non-performing assets 542 &#160; 418 Nonaccrual loans to funded loans 0.79 &#160; % 0.54 % Nonaccrual and repossessed assets to total assets 0.53 &#160; 0.40 Allowance for loan losses to funded loans 0.67 &#160; 0.67 Allowance for credit losses to funded loans 0.74 &#160; 0.73 Net charge-offs to average loans outstanding (1) 0.08 &#160; 0.06

Asset and Deposit Growth 

The Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities are comprised primarily of loans and deposits. Therefore, the ability to originate new loans and attract new deposits is fundamental to the Company&#8217;s growth. 

Total assets increased to $77.0 billion at March 31, 2024 from $70.9 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase in total assets of $6.1 billion, or 8.6%, was driven by an increase in deposits, which contributed to an increase in investment securities of $3.4 billion and an increase in cash of $2.0 billion. Loans HFI increased by $403 million, or 0.8%, to $50.7 billion as of March 31, 2024, compared to $50.3 billion as of December 31, 2023. By loan type, commercial and industrial loans increased $646 million from December 31, 2023, partially offset by decreases in residential real estate and construction and land development loans of $154 million and $108 million, respectively. Loans HFS increased $439 million from $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2023 due to an increase in non-EBO and agency conforming loans. 

Total deposits increased $6.9 billion, or 12.5%, to $62.2 billion as of March 31, 2024 from $55.3 billion as of December 31, 2023. By type, the increase in deposits from December 31, 2023 was driven by an increase of $3.9 billion in non-interest bearing demand deposits, $1.4 billion in savings and money market accounts, $1.0 billion in interest bearing demand deposits, and $564 million in certificates of deposit. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following table sets forth a summary financial overview: 

Three Months Ended March 31, Increase 2024 2023 (Decrease) (in millions, except per share amounts) Consolidated Income Statement Data: Interest income $ 1,055.0 &#160; $ 968.9 $ 86.1 &#160; Interest expense 456.1 &#160; 359.0 97.1 &#160; Net interest income 598.9 &#160; 609.9 (11.0) Provision for credit losses 15.2 &#160; 19.4 (4.2) Net interest income after provision for credit losses 583.7 &#160; 590.5 (6.8) Non-interest income 129.9 &#160; (58.0) 187.9 &#160; Non-interest expense 481.8 &#160; 347.9 133.9 &#160; Income before provision for income taxes 231.8 &#160; 184.6 47.2 &#160; Income tax expense 54.4 &#160; 42.4 12.0 &#160; Net income 177.4 &#160; 142.2 35.2 &#160; Dividends on preferred stock 3.2 &#160; 3.2 &#8212; &#160; Net income available to common stockholders $ 174.2 &#160; $ 139.0 $ 35.2 &#160; Earnings per share: Basic $ 1.61 &#160; $ 1.29 $ 0.32 &#160; Diluted 1.60 &#160; 1.28 0.32 &#160; 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

The following discussion and analysis contains financial information determined by methods other than those prescribed by GAAP. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in their analysis of the Company's performance. Management believes presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a complete understanding of the operating results of the Company. Since the presentation of these non-GAAP performance measures and their impact differ between companies, these non-GAAP disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. 

Pre-Provision Net Revenue 

Banking regulations define PPNR as the sum of net interest income and non-interest income less expenses before adjusting for loss provisions. Management believes that this is an important metric as it illustrates the underlying performance of the Company, it enables investors and others to assess the Company's ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through the credit cycle, and provides consistent reporting with a key metric used by bank regulatory agencies. 

The following table shows the components used in the calculation of PPNR: 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 2023 (in millions) Total non-interest income $ 129.9 &#160; $ (58.0) Net interest income 598.9 &#160; 609.9 Net revenue $ 728.8 &#160; $ 551.9 Total non-interest expense 481.8 &#160; 347.9 Pre-provision net revenue $ 247.0 &#160; $ 204.0 Total non-interest expense 481.8 &#160; 347.9 Adjusted for: FDIC special assessment 17.6 &#160; &#8212; Total non-interest expense, adjusted $ 464.2 &#160; $ 347.9 Pre-provision net revenue, adjusted $ 264.6 &#160; $ 204.0 Less: Provision for credit losses 15.2 &#160; 19.4 Income tax expense 54.4 &#160; 42.4 FDIC Special Assessment 17.6 &#160; &#8212; Net income $ 177.4 &#160; $ 142.2 

Efficiency Ratio 

The following table shows the components used in the calculation of the efficiency ratio, which management uses as a metric for assessing cost efficiency: 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 2023 (dollars in millions) Total non-interest expense $ 481.8 &#160; $ 347.9 Total non-interest expense, adjusted $ 464.2 &#160; $ 347.9 Divided by: Total net interest income 598.9 &#160; 609.9 Plus: Tax equivalent interest adjustment 9.6 &#160; 8.8 Total non-interest income 129.9 &#160; (58.0) $ 738.4 &#160; $ 560.7 Efficiency ratio - tax equivalent basis 65.2 &#160; % 62.0 % Efficiency ratio - tax equivalent basis, adjusted 62.9 &#160; 62.0 

Net Income, Adjusted and Earnings Per Share, Adjusted 

The following table shows the components used in the calculation of earnings per share for the three months ended March 31, 2024, adjusted to exclude the FDIC special assessment, which management believes is more comparable to historical earnings trends: 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 (in millions, except per share amounts) Net income $ 177.4 &#160; Adjusted for: FDIC special assessment 17.6 &#160; Tax effect of adjustments (4.1) Net income, adjusted $ 190.9 &#160; Dividends on preferred stock 3.2 &#160; Net income available to common stockholders, adjusted $ 187.7 &#160; FDIC special assessment (17.6) Tax effect of adjustments 4.1 &#160; Net income available to common stockholders $ 174.2 &#160; Weighted average number of common shares outstanding: Basic 108.5 &#160; Diluted 109.0 &#160; Earnings per share, adjusted: Basic, adjusted $ 1.73 &#160; Diluted, adjusted 1.72 &#160; 

Return on Average Equity, Adjusted and Return on Average Assets, Adjusted 

The following table shows the components used in the calculation of return on average equity and return on average assets for the three months ended March 31, 2024, adjusted to exclude the FDIC special assessment, which management believes is more comparable to historical earnings trends: 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 (dollars in millions) Net income available to common stockholders, adjusted $ 187.7 &#160; Divided by: Average stockholders' equity 6,184 &#160; Return on average equity, adjusted 12.4 &#160; % 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 (dollars in millions) Net income, adjusted $ 190.9 &#160; Divided by: Average assets 72,681 &#160; Return on average assets, adjusted 1.06 &#160; % 

Tangible Common Equity and Return on Average Tangible Common Equity 

The following tables present financial measures related to tangible common equity. Tangible common equity represents total stockholders' equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets and preferred stock. Management believes that tangible common equity financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company's capital strength, financial condition, and ability to manage potential losses. 

March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 (dollars and shares in millions) Total stockholders' equity $ 6,172 &#160; $ 6,078 Less: Goodwill and intangible assets 666 &#160; 669 Preferred stock 295 &#160; 295 Total tangible common stockholders' equity 5,211 &#160; 5,114 Plus: deferred tax - attributed to intangible assets 2 &#160; 2 Total tangible common equity, net of tax $ 5,213 &#160; $ 5,116 Total assets $ 76,989 &#160; $ 70,862 Less: goodwill and intangible assets, net 666 &#160; 669 Tangible assets 76,323 &#160; 70,193 Plus: deferred tax - attributed to intangible assets 2 &#160; 2 Total tangible assets, net of tax $ 76,325 &#160; $ 70,195 Tangible common equity ratio 6.8 &#160; % 7.3 % Common shares outstanding 110.2 &#160; 109.5 Book value per common share $ 53.33 &#160; $ 52.81 Tangible book value per common share, net of tax 47.30 &#160; 46.72

Regulatory Capital 

The following table presents certain financial measures related to regulatory capital under Basel III, which includes CET1 and total capital. The FRB and other banking regulators use CET1 and total capital as a basis for assessing a bank's capital adequacy; therefore, management believes it is useful to assess financial condition and capital adequacy using this same basis. Specifically, the total capital ratio takes into consideration the risk levels of assets and off-balance sheet financial instruments. In addition, management believes that the classified assets to CET1 plus allowance measure is an important regulatory metric for assessing asset quality. 

As permitted by the regulatory capital rules, the Company elected the CECL transition option that delayed the estimated impact on regulatory capital resulting from the adoption of CECL over a five-year transition period ending December 31, 2024. Accordingly, beginning in 2024, capital ratios and amounts include a 25% capital benefit that resulted from the increased ACL related to the adoption of ASC 326. 

March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 (dollars in millions) Common equity tier 1: Common equity $ 5,890 &#160; $ 5,807 Less: Non-qualifying goodwill and intangibles 655 &#160; 658 Disallowed deferred tax asset 6 &#160; 3 AOCI related adjustments (560) (516) Unrealized gain on changes in fair value liabilities 2 &#160; 3 Common equity tier 1 $ 5,787 &#160; $ 5,659 Divided by: Risk-weighted assets $ 52,545 &#160; $ 52,517 Common equity tier 1 ratio 11.0 &#160; % 10.8 % Common equity tier 1 $ 5,787 &#160; $ 5,659 Plus: Preferred stock and trust preferred securities 376 &#160; 376 Tier 1 capital $ 6,163 &#160; $ 6,035 Divided by: Tangible average assets $ 72,766 &#160; $ 70,295 Tier 1 leverage ratio 8.5 &#160; % 8.6 % Total capital: Tier 1 capital $ 6,163 &#160; $ 6,035 Plus: Subordinated debt 818 &#160; 818 Adjusted allowances for credit losses 368 &#160; 348 Tier 2 capital 1,186 &#160; 1,166 Total capital $ 7,349 &#160; $ 7,201 Total capital ratio 14.0 &#160; % 13.7 % Classified assets to tier 1 capital plus allowance: Classified assets $ 781 &#160; $ 673 Divided by: Tier 1 capital 6,163 &#160; 6,035 Plus: Adjusted allowances for credit losses 368 &#160; 348 Total Tier 1 capital plus adjusted allowances for credit losses $ 6,531 &#160; $ 6,383 Classified assets to tier 1 capital plus allowance 12.0 &#160; % 10.5 % 

Net Interest Margin 

The net interest margin is reported on a TEB. A tax equivalent adjustment is added to reflect interest earned on certain securities and loans that are exempt from federal and state income tax. The following tables set forth the average balances, interest income, interest expense, and average yield (on a fully TEB) for the periods indicated:

Comparison of interest income, interest expense and net interest margin 

The Company's primary source of revenue is interest income. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, interest income was $1.1 billion, an increase of $86.1 million, or 8.9%, compared to $968.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. This increase was primarily the result of a $47.9 million increase in interest income from investment securities due to an increase in the average investment balance of $4.1 billion and a $31.4 million increase in interest income from loans HFI that was driven primarily by higher yields and partially offset by lower average HFI loan balances of $2.2 billion. 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, interest expense was $456.1 million, an increase of $97.1 million, compared to $359.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in interest expense was due to an increase in interest expense on deposits of $149.0 million driven by a $7.6 billion increase in the average interest-bearing deposit balance and increased interest rates, partially offset by a $52.1 million decrease in interest expense on borrowings resulting from a decrease in average borrowing balances of $4.4 billion. 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, net interest income was $598.9 million, a decrease of $11.0 million, or 1.8%, compared to $609.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in net interest income was driven by the higher rate environment and reflects a $3.2 billion increase in average interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by an increase in yields on interest-earning assets. The decrease in net interest margin of 19 basis points to 3.60% is largely the result of an increase in both the rates and balances of deposits, partially offset by higher yields on HFI loans and a decrease in borrowings compared to the same period in 2023. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses in each period is reflected as a reduction in earnings for that period and includes amounts related to funded loans, unfunded loan commitments, and investment securities. The provision is equal to the amount required to maintain the ACL at a level that is adequate to absorb estimated lifetime credit losses inherent in the loan and investment securities portfolios based on remaining contractual maturity, adjusted for estimated prepayments as of each period end. The Company's CECL models incorporate historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts in measuring expected credit losses. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $15.2 million, compared to $19.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The provision for credit losses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 is primarily reflective of loan growth, net charge-offs of $9.8 million, and a stable economic outlook. 

Non-interest Income 

The following table presents a summary of non-interest income: 

Three Months Ended March 31, Increase (Decrease) 2024 2023 (in millions) Net loan servicing revenue $ 46.4 &#160; $ 41.9 $ 4.5 &#160; Net gain on loan origination and sale activities 45.3 &#160; 31.4 13.9 &#160; Income from equity investments 17.1 &#160; 1.4 15.7 &#160; Service charges and fees 9.9 &#160; 9.5 0.4 &#160; Commercial banking related income 6.5 &#160; 6.2 0.3 &#160; Fair value gain (loss) adjustments, net 0.3 &#160; (147.8) 148.1 &#160; (Loss) gain on recovery from credit guarantees (0.5) 3.3 (3.8) Loss on sales of investment securities (0.9) (12.5) 11.6 &#160; Other income 5.8 &#160; 8.6 (2.8) Total non-interest income $ 129.9 &#160; $ (58.0) $ 187.9 &#160; 

Total non-interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 increased $187.9 million. The increase in non-interest income from the three months ended March 31, 2023 was primarily driven by a net fair value loss adjustment of $147.8 million recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2023 due to the Company's balance sheet repositioning in the prior year that did not reoccur. Also contributing to the increase in non-interest income was an increase in income from equity investments of $15.7 million and a net increase in mortgage banking income as net gain on loan origination and sale activities increased $13.9 million from higher production volume and spreads. 

Non-interest Expense 

The following table presents a summary of non-interest expense: 

Three Months Ended March 31, Increase (Decrease) 2024 2023 (in millions) Salaries and employee benefits $ 154.9 &#160; $ 148.9 $ 6.0 &#160; Deposit costs 137.0 &#160; 86.9 50.1 &#160; Insurance 58.9 &#160; 15.7 43.2 &#160; Data processing 36.0 &#160; 26.4 9.6 &#160; Legal, professional, and directors' fees 30.1 &#160; 23.1 7.0 &#160; Occupancy 17.5 &#160; 16.5 1.0 &#160; Loan servicing expenses 15.0 &#160; 13.8 1.2 &#160; Business development and marketing 5.5 &#160; 5.2 0.3 &#160; Loan acquisition and origination expenses 4.8 &#160; 4.4 0.4 &#160; Gain on extinguishment of debt &#8212; &#160; (12.7) 12.7 &#160; Other expense 22.1 &#160; 19.7 2.4 &#160; Total non-interest expense $ 481.8 &#160; $ 347.9 $ 133.9 &#160; 

Total non-interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased $133.9 million compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily driven by an increase in deposit and insurance cost s. The increase in deposit costs from the prior year relates primarily to higher average ECR balances and rates, while the increase in insurance costs is due to elevated insured and brokered deposit levels and a $17.6 million charge related to the FDIC special assessment. 

Income Taxes 

The Company's effective tax rate was 23.5% and 23.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in nondeductible insurance premiums and shortfalls from stock compensation expense in 2024. 

Business Segment Results 

The Company's reportable segments are aggregated with a focus on products and services offered and consist of three reportable segments: 

&#8226; Commercial: provides commercial banking and treasury management products and services to small and middle-market businesses, specialized banking services to sophisticated commercial institutions and investors within niche industries, as well as financial services to the real estate industry. 

&#8226; Consumer Related: offers consumer banking services, such as mortgage banking and commercial banking services to enterprises in consumer-related sectors.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS 

Total assets increased $6.1 billion to $77.0 billion at March 31, 2024, compared to $70.9 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase in total assets was driven by an increase in investment securities of $3.4 billion as well an increase in cash of $2.0 billion. Loans HFI increased by $403 million, or 0.8%, to $50.7 billion as of March 31, 2024, compared to $50.3 billion as of December 31, 2023. The increase in loans HFI from December 31, 2023 was driven by a $646 million increase in commercial and industrial loans from December 31, 2023, partially offset by decreases in residential real estate and construction and land development loans of $154 million and $108 million, respectively. Loans HFS increased $439 million from $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2023 due to an increase in non-EBO and agency conforming loans. 

Total liabilities increased $6.0 billion to $70.8 billion at March 31, 2024, compared to $64.8 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase in liabilities is due primarily to an increase in total deposits of $6.9 billion, or 12.5%, to $62.2 billion. By type, the increase in deposits from December 31, 2023 was driven by increases of $3.9 billion in non-interest bearing demand deposits, $1.4 billion in savings and money market accounts, $1.0 billion in interest bearing demand deposits, and $564 million in certificates of deposit. Other borrowings decreased $1.0 billion from December 31, 2023 primarily due to a decrease in short-term borrowings. 

Total stockholders&#8217; equity of $6.2 billion at March 31, 2024 increased by $94 million, or 1.5%, from December 31, 2023. The increase in stockholders' equity is primarily a function of net income, offset by quarterly dividends to common and preferred stockholders, and unrealized fair value losses on AFS securities, recorded net of tax in other comprehensive income. 

Investment securities 

Debt securities are classified at the time of acquisition as either HTM, AFS, or trading based upon various factors, including asset/liability management strategies, liquidity and profitability objectives, and regulatory requirements. HTM securities are carried at amortized cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts. AFS securities are debt securities that may be sold prior to maturity based upon asset/liability management decisions. Investment securities classified as AFS are carried at fair value with unrealized gains or losses on these securities recorded in AOCI in stockholders&#8217; equity, net of tax. 

Amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts on MBS is periodically adjusted for estimated prepayments. Trading securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses on these securities included in current period earnings. 

The Company's investment securities portfolio is utilized as collateral for borrowings, required collateral for public deposits and repurchase agreements, and to manage liquidity, capital, and interest rate risk. 

The following table summarizes the carrying value of the Company's investment securities portfolio: 

March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 Increase (Decrease) (in millions) Debt securities U.S. Treasury securities $ 7,011 &#160; $ 4,853 $ 2,158 &#160; Residential MBS issued by GSEs 4,536 &#160; 1,972 2,564 &#160; Tax-exempt 2,127 &#160; 2,101 26 &#160; Private label residential MBS 1,274 &#160; 1,303 (29) Commercial MBS issued by GSEs 586 &#160; 530 56 &#160; Corporate debt securities 367 &#160; 367 &#8212; &#160; CLO &#8212; &#160; 1,399 (1,399) Other 69 &#160; 69 &#8212; &#160; Total debt securities $ 15,970 &#160; $ 12,594 $ 3,376 &#160; Equity securities Preferred stock $ 105 &#160; $ 100 $ 5 &#160; CRA investments 25 &#160; 26 (1) Total equity securities $ 130 &#160; $ 126 $ 4 &#160; 

Loans HFS 

The Company purchases and originates residential mortgage loans through its AmeriHome mortgage banking business channel that are held for sale or securitization. As of March 31, 2024, loans HFS totaled $1.8 billion, compared to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of $439 million primarily related to an increase in non-EBO and agency-conforming loans. 

Loans HFI 

The table below summarizes the distribution of the Company&#8217;s held for investment loan portfolio: 

March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 Increase (Decrease) (in millions) Warehouse lending $ 6,915 &#160; $ 6,618 $ 297 &#160; Municipal &#38; nonprofit 1,622 &#160; 1,554 68 &#160; Tech &#38; innovation 2,941 &#160; 2,808 133 &#160; Equity fund resources 695 &#160; 845 (150) Other commercial and industrial 7,754 &#160; 7,452 302 &#160; CRE - owner occupied 1,707 &#160; 1,658 49 &#160; Hotel franchise finance 3,556 &#160; 3,855 (299) Other CRE - non-owner occupied 6,365 &#160; 5,974 391 &#160; Residential 13,078 &#160; 13,287 (209) Residential - EBO 1,171 &#160; 1,223 (52) Construction and land development 4,746 &#160; 4,862 (116) Other 150 &#160; 161 (11) Total loans HFI 50,700 &#160; 50,297 403 &#160; Allowance for credit losses (340) (337) (3) Total loans HFI, net of allowance $ 50,360 &#160; $ 49,960 $ 400 &#160; 

Loans classified as HFI are stated at the amount of unpaid principal, adjusted for net deferred fees and costs, premiums and discounts on acquired and purchased loans, and an ACL. Net deferred loan fees of $102 million and $108 million reduced the carrying value of loans as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Net unamortized purchase premiums on acquired and purchased loans of $175 million and $177 million increased the carrying value of loans as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Concentrations of Lending Activities 

The Company monitors concentrations of lending activities at the product and borrower relationship level. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no borrower relationships at both the commitment and funded loan level exceeded 5% of total loans HFI. 

Commercial and industrial loans made up 39% and 38% of total loans HFI as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

In addition, the Company's loan portfolio includes significant credit exposure to the CRE market as CRE related loans accounted for approximately 32% and 33% of total loans at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 respectively. Non-owner occupied CRE loans are CRE loans for which the primary source of repayment is rental income generated from the collateral property. Owner occupied CRE loans are loans secured by owner occupied non-farm nonresidential properties for which the primary source of repayment (more than 50%) is the cash flow from the ongoing operations and activities conducted by the borrower who owns the property. These CRE loans are secured by multi-family residential properties, professional offices, industrial facilities, retail centers, hotels, and other commercial properties. 

The following tables present the composition by property type and weighted average LTV of the Company&#8217;s CRE non-owner occupied loans:

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s CRE non-owner occupied loans by origination year as of March 31, 2024: 

(in millions) 2024 $ 248 2023 915 2022 3,291 2021 1,808 2020 793 Prior 2,582 Total $ 9,637 &#160; 

The following table presents the scheduled maturities of the Company&#8217;s CRE non-owner occupied loans as of March 31, 2024: 

(in millions) 2024 $ 1,616 2025 1,986 2026 2,132 2027 2,013 2028 850 Thereafter 1,040 Total $ 9,637 &#160; 

Approximately $2.5 billion, or 4.9%, of total loans HFI consisted of CRE non-owner occupied office loans as of March 31, 2024, compared to $2.4 billion, or 4.7%, as of December 31, 2023. Of the non-owner occupied office loan balance as of March 31, 2024, $266 million is scheduled to mature in the remainder of 2024. These office loans primarily consist of shorter-term bridge loans that enable borrowers to reposition or redevelop projects with more modern standards attractive to in-office employers in today&#8217;s environment, including enhanced on-site amenities. The vast majority of these projects are located in suburban locations in the Company's core footprint states (Arizona, California, and Nevada), with central business district and midtown exposure totaling approximately 2% and 10% of office loans as of March 31, 2024, respectively. 

The office loan portfolio largely consists of value-add loans that require significant up-front cash equity contributions from institutional sponsors and large regional and national developers. The properties underlying these loans have stable business trends and low vacancy rates. To a large extent, the financing structures of these loans do not carry junior liens or mezzanine debt, which enables maximum flexibility when working with clients and sponsors. In addition to adhering to conservative underwriting standards, asset-specific credit risk is mitigated through continued sponsor support of projects by re-appraisal rights of the Company, re-margining requirements and ongoing debt service, and debt yield covenants. 

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 16% of the Company's CRE loans, excluding construction and land loans, were owner occupied, with substantially all of these loans secured by first liens and had an initial loan-to-value ratio of generally not more than 75%. 

Non-performing Assets 

Total non-performing loans increased $124 million to $534 million at March 31, 2024, from $410 million at December 31, 2023.

The performance of these modified loans is monitored for 12 months following the modification. As of March 31, 2024, modified loans of $129 million were current with contractual payments and $129 million were on nonaccrual status. As of December 31, 2023, modified loans of $95 million were current with contractual payments and $111 million were on nonaccrual status. 

In the normal course of business, the Company also modifies EBO loans, which are delinquent FHA, VA, or USDA insured or guaranteed loans repurchased under the terms of the GNMA MBS program and can be repooled or resold when loans are brought current. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company completed modifications of EBO loans with an amortized cost of $90 million and $57 million, respectively. These modifications were largely payment delays and term extensions. Certain of these loans were repooled or resold after modification and are no longer included in the pool of loan modifications being monitored for future performance. As of March 31, 2024, modified EBO loans consisted of $38 million in loans that were current to 89 days delinquent and $12 million in loans greater than 90 days delinquent. As of December 31, 2023, modified EBO loans consisted of $26 million in loans that were current to 89 days delinquent and $12 million in loans greater than 90 days delinquent. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans HFI 

The ACL consists of an ACL on loans and on unfunded loan commitments. The ACL on AFS and HTM securities is estimated separately from loans and is discussed within the Investment Securities section. 

The following table summarizes the allocation of the ACL on loans HFI by loan portfolio segment: 

March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 Allowance for credit losses Percent of total allowance for credit losses Percent of loan type to total loans HFI Allowance for credit losses Percent of total allowance for credit losses Percent of loan type to total loans HFI (dollars in millions) Warehouse lending $ 7.3 &#160; 2.1 &#160; % 13.6 &#160; % $ 5.8 1.7 % 13.2 % Municipal &#38; nonprofit 13.9 &#160; 4.1 &#160; 3.2 &#160; 14.7 4.4 3.1 Tech &#38; innovation 48.0 &#160; 14.1 &#160; 5.8 &#160; 42.1 12.5 5.6 Equity fund resources 1.2 &#160; 0.4 &#160; 1.4 &#160; 1.3 0.4 1.7 Other commercial and industrial 67.1 &#160; 19.7 &#160; 15.3 &#160; 81.4 24.2 14.8 CRE - owner occupied 6.2 &#160; 1.8 &#160; 3.4 &#160; 6.0 1.8 3.3 Hotel franchise finance 35.8 &#160; 10.5 &#160; 7.0 &#160; 33.4 9.9 7.6 Other CRE - non-owner occupied 104.7 &#160; 30.8 &#160; 12.5 &#160; 96.0 28.5 11.9 Residential 22.1 &#160; 6.5 &#160; 25.8 &#160; 23.1 6.9 26.4 Residential - EBO &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2.3 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; 2.4 Construction and land development 31.9 &#160; 9.4 &#160; 9.4 &#160; 30.4 9.0 9.6 Other 2.1 &#160; 0.6 &#160; 0.3 &#160; 2.5 0.7 0.4 Total $ 340.3 &#160; 100.0 &#160; % 100.0 &#160; % $ 336.7 100.0 % 100.0 % 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, net loan charge-offs to average loans outstanding were 0.08% and 0.05%, respectively. 

In addition to the ACL on funded loans HFI, the Company maintains a separate ACL related to off-balance sheet credit exposures, including unfunded loan commitments. This allowance balance totaled $33 million and $32 million at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

Problem Loans 

The Company classifies loans consistent with federal banking regulations using a nine category grading system. The following table presents information regarding potential and actual problem loans, consisting of loans graded as Special Mention, Substandard, Doubtful, and Loss, but which are still performing: 

March 31, 2024 Number of Loans Problem Loan Balance Percent of Problem Loan Balance Percent of Total Loans HFI (dollars in millions) Warehouse lending 1 &#160; $ 23 &#160; 4.8 &#160; % 0.04 &#160; % Municipal &#38; nonprofit 2 &#160; 18 &#160; 3.7 &#160; 0.04 &#160; Tech &#38; innovation 18 &#160; 58 &#160; 12.0 &#160; 0.11 &#160; Other commercial and industrial 49 &#160; 4 &#160; 0.8 &#160; 0.01 &#160; CRE - owner occupied 10 &#160; 5 &#160; 1.0 &#160; 0.01 &#160; Hotel franchise finance 7 &#160; 100 &#160; 20.7 &#160; 0.20 &#160; Other CRE - non-owner occupied 9 &#160; 184 &#160; 38.1 &#160; 0.36 &#160; Residential 141 &#160; 81 &#160; 16.8 &#160; 0.16 &#160; Construction and land development 2 &#160; 6 &#160; 1.3 &#160; 0.01 &#160; Other 24 &#160; 4 &#160; 0.8 &#160; 0.01 &#160; Total 263 &#160; $ 483 &#160; 100.0 &#160; % 0.95 &#160; %

Mortgage Servicing Rights 

The fair value of the Company's MSRs related to residential mortgage loans totaled $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase in MSRs is primarily related to new production of MSRs and valuation gains, partially offset by sales. 

The following is a summary of the UPB of loans underlying the Company's MSR portfolio by type: 

March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 (in millions) FNMA and FHLMC $ 41,157 &#160; $ 46,840 GNMA 22,352 &#160; 19,848 Non-agency 2,111 &#160; 1,959 Total unpaid principal balance of loans $ 65,620 &#160; $ 68,647 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

Goodwill represents the excess consideration paid for net assets acquired in a business combination over their fair value. Goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are determined to have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortization, but are subsequently evaluated for impairment at least annually. The Company has goodwill and intangible assets totaling $666 million and $669 million at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

The Company performs its annual goodwill and intangible assets impairment tests as of October 1 each year, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 there were no events or circumstances that indicated an interim impairment test of goodwill or other intangible assets was necessary. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company evaluated whether the effects from the bank failures in 2023 gave rise to a triggering event and elected to perform a Step 0 goodwill impairment assessment, which included assessing the financial performance of the Company and analyzing qualitative factors applicable to the Company. Based on this assessment, the Company determined that it was more likely than not the fair value of the Company and its reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values as of March 31, 2023. 

Deferred Tax Assets 

As of March 31, 2024, the net DTA balance totaled $300 million, an increase of $13 million from $287 million at December 31, 2023. This overall increase in the net DTA was primarily the result of a decrease in the fair market value of AFS securities. 

Deposits 

Deposits are the primary source for funding the Company's asset growth. Total deposit s increased to $62.2 billion at March 31, 2024, from $55.3 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of $6.9 billion, or 12.5%. By deposit type, the increase in deposits is attributable to increases of $3.9 billion in non-interest bearing demand deposits, $1.4 billion in savings and money market accounts, $1.0 billion in interest bearing demand deposits, and $564 million in certificates of deposit. 

WAB is a participant in the IntraFi Network, a network that offers deposit placement services such as CDARS and ICS, which offer products that qualify large deposits for FDIC insurance. At March 31, 2024, the Company had $14.5 billion of these reciprocal deposits, compared to $13.3 billion at December 31, 2023. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company also had wholesale brokered deposits of $6.5 billion and $6.6 billion, respectively. 

In addition, deposits for which the Company provides account holders with earnings credits or referral fees totaled $22.2 billion and $17.8 billion at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company incurred $131.2 million and $85.6 million in deposit related costs on these deposits during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These costs are reported as Deposit costs in non-interest expense. Th e increase in these costs from the prior year is due to an increase in earnings credit rates as well as an increase in average deposit balances eligible for earnings credits or referral fees. 

The average balances and weighted average rates paid on deposits are presented below: 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 2023 Average Balance Rate Average Balance Rate (dollars in millions) Interest-bearing transaction accounts $ 16,348 &#160; 3.00 &#160; % $ 10,534 2.63 % Savings and money market accounts 15,247 &#160; 3.43 &#160; 18,066 2.59 Certificates of deposit 10,129 &#160; 5.11 &#160; 5,520 3.52 Total interest-bearing deposits 41,724 &#160; 3.67 &#160; 34,120 2.75 Non-interest-bearing demand deposits 18,183 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 20,521 &#8212; Total deposits $ 59,907 &#160; 2.56 &#160; % $ 54,641 1.72 % 

Other Borrowings 

Short-Term Borrowings 

The Company utilizes short-term borrowed funds to support short-term liquidity needs. The majority of these short-term borrowed funds consist of advances from the FHLB, repurchase agreements, and federal funds purchased from correspondent banks or the FHLB. The Company&#8217;s borrowing capacity with the FHLB is determined based on collateral pledged, generally consisting of securities and loans. In addition, the Company has repurchase facilities, collateralized by securities and EBO loans, including assets sold under agreements to repurchase, which are reflected at the amount of cash received in connection with the transaction, and may require additional collateral based on the fair value of the underlying assets. Total short-term borrowings decreased $1.0 billion to $5.8 billion at March 31, 2024 from $6.8 billion at December 31, 2023. The decrease was driven by decreases in FHLB advances of $450 million, repurchase agreements of $374 million, and federal funds purchased of $175 million. 

Long-Term Borrowings 

The Company's long-term borrowings consist of credit linked notes, inclusive of issuance costs. At March 31, 2024, the carrying value of long-term borrowings was $441 million, compared to $446 million at December 31, 2023. 

Qualifying Debt 

Qualifying debt consists of subordinated debt and junior subordinated debt, inclusive of issuance costs and fair market value adjustments. At March 31, 2024, the carrying value of qualifying debt was $896 million, compared to $895 million at December 31, 2023. 

Capital Resources 

The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could trigger certain mandatory or discretionary actions that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company&#8217;s business and financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items (discussed in "Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies" to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements) as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. 

As permitted by the regulatory capital rules, the Company elected the CECL transition option that delayed the estimated impact on regulatory capital resulting from the adoption of CECL over a five-year transition period ending December 31, 2024. Accordingly, beginning in 2024, capital ratios and amounts include a 25% capital benefit that resulted from the increased ACL related to the adoption of ASC 326. 

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company and the Bank exceeded the capital levels necessary to be classified as well-capitalized, as defined by the various banking agencies. The actual capital amounts and ratios for the Company and the Bank are presented in the following tables: 

Total Capital Tier 1 Capital Risk-Weighted Assets Tangible Average Assets Total Capital Ratio Tier 1 Capital Ratio Tier 1 Leverage Ratio Common Equity Tier 1 (dollars in millions) March 31, 2024 WAL $ 7,349 &#160; $ 6,163 &#160; $ 52,545 &#160; $ 72,766 &#160; 14.0 &#160; % 11.7 &#160; % 8.5 &#160; % 11.0 &#160; % WAB 6,915 &#160; 6,323 &#160; 52,524 &#160; 72,748 &#160; 13.2 &#160; 12.0 &#160; 8.7 &#160; 12.0 &#160; Well-capitalized ratios 10.0 &#160; 8.0 &#160; 5.0 &#160; 6.5 &#160; Minimum capital ratios 8.0 &#160; 6.0 &#160; 4.0 &#160; 4.5 &#160; December 31, 2023 WAL $ 7,201 $ 6,035 $ 52,517 $ 70,295 13.7 % 11.5 % 8.6 % 10.8 % WAB 6,802 6,229 52,508 70,347 13.0 11.9 8.9 11.9 Well-capitalized ratios 10.0 8.0 5.0 6.5 Minimum capital ratios 8.0 6.0 4.0 4.5 

The Company and the Bank are also subject to liquidity and other regulatory requirements as administered by the federal banking agencies. These agencies have broad powers and at their discretion, could limit or prohibit the Company's payment of dividends, payment of certain debt service and issuance of capital stock and debt as they deem appropriate and as such, actions by the agencies could have a direct material effect on the Company&#8217;s business and financial statements. 

The Company is also required to maintain specified levels of capital to remain in good standing with certain federal government agencies, including FNMA, FHLMC, GNMA, and HUD. These capital requirements are generally tied to the unpaid balances of loans included in the Company's servicing portfolio or loan production volume. Noncompliance with these capital requirements can result in various remedial actions up to, and including, removing the Company's ability to sell loans to and service loans on behalf of the respective agency. The Company believes that it is in compliance with these requirements as of March 31, 2024. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The critical accounting estimates upon which the Company's financial condition and results of operations depend, and which involve the most complex subjective decisions or assessments, are included in the discussion entitled "Critical Accounting Policies" in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and all amendments thereto, as filed with the SEC. There were no material changes to the critical accounting policies disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Liquidity 

Liquidity is the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, fund asset growth and business operations, and meet contractual obligations through unconstrained access to funding at reasonable market rates. Liquidity management involves forecasting funding requirements and maintaining sufficient capacity to meet the needs and accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to changes in the Company's business operations or unanticipated events. 

The ability to have readily available funds sufficient to repay fully maturing liabilities is of primary importance to depositors, creditors, and regulators. The Company's liquidity, represented by cash and amounts due from banks, federal funds sold, loans HFS, and non-pledged marketable securities, is a result of the Company's operating, investing, and financing activities and related cash flows. The Company actively monitors and manages liquidity, and no less than quarterly will estimate probable liquidity needs on a 12-month horizon. Liquidity needs can also be met through short-term borrowings or the disposition of short-term assets. 

The following table presents the available and outstanding balances on the Company's lines of credit: 

March 31, 2024 Available Balance Outstanding Balance (in millions) Unsecured fed funds credit lines at correspondent banks $ 839 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; 

In addition to lines of credit, the Company has borrowing capacity with the FHLB and FRB from pledged loans and securities and warehouse borrowing lines of credit. The borrowing capacity, outstanding borrowings, and available credit are presented in the following table: 

March 31, 2024 (in millions) FHLB: Borrowing capacity $ 13,823 &#160; Outstanding borrowings 5,750 &#160; Letters of credit 101 &#160; Total available credit $ 7,972 &#160; FRB: Borrowing capacity $ 10,947 &#160; Outstanding borrowings &#8212; &#160; Total available credit $ 10,947 &#160; Warehouse borrowings: Borrowing capacity $ 2,250 &#160; Outstanding borrowings &#8212; &#160; Total available credit $ 2,250 &#160; 

The Company has a formal liquidity policy and, in the opinion of management, its liquid assets are considered adequate to meet financial obligations and support client activity during normal and stressed operating conditions. At March 31, 2024, there were $12.0 billion in liquid assets, comprised of $2.8 billion in cash on deposit at the FRB and $9.2 billion in securities not currently used as collateral for borrowings or other purposes. At December 31, 2023, the Company maintained $6.9 billion in liquid assets, comprised of $785 million in cash on deposit at the FRB and $6.1 billion in liquid securities not currently used as collateral for borrowings or other purposes. 

The Parent maintains liquidity that would be sufficient to fund its operations and certain non-bank affiliate operations for an extended period should funding from normal sources be disrupted. In the Company's analysis of Parent liquidity, it is assumed the Parent is unable to generate funds from additional debt or equity issuances, receives no dividend income from subsidiaries and does not pay dividends to stockholders, while continuing to make non-discretionary payments needed to maintain operations and repayment of contractual principal and interest payments owed by the Parent and affiliated companies. Under this scenario, the amount of time the Parent and its non-bank subsidiary can operate and meet all obligations before the current liquid assets are exhausted is considered as part of the Parent liquidity analysis. Management believes the Parent maintains adequate liquidity capacity to operate without additional funding from new sources for over twelve months. 

WAB maintains sufficient funding capacity to address large increases in funding requirements, such as deposit outflows. This capacity is comprised of liquidity derived from a reduction in asset levels and various secured funding sources. On a long-term basis, the Company&#8217;s liquidity will be met by changing the relative distribution of its asset portfolios (for example, by reducing investment or loan volumes, or selling or encumbering assets). Further, the Company can increase liquidity by soliciting higher levels of deposit accounts through promotional activities and/or borrowing from correspondent banks, the FHLB of San Francisco, and the FRB. At March 31, 2024, the Company's long-term liquidity needs primarily relate to funds required to support loan originations, commitments, and deposit withdrawals, which can be met by cash flows from investment payments and maturities, and investment sales, if necessary. 

The Company&#8217;s liquidity is comprised of three primary classifications: 1) cash flows provided by operating activities; 2) cash flows used in investing activities; and 3) cash flows provided by financing activities. Net cash provided by or used in operating activities consists primarily of net income, adjusted for changes in certain other asset and liability accounts and certain non-cash income and expense items, such as the provision for credit losses, investment and other amortization and depreciation. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, net cash (used in) provided by operating activities was $(306.5) million and $357.3 million, respectively. 

The Company's primary investing activities are the origination of real estate and commercial loans, the collection of repayments of these loans, and the purchase and sale of securities. The Company's net cash used in investing activities has been primarily influenced by its loan and securities activities. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company's cash balance decreased by $526 million as a result of a net increase in loans, compared to a reduction in cash of $1.0 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2023 from a net increase in loans. A net increase in investment securities of $3.3 billion and $478 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, partially offset the increase to the Company's cash balance during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023. 

Net cash provided by financing activities has been impacted significantly by deposit levels. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, net deposits increased $6.9 billion, compared to a decrease in net deposits of $6.1 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2023. 

Fluctuations in core deposit levels may increase the Company's need for liquidity as certificates of deposit mature or are withdrawn before maturity, and as non-maturity deposits, such as checking and savings account balances, are withdrawn. Additionally, the Company is exposed to the risk that customers with large deposit balances will withdraw all or a portion of such deposits, due in part to the FDIC limitations on the amount of insurance coverage provided to depositors. To mitigate the uninsured deposit risk, the Company participates in the CDARS and ICS programs, which allow an individual customer to invest up to $50 million and $225 million, respectively, through one participating financial institution or, a combined total of $275 million per individual customer, with the entire amount being covered by FDIC insurance. As of March 31, 2024, the Company has $1.6 billion of CDARS and $11.2 billion of ICS deposits. 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company has $6.5 billion of wholesale brokered deposits outstanding, Brokered deposits are generally considered to be deposits that have been received from a third party who is engaged in the business of placing deposits on behalf of others. A traditional deposit broker will direct deposits to the banking institution offering the highest interest rate available. Federal banking laws and regulations place restrictions on depository institutions regarding brokered deposits because of the general concern that these deposits are not relationship based and are at a greater risk of being withdrawn and placed on deposit at another institution offering a higher interest rate, thus posing liquidity risk for institutions that gather brokered deposits in significant amounts. 

Federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid. The total amount of dividends which may be paid at any date is generally limited to the retained earnings of the bank.

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, WAB paid dividends to the Parent of $60 million. Subsequent to March 31, 2024, WAB paid dividends to the Parent of $60 million.
