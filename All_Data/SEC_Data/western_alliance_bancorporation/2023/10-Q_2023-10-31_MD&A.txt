Recent Banking Industry and Market Developments 

The bank failures that occurred in early 2023 caused significant disruption in the United States banking industry, particularly among mid-sized banks, such as the Company. The closures of these banks triggered a surge in deposit outflows and stock price volatility at many mid-sized banks. 

In response to these bank failures, the FRB announced the BTFP, which offers loans of up to one year in length to banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other eligible depository institutions pledging U.S. Treasuries, agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, and other qualifying assets as collateral valued at par. Under this program, the Bank has access to $1.3 billion in borrowing capacity. During the first quarter of 2023, the Company drew $1.3 billion from the BTFP, all of which was outstanding at September 30, 2023. 

Additionally, the Department of the Treasury, FRB, and FDIC issued a joint statement, which stated that losses to support uninsured deposits of those failed banks would be recovered via a special assessment on banks. The FDIC has proposed an annual special assessment rate of approximately 12.5 basis points. The assessment base for the special assessments would be equal to an institution&#8217;s estimated uninsured deposits as of December 31, 2022, adjusted to exclude the first $5 billion from estimated uninsured deposits. The special assessments would be collected over an eight-quarter collection period, at a quarterly special assessment rate of 3.13 basis points, with the first quarterly assessment period beginning on January 1, 2024. The comment period for the proposal ended on July 21, 2023, with a final rule expected later this year. If adopted as proposed, the Company expects to recognize a one-time charge of $62 million. 

The recent volatility in the banking industry and other recent regulatory actions have had and may continue to have a material impact on the Company's operations, as further discussed below. 

Capital and liquidity 

While the Company believes it has sufficient capital, funding, and access to contingent sources of liquidity, the Company has taken several actions to ensure the strength of its capital and liquidity position. These actions included disposition of selected assets, including $821 million of AFS securities and $4.3 billion of loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and increasing its borrowing capacity with the FRB. 

The Company's deposit balances stabilized as of March 20, 2023 and from such date through September 30, 2023 deposits increased, and were up $643 million from December 31, 2022. The Company also strengthened its insured deposit ratio from 45% as of December 31, 2022 to 77% as of September 30, 2023. Insured and collateralized deposits as a percentage of total deposits was 82% at September 30, 2023 and 47% at December 31, 2022. 

Financial position and results of operations 

The Company's financial position and results of operations as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 have been impacted by this disruption. Recent events in the banking industry contributed to the $53.3 million provision for credit losses recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, of which $17.1 million related to a charge-off of a corporate debt security from a financial institution issuer. The Company's actions to strengthen its capital and liquidity position contributed to a $117.3 million pre-tax fair value loss adjustment primarily related to the transfer of loans to HFS, a loss of $26.0 million on sales of investment securities, and a $13.4 million gain on extinguishment of debt. The continued uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the volatility in the banking industry and related economic effects may continue to affect the Company&#8217;s estimate of its allowance for credit losses and resulting provision for credit losses. To the extent the impact of the recent banking industry volatility is prolonged and economic conditions worsen or persist longer than forecast, such estimates may be insufficient and may change significantly in the future. The Company&#8217;s net interest margin also may be negatively impacted in future periods if the Company's borrowings remain elevated. These uncertainties and the economic environment will continue to affect earnings, growth, and may result in deterioration of asset quality in the Company's loan and investment portfolios. 

Depositors in the technology industry were generally considered to be the most impacted by these adverse events and may have greater sensitivity to the recent volatility in the banking industry with potentially longer recovery periods than other types of businesses. The Company's deposit exposure to the technology industry totaled $4.1 billion, or 7.6% of total deposits, as of September 30, 2023. 

Asset valuation 

Sustained declines in the Company's stock price and/or other liquidity related impacts, such as increases in deposit outflows, could give rise to triggering events in the future that could result in a write-down in the value of our goodwill, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

For all banks and bank holding companies, asset quality plays a significant role in the overall financial condition of the institution and results of operations. The Company measures asset quality in terms of nonaccrual loans as a percentage of gross loans and net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans. Net charge-offs are calculated as the difference between charged-off loans and recovery payments received on previously charged-off loans. The following table summarizes the Company's key asset quality metrics for loans HFI: 

September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 (dollars in millions) Nonaccrual loans $ 237 &#160; $ 85 Repossessed assets 8 &#160; 11 Non-performing assets 352 &#160; 98 Nonaccrual loans to funded loans 0.48 &#160; % 0.16 % Nonaccrual and repossessed assets to total assets 0.35 &#160; 0.14 Allowance for loan losses to funded loans 0.66 &#160; 0.60 Allowance for credit losses to funded loans 0.74 &#160; 0.69 Net charge-offs to average loans outstanding (1) 0.07 &#160; 0.00 

(1) Annualized on an actual/actual basis for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Actual year-to-date for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Asset and Deposit Growth 

The Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities are comprised primarily of loans and deposits. Therefore, the ability to originate new loans and attract new deposits is fundamental to the Company&#8217;s growth. 

Total assets increased to $70.9 billion at September 30, 2023 from $67.7 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase in total assets of $3.2 billion, or 4.7%, was driven by an increase in borrowings, which contributed to an increase in investment securities of $2.7 billion and an increase in cash of $2.5 billion. Loans HFI decreased by $2.4 billion, or 4.7%, to $49.4 billion as of September 30, 2023, compared to $51.9 billion as of December 31, 2022. The decrease in loans HFI from December 31, 2022 was driven by the transfer of $6.0 billion of loans HFI to HFS during the first quarter 2023. The Company completed loan dispositions from this transferred loan pool totaling $4.3 billion through September 30, 2023 and transferred all remaining HFS loans back to HFI at the end of the period as a result of a change in management's intentions. By loan type, commercial and industrial loans and residential real estate loans decreased $2.4 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, from December 31, 2022, partially offset by increases in construction and land development loans and CRE, non-owner occupied loans of $656 million and $491 million, respectively. Loans HFS were up $582 million from $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2022 due to an increase in non-EBO loans. 

Total deposits increased $643 million, or 1.2%, to $54.3 billion as of September 30, 2023 from $53.6 billion as of December 31, 2022. By type, the increase in deposits from December 31, 2022 was driven by an increase of $3.7 billion in certificates of deposit and $3.3 billion in interest bearing demand deposits, partially offset by decreases of $4.7 billion in savings and money market accounts and $1.7 billion in non-interest bearing demand deposits. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following table sets forth a summary financial overview: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Increase Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase 2023 2022 (Decrease) 2023 2022 (Decrease) (in millions, except per share amounts) Consolidated Income Statement Data: Interest income $ 1,026.6 &#160; $ 739.4 $ 287.2 &#160; $ 2,996.3 &#160; $ 1,803.5 $ 1,192.8 &#160; Interest expense 439.6 &#160; 137.3 302.3 &#160; 1,249.1 &#160; 226.9 1,022.2 &#160; Net interest income 587.0 &#160; 602.1 (15.1) 1,747.2 &#160; 1,576.6 170.6 &#160; Provision for credit losses 12.1 &#160; 28.5 (16.4) 53.3 &#160; 65.0 (11.7) Net interest income after provision for credit losses 574.9 &#160; 573.6 1.3 &#160; 1,693.9 &#160; 1,511.6 182.3 &#160; Non-interest income 129.2 &#160; 61.8 67.4 &#160; 190.2 &#160; 263.1 (72.9) Non-interest expense 426.2 &#160; 305.8 120.4 &#160; 1,161.5 &#160; 823.3 338.2 &#160; Income before provision for income taxes 277.9 &#160; 329.6 (51.7) 722.6 &#160; 951.4 (228.8) Income tax expense 61.3 &#160; 65.6 (4.3) 148.1 &#160; 187.1 (39.0) Net income 216.6 &#160; 264.0 (47.4) 574.5 &#160; 764.3 (189.8) Dividends on preferred stock 3.2 &#160; 3.2 &#8212; &#160; 9.6 &#160; 9.6 &#8212; &#160; Net income available to common stockholders $ 213.4 &#160; $ 260.8 $ (47.4) $ 564.9 &#160; $ 754.7 $ (189.8) Earnings per share: Basic $ 1.97 &#160; $ 2.43 $ (0.46) $ 5.22 &#160; $ 7.06 $ (1.84) Diluted 1.97 &#160; 2.42 (0.45) 5.21 &#160; 7.03 (1.82) 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

The following discussion and analysis contains financial information determined by methods other than those prescribed by GAAP. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in their analysis of the Company's performance. Management believes presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a complete understanding of the operating results of the Company. Since the presentation of these non-GAAP performance measures and their impact differ between companies, these non-GAAP disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. 

Pre-Provision Net Revenue 

Banking regulations define PPNR as the sum of net interest income and non-interest income less expenses before adjusting for loss provisions. Management believes that this is an important metric as it illustrates the underlying performance of the Company, it enables investors and others to assess the Company's ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through the credit cycle, and provides consistent reporting with a key metric used by bank regulatory agencies. 

The following table shows the components used in the calculation of PPNR: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 (in millions) Net interest income $ 587.0 &#160; $ 602.1 $ 1,747.2 &#160; $ 1,576.6 Total non-interest income 129.2 &#160; 61.8 190.2 &#160; 263.1 Net revenue $ 716.2 &#160; $ 663.9 $ 1,937.4 &#160; $ 1,839.7 Total non-interest expense 426.2 &#160; 305.8 1,161.5 &#160; 823.3 Pre-provision net revenue $ 290.0 &#160; $ 358.1 $ 775.9 &#160; $ 1,016.4 Less: Provision for credit losses 12.1 &#160; 28.5 53.3 &#160; 65.0 Income tax expense 61.3 &#160; 65.6 148.1 &#160; 187.1 Net income $ 216.6 &#160; $ 264.0 $ 574.5 &#160; $ 764.3 

Efficiency Ratio 

The following table shows the components used in the calculation of the efficiency ratio, which management uses as a metric for assessing cost efficiency: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 (dollars in millions) Total non-interest expense $ 426.2 &#160; $ 305.8 $ 1,161.5 &#160; $ 823.3 Divided by: Total net interest income 587.0 &#160; 602.1 1,747.2 &#160; 1,576.6 Plus: Tax equivalent interest adjustment 8.9 &#160; 8.5 26.4 &#160; 24.7 Total non-interest income 129.2 &#160; 61.8 190.2 &#160; 263.1 $ 725.1 &#160; $ 672.4 $ 1,963.8 &#160; $ 1,864.4 Efficiency ratio - tax equivalent basis 58.8 &#160; % 45.5 % 59.1 &#160; % 44.2 % 

Earnings Per Share, Adjusted 

The Company's earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2023 were impacted by significant non-operating losses that were incurred as a result of actions undertaken by the Company to reposition its balance sheet to ensure the strength of its capital and liquidity position in response to the bank failures in early 2023. The following table shows the components used in the calculation of earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, adjusted to exclude non-operating items, which management believes is more comparable to historical earnings trends: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 (in millions) Net income $ 574.5 &#160; Adjusted for: Loss on sales of investment securities 26.0 &#160; Fair value loss adjustments, net 117.3 &#160; Gain on extinguishment of debt (13.4) Tax effect of adjustments (34.0) Net income, adjusted $ 670.4 &#160; Dividends on preferred stock 9.6 &#160; Net income available to common stockholders, adjusted $ 660.8 &#160; Weighted average number of common shares outstanding: Basic $ 108.3 &#160; Diluted 108.4 &#160; Earnings per share, adjusted: Basic, adjusted $ 6.10 &#160; Diluted, adjusted 6.10 &#160; 

Tangible Common Equity and Return on Average Tangible Common Equity 

The following tables present financial measures related to tangible common equity. Tangible common equity represents total stockholders' equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets and preferred stock. Management believes that tangible common equity financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company's capital strength, financial condition, and ability to manage potential losses. 

September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 (dollars and shares in millions) Total stockholders' equity $ 5,746 &#160; $ 5,356 $ 5,021 Less: Goodwill and intangible assets 672 &#160; 680 682 Preferred stock 295 &#160; 295 295 Total tangible common stockholders' equity 4,779 &#160; 4,381 4,044 Plus: deferred tax - attributed to intangible assets 2 &#160; 2 3 Total tangible common equity, net of tax $ 4,781 &#160; $ 4,383 $ 4,047 Total assets $ 70,891 &#160; $ 67,734 $ 69,165 Less: goodwill and intangible assets, net 672 &#160; 680 682 Tangible assets 70,219 &#160; 67,054 68,483 Plus: deferred tax - attributed to intangible assets 2 &#160; 2 3 Total tangible assets, net of tax $ 70,221 &#160; $ 67,056 $ 68,486 Tangible common equity ratio 6.8 &#160; % 6.5 % 5.9 % Common shares outstanding 109.5 &#160; 108.9 108.9 Book value per common share $ 49.78 &#160; $ 46.47 $ 43.39 Tangible book value per common share, net of tax 43.66 &#160; 40.25 37.16 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 (dollars in millions) Net income available to common stockholders $ 213.4 &#160; $ 260.8 $ 564.9 &#160; $ 754.7 Divided by: Average stockholders' equity 5,854 &#160; 5,150 5,699 &#160; 5,054 Less: Average goodwill and intangible assets 673 &#160; 694 676 &#160; 690 Average preferred stock 295 &#160; 295 295 &#160; 295 Average tangible common equity 4,886 &#160; 4,161 4,728 &#160; 4,069 Return on average tangible common equity (1) 17.3 &#160; % 24.9 % 16.0 &#160; % 24.8 % 

(1) Using adjusted net income available to common stockholders of $660.8 million, return on average tangible common equity was 18.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Regulatory Capital 

The following table presents certain financial measures related to regulatory capital under Basel III, which includes CET1 and total capital. The FRB and other banking regulators use CET1 and total capital as a basis for assessing a bank's capital adequacy; therefore, management believes it is useful to assess financial condition and capital adequacy using this same basis. Specifically, the total capital ratio takes into consideration the risk levels of assets and off-balance sheet financial instruments. In addition, management believes that the classified assets to CET1 plus allowance measure is an important regulatory metric for assessing asset quality. 

As permitted by the regulatory capital rules, the Company elected to delay the estimated impact of CECL on its regulatory capital over a five-year transition period ending December 31, 2024. Accordingly, capital ratios and amounts for 2022 include a 25% reduction to the capital benefit that resulted from the increased ACL related to the adoption of ASC 326, which has increased to include a 50% reduction beginning in 2023.

Net Interest Margin 

The net interest margin is reported on a TEB. A tax equivalent adjustment is added to reflect interest earned on certain securities and loans that are exempt from federal and state income tax. The following tables set forth the average balances, interest income, interest expense, and average yield (on a fully TEB) for the periods indicated:

Comparison of interest income, interest expense and net interest margin 

The Company's primary source of revenue is interest income. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, interest income was $1.0 billion, an increase of $287.2 million, or 38.8%, compared to $739.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022. This increase was primarily the result of a $205.5 million increase in interest income from loans HFI that was driven primarily by higher yields and a $46.9 million increase in interest income from investment securities due to higher investment yields and an increase in the average investment balance of $1.6 billion. Interest income from cash and other also increased $36.5 million due to an increase in cash balances resulting from higher short-term borrowings and the higher rate environment. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, interest income was $3.0 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion, or 66.1%, compared to $1.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. This increase was primarily the result of higher rates on HFI loans coupled with a $3.8 billion increase in the average balance, which drove a $901.1 million increase in HFI loan interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. An increase in investment yields and in the average investment balance of $1.3 billion resulted in an increase in interest income of $148.1 million, and an increase in cash balances and rates on those balances drove a $102.3 million increase in interest income. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2023, interest expense was $439.6 million, an increase of $302.3 million, compared to $137.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in interest expense was due to an increase in interest expense on deposits of $238.6 million driven by increased interest rates and a $6.1 billion increase in the average interest-bearing deposit balance combined with a $63.1 million increase in interest expense on other borrowings resulting from an increase in average borrowings of $1.7 billion and an increase in borrowing rates. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, interest expense was $1.2 billion, an increase of $1.0 billion, compared to $226.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Interest expense on deposits increased $680.1 million driven by 

an increase in deposit rates and an increase in the average interest-bearing deposit balance of $5.3 billion coupled with an increase in the average balance of other borrowings of $5.9 billion, which drove a $339.7 million increase in interest expense. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2023, net interest income was $587.0 million, a decrease of $15.1 million, or 2.5%, compared to $602.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The decrease in net interest income was driven by the higher rate environment and reflects a $7.7 billion increase in average interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by an increase in yields on interest-earning assets. The decrease in net interest margin of 11 basis points to 3.67% is largely the result of an increase in both the rates and balances of deposits and borrowings, partially offset by higher yields on HFI loans compared to the same period in 2022. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net interest income was $1.7 billion, an increase of $170.6 million, or 10.8%, compared to $1.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in net interest income was driven by the higher rate environment and reflects a $5.3 billion increase in average interest-earning assets, partially offset by an increase of $11.2 billion in average interest-bearing liabilities. The increase in net interest margin of 6 basis points to 3.62% is the result of an increase in loan yields and balances, partially offset by an increase in the balance of deposits and other borrowings and higher rates compared to the same period in 2022. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses in each period is reflected as a reduction in earnings for that period and includes amounts related to funded loans, unfunded loan commitments, and investment securities. The provision is equal to the amount required to maintain the ACL at a level that is adequate to absorb estimated lifetime credit losses inherent in the loan and investment securities portfolios based on remaining contractual maturity, adjusted for estimated prepayments as of each period end. The Company's CECL models incorporate historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts in measuring expected credit losses. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $12.1 million and $53.3 million, respectively, compared to $28.5 million and $65.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. The decrease in the provision for credit losses from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 is primarily related to a significant decline in loan growth, offset by heightened economic uncertainty, particularly in the commercial real estate market. 

Non-interest Income 

The following table presents a summary of non-interest income: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 Increase (Decrease) 2023 2022 Increase (Decrease) (in millions) Net gain on loan origination and sale activities $ 52.0 &#160; $ 14.5 $ 37.5 &#160; $ 145.7 &#160; $ 78.6 $ 67.1 &#160; Net loan servicing revenue 27.2 &#160; 23.0 4.2 &#160; 93.2 &#160; 109.5 (16.3) Service charges and fees 23.3 &#160; 6.5 16.8 &#160; 53.6 &#160; 21.1 32.5 &#160; Commercial banking related income 5.6 &#160; 5.1 0.5 &#160; 17.8 &#160; 16.0 1.8 &#160; Income from equity investments 0.5 &#160; 4.3 (3.8) 2.6 &#160; 13.6 (11.0) (Loss) gain on recovery from credit guarantees (4.0) 0.4 (4.4) 0.5 &#160; 11.7 (11.2) Gain (loss) on sales of investment securities 0.1 &#160; &#8212; 0.1 &#160; (26.0) 6.7 (32.7) Fair value gain (loss) adjustments, net 17.8 &#160; (2.8) 20.6 &#160; (117.3) (19.4) (97.9) Other income 6.7 &#160; 10.8 (4.1) 20.1 &#160; 25.3 (5.2) Total non-interest income $ 129.2 &#160; $ 61.8 $ 67.4 &#160; $ 190.2 &#160; $ 263.1 $ (72.9) 

Total non-interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 increased $67.4 million. The increase in non-interest income from the three months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily driven by a net increase in mortgage banking income as net gain on loan origination and sale activities increased $37.5 million from higher production volume and spreads, a net fair value gain adjustment of $17.8 million related to HFS loans, compared to a net fair value loss adjustment of $2.8 million on equity securities in the prior year, and an increase of $16.8 million in service charges and fees. 

Total non-interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 decreased $72.9 million. The decrease in non-interest income was primarily driven by non-operating charges incurred during the first quarter 2023 following the execution of the Company's balance sheet repositioning strategy, which included sales of selected loans and investment securities and the transfer of $6.0 billion of loans HFI to HFS. Consequently, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized net fair value loss adjustments totaling $117.3 million primarily related to the transfer of loans to HFS and a net loss of $26.0 million on sales of investment securities. These decreases were offset in part by a net increase in mortgage banking income of $50.8 million from higher production volume and spreads.

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 Increase (Decrease) 2023 2022 Increase (Decrease) (in millions) Salaries and employee benefits $ 137.2 &#160; $ 136.5 $ 0.7 &#160; $ 431.7 &#160; $ 413.8 $ 17.9 &#160; Deposit costs 127.8 &#160; 56.2 71.6 &#160; 305.7 &#160; 83.6 222.1 &#160; Data processing 33.9 &#160; 21.8 12.1 &#160; 88.9 &#160; 59.1 29.8 &#160; Insurance 33.1 &#160; 8.1 25.0 &#160; 81.8 &#160; 22.2 59.6 &#160; Legal, professional, and directors' fees 28.3 &#160; 24.8 3.5 &#160; 77.8 &#160; 73.9 3.9 &#160; Occupancy 16.8 &#160; 13.9 2.9 &#160; 48.7 &#160; 39.7 9.0 &#160; Loan servicing expenses 11.9 &#160; 15.2 (3.3) 44.1 &#160; 40.7 3.4 &#160; Loan acquisition and origination expenses 5.6 &#160; 5.8 (0.2) 15.6 &#160; 18.7 (3.1) Business development and marketing 4.9 &#160; 5.0 (0.1) 15.1 &#160; 14.8 0.3 &#160; Gain on extinguishment of debt &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#160; (13.4) &#8212; (13.4) Other expense 26.7 &#160; 18.5 8.2 &#160; 65.5 &#160; 56.8 8.7 &#160; Total non-interest expense $ 426.2 &#160; $ 305.8 $ 120.4 &#160; $ 1,161.5 &#160; $ 823.3 $ 338.2 &#160; 

Total non-interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023 increased $120.4 million compared to the same period in 2022. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily driven by an increase in deposit and insurance costs. The increase in deposit costs from the prior year relates primarily to higher average ECR rates, while the increase in insurance costs is due to elevated insured and brokered deposit levels. 

Total non-interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased $338.2 million compared to the same period in 2022. The increase in non-interest expense for this period was also primarily driven by increases in deposit and insurance costs and are due to the same factors discussed above for the three-month comparable period, with the addition that the increase in deposit costs for the nine-month comparable period is also related to an increase in overall deposits since 2022. 

Income Taxes 

The Company's effective tax rate was 22.1% and 19.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company's effective tax rate was 20.5% and 19.7%, respectively. The increase in the three-month and nine-month effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in nondeductible discrete items.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS 

Total assets increased $3.2 billion to $70.9 billion at September 30, 2023, compared to $67.7 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase in total assets was driven by an increase in borrowings, which contributed to an increase in investment securities of $2.7 billion as well an increase in cash of $2.5 billion. Loans HFI decreased by $2.4 billion, or 4.7%, to $49.4 billion as of September 30, 2023, compared to $51.9 billion as of December 31, 2022. The decrease in loans HFI from December 31, 2022 was driven by the transfer of $6.0 billion of loans HFI to HFS during the first quarter 2023. The Company completed loan dispositions from this transferred loan pool totaling $4.3 billion through September 30, 2023 and transferred all remaining HFS loans back to HFI at the end of the period as a result of a change in management's intentions. By loan type, commercial and industrial loans and residential real estate loans decreased $2.4 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, from December 31, 2022, partially offset by increases in construction and land development loans and CRE, non-owner occupied loans of $656 million and $491 million, respectively. Loans HFS increased $582 million from $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2022 due to an increase in non-EBO loans. 

Total liabilities increased $2.8 billion to $65.1 billion at September 30, 2023, compared to $62.4 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase in liabilities is due primarily to an increase in borrowings and an increase in total deposits of $643 million, or 1.2%, to $54.3 billion. By type, the increase in deposits from December 31, 2022 was driven by increases of $3.7 billion in certificates of deposit and $3.3 billion in interest bearing demand deposits, partially offset by a decrease of $4.7 billion in savings and money market accounts and $1.7 billion in non-interest bearing demand deposits. Other borrowings increased $2.4 billion from December 31, 2022 due to an increase in short-term borrowings. 

Total stockholders&#8217; equity of $5.7 billion at September 30, 2023 increased by $390 million, or 7.3%, from December 31, 2022. The increase in stockholders' equity is primarily a function of net income, offset by quarterly dividends to common and preferred stockholders and unrealized fair value losses on AFS securities recorded net of tax in other comprehensive income. 

Investment securities 

Debt securities are classified at the time of acquisition as either HTM, AFS, or trading based upon various factors, including asset/liability management strategies, liquidity and profitability objectives, and regulatory requirements. HTM securities are carried at amortized cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts. AFS securities are debt securities that may be sold prior to maturity based upon asset/liability management decisions. Investment securities classified as AFS are carried at fair value with unrealized gains or losses on these securities recorded in AOCI in stockholders&#8217; equity, net of tax. Amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts on MBS is periodically adjusted for estimated prepayments. Trading securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses on these securities included in current period earnings. 

The Company's investment securities portfolio is utilized as collateral for borrowings, required collateral for public deposits and repurchase agreements, and to manage liquidity, capital, and interest rate risk. 

The following table summarizes the carrying value of the Company's investment securities portfolio: 

September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Increase (Decrease) (in millions) Debt securities CLO $ 2,165 &#160; $ 2,706 $ (541) Commercial MBS issued by GSEs 199 &#160; 97 102 &#160; Corporate debt securities 360 &#160; 390 (30) Private label residential MBS 1,257 &#160; 1,397 (140) Residential MBS issued by GSEs 1,858 &#160; 1,740 118 &#160; Tax-exempt 1,987 &#160; 1,982 5 &#160; U.S. Treasury securities 3,198 &#160; &#8212; 3,198 &#160; Other 66 &#160; 69 (3) Total debt securities $ 11,090 &#160; $ 8,381 $ 2,709 &#160; Equity securities Common stock $ &#8212; &#160; $ 3 $ (3) CRA investments 24 &#160; 49 (25) Preferred stock 97 &#160; 108 (11) Total equity securities $ 121 &#160; $ 160 $ (39) 

Loans HFS 

The Company purchases and originates residential mortgage loans through its AmeriHome mortgage banking business channel that are held for sale or securitization. These loans have historically made up the entire balance of loans HFS. However, as part of the Company's balance sheet repositioning strategy, the Company transferred $5.9 billion of loans, net of a fair value loss adjustment (primarily commercial and industrial loans) to HFS as of March 31, 2023. The Company completed loan dispositions from this transferred loan pool totaling $4.3 billion through September 30, 2023 and transferred all remaining HFS loans back to HFI at the end of the period as a result of a change in management's intentions. As of September 30, 2023, the loans HFS balance totaled $1.8 billion, compared to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2022, an increase of $582 million primarily related to an increase in non-EBO loans. 

Loans HFI 

The table below summarizes the distribution of the Company&#8217;s held for investment loan portfolio: 

September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Increase (Decrease) (in millions) Warehouse lending $ 6,439 &#160; $ 5,561 $ 878 &#160; Municipal &#38; nonprofit 1,474 &#160; 1,524 (50) Tech &#38; innovation 2,254 &#160; 2,293 (39) Equity fund resources 1,034 &#160; 3,717 (2,683) Other commercial and industrial 7,317 &#160; 7,793 (476) CRE - owner occupied 1,624 &#160; 1,656 (32) Hotel franchise finance 3,837 &#160; 3,807 30 &#160; Other CRE - non-owner occupied 5,952 &#160; 5,457 495 &#160; Residential 13,301 &#160; 13,996 (695) Residential - EBO 1,343 &#160; 1,884 (541) Construction and land development 4,652 &#160; 3,995 657 &#160; Other 220 &#160; 179 41 &#160; Total loans HFI 49,447 &#160; 51,862 (2,415) Allowance for credit losses (327) (310) (17) Total loans HFI, net of allowance $ 49,120 &#160; $ 51,552 $ (2,432) 

Loans classified as HFI are stated at the amount of unpaid principal, adjusted for net deferred fees and costs, premiums and discounts on acquired and purchased loans, and an ACL. Net deferred loan fees of $112 million and $141 million reduced the carrying value of loans as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Net unamortized purchase premiums on acquired and purchased loans of $177 million and $195 million increased the carrying value of loans as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

Concentrations of Lending Activities 

The Company monitors concentrations of lending activities at the product and borrower relationship level. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, no borrower relationships at both the commitment and funded loan level exceeded 5% of total loans HFI. 

Commercial and industrial loans made up 37% and 40% of total loans HFI as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

The Company&#8217;s loan portfolio also includes credit exposure to the CRE market as CRE-non-owner occupied loans accounted for approximately 20% and 18% of total loans HFI at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Approximately $2.6 billion, or 5.3%, of total loans HFI consisted of CRE non-owner occupied office loans as of September 30, 2023, compared to $2.4 billion, or 4.6%, as of December 31, 2022. These office loans primarily consist of shorter-term bridge loans that enable borrowers to reposition or redevelop projects with more modern standards attractive to in-office employers in today&#8217;s environment, including enhanced on-site amenities. The vast majority of these projects are located in suburban locations with Central Business District or downtown exposure totaling approximately 3% and midtown exposure totaling approximately 9% of office loans. 

The office loan portfolio largely consists of value-add loans that require significant up-front cash equity contributions from institutional sponsors and large regional and national developers. Leverage is low with initial loan-to-value ratios less than 55% and a weighted average loan-to-cost of approximately 62% at time of origination. The properties underlying these loans have 

stable business trends and low vacancy rates. In addition to adhering to conservative underwriting standards, asset-specific credit risk is mitigated through continued sponsor support of projects by re-appraisal rights by the Company, re-margining requirements and ongoing debt service, and debt yield covenants. To a large extent, the financing structures of these loans do not carry junior liens or mezzanine debt, which enables maximum flexibility when working with clients and sponsors. 

In addition, construction and land loans were 9% and 8% of total loans HFI at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

Non-performing Assets 

Total non-performing loans increased $257 million to $344 million at September 30, 2023, from $87 million at December 31, 2022. 

September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 (dollars in millions) Total nonaccrual loans (1) $ 237 &#160; $ 85 Loans past due 90 days or more on accrual status (2) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; Accruing restructured loans 107 &#160; 2 Total nonperforming loans $ 344 &#160; $ 87 Other assets acquired through foreclosure, net $ 8 &#160; $ 11 Nonaccrual loans to funded loans HFI 0.48 &#160; % 0.16 % Loans past due 90 days or more on accrual status to funded loans HFI &#8212; &#8212; 

(1) Includes loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty of $36 million and TDR loans of $12 million at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

(2) Excludes government guaranteed residential mortgage loans of $439 million and $582 million at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

Interest income that would have been recorded under the original terms of nonaccrual loans was $4.5 million and $1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $8.1 million and $3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

The composition of nonaccrual loans HFI by loan portfolio segment were as follows: 

September 30, 2023 Nonaccrual Balance Percent of Nonaccrual Balance Percent of Total Loans HFI (dollars in millions) Municipal &#38; nonprofit $ 13 &#160; 5.5 &#160; % 0.03 &#160; % Tech &#38; innovation 7 &#160; 3.0 &#160; 0.01 &#160; Other commercial and industrial 69 &#160; 29.1 &#160; 0.14 &#160; CRE - owner occupied 9 &#160; 3.8 &#160; 0.02 &#160; Other CRE - non-owner occupied 77 &#160; 32.5 &#160; 0.16 &#160; Residential 62 &#160; 26.1 &#160; 0.12 &#160; Total non-accrual loans $ 237 &#160; 100.0 &#160; % 0.48 &#160; %

Restructurings for Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 

The Company adopted the amendments in ASU 2022-02, which eliminated the accounting guidance on TDR loans for creditors and requires enhanced disclosures for loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that were made on or after January 1, 2023. 

The following table presents the amortized cost of loans HFI that were modified during the period by loan portfolio segment:

The performance of these modified loans is monitored for 12 months following the modification. As of September 30, 2023, modified loans on nonaccrual status totaled $36 million and the remaining $107 million were current with contractual payments. 

In the normal course of business, the Company also modifies EBO loans, which are delinquent FHA, VA, or USDA insured or guaranteed loans repurchased under the terms of the GNMA MBS program and can be repooled or resold when loans are brought current. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company completed modifications of EBO loans with an amortized cost of $84 million and $176 million, respectively. These modifications were largely payment delays and term extensions, or both. 

Troubled Debt Restructured Loans 

Prior to the adoption of ASU 2022-02, the Company accounted for a modification to the contractual terms of a loan that resulted in granting a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties as a TDR. The loan terms that were modified or restructured due to a borrower&#8217;s financial situation included, but were not limited to, a reduction in the stated interest rate, an extension of the maturity or renewal of the loan at an interest rate below current market, a reduction in the face amount of the debt, a reduction in the accrued interest, or deferral of interest payments. The majority of the Company's modifications were extensions in terms or deferral of payments which resulted in no lost principal or interest. Consistent with regulatory guidance, a TDR loan that was subsequently modified in another restructuring agreement but had shown sustained performance and classification as a TDR, was removed from TDR status provided that the modified terms were market-based at the time of modification. 

The following table presents TDR loans: 

December 31, 2022 Number of Loans Recorded Investment Other commercial and industrial 4 $ 2 CRE - owner occupied 1 1 Hotel franchise finance 1 10 Other CRE - non-owner occupied 1 1 Total 7 $ 14 

As of December 31, 2022, the ACL on TDR loans totaled $4 million and there were no outstanding commitments on TDR loans. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans HFI 

The ACL consists of an ACL on loans and on unfunded loan commitments. The ACL on AFS and HTM securities is estimated separately from loans and is discussed within the Investment Securities section. 

The following table summarizes the allocation of the ACL on loans HFI by loan portfolio segment: 

September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Allowance for credit losses Percent of total allowance for credit losses Percent of loan type to total loans HFI Allowance for credit losses Percent of total allowance for credit losses Percent of loan type to total loans HFI (dollars in millions) Warehouse lending $ 4.7 &#160; 1.4 &#160; % 13.0 &#160; % $ 8.4 2.7 % 10.7 % Municipal &#38; nonprofit 16.7 &#160; 5.1 &#160; 3.0 &#160; 15.9 5.1 3.0 Tech &#38; innovation 32.0 &#160; 9.8 &#160; 4.6 &#160; 30.8 10.0 4.4 Equity fund resources 1.7 &#160; 0.5 &#160; 2.1 &#160; 6.4 2.1 7.2 Other commercial and industrial 69.5 &#160; 21.2 &#160; 14.8 &#160; 85.9 27.7 15.0 CRE - owner occupied 7.7 &#160; 2.4 &#160; 3.3 &#160; 7.1 2.3 3.2 Hotel franchise finance 40.6 &#160; 12.4 &#160; 7.8 &#160; 46.9 15.2 7.4 Other CRE - non-owner occupied 95.7 &#160; 29.2 &#160; 12.0 &#160; 47.4 15.3 10.5 Residential 26.1 &#160; 8.0 &#160; 26.9 &#160; 30.4 9.8 27.0 Residential - EBO &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2.7 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; 3.6 Construction and land development 29.1 &#160; 8.9 &#160; 9.4 &#160; 27.4 8.8 7.7 Other 3.6 &#160; 1.1 &#160; 0.4 &#160; 3.1 1.0 0.3 Total $ 327.4 &#160; 100.0 &#160; % 100.0 &#160; % $ 309.7 100.0 % 100.0 % 

During the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, net loan charge-offs (recoveries) to average loans outstanding were 0.07% and (0.02)%, respectively, and 0.06% and 0.00% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

In addition to the ACL on funded loans HFI, the Company maintains a separate ACL related to off-balance sheet credit exposures, including unfunded loan commitments. This allowance balance totaled $37.9 million and $47.0 million at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and is included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

Problem Loans 

The Company classifies loans consistent with federal banking regulations using a nine category grading system.

Mortgage Servicing Rights 

The fair value of the Company's MSRs related to residential mortgage loans totaled $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The increase in MSRs is primarily related to new production of MSRs and valuation gains, partially offset by sales. 

The following is a summary of the UPB of loans underlying the Company's MSR portfolio by type: 

September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 (in millions) FNMA and FHLMC $ 52,618 &#160; $ 38,113 GNMA 15,766 &#160; 31,046 Non-agency 1,877 &#160; 1,690 Total unpaid principal balance of loans $ 70,261 &#160; $ 70,849 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

Goodwill represents the excess consideration paid for net assets acquired in a business combination over their fair value. Goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are determined to have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortization, but are subsequently evaluated for impairment at least annually. The Company has goodwill totaling $527 million at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

The Company performs its annual goodwill and intangible assets impairment tests as of October 1 each year, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company evaluated whether the continued effects from the bank failures earlier in 2023 may give rise to a triggering event and elected to perform a Step 0 goodwill impairment assessment, which included assessing the financial performance of the Company and analyzing qualitative factors applicable to the Company. As of September 30, 2023, the Company does not believe that these events or circumstances have significantly altered the long-term financial performance of the Company. Accordingly, it was determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Company and its reporting units exceeds their respective carrying values as of September 30, 2023. 

Deferred Tax Assets 

As of September 30, 2023, the net DTA balance totaled $365 million, an increase of $54 million from $311 million at December 31, 2022. This overall increase in the net DTA was primarily the result of a decrease in the fair market value of AFS securities and a decrease to MSR deferred tax liabilities. 

At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had no deferred tax valuation allowance. 

Deposits 

Deposits are the primary source for funding the Company's asset growth. Total deposits increased to $54.3 billion at September 30, 2023, from $53.6 billion at December 31, 2022, an increase of $643 million, or 1.2%. By deposit type, the increase in deposits is attributable to increases in certificates of deposit of $3.7 billion and interest bearing demand deposits of $3.3 billion, partially offset by decreases in savings and money market accounts of $4.7 billion and non-interest bearing demand deposits of $1.7 billion. 

Brokered deposits provide an additional source of deposits and are placed with the Bank through third-party brokers. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company held wholesale brokered deposits of $6.5 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively, excluding reciprocal deposits. In addition, WAB is a participant in the IntraFi Network, a network that offers deposit placement services such as CDARS and ICS, and other reciprocal deposit networks which offer products that qualify large deposits for FDIC insurance. At September 30, 2023, the Company had $12.5 billion of reciprocal deposits, compared to $2.8 billion at December 31, 2022. These reciprocal deposit structures offer protection to depositors by fully insuring deposits with other network banks and also provides the Company with funding stability and drove the increase in the Company&#8217;s insured deposit ratio from 45% at December 31, 2022 to 77% at September 30, 2023 and including collateralized deposits, this ratio increased to 82% at September 30, 2023 from 47% at December 31, 2022. 

In addition, deposits for which the Company provides account holders with earnings credits or referral fees totaled $17.1 billion and $12.9 billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The Company incurred $123.7 million and $17.3 million in deposit related costs on these deposits during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company incurred $297.1 million and $26.0 million in deposit related costs on these deposits during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These costs are reported as Deposit costs in non-interest expense. The increase in these costs from the prior year is due to an increase in average earnings credit rates as well as an increase in average deposit balances eligible for earnings credits or referral fees. 

The average balances and weighted average rates paid on deposits are presented below: 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 Average Balance Rate Average Balance Rate (dollars in millions) Interest-bearing transaction accounts $ 12,947 &#160; 3.03 &#160; % $ 8,466 1.15 % Savings and money market accounts 13,832 &#160; 3.05 &#160; 18,515 0.95 Certificates of deposit 9,125 &#160; 4.83 &#160; 2,843 1.19 Total interest-bearing deposits 35,904 &#160; 3.49 &#160; 29,824 1.03 Non-interest-bearing demand deposits 18,402 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 25,865 &#8212; Total deposits $ 54,306 &#160; 2.31 &#160; % $ 55,689 0.55 %

Other Borrowings 

Short-Term Borrowings 

The Company utilizes short-term borrowed funds to support short-term liquidity needs. The majority of these short-term borrowed funds consist of warehouse borrowings, advances from the FHLB, the BTFP, repurchase agreements, and federal funds purchased from correspondent banks or the FHLB. The Company&#8217;s borrowing capacity with the FHLB is determined based on collateral pledged, generally consisting of securities and loans. In addition, the Company has repurchase facilities, collateralized by securities and EBO loans, including assets sold under agreements to repurchase, which are reflected at the amount of cash received in connection with the transaction, and may require additional collateral based on the fair value of the underlying securities. Total short-term borrowings increased $3.0 billion to $8.0 billion at September 30, 2023 from $5.0 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase was driven by increases in warehouse and BTFP borrowings of $1.3 billion, EBO repurchase agreements of $481 million, and FHLB advances of $400 million. 

Long-Term Borrowings 

The Company's long-term borrowings consist of AmeriHome senior notes and credit linked notes, inclusive of issuance costs and fair market value adjustments. At September 30, 2023, the carrying value of long-term borrowings was $763 million, compared to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2022. The decrease in long-term borrowings from December 31, 2022 primarily relates to the payoff of credit linked notes on the Company's mortgage warehouse and equity fund resource loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Qualifying Debt 

Qualifying debt consists of subordinated debt and junior subordinated debt, inclusive of issuance costs and fair market value adjustments. At September 30, 2023, the carrying value of qualifying debt was $890 million, compared to $893 million at December 31, 2022. 

Capital Resources 

The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could trigger certain mandatory or discretionary actions that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company&#8217;s business and financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items (discussed in "Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies" to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements) as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. 

As permitted by the regulatory capital rules, the Company elected the CECL transition option that delayed the estimated impact on regulatory capital resulting from the adoption of CECL over a five-year transition period ending December 31, 2024. Accordingly, capital ratios and amounts for 2022 include a 25% reduction to the capital benefit that resulted from the increased ACL related to the adoption of ASC 326, which has increased to include a 50% reduction beginning in 2023. 

As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company and the Bank exceeded the capital levels necessary to be classified as well-capitalized, as defined by the various banking agencies. The actual capital amounts and ratios for the Company and the Bank are presented in the following tables: 

Total Capital Tier 1 Capital Risk-Weighted Assets Tangible Average Assets Total Capital Ratio Tier 1 Capital Ratio Tier 1 Leverage Ratio Common Equity Tier 1 (dollars in millions) September 30, 2023 WAL $ 7,078 &#160; $ 5,916 &#160; $ 52,447 &#160; $ 69,296 &#160; 13.5 &#160; % 11.3 &#160; % 8.5 &#160; % 10.6 &#160; % WAB 6,726 &#160; 6,158 &#160; 52,339 &#160; 69,221 &#160; 12.9 &#160; 11.8 &#160; 8.9 &#160; 11.8 &#160; Well-capitalized ratios 10.0 &#160; 8.0 &#160; 5.0 &#160; 6.5 &#160; Minimum capital ratios 8.0 &#160; 6.0 &#160; 4.0 &#160; 4.5 &#160; December 31, 2022 WAL $ 6,586 $ 5,449 $ 54,461 $ 69,814 12.1 % 10.0 % 7.8 % 9.3 % WAB 6,280 5,737 54,411 69,762 11.5 10.5 8.2 10.5 Well-capitalized ratios 10.0 8.0 5.0 6.5 Minimum capital ratios 8.0 6.0 4.0 4.5 

The Company is also required to maintain specified levels of capital to remain in good standing with certain federal government agencies, including FNMA, FHLMC, GNMA, and HUD. These capital requirements are generally tied to the unpaid balances of loans included in the Company's servicing portfolio or loan production volume. Noncompliance with these capital requirements can result in various remedial actions up to, and including, removing the Company's ability to sell loans to and service loans on behalf of the respective agency. The Company believes that it is in compliance with these requirements as of September 30, 2023. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The critical accounting estimates upon which the Company's financial condition and results of operations depend, and which involve the most complex subjective decisions or assessments, are included in the discussion entitled "Critical Accounting Policies" in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, and all amendments thereto, as filed with the SEC. There were no material changes to the critical accounting policies disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Liquidity 

Liquidity is the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, fund asset growth and business operations, and meet contractual obligations through unconstrained access to funding at reasonable market rates. Liquidity management involves forecasting funding requirements and maintaining sufficient capacity to meet the needs and accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to changes in the Company's business operations or unanticipated events. 

The ability to have readily available funds sufficient to repay fully maturing liabilities is of primary importance to depositors, creditors, and regulators. The Company's liquidity, represented by cash and amounts due from banks, federal funds sold, loans HFS, and non-pledged marketable securities, is a result of the Company's operating, investing, and financing activities and related cash flows. The Company actively monitors and manages liquidity, and no less than quarterly will estimate probable liquidity needs on a 12-month horizon. Liquidity needs can also be met through short-term borrowings or the disposition of short-term assets. 

The following table presents the available and outstanding balances on the Company's lines of credit: 

September 30, 2023 Available Balance Outstanding Balance (in millions) Unsecured fed funds credit lines at correspondent banks $ 1,417 &#160; $ 122 &#160; 

In addition to lines of credit, the Company has borrowing capacity with the FHLB and FRB from pledged loans and securities and warehouse borrowing lines of credit. The borrowing capacity, outstanding borrowings, and available credit are presented in the following table: 

September 30, 2023 (in millions) FHLB: Borrowing capacity $ 12,524 &#160; Outstanding borrowings 4,700 &#160; Letters of credit 195 &#160; Total available credit $ 7,629 &#160; FRB: Borrowing capacity $ 16,073 &#160; Outstanding borrowings (BTFP) 1,300 &#160; Total available credit $ 14,773 &#160; Warehouse borrowings: Borrowing capacity $ 3,000 &#160; Outstanding borrowings 1,334 &#160; Total available credit $ 1,666 &#160; 

The Company has a formal liquidity policy and, in the opinion of management, its liquid assets are considered adequate to meet cash flow needs for loan funding and deposit cash withdrawals for the next 90-120 days. At September 30, 2023, there were $8.9 billion in liquid assets, comprised of $3.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $5.4 billion in unpledged marketable securities. At December 31, 2022, the Company maintained $7.7 billion in liquid assets, comprised of $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $1.1 billion in loans HFS, and $5.5 billion of unpledged marketable securities. 

The Parent maintains liquidity that would be sufficient to fund its operations and certain non-bank affiliate operations for an extended period should funding from normal sources be disrupted. In the Company's analysis of Parent liquidity, it is assumed that the Parent is unable to generate funds from additional debt or equity issuances, receives no dividend income from subsidiaries and does not pay dividends to stockholders, while continuing to make non-discretionary payments needed to maintain operations and repayment of contractual principal and interest payments owed by the Parent and affiliated companies. Under this scenario, the amount of time the Parent and its non-bank subsidiary can operate and meet all obligations before the current liquid assets are exhausted is considered as part of the Parent liquidity analysis. Management believes the Parent maintains adequate liquidity capacity to operate without additional funding from new sources for over twelve months. 

WAB maintains sufficient funding capacity to address large increases in funding requirements, such as deposit outflows. This capacity is comprised of liquidity derived from a reduction in asset levels and various secured funding sources. On a long-term basis, the Company&#8217;s liquidity will be met by changing the relative distribution of its asset portfolios (for example, by reducing investment or loan volumes, or selling or encumbering assets). Further, the Company can increase liquidity by soliciting higher levels of deposit accounts through promotional activities and/or borrowing from correspondent banks, the FHLB of San Francisco, and the FRB. At September 30, 2023, the Company's long-term liquidity needs primarily relate to funds required to support loan originations, commitments, and deposit withdrawals, which can be met by cash flows from investment payments and maturities, and investment sales, if necessary. 

The Company&#8217;s liquidity is comprised of three primary classifications: 1) cash flows provided by operating activities; 2) cash flows used in investing activities; and 3) cash flows provided by financing activities. Net cash provided by or used in operating activities consists primarily of net income, adjusted for changes in certain other asset and liability accounts and certain non-cash income and expense items, such as the provision for credit losses, investment and other amortization and depreciation. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, net cash (used in) provided by operating activities was $(669.8) million and $1.5 billion, respectively. 

The Company's primary investing activities are the origination of real estate and commercial loans, the collection of repayments of these loans, and the purchase and sale of securities. The Company's net cash used in investing activities has been primarily influenced by its loan and securities activities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company's cash balance increased by $1.9 billion as a result of a net decrease in loans, compared to a reduction in cash of $11.7 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 from a net increase in loans. A net increase in investment securities of $2.6 billion and $1.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, partially offset the increase to the Company's cash balance during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and contributed to the reduction during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. 

Net cash provided by financing activities has been impacted significantly by deposit levels. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net deposits increased $642.9 million, compared to an increase in net deposits of $8.0 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. 

Fluctuations in core deposit levels may increase the Company's need for liquidity as certificates of deposit mature or are withdrawn before maturity, and as non-maturity deposits, such as checking and savings account balances, are withdrawn. Additionally, the Company is exposed to the risk that customers with large deposit balances will withdraw all or a portion of such deposits, due in part to the FDIC limitations on the amount of insurance coverage provided to depositors. To mitigate the uninsured deposit risk, the Company participates in the CDARS and ICS programs, which allow an individual customer to invest up to $50.0 million and $150.0 million, respectively, through one participating financial institution or, a combined total of $200.0 million per individual customer, with the entire amount being covered by FDIC insurance. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $12.5 billion of total reciprocal deposits. 

As of September 30, 2023, the Company has $6.5 billion of wholesale brokered deposits outstanding, excluding reciprocal deposits of $12.5 billion. Although classified as brokered deposits, the Company believes that due to the reciprocal nature of these deposits, these accounts carry a lower risk of withdrawal and deposit volatility. Non-reciprocal brokered deposits are generally considered to be deposits that have been received from a third party who is engaged in the business of placing deposits on behalf of others. A traditional deposit broker will direct deposits to the banking institution offering the highest interest rate available. Federal banking laws and regulations place restrictions on depository institutions regarding brokered deposits because of the general concern that these deposits are not relationship based and are at a greater risk of being withdrawn and placed on deposit at another institution offering a higher interest rate, thus posing liquidity risk for institutions that gather brokered deposits in significant amounts. 

Federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid. The total amount of dividends which may be paid at any date is generally limited to the retained earnings of the bank. Dividends paid by WAB to the Parent would be prohibited if the effect thereof would cause the Bank&#8217;s capital to be reduced below applicable minimum capital requirements. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2023, WAB paid dividends to the Parent of $60 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, WAB and CSI paid dividends to the Parent of $170 million and $100 million, respectively. 

Supervision and Regulation 

The following information is intended to update, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained under the caption &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Bank Term Funding Program 

In response to the bank failures that occurred earlier in 2023, the Federal Reserve System has established a BTFP, which is intended to provide additional funding to eligible depository institutions to help assure banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors. The BTFP offers loans of up to one year in length to eligible depository institutions pledging any collateral eligible for purchase by the Federal Reserve Banks in open market operations (for example, U.S. Treasuries, U.S. agency securities, and U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities), which will be valued at par. The U.S. Department of the Treasury will provide $25 billion as credit protection to the Federal Reserve Banks in connection with the BTFP. The goal of the BTFP is to be an additional source of liquidity against high-quality securities, eliminating an institution&#8217;s need to quickly sell those securities in times of stress. The Company has borrowings under the BTFP that totaled $1.3 billion as of September 30, 2023. 

FDIC Special Assessment 

To recover the loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund arising from the bank failures that occurred earlier in 2023, the FDIC has proposed an annual special assessment rate of approximately 12.5 basis points. The assessment base for the special assessments would be equal to an institution&#8217;s estimated uninsured deposits as of December 31, 2022, adjusted to exclude the first $5 billion from estimated uninsured deposits. The special assessments would be collected over an eight-quarter collection period, at a quarterly special assessment rate of 3.13 basis points, with the first quarterly assessment period beginning on January 1, 2024. The comment period for the proposal ended on July 21, 2023, with a final rule expected later this year. If adopted as proposed, the Company expects to recognize a one-time charge of $62 million.
