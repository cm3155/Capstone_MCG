Recent Banking Industry and Market Developments 

The closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank have caused significant disruption in the United States banking industry, particularly among mid-size banks, such as the Company. These bank closures triggered a surge in deposit outflows and stock price volatility at many mid-sized banks. 

The FRB announced the BTFP, which offers loans of up to one year in length to banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other eligible depository institutions pledging U.S. Treasuries, agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, and other qualifying assets as collateral valued at par. Under this program, the Bank has access to $1.4 billion in borrowing capacity, of which $1.3 billion was drawn at March 31, 2023. 

Additionally, the Department of the Treasury, FRB, and FDIC issued a joint statement relating to the resolution of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, which stated that losses to support uninsured deposits of those banks would be recovered via a special assessment on banks. Although the exact terms of that special assessment have not been announced, the Company expects that future FDIC deposit insurance assessments will increase. 

Most recently, on May 1, 2023, First Republic Bank was closed by its primary state regulator, which appointed the FDIC as receiver, and the FDIC announced that JP Morgan Chase Bank, National Association agreed to assume all of First Republic Bank&#8217;s deposits and substantially all of its assets and that the expected related cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund would be approximately $13 billion. The recent volatility in the banking industry and other recent regulatory actions have had and may continue to have a material impact on the Company's operations, as further discussed below. 

Capital and liquidity 

While the Company believes it has sufficient capital, funding, and access to contingent sources of liquidity, the Company has taken several actions to ensure the strength of its capital and liquidity position. These actions included sale of selected assets, including $459 million of AFS securities and $915 million of loans, as well as transfer of $5.9 billion of loans to HFS, net of a pre-tax fair value loss adjustment of $123.5 million, and increasing its borrowing capacity with the FRB. 

The Company's deposit balances stabilized as of March 20, 2023 and from such date through March 31, 2023 deposits increased, but were down $6.1 billion from December 31, 2022. The Company also strengthened its insured deposit ratio from 45% as of December 31, 2022 to 68% as of March 31, 2023, with a further increase to 74% as of May 2, 2023. 

Financial position and results of operations 

The Company's financial position and results of operations as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2023 have been impacted by this disruption. The current conditions in the banking industry contributed to the $19.4 million provision for credit losses recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2023, of which $17.1 million related to a charge-off of a corporate debt security from a financial institution issuer. The Company's actions to strengthen its capital and liquidity position contributed to a $147.8 million pre-tax fair value loss adjustment primarily related to the transfer of loans to HFS, a loss of $12.5 million on sales of investment securities, and a $12.7 million gain on extinguishment of debt. The continued uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the volatility in the banking industry and related economic effects will continue to affect the Company&#8217;s estimate of its allowance for credit losses and resulting provision for credit losses. To the extent the impact of the recent banking industry volatility is prolonged and economic conditions worsen or persist longer than forecast, such estimates may be insufficient and may change significantly in the future. The Company&#8217;s net interest margin also may be negatively impacted in future periods if the Company's borrowings remain elevated. These uncertainties and the economic environment will continue to affect earnings, growth, and may result in deterioration of asset quality in the Company's loan and investment portfolios. 

Depositors in the technology industry are generally considered to be the most impacted by recent events and may have greater sensitivity to the recent volatility in the banking industry with potentially longer recovery periods than other types of businesses. The Company's deposit exposure to the technology industry totaled $4.2 billion, or 8.8% of total deposits, as of March 31, 2023. 

Asset valuation 

Continued and sustained declines in the Company's stock price and/or other liquidity related impacts, such as increases in deposit outflows, could give rise to triggering events in the future that could result in a write-down in the value of our goodwill, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

For all banks and bank holding companies, asset quality plays a significant role in the overall financial condition of the institution and results of operations. The Company measures asset quality in terms of nonaccrual loans as a percentage of gross loans and net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans. Net charge-offs are calculated as the difference between charged-off loans and recovery payments received on previously charged-off loans. The following table summarizes the Company's key asset quality metrics for loans HFI: 

March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 (dollars in millions) Nonaccrual loans $ 107 &#160; $ 85 Repossessed assets 11 &#160; 11 Non-performing assets 138 &#160; 98 Nonaccrual loans to funded loans 0.23 &#160; % 0.16 % Nonaccrual and repossessed assets to total assets 0.17 &#160; 0.14 Allowance for loan losses to funded loans 0.66 &#160; 0.60 Allowance for credit losses to funded loans 0.75 &#160; 0.69 Net charge-offs to average loans outstanding (1) 0.05 &#160; 0.00 

(1) Annualized on an actual/actual basis for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Actual year-to-date for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Asset and Deposit Growth 

The Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities are comprised primarily of loans and deposits. Therefore, the ability to originate new loans and attract new deposits is fundamental to the Company&#8217;s growth. 

Total assets increased to $71.0 billion at March 31, 2023 from $67.7 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase in total assets of $3.3 billion, or 4.9%, was driven by an increase in borrowings as the recent disruption in the banking industry caused a temporary surge in deposit outflows, increasing the need for additional liquidity, which contributed to an increase in cash of $2.6 billion as well as an increase in investment securities of $569 million. Loans HFI decreased by $5.4 billion, or 10.5%, to $46.4 billion as of March 31, 2023, compared to $51.9 billion as of December 31, 2022. The decrease in loans HFI from December 31, 2022 was attributable to the transfer of $5.9 billion to HFS, net of a fair value loss adjustment of $123.5 million. By loan type, commercial and industrial loans and residential real estate loans decreased $5.2 billion and $904 million, respectively, from December 31, 2022, partially offset by increases in construction and land development loans and CRE, non-owner occupied loans of $394 million and $298 million, respectively. Loans HFS increased by $5.8 billion as a result of this transfer, up from $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2022. 

Total deposits decreased $6.1 billion, or 11.3%, to $47.6 billion as of March 31, 2023 from $53.6 billion as of December 31, 2022. By type, the decrease in deposits from December 31, 2022 was driven by a decrease of $5.6 billion in savings and money market accounts and $3.2 billion in non-interest bearing demand deposits, partially offset by an increase of $1.5 billion in certificates of deposit and $1.2 billion in interest bearing demand deposits. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following table sets forth a summary financial overview: 

Three Months Ended March 31, Increase 2023 2022 (Decrease) (in millions, except per share amounts) Consolidated Income Statement Data: Interest income $ 968.9 &#160; $ 484.5 $ 484.4 &#160; Interest expense 359.0 &#160; 35.0 324.0 &#160; Net interest income 609.9 &#160; 449.5 160.4 &#160; Provision for credit losses 19.4 &#160; 9.0 10.4 &#160; Net interest income after provision for credit losses 590.5 &#160; 440.5 150.0 &#160; Non-interest income (58.0) 106.3 (164.3) Non-interest expense 347.9 &#160; 248.6 99.3 &#160; Income before provision for income taxes 184.6 &#160; 298.2 (113.6) Income tax expense 42.4 &#160; 58.1 (15.7) Net income 142.2 &#160; 240.1 (97.9) Dividends on preferred stock 3.2 &#160; 3.2 &#8212; &#160; Net income available to common stockholders $ 139.0 &#160; $ 236.9 $ (97.9) Earnings per share: Basic $ 1.29 &#160; $ 2.23 $ (0.94) Diluted 1.28 &#160; 2.22 (0.94) 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

The following discussion and analysis contains financial information determined by methods other than those prescribed by GAAP. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in their analysis of the Company's performance. Management believes presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a complete understanding of the operating results of the Company. Since the presentation of these non-GAAP performance measures and their impact differ between companies, these non-GAAP disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. 

Pre-Provision Net Revenue 

Banking regulations define PPNR as the sum of net interest income and non-interest income less expenses before adjusting for loss provisions and has been further adjusted for non-operating items. Management believes that this is an important metric as it illustrates the underlying performance of the Company, it enables investors and others to assess the Company's ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through the credit cycle, and provides consistent reporting with a key metric used by bank regulatory agencies. 

The following table shows the components used in the calculation of PPNR: 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 (in millions) Net interest income $ 609.9 &#160; $ 449.5 Total non-interest income (58.0) 106.3 Adjusted for: Loss (gain) on sales of investment securities 12.5 &#160; (6.9) Fair value loss adjustments, net 147.8 &#160; 6.6 Total non-interest income, adjusted $ 102.3 &#160; $ 106.0 Net revenue, adjusted $ 712.2 &#160; $ 555.5 Total non-interest expense 347.9 &#160; 248.6 Adjusted for: Gain on extinguishment of debt 12.7 &#160; &#8212; Total non-interest expense, adjusted $ 360.6 &#160; $ 248.6 Pre-provision net revenue $ 351.6 &#160; $ 306.9 Less: Provision for credit losses 19.4 &#160; 9.0 Income tax expense 42.4 &#160; 58.1 Loss (gain) on sales of investment securities 12.5 &#160; (6.9) Fair value loss adjustments, net 147.8 &#160; 6.6 Plus: Gain on extinguishment of debt 12.7 &#160; &#8212; Net income $ 142.2 &#160; $ 240.1 

Efficiency Ratio 

The following table shows the components used in the calculation of the efficiency ratio, adjusted for non-operating items, which management uses as a metric for assessing cost efficiency: 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 (dollars in millions) Total non-interest expense, adjusted $ 360.6 &#160; $ 248.6 Divided by: Total net interest income 609.9 &#160; 449.5 Plus: Tax equivalent interest adjustment 8.8 &#160; 8.0 Total non-interest income, adjusted 102.3 &#160; 106.0 $ 721.0 &#160; $ 563.5 Efficiency ratio - tax equivalent basis 62.1 &#160; % 44.1 % Efficiency ratio - tax equivalent basis, adjusted 50.0 &#160; % 44.1 % 

Earnings Per Share, Adjusted 

The following table shows the components used in the calculation of earnings per share, adjusted to exclude non-operating items: 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 (in millions) Net income available to common stockholders $ 139.0 &#160; $ 236.9 Adjusted for: Loss (gain) on sales of investment securities 12.5 &#160; (6.9) Fair value loss adjustments, net 147.8 &#160; 6.6 Gain on extinguishment of debt (12.7) &#8212; Tax effect of adjustments (37.9) 0.1 Net income available to common stockholders, adjusted $ 248.7 &#160; $ 236.7 Diluted shares 108.3 &#160; 106.6 Diluted earnings per share, adjusted $ 2.30 &#160; $ 2.22 

Tangible Common Equity and Return on Average Tangible Common Equity 

The following tables present financial measures related to tangible common equity. Tangible common equity represents total stockholders' equity, less goodwill and intangible assets and preferred stock. Management believes that tangible common equity financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company's capital strength, financial condition, and ability to manage potential losses. 

March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 (dollars and shares in millions) Total stockholders' equity $ 5,521 &#160; $ 5,356 Less: Goodwill and intangible assets 677 &#160; 680 Preferred stock 295 &#160; 295 Total tangible common stockholders' equity 4,549 &#160; 4,381 Plus: deferred tax - attributed to intangible assets 2 &#160; 2 Total tangible common equity, net of tax $ 4,551 &#160; $ 4,383 Total assets $ 71,047 &#160; $ 67,734 Less: goodwill and intangible assets, net 677 &#160; 680 Tangible assets 70,370 &#160; 67,054 Plus: deferred tax - attributed to intangible assets 2 &#160; 2 Total tangible assets, net of tax $ 70,372 &#160; $ 67,056 Tangible common equity ratio 6.5 &#160; % 6.5 % Common shares outstanding 109.5 &#160; 108.9 Book value per common share $ 47.72 &#160; $ 46.47 Tangible book value per common share, net of tax 41.56 &#160; 40.25 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 (dollars in millions) Net income available to common shareholders $ 139.0 &#160; $ 236.9 Divided by: Average stockholders' equity 5,587.8 &#160; 4,988.9 Less: Average goodwill and intangible assets (678.6) (679.3) Average preferred stock (294.5) (294.5) Average tangible common equity 4,614.7 &#160; 4,015.1 Return on average tangible common equity 12.2 &#160; % 23.9 % 

Regulatory Capital 

The following table presents certain financial measures related to regulatory capital under Basel III, which includes CET1 and total capital. The FRB and other banking regulators use CET1 and total capital as a basis for assessing a bank's capital adequacy; therefore, management believes it is useful to assess financial condition and capital adequacy using this same basis. Specifically, the total capital ratio takes into consideration the risk levels of assets and off-balance sheet financial instruments. In addition, management believes that the classified assets to CET1 plus allowance measure is an important regulatory metric for assessing asset quality. 

As permitted by the regulatory capital rules, the Company elected to delay the estimated impact of CECL on its regulatory capital over a five-year transition period ending December 31, 2024. Accordingly, capital ratios and amounts for 2022 include a 25% reduction to the capital benefit that resulted from the increased ACL related to the adoption of ASC 326, which has increased to include a 50% reduction beginning in 2023.

Net Interest Margin 

The net interest margin is reported on a TEB. A tax equivalent adjustment is added to reflect interest earned on certain securities and loans that are exempt from federal and state income tax. The following tables set forth the average balances, interest income, interest expense, and average yield (on a fully TEB) for the periods indicated:

(1) Changes attributable to both volume and rate are designated as volume changes. 

Comparison of interest income, interest expense and net interest margin 

The Company's primary source of revenue is interest income. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, interest income was $968.9 million, an increase of $484.4 million, or 100.0%, compared to $484.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. This increase was primarily the result of a $417.1 million increase in interest income from loans HFI that was driven by a $12.4 billion increase in the average loan HFI balance, coupled with a $48.1 million increase in interest income from investment securities due to higher investment yields and an increase in the average investment balance of $1.1 billion. Interest income from cash and other also increased $38.3 million due to the higher rate environment and an increase in cash balances resulting from higher short-term borrowings. 

For the three months ended March 31, 2023, interest expense was $359.0 million, an increase of $324.0 million, compared to $35.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase in interest expense was due to an increase in interest expense on deposits of $217.5 million driven by increased interest rates and a $6.3 billion increase in the average interest-bearing deposit balance combined with a $105.6 million increase in interest expense on other borrowings resulting from an increase in the average balance of $6.6 billion. 

For the three months ended March 31, 2023, net interest income was $609.9 million, an increase of $160.4 million, or 35.7%, compared to $449.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase in net interest income reflects a $10.4 billion increase in average interest-earning assets, partially offset by an increase of $13.0 billion in average interest-bearing liabilities. The increase in net interest margin of 47 basis points to 3.79% is largely the result of an increase in loan balances and related yields, partially offset by higher deposit balances and rates compared to the same period in 2022. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses in each period is reflected as a reduction in earnings for that period and includes amounts related to funded loans, unfunded loan commitments, and investment securities. The provision is equal to the amount required to maintain the ACL at a level that is adequate to absorb estimated lifetime credit losses inherent in the loan and investment securities portfolios based on remaining contractual maturity, adjusted for estimated prepayments as of each period end. The Company's CECL models incorporate historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts in measuring expected credit losses. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $19.4 million, compared to $9.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase in the provision for credit losses from the three months ended March 31, 2022 is primarily related to a $17.1 million charge-off in the Company's AFS securities portfolio of a corporate debt security from a financial institution issuer and from heightened economic uncertainty, offset by a decrease in loans HFI balances as the Company transferred $5.9 billion to HFS, net of a fair value loss adjustment of $123.5 million. 

Non-interest Income 

The following table presents a summary of non-interest income: 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 Increase (Decrease) (in millions) Net loan servicing revenue $ 41.9 &#160; $ 41.1 $ 0.8 &#160; Net gain on loan origination and sale activities 31.4 &#160; 36.9 (5.5) Service charges and fees 9.5 &#160; 7.0 2.5 &#160; Commercial banking related income 6.2 &#160; 5.1 1.1 &#160; Gain on recovery from credit guarantees 3.3 &#160; 2.3 1.0 &#160; Income from equity investments 1.4 &#160; 4.1 (2.7) (Loss) gain on sales of investment securities (12.5) 6.9 (19.4) Fair value loss adjustments, net (147.8) (6.6) (141.2) Other income 8.6 &#160; 9.5 (0.9) Total non-interest income $ (58.0) $ 106.3 $ (164.3) 

Total non-interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 decreased $164.3 million. Th e decrease in non-interest income was driven by non-operating charges following the execution of the Company's balance sheet repositioning strategy, which included sales of selected loans and investment securities and the transfer of $5.9 billion of loans HFI to HFS, net of a fair value loss adjustment of $123.5 million. Consequently, the Company recognized fair value loss adjustments of $147.8 million primarily related to the transfer of loans to HFS and a net loss of $12.5 million on sales of investment securities during the t hree months ended March 31, 2023 . 

Non-interest Expense 

The following table presents a summary of non-interest expense: 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 Increase (Decrease) (in millions) Salaries and employee benefits $ 148.9 &#160; $ 138.3 $ 10.6 &#160; Deposit costs 86.9 &#160; 9.3 77.6 &#160; Data processing 26.4 &#160; 17.6 8.8 &#160; Legal, professional, and directors' fees 23.1 &#160; 24.0 (0.9) Occupancy 16.5 &#160; 12.8 3.7 &#160; Insurance 15.7 &#160; 7.2 8.5 &#160; Loan servicing expenses 13.8 &#160; 10.8 3.0 &#160; Business development and marketing 5.2 &#160; 4.4 0.8 &#160; Loan acquisition and origination expenses 4.4 &#160; 6.5 (2.1) Gain on extinguishment of debt (12.7) &#8212; (12.7) Other expense 19.7 &#160; 17.7 2.0 &#160; Total non-interest expense $ 347.9 &#160; $ 248.6 $ 99.3 &#160; 

Total non-interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased $99.3 million compared to the same period in 2022. The increase in non-interest expense was driven by an increase in deposit costs and salaries and employee benefits. The increase in deposit costs from the prior year relates primarily to an increase in deposit balances throughout 2022 and higher average ECR rates. The increase in salaries and employee benefits from the prior year relates to an increase in headcount. These increases were partially offset by a gain on extinguishment of debt of $12.7 million primarily related to payoff of the Company's credit linked note on its warehouse loans. 

Income Taxes 

The Company's effective tax rate was 23.0% and 19.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in LIHTC and solar credit benefits and a decrease in excess stock compensation benefit.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS 

Total assets increased $3.3 billion, or 4.9%, to $71.0 billion at March 31, 2023, compared to $67.7 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase in total assets was driven by an increase in borrowings as the recent disruption in the banking industry caused a temporary surge in deposit outflows, increasing the need for additional liquidity, which contributed to an increase in cash of $2.6 billion as well as an increase in investment securities of $569 million. Loans HFI decreased by $5.4 billion, or 10.5%, to $46.4 billion as of March 31, 2023, compared to $51.9 billion as of December 31, 2022. The decrease in loans HFI from December 31, 2022 was driven by the transfer of $5.9 billion to HFS, net of a fair value loss adjustment of $123.5 million. By loan type, commercial and industrial loans and residential real estate loans decreased $5.2 billion and $904 million, respectively, from December 31, 2022, offset by increases in construction and land development loans and CRE, non-owner occupied loans of $394 million and $298 million, respectively. Loans HFS increased $5.8 billion as a result of this transfer, up from $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2022. 

Total liabilities increased $3.1 billion, or 5.0%, to $65.5 billion at March 31, 2023, compared to $62.4 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase in liabilities is due primarily to an increase in borrowings as total deposits were down $6.1 billion, or 11.3%, to $47.6 billion. By type, the decrease in deposits from December 31, 2022 was driven by a decrease of $5.6 billion in savings and money market accounts and $3.2 billion in non-interest bearing demand deposits, partially offset by an increase of $1.5 billion in certificates of deposit and $1.2 billion in interest bearing demand deposits. Other borrowings increased $9.6 billion from December 31, 2022 due to an increase in short-term borrowings. 

Total stockholders&#8217; equity of $5.5 billion at March 31, 2023 increased by $165 million, or 3.1%, from December 31, 2022. The increase in stockholders' equity is primarily a function of net income and unrealized fair value gains on AFS securities recorded net of tax in other comprehensive income, offset by quarterly dividends to common and preferred shareholders. 

Investment securities 

Debt securities are classified at the time of acquisition as either HTM, AFS, or trading based upon various factors, including asset/liability management strategies, liquidity and profitability objectives, and regulatory requirements. HTM securities are carried at amortized cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts. AFS securities are debt securities that may be sold prior to maturity based upon asset/liability management decisions. Investment securities classified as AFS are carried at fair value with unrealized gains or losses on these securities recorded in AOCI in stockholders&#8217; equity, net of tax. Amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts on MBS is periodically adjusted for estimated prepayments. Trading securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses on these securities included in current period earnings. 

The Company's investment securities portfolio is utilized as collateral for borrowings, required collateral for public deposits and repurchase agreements, and to manage liquidity, capital, and interest rate risk. 

The following table summarizes the carrying value of the Company's investment securities portfolio: 

March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Increase (Decrease) (in millions) Debt securities CLO $ 2,436 &#160; $ 2,706 $ (270) Commercial MBS issued by GSEs 62 &#160; 97 (35) Corporate debt securities 358 &#160; 390 (32) Private label residential MBS 1,370 &#160; 1,397 (27) Residential MBS issued by GSEs 1,788 &#160; 1,740 48 &#160; Tax-exempt 1,990 &#160; 1,982 8 &#160; U.S. Treasury securities 900 &#160; &#8212; 900 &#160; Other 66 &#160; 69 (3) Total debt securities $ 8,970 &#160; $ 8,381 $ 589 &#160; Equity securities Common stock $ 3 &#160; $ 3 $ &#8212; &#160; CRA investments 39 &#160; 49 (10) Preferred stock 99 &#160; 108 (9) Total equity securities $ 141 &#160; $ 160 $ (19) 

Loans HFS 

The Company purchases and originates residential mortgage loans through its AmeriHome mortgage banking business channel that are held for sale or securitization. These loans have historically made up the entire balance of loans HFS. As of March 31, 2023, the loans HFS balance includes $5.9 billion of loans (primarily commercial and industrial loans) that were transferred to HFS, net of a fair value loss adjustment of $123.5 million, as the Company executes its balance sheet repositioning strategy to further strengthen its capital and liquidity position. This transfer of loans that were previously classified as HFI increased the balance of loans HFS to $7.0 billion at March 31, 2023, compared to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2022. 

Loans HFI 

The table below summarizes the distribution of the Company&#8217;s held for investment loan portfolio: 

March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Increase (Decrease) (in millions) Warehouse lending $ 4,788 &#160; $ 5,561 $ (773) Municipal &#38; nonprofit 1,543 &#160; 1,524 19 &#160; Tech &#38; innovation 2,471 &#160; 2,293 178 &#160; Equity fund resources 971 &#160; 3,717 (2,746) Other commercial and industrial 5,912 &#160; 7,793 (1,881) CRE - owner occupied 1,645 &#160; 1,656 (11) Hotel franchise finance 3,900 &#160; 3,807 93 &#160; Other CRE - non-owner occupied 5,650 &#160; 5,457 193 &#160; Residential 13,435 &#160; 13,996 (561) Residential - EBO 1,538 &#160; 1,884 (346) Construction and land development 4,388 &#160; 3,995 393 &#160; Other 194 &#160; 179 15 &#160; Total loans HFI 46,435 &#160; 51,862 (5,427) Allowance for credit losses (305) (310) 5 &#160; Total loans HFI, net of allowance $ 46,130 &#160; $ 51,552 $ (5,422) 

Loans classified as HFI are stated at the amount of unpaid principal, adjusted for net deferred fees and costs, premiums and discounts on acquired and purchased loans, and an ACL. Net deferred loan fees of $126 million and $141 million reduced the carrying value of loans as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Net unamortized purchase premiums on acquired and purchased loans of $191 million and $195 million increased the carrying value of loans as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

Concentrations of Lending Activities 

The Company monitors concentrations of lending activities at the product and borrower relationship level. As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, no borrower relationships at both the commitment and funded loan level exceeded 5% of total loans HFI. 

The Company&#8217;s loan portfolio includes significant credit exposure to the CRE market as CRE related loans accounted for approximately 34% and 29% of total loans at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Approximately $2.5 billion, or 5.5%, of the Company&#8217;s HFI loan portfolio consisted of office loans as of March 31, 2023, compared to $2.4 billion, or 4.6%, as of December 31, 2022. Over 90% of these office loans are considered CRE-non-owner occupied ("CRE-investor") and primarily consist of shorter-term bridge loans that enable borrowers to reposition or redevelop projects with more modern standards attractive to in-office employers in today&#8217;s environment, including enhanced on-site amenities. The vast majority of these projects are located in midtown or suburban locations with Central Business District or downtown exposure totaling less than 15% of office loans. Among the CRE-investor office portfolio, the Company focuses on serving well-understood locations where the Company has an established track record, with the largest MSA exposures in Phoenix (31%), Los Angeles (19%), San Diego (10%), and Las Vegas (8%). Concentration in metropolitan areas generally assumed to be most impacted by &#8220;work-from-home&#8221; trends is limited to less than 15%, which include: San Francisco-Oakland (&#60; 5%), San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara (&#60; 3%), Seattle (&#60;4%) and New York City (&#60;3%). 

The office loan portfolio largely consists of value-add loans that require significant up-front cash equity contributions from institutional sponsors and large regional and national developers. Leverage is low with initial loan-to-value ratios less than 55% and a weighted average loan-to-cost of less than 62% at time of origination. The properties underlying these loans have stable business trends and low vacancy rates. In addition to adhering to conservative underwriting standards, asset-specific credit risk 

is mitigated through continued sponsor support of projects by re-appraisal rights by the Company, re-margining requirements and ongoing debt service, and debt yield covenants. 

Substantially all of the Company's remaining CRE loans are secured by first liens with an initial loan to value ratio of generally not more than 75%. Approximately 16% of these CRE loans, excluding construction and land loans, were owner-occupied at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

In addition, commercial and industrial loans made up 33% and 40% of the Company's HFI loan portfolio as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

Non-performing Assets 

Total non-performing loans increased $40 million to $127 million at March 31, 2023, from $87 million at December 31, 2022. 

March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 (dollars in millions) Total nonaccrual loans (1) $ 107 &#160; $ 85 Loans past due 90 days or more on accrual status (2) 1 &#160; &#8212; Accruing restructured loans 19 &#160; 2 Total nonperforming loans $ 127 &#160; $ 87 Other assets acquired through foreclosure, net $ 11 &#160; $ 11 Nonaccrual loans to funded loans HFI 0.23 &#160; % 0.16 % Loans past due 90 days or more on accrual status to funded loans HFI 0.00 &#160; &#8212; 

(1) Includes loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty of $7 million and TDR loans of $12 million at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

(2) Excludes government guaranteed residential mortgage loans of $495 million and $582 million at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

Interest income that would have been recorded under the original terms of nonaccrual loans was $0.8 million and $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

The composition of nonaccrual loans HFI by loan portfolio segment were as follows: 

March 31, 2023 Nonaccrual Balance Percent of Nonaccrual Balance Percent of Total Loans HFI (dollars in millions) Municipal &#38; nonprofit $ 13 &#160; 12.1 &#160; % 0.03 &#160; % Tech &#38; innovation 9 &#160; 8.4 &#160; 0.02 &#160; Other commercial and industrial 29 &#160; 27.1 &#160; 0.06 &#160; CRE - owner occupied 21 &#160; 19.6 &#160; 0.05 &#160; Other CRE - non-owner occupied 5 &#160; 4.7 &#160; 0.01 &#160; Residential 28 &#160; 26.2 &#160; 0.06 &#160; Construction and land development 2 &#160; 1.9 &#160; 0.00 &#160; Total non-accrual loans $ 107 &#160; 100.0 &#160; % 0.23 &#160; %

Restructurings for Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 

The Company adopted the amendments in ASU 2022-02, which eliminated the accounting guidance on TDR loans for creditors and requires enhanced disclosures for loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that were made on or after January 1, 2023. 

The following table presents the amortized cost of loans HFI that were modified during the period by loan portfolio segment: 

March 31, 2023 Payment Delay and Term Extension Term Extension Payment Delay Total % of Total Class of Financing Receivable (dollars in millions) Tech &#38; innovation $ 2 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 5 &#160; $ 7 &#160; 0.3 &#160; % Hotel franchise finance &#8212; &#160; 18 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 18 &#160; 0.5 &#160; Residential &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total $ 2 &#160; $ 18 &#160; $ 6 &#160; $ 26 &#160; 0.1 &#160; % 

None of the loans that were modified were in payment default and the loans remain current with contractual payments as of March 31, 2023. 

In the normal course of business, the Company also modifies EBO loans, which are delinquent FHA, VA, or USDA insured or guaranteed loans repurchased under the terms of the GNMA MBS program and can be repooled or resold when loans are brought current. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company completed modifications of EBO loans with an amortized cost of $57 million. These modifications were largely payment delays and term extensions, or both. 

Troubled Debt Restructured Loans 

Prior to the adoption of ASU 2022-02, the Company accounted for a modification to the contractual terms of a loan that resulted in granting a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties as a TDR. The loan terms that were modified or restructured due to a borrower&#8217;s financial situation included, but were not limited to, a reduction in the stated interest rate, an extension of the maturity or renewal of the loan at an interest rate below current market, a reduction in the face amount of the debt, a reduction in the accrued interest, or deferral of interest payments. The majority of the Company's modifications were extensions in terms or deferral of payments which resulted in no lost principal or interest. Consistent with regulatory guidance, a TDR loan that was subsequently modified in another restructuring agreement but had shown sustained performance and classification as a TDR, was removed from TDR status provided that the modified terms were market-based at the time of modification. 

The following table presents TDR loans: 

December 31, 2022 Number of Loans Recorded Investment Other commercial and industrial 4 $ 2 CRE - owner occupied 1 1 Hotel franchise finance 1 10 Other CRE - non-owner occupied 1 1 Total 7 $ 14 

As of December 31, 2022, the ACL on TDR loans totaled $4 million and there were no outstanding commitments on TDR loans. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans HFI 

The ACL consists of the ACL on loans and an ACL on unfunded loan commitments. The ACL on AFS and HTM securities is estimated separately from loans and is discussed within the Investment Securities section. 

The following table summarizes the allocation of the ACL on loans HFI by loan portfolio segment: 

March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Allowance for credit losses Percent of total allowance for credit losses Percent of loan type to total loans HFI Allowance for credit losses Percent of total allowance for credit losses Percent of loan type to total loans HFI (dollars in millions) Warehouse lending $ 6.6 &#160; 2.2 &#160; % 10.3 &#160; % $ 8.4 2.7 % 10.7 % Municipal &#38; nonprofit 18.4 &#160; 6.0 &#160; 3.3 &#160; 15.9 5.1 3.0 Tech &#38; innovation 36.4 &#160; 11.9 &#160; 5.3 &#160; 30.8 10.0 4.4 Equity fund resources 3.3 &#160; 1.1 &#160; 2.1 &#160; 6.4 2.1 7.2 Other commercial and industrial 51.1 &#160; 16.8 &#160; 12.8 &#160; 85.9 27.7 15.0 CRE - owner occupied 8.6 &#160; 2.8 &#160; 3.6 &#160; 7.1 2.3 3.2 Hotel franchise finance 47.7 &#160; 15.7 &#160; 8.4 &#160; 46.9 15.2 7.4 Other CRE - non-owner occupied 66.4 &#160; 21.8 &#160; 12.2 &#160; 47.4 15.3 10.5 Residential 31.7 &#160; 10.4 &#160; 28.9 &#160; 30.4 9.8 27.0 Residential - EBO &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3.3 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; 3.6 Construction and land development 31.5 &#160; 10.3 &#160; 9.4 &#160; 27.4 8.8 7.7 Other 3.0 &#160; 1.0 &#160; 0.4 &#160; 3.1 1.0 0.3 Total $ 304.7 &#160; 100.0 &#160; % 100.0 &#160; % $ 309.7 100.0 % 100.0 % 

During the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, net loan charge-offs to average loans outstanding were 0.05% and approximately 0.00%, respectively. 

In addition to the ACL on funded loans HFI, the Company maintains a separate ACL related to off-balance sheet credit exposures, including unfunded loan commitments. This allowance balance totaled $44.8 million and $47.0 million at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and is included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

Problem Loans 

The Company classifies loans consistent with federal banking regulations using a nine category grading system. The following table presents information regarding potential and actual problem loans, consisting of loans graded as Special Mention, Substandard, Doubtful, and Loss, but which are still performing: 

March 31, 2023 Number of Loans Problem Loan Balance Percent of Problem Loan Balance Percent of Total Loans HFI (dollars in millions) Municipal &#38; nonprofit 1 &#160; $ 7 &#160; 1.8 &#160; % 0.01 &#160; % Tech &#38; innovation 19 &#160; 54 &#160; 14.3 &#160; 0.12 &#160; Other commercial and industrial 42 &#160; 32 &#160; 8.5 &#160; 0.07 &#160; CRE - owner occupied 8 &#160; 3 &#160; 0.8 &#160; 0.01 &#160; Hotel franchise finance 1 &#160; 8 &#160; 2.1 &#160; 0.02 &#160; Other CRE - non-owner occupied 11 &#160; 136 &#160; 36.1 &#160; 0.29 &#160; Residential 60 &#160; 30 &#160; 8.0 &#160; 0.06 &#160; Construction and land development 2 &#160; 99 &#160; 26.3 &#160; 0.21 &#160; Other 19 &#160; 8 &#160; 2.1 &#160; 0.02 &#160; Total 163 &#160; $ 377 &#160; 100.0 &#160; % 0.81 &#160; %

Mortgage Servicing Rights 

The fair value of the Company's MSRs related to residential mortgage loans totaled $910 million and $1.1 billion as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The decrease in MSRs is primarily related to sales of MSRs, partially offset by new production. 

The following is a summary of the UPB of loans underlying the Company's MSR portfolio by type: 

March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 (in millions) FNMA and FHLMC $ 42,198 &#160; $ 38,113 GNMA 14,545 &#160; 31,046 Non-agency 1,723 &#160; 1,690 Total unpaid principal balance of loans $ 58,466 &#160; $ 70,849 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

Goodwill represents the excess consideration paid for net assets acquired in a business combination over their fair value. Goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are determined to have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortization, but are subsequently evaluated for impairment at least annually. The Company has goodwill totaling $527 million at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

The Company performs its annual goodwill and intangible assets impairment tests as of October 1 each year, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company evaluated whether the recent events in the banking sector may give rise to a triggering event and elected to perform a Step 0 goodwill impairment assessment, which included analyzing qualitative factors applicable to the Company, the financial performance of the Company, and valuation metrics of publicly traded companies comparable to the Company and its reporting units. As of March 31, 2023, the Company does not believe that these events or circumstances have significantly altered the long-term financial performance of the Company. Accordingly, it was determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Company and its reporting units exceeds their respective carrying values as of March 31, 2023. The Company will continue to monitor developments in the banking industry and the resulting impact on the Company&#8217;s performance to assess whether an interim impairment test of goodwill or other intangible assets may be necessary in subsequent quarters. 

Deferred Tax Assets 

As of March 31, 2023, the net DTA balance totaled $289 million, a decrease of $22 million from $311 million at December 31, 2022. This overall decrease in the net deferred tax asset was primarily the result of increases in the fair market value of AFS securities and a decrease to tax credit carryovers. These items were not fully offset by decreases to DTLs related to mortgage servicing rights. 

At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had no deferred tax valuation allowance. 

Deposits 

Deposits are the primary source for funding the Company's asset growth. Total deposits decreased to $47.6 billion at March 31, 2023, from $53.6 billion at December 31, 2022, a decrease of $6.1 billion, or 11.3%. By deposit type, the decrease in deposits is attributable to decreases in savings and money market accounts of $5.6 billion and non-interest bearing demand deposits of $3.2 billion, partially offset by increases in certificates of deposit of $1.5 billion and interest bearing demand deposits of $1.2 billion. 

WAB is a participant in the IntraFi Network, a network that offers deposit placement services such as CDARS and ICS, and other reciprocal deposit networks which offer products that qualify large deposits for FDIC insurance. At March 31, 2023, the Company had $8.0 billion of reciprocal deposits, compared to $2.8 billion at December 31, 2022. 

Brokered deposits provide an additional source of deposits and are placed with the Bank through third-party brokers. At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company reported wholesale brokered deposits of $8.1 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively. Brokered deposits of $8.1 billion at March 31, 2023 include $3.0 billion of reciprocal deposits that exceeded the $5.0 billion reciprocal deposits reporting exclusion threshold. 

In addition, deposits for which the Company provides account holders with earnings credits or referral fees totaled $13.4 billion and $12.9 billion at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The Company incurred $85.6 million and $8.7 million in deposit related costs on these deposits during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These costs are reported as Deposit costs in non-interest expense. The increase in these costs from the prior year is due to an increase in earnings credit rates as well as an increase in average deposit balances eligible for earnings credits or referral fees. 

The average balances and weighted average rates paid on deposits are presented below: 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 Average Balance Rate Average Balance Rate (dollars in millions) Interest-bearing transaction accounts $ 10,534 &#160; 2.63 &#160; % $ 7,743 0.14 % Savings and money market accounts 18,066 &#160; 2.59 &#160; 18,131 0.21 Certificates of deposit 5,520 &#160; 3.52 &#160; 1,920 0.38 Total interest-bearing deposits 34,120 &#160; 2.75 &#160; 27,794 0.21 Non-interest-bearing demand deposits 20,521 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 22,580 &#8212; Total deposits $ 54,641 &#160; 1.72 &#160; % $ 50,374 0.11 % 

At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company's insured deposits as a percentage of total deposits was 68% and 45%, respectively. The Company's insured deposit ratio further increased to 74% as of May 2, 2023. 

Other Borrowings 

Short-Term Borrowings 

The Company utilizes short-term borrowed funds to support short-term liquidity needs. The majority of these short-term borrowed funds consist of advances from the FHLB, federal funds purchased from correspondent banks or the FHLB, the BTFP, and repurchase agreements. The Company&#8217;s borrowing capacity with the FHLB is determined based on collateral pledged, generally consisting of securities and loans. In addition, the Company has borrowing capacity from other sources, collateralized by securities, including securities sold under agreements to repurchase, which are reflected at the amount of cash received in connection with the transaction, and may require additional collateral based on the fair value of the underlying securities and the BTFP. Total short term borrowings increased $9.8 billion to $14.8 billion at March 31, 2023 from $5.0 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase was driven by increases in FHLB advances of $6.7 billion, securities repurchase agreements of $1.5 billion, BTFP borrowings of $1.3 billion, and $566 million of warehouse borrowings. 

Long-Term Borrowings 

The Company's long-term borrowings consist of AmeriHome senior notes and credit linked notes, inclusive of issuance costs and fair market value adjustments. At March 31, 2023, the carrying value of long-term borrowings was $1.0 billion, compared to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2022. The decrease in long-term borrowings from December 31, 2022 primarily relates to the payoff of the credit linked note on the Company's mortgage warehouse loans during the three months ended March 31, 2023. 

Qualifying Debt 

Qualifying debt consists of subordinated debt and junior subordinated debt, inclusive of issuance costs and fair market value adjustments. At March 31, 2023, the carrying value of qualifying debt was $895 million, compared to $893 million at December 31, 2022. 

Capital Resources 

The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could trigger certain mandatory or discretionary actions that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company&#8217;s business and financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items (discussed in "Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies" to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements) as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. 

As permitted by the regulatory capital rules, the Company elected the CECL transition option that delayed the estimated impact on regulatory capital resulting from the adoption of CECL over a five-year transition period ending December 31, 2024. Accordingly, capital ratios and amounts for 2022 include a 25% reduction to the capital benefit that resulted from the increased ACL related to the adoption of ASC 326, which has increased to include a 50% reduction beginning in 2023. 

As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company and the Bank exceeded the capital levels necessary to be classified as well-capitalized, as defined by the various banking agencies. The actual capital amounts and ratios for the Company and the Bank are presented in the following tables: 

Total Capital Tier 1 Capital Risk-Weighted Assets Tangible Average Assets Total Capital Ratio Tier 1 Capital Ratio Tier 1 Leverage Ratio Common Equity Tier 1 (dollars in millions) March 31, 2023 WAL $ 6,680 &#160; $ 5,535 &#160; $ 54,988 &#160; $ 71,412 &#160; 12.1 &#160; % 10.1 &#160; % 7.8 &#160; % 9.4 &#160; % WAB 6,361 &#160; 5,809 &#160; 54,914 &#160; 71,360 &#160; 11.6 &#160; 10.6 &#160; 8.1 &#160; 10.6 &#160; Well-capitalized ratios 10.0 &#160; 8.0 &#160; 5.0 &#160; 6.5 &#160; Minimum capital ratios 8.0 &#160; 6.0 &#160; 4.0 &#160; 4.5 &#160; December 31, 2022 WAL $ 6,586 $ 5,449 $ 54,461 $ 69,814 12.1 % 10.0 % 7.8 % 9.3 % WAB 6,280 5,737 54,411 69,762 11.5 10.5 8.2 10.5 Well-capitalized ratios 10.0 8.0 5.0 6.5 Minimum capital ratios 8.0 6.0 4.0 4.5 

The Company is also required to maintain specified levels of capital to remain in good standing with certain federal government agencies, including FNMA, FHLMC, GNMA, and HUD. These capital requirements are generally tied to the unpaid balances of loans included in the Company's servicing portfolio or loan production volume. Noncompliance with these capital requirements can result in various remedial actions up to, and including, removing the Company's ability to sell loans to and service loans on behalf of the respective agency. The Company believes that it is in compliance with these requirements as of March 31, 2023. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The critical accounting estimates upon which the Company's financial condition and results of operations depend, and which involve the most complex subjective decisions or assessments, are included in the discussion entitled "Critical Accounting Policies" in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, and all amendments thereto, as filed with the SEC. There were no material changes to the critical accounting policies disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Liquidity 

Liquidity is the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, fund asset growth and business operations, and meet contractual obligations through unconstrained access to funding at reasonable market rates. Liquidity management involves forecasting funding requirements and maintaining sufficient capacity to meet the needs and accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to changes in the Company's business operations or unanticipated events. 

The ability to have readily available funds sufficient to repay fully maturing liabilities is of primary importance to depositors, creditors, and regulators. The Company's liquidity, represented by cash and amounts due from banks, federal funds sold, loans HFS, and non-pledged marketable securities, is a result of the Company's operating, investing, and financing activities and related cash flows. The Company actively monitors and manages liquidity, and no less than quarterly will estimate probable liquidity needs on a 12-month horizon. Liquidity needs can also be met through short-term borrowings or the disposition of short-term assets. 

The following table presents the available and outstanding balances on the Company's lines of credit as of March 31, 2023: 

March 31, 2023 Available Balance Outstanding Balance (in millions) Unsecured fed funds credit lines at correspondent banks $ 1,084 &#160; $ 400 &#160; 

In addition to lines of credit, the Company has borrowing capacity with the FHLB and FRB from pledged loans and securities and warehouse borrowing lines of credit. The borrowing capacity, outstanding borrowings, and available credit as of March 31, 2023 are presented in the following table: 

March 31, 2023 (in millions) FHLB: Borrowing capacity $ 11,870 &#160; Outstanding borrowings 11,000 &#160; Letters of credit 194 &#160; Total available credit $ 676 &#160; FRB: Borrowing capacity $ 17,947 &#160; Outstanding borrowings (BTFP) 1,300 &#160; Total available credit $ 16,647 &#160; Warehouse borrowings: Borrowing capacity $ 1,000 &#160; Outstanding borrowings 566 &#160; Total available credit $ 434 &#160; 

The Company has a formal liquidity policy and, in the opinion of management, its liquid assets are considered adequate to meet cash flow needs for loan funding and deposit cash withdrawals for the next 90-120 days. At March 31, 2023, there were $5.7 billion in liquid assets, comprised of $3.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $1.0 billion in loans HFS, and $1.1 billion in unpledged marketable securities. At December 31, 2022, the Company maintained $7.7 billion in liquid assets, comprised of $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $1.1 billion in loans HFS, and $5.5 billion of unpledged marketable securities. 

The Parent maintains liquidity that would be sufficient to fund its operations and certain non-bank affiliate operations for an extended period should funding from normal sources be disrupted. In the Company's analysis of Parent liquidity, it is assumed that the Parent is unable to generate funds from additional debt or equity issuances, receives no dividend income from subsidiaries and does not pay dividends to stockholders, while continuing to make non-discretionary payments needed to maintain operations and repayment of contractual principal and interest payments owed by the Parent and affiliated companies. Under this scenario, the amount of time the Parent and its non-bank subsidiary can operate and meet all obligations before the current liquid assets are exhausted is considered as part of the Parent liquidity analysis. Management believes the Parent maintains adequate liquidity capacity to operate without additional funding from new sources for over twelve months. 

WAB maintains sufficient funding capacity to address large increases in funding requirements, such as deposit outflows. This capacity is comprised of liquidity derived from a reduction in asset levels and various secured funding sources. On a long-term basis, the Company&#8217;s liquidity will be met by changing the relative distribution of its asset portfolios (for example, by reducing investment or loan volumes, or selling or encumbering assets). Further, the Company can increase liquidity by soliciting higher levels of deposit accounts through promotional activities and/or borrowing from correspondent banks, the FHLB of San Francisco, and the FRB. At March 31, 2023, the Company's long-term liquidity needs primarily relate to funds required to support loan originations, commitments, and deposit withdrawals, which can be met by cash flows from investment payments and maturities, and investment sales, if necessary. 

The Company&#8217;s liquidity is comprised of three primary classifications: 1) cash flows provided by operating activities; 2) cash flows used in investing activities; and 3) cash flows provided by financing activities. Net cash provided by or used in operating activities consists primarily of net income, adjusted for changes in certain other asset and liability accounts and certain non-cash income and expense items, such as the provision for credit losses, investment and other amortization and depreciation. For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, net cash provided by operating activities was $357.3 million and $622.9 million, respectively. 

The Company's primary investing activities are the origination of real estate and commercial loans, the collection of repayments of these loans, and the purchase and sale of securities. The Company's net cash provided by and used in investing activities has been primarily influenced by its loan and securities activities. The Company's cash balance during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 was reduced by $1.0 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, as a result of a net increase in loans, excluding non-cash transfers of loans from HFI to HFS, as well as a net increase in investment securities of $478 million and $518 million, respectively. 

Net cash provided by financing activities has been impacted significantly by deposit levels. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, net deposits decreased $6.1 billion, compared to an increase in net deposits of $4.5 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2022. 

Fluctuations in core deposit levels may increase the Company's need for liquidity as certificates of deposit mature or are withdrawn before maturity, and as non-maturity deposits, such as checking and savings account balances, are withdrawn. Additionally, the Company is exposed to the risk that customers with large deposit balances will withdraw all or a portion of such deposits, due in part to the FDIC limitations on the amount of insurance coverage provided to depositors. To mitigate the uninsured deposit risk, the Company participates in the CDARS and ICS programs, which allow an individual customer to invest up to $50.0 million and $150.0 million, respectively, through one participating financial institution or, a combined total of $200.0 million per individual customer, with the entire amount being covered by FDIC insurance. As of March 31, 2023, the Company had $8.0 billion of total reciprocal deposits. 

As of March 31, 2023, the Company has $8.1 billion of wholesale brokered deposits outstanding. Brokered deposits are generally considered to be deposits that have been received from a third party who is engaged in the business of placing deposits on behalf of others. A traditional deposit broker will direct deposits to the banking institution offering the highest interest rate available. Federal banking laws and regulations place restrictions on depository institutions regarding brokered deposits because of the general concern that these deposits are not relationship based and are at a greater risk of being withdrawn and placed on deposit at another institution offering a higher interest rate, thus posing liquidity risk for institutions that gather brokered deposits in significant amounts. As of March 31, 2023, $3.0 billion of reciprocal deposits were included as brokered deposits as these deposits exceeded the $5 billion threshold for exclusion from brokered deposits. 

Federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid. The total amount of dividends which may be paid at any date is generally limited to the retained earnings of the bank. Dividends paid by WAB to the Parent would be prohibited if the effect thereof would cause the Bank&#8217;s capital to be reduced below applicable minimum capital requirements. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, WAB and CSI paid dividends to the Parent of $55 million and $100 million, respectively.

Supervision and Regulation

Bank Term Funding Program 

In response to recent bank failures, the Federal Reserve System has established a BTFP, which is intended to provide additional funding to eligible depository institutions to help assure banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors. The BTFP offers loans of up to one year in length to eligible depository institutions pledging any collateral eligible for purchase by the Federal Reserve Banks in open market operations (for example, U.S. Treasuries, U.S. agency securities, and U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities), which will be valued at par. The U.S. Department of the Treasury will provide $25 billion as credit protection to the Federal Reserve Banks in connection with the BTFP. The goal of the BTFP is to be an additional source of liquidity against high-quality securities, eliminating an institution&#8217;s need to quickly sell those securities in times of stress. The Company has borrowings under the BTFP that totaled $1.3 billion as of March 31, 2023.
