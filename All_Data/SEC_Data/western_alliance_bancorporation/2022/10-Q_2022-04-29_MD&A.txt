Recent Developments: Acquisition of Digital Disbursements 

On January 25, 2022, the Company completed its acquisition of Digital Settlement Technologies LLC, doing business as Digital Disbursements, a digital payments platform for the class action legal industry. DST's proprietary platform enables claimants to select their payment method, including direct-to-bank account options and popular digital wallets. This provides the Company with the internal capability to significantly increase efficacy, reduce distribution costs and improve potential fraud detection for the legal class action market. The acquisition is expected to grow the Company's deposit base and continue to extend the suite of legal banking services offered while serving adjacent sectors that will benefit from digital payments technology.

Asset Quality 

For all banks and bank holding companies, asset quality plays a significant role in the overall financial condition of the institution and results of operations. The Company measures asset quality in terms of nonaccrual loans as a percentage of gross loans and net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans. Net charge-offs are calculated as the difference between charged-off loans and recovery payments received on previously charged-off loans. The following table summarizes the Company's key asset quality metrics for HFI loans: 

March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (dollars in millions) Nonaccrual loans $ 91.0 &#160; $ 72.6 Repossessed assets 11.7 &#160; 11.7 Non-performing assets 105.6 &#160; 87.3 Nonaccrual loans to funded loans 0.22 &#160; % 0.19 % Nonaccrual and repossessed assets to total assets 0.17 &#160; 0.15 Allowance for loan losses to funded loans 0.63 &#160; 0.65 Allowance for credit losses to funded loans 0.73 &#160; 0.74 Net charge-offs to average loans outstanding (1) 0.00 &#160; 0.02 

(1) Annualized on an actual/actual basis for the three months ended March 31, 2022. Actual year-to-date for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Asset and Deposit Growth 

The Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities are comprised primarily of loans and deposits. Therefore, the ability to originate new loans and attract new deposits is fundamental to the Company&#8217;s growth. 

Total assets increased to $60.6 billion at March 31, 2022 from $56.0 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase in total assets of $4.6 billion, or 8.2%, was driven by continued organic loan and deposit growth, which contributed to an increase in cash of $2.1 billion as well as an increase in investment securities of $725.5 million. HFI loans increased by $2.0 billion, or 5.2%, to $41.1 billion as of March 31, 2022, compared to $39.1 billion as of December 31, 2021. The increase in HFI loans from December 31, 2021 was driven by increases in residential real estate loans of $2.0 billion, CRE, non-owner occupied loans of $323.2 million, and construction and land development loans of $255.0 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases in commercial and industrial loans of $435.6 million and CRE, owner occupied loans of $92.7 million. In addition, HFS loans decreased by $873.5 million, from $5.6 billion as of December 31, 2021. 

Total deposits increased $4.5 billion, or 9.6%, to $52.2 billion as of March 31, 2022 from $47.6 billion as of December 31, 2021. The increase in deposits from December 31, 2021 was driven by increases of $2.2 billion in non-interest bearing demand deposits, $1.3 billion in interest bearing demand deposits, and $1.3 billion in savings and money market accounts. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in certificates of deposit of $237.7 million. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following table sets forth a summary financial overview for the comparable periods: 

Three Months Ended March 31, Increase 2022 2021 (Decrease) (in millions, except per share amounts) Consolidated Income Statement Data: Interest income $ 484.5 &#160; $ 334.1 $ 150.4 &#160; Interest expense 35.0 &#160; 16.8 18.2 &#160; Net interest income 449.5 &#160; 317.3 132.2 &#160; Provision for (recovery of) credit losses 9.0 &#160; (32.4) 41.4 &#160; Net interest income after provision for (recovery of) credit losses 440.5 &#160; 349.7 90.8 &#160; Non-interest income 106.3 &#160; 19.7 86.6 &#160; Non-interest expense 248.6 &#160; 135.0 113.6 &#160; Income before provision for income taxes 298.2 &#160; 234.4 63.8 &#160; Income tax expense 58.1 &#160; 41.9 16.2 &#160; Net income 240.1 &#160; 192.5 47.6 &#160; Dividends on preferred stock 3.2 &#160; &#8212; 3.2 &#160; Net income available to common stockholders $ 236.9 &#160; $ 192.5 $ 44.4 &#160; Earnings per share: Basic $ 2.23 &#160; $ 1.91 $ 0.32 &#160; Diluted 2.22 &#160; 1.90 0.32 &#160; 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

The following discussion and analysis contains financial information determined by methods other than those prescribed by GAAP. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in their analysis of the Company's performance. Management believes presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a complete understanding of the operating results of the Company. Since the presentation of these non-GAAP performance measures and their impact differ between companies, these non-GAAP disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. 

Pre-Provision Net Revenue 

Banking regulations define PPNR as the sum of net interest income and non-interest income less expenses before adjusting for loss provisions. Management believes that this is an important metric as it illustrates the underlying performance of the Company, it enables investors and others to assess the Company's ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through the credit cycle, and provides consistent reporting with a key metric used by bank regulatory agencies. 

The following table shows the components of PPNR for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021: 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 2021 (in millions) Net interest income $ 449.5 &#160; $ 317.3 Total non-interest income 106.3 &#160; 19.7 Net revenue $ 555.8 &#160; $ 337.0 Total non-interest expense 248.6 &#160; 135.0 Pre-provision net revenue $ 307.2 &#160; $ 202.0 Less: Provision for (recovery of) credit losses 9.0 &#160; (32.4) Income tax expense 58.1 &#160; 41.9 Net income $ 240.1 &#160; $ 192.5 

Efficiency Ratio 

The following table shows the components used in the calculation of the efficiency ratio, which management uses as a metric for assessing cost efficiency: 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 2021 (dollars in millions) Total non-interest expense $ 248.6 &#160; $ 135.0 Divided by: Total net interest income $ 449.5 &#160; $ 317.3 Plus: Tax equivalent interest adjustment 8.0 &#160; 8.0 Total non-interest income 106.3 &#160; 19.7 $ 563.8 &#160; $ 345.0 Efficiency ratio - tax equivalent basis 44.1 &#160; % 39.1 % 

Tangible Common Equity 

The following table presents financial measures related to tangible common equity. Tangible common equity represents total stockholders' equity, less identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. Management believes that tangible common equity financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company's capital strength, financial condition, and ability to manage potential losses. In addition, management believes that these measures improve comparability to other institutions that have not engaged in acquisitions that resulted in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets. 

March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (dollars and shares in millions) Total stockholders' equity $ 5,011.6 &#160; $ 4,962.6 Less: Goodwill and intangible assets 698.2 &#160; 634.8 Preferred stock 294.5 &#160; 294.5 Total tangible common stockholders' equity 4,018.9 &#160; 4,033.3 Plus: deferred tax - attributed to intangible assets 2.0 &#160; 1.9 Total tangible common equity, net of tax $ 4,020.9 &#160; $ 4,035.2 Total assets $ 60,576.1 &#160; $ 55,982.6 Less: goodwill and intangible assets, net 698.2 &#160; 634.8 Tangible assets 59,877.9 &#160; 55,347.8 Plus: deferred tax - attributed to intangible assets 2.0 &#160; 1.9 Total tangible assets, net of tax $ 59,879.9 &#160; $ 55,349.7 Tangible common equity ratio 6.7 &#160; % 7.3 % Common shares outstanding 108.3 &#160; 106.6 Book value per common share $ 43.56 &#160; $ 43.78 Tangible book value per common share, net of tax 37.13 &#160; 37.84 

Regulatory Capital 

The following table presents certain financial measures related to regulatory capital under Basel III, which includes common equity tier 1 and total capital. The FRB and other banking regulators use CET1 and total capital as a basis for assessing a bank's capital adequacy; therefore, management believes it is useful to assess financial condition and capital adequacy using this same basis. Specifically, the total capital ratio takes into consideration the risk levels of assets and off-balance sheet financial instruments. In addition, management believes that the classified assets to CET1 plus allowance measure is an important regulatory metric for assessing asset quality. 

As permitted by the regulatory capital rules, the Company elected to delay the estimated impact of CECL on its regulatory capital over a five-year transition period ending December 31, 2024. Beginning as of March 31, 2022, capital ratios and amounts include a 25% reduction to the capital benefit that resulted from the increased allowance for credit losses related to the adoption of ASC 326. 

March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (dollars in millions) Common equity tier 1: Common equity $ 4,752.6 &#160; $ 4,715.4 Less: Non-qualifying goodwill and intangibles 694.0 &#160; 631.3 Disallowed deferred tax asset 1.8 &#160; &#8212; AOCI related adjustments (236.6) 16.4 Unrealized gain on changes in fair value liabilities 1.5 &#160; (0.7) Common equity tier 1 $ 4,291.9 &#160; $ 4,068.4 Divided by: Risk-weighted assets $ 47,772.1 &#160; $ 44,697.0 Common equity tier 1 ratio 9.0 &#160; % 9.1 % Common equity tier 1 $ 4,291.9 &#160; $ 4,068.4 Plus: Preferred stock and trust preferred securities 376.0 &#160; 375.9 Tier 1 capital $ 4,667.9 &#160; $ 4,444.3 Divided by: Tangible average assets $ 58,687.4 &#160; $ 56,972.9 Tier 1 leverage ratio 8.0 &#160; % 7.8 % Total capital: Tier 1 capital $ 4,667.9 &#160; $ 4,444.3 Plus: Subordinated debt 815.5 &#160; 815.1 Adjusted allowances for credit losses 262.3 &#160; 239.6 Tier 2 capital $ 1,077.8 &#160; $ 1,054.7 Total capital $ 5,745.7 &#160; $ 5,499.0 Total capital ratio 12.0 &#160; % 12.3 % Classified assets to tier 1 capital plus allowance: Classified assets $ 365.1 &#160; $ 300.7 Divided by: Tier 1 capital 4,667.9 &#160; 4,444.3 Plus: Adjusted allowances for credit losses 262.3 &#160; 239.6 Total Tier 1 capital plus adjusted allowances for credit losses $ 4,930.2 &#160; $ 4,683.9 Classified assets to tier 1 capital plus allowance 7.4 &#160; % 6.4 % 

Net Interest Margin 

The net interest margin is reported on a TEB. A tax equivalent adjustment is added to reflect interest earned on certain securities and loans that are exempt from federal and state income tax. The following tables set forth the average balances, interest income, interest expense, and average yield (on a fully TEB) for the periods indicated:

Comparison of interest income, interest expense and net interest margin 

The Company's primary source of revenue is interest income. For the three months ended March 31, 2022, interest income was $484.5 million, an increase of $150.4 million, or 45.0%, compared to $334.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. This increase was primarily the result of an $85.9 million increase in interest income from HFI loans that was driven by a $12.8 billion increase in the average HFI loan balance, coupled with an increase of interest income from HFS loans of $50.4 million. Interest income from investment securities also increased by $14.0 million for the comparable period due to an increase in the average investment balance of $1.2 billion. 

For the three months ended March 31, 2022, interest expense was $35.0 million, an increase of $18.2 million, or 108.3%, compared to $16.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in borrowings resulting from the AmeriHome acquisition, combined with the issuance of $600.0 million in subordinated debt and $469.6 million in credit linked notes in 2021. 

For the three months ended March 31, 2022, net interest income was $449.5 million, an increase of $132.2 million, or 41.7%, compared to $317.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The increase in net interest income reflects a $16.7 billion increase in average interest-earning assets, partially offset by an increase of $10.5 billion in average interest-bearing liabilities. The decrease in net interest margin of 5 basis points to 3.32% is largely the result of a decrease in loan yields due to a loan portfolio shift towards residential mortgage loans and higher borrowing costs. The decrease to net interest margin was partially offset by higher investment yields compared to the same period in 2021. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses in each period is reflected as a reduction in earnings for that period and includes amounts related to funded loans, unfunded loan commitments, and investment securities. The provision is equal to the amount required to maintain the allowance for credit losses at a level that is adequate to absorb estimated lifetime credit losses inherent in the loan and investment securities portfolios at the time that the loan is originated or the security is purchased. The Company's CECL models incorporate historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts in measuring expected credit losses. For the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $9.0 million, compared to a release of credit loss provisions of $32.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The increase in the provision for credit losses from the three months ended March 31, 2021 is primarily related to loan growth. 

Non-interest Income 

The following table presents a summary of non-interest income for the periods presented: 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) (in millions) Net loan servicing revenue $ 41.1 &#160; $ &#8212; $ 41.1 &#160; Net gain on loan origination and sale activities 36.9 &#160; &#8212; 36.9 &#160; Service charges and fees 7.0 &#160; 6.7 0.3 &#160; Gain on sales of investment securities 6.9 &#160; 0.1 6.8 &#160; Commercial banking related income 5.1 &#160; 3.4 1.7 &#160; Income from equity investments 4.1 &#160; 7.6 (3.5) Gain on recovery from credit guarantees 2.3 &#160; &#8212; 2.3 &#160; Fair value loss on assets measured at fair value, net (6.6) (1.5) (5.1) Other income 9.5 &#160; 3.4 6.1 &#160; Total non-interest income $ 106.3 &#160; $ 19.7 $ 86.6 &#160; 

Total non-interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 increased $86.6 million. The increase in non-interest income was driven by mortgage banking revenue as net loan servicing revenue and net gain on loan purchase, origination, and sale activities totaled $41.1 million and $36.9 million, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2022. 

Non-interest Expense 

The following table presents a summary of non-interest expense for the periods presented: 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) (in millions) Salaries and employee benefits $ 138.3 &#160; $ 83.7 $ 54.6 &#160; Legal, professional, and directors' fees 24.0 &#160; 10.1 13.9 &#160; Data processing 17.6 &#160; 9.9 7.7 &#160; Occupancy 12.8 &#160; 8.6 4.2 &#160; Loan servicing expenses 10.8 &#160; &#8212; 10.8 &#160; Deposit costs 9.3 &#160; 6.3 3.0 &#160; Insurance 7.2 &#160; 4.2 3.0 &#160; Loan acquisition and origination expenses 6.5 &#160; &#8212; 6.5 &#160; Business development and marketing 4.4 &#160; 1.4 3.0 &#160; Net loss (gain) on sales and valuations of repossessed and other assets 0.1 &#160; (0.3) 0.4 &#160; Acquisition and restructure expenses 0.4 &#160; 0.4 &#8212; &#160; Other expense 17.2 &#160; 10.7 6.5 &#160; Total non-interest expense 248.6 &#160; 135.0 113.6 &#160; 

Total non-interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2022 increased $113.6 million compared to the same period in 2021. The increase in non-interest expense was driven by the AmeriHome acquisition, which contributed to the increase in salaries and employee benefits of $54.6 million from the addition of approximately 1,000 employees and also the addition of expenses associated with mortgage banking activities, including loan servicing expenses of $10.8 million and loan acquisition 

and origination expenses of $6.5 million. In addition, the Company recognized increases in legal, professional, and directors' fees of $13.9 million and data processing expenses of $7.7 million, which were primarily related to an increase in IT and consulting initiatives as well as the integration of AmeriHome. 

Income Taxes 

The Company's effective tax rate was 19.5% and 17.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to projected pretax book income growth outpacing growth in permanent tax benefit items for the year and an increase in state tax expense.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS 

Total assets increased $4.6 billion, or 8.2%, to $60.6 billion at March 31, 2022, compared to $56.0 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase in total assets was driven by continued organic loan and deposit growth, which contributed to an increase in cash of $2.1 billion as well as an increase in investment securities. HFI loans increased by $2.0 billion, or 5.2%, to $41.1 billion as of March 31, 2022, compared to $39.1 billion as of December 31, 2021. The increase in HFI loans from December 31, 2021 was driven by increases in residential real estate loans of $2.0 billion, CRE, non-owner occupied loans of $323.2 million, and construction and land development loans of $255.0 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases in commercial and industrial loans of $435.6 million and CRE, owner occupied loans of $92.7 million. In addition, HFS loans decreased by $873.5 million, down from $5.6 billion as of December 31, 2021. 

Total liabilities increased $4.5 billion, or 8.9%, to $55.6 billion at March 31, 2022, compared to $51.0 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase in liabilities is due primarily to an increase in total deposits of $4.5 billion, or 9.6%, to $52.2 billion. The increase in deposits from December 31, 2021 was driven by increases of $2.2 billion in non-interest bearing demand deposits, $1.3 billion in interest bearing demand deposits, and $1.3 billion in savings and money market accounts. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in certificates of deposit of $237.7 million. Other borrowings also decreased $668.6 million due to a decrease in overnight borrowings of $675.0 million. 

Total stockholders&#8217; equity $5.0 billion at March 31, 2022 increased by $49.0 million, or 1.0%, from December 31, 2021. The increase in stockholders' equity is primarily a function of net income and net proceeds of $107.7 million from issuance of common stock during the three months ended March 31, 2022, partially offset by quarterly dividends to shareholders and unrealized losses on AFS securities, net of tax, of $247.9 million recorded in other comprehensive income. 

Investment securities 

Debt securities are classified at the time of acquisition as either HTM, AFS, or trading based upon various factors, including asset/liability management strategies, liquidity and profitability objectives, and regulatory requirements. HTM securities are carried at amortized cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts. AFS securities are securities that may be sold prior to maturity based upon asset/liability management decisions. Investment securities classified as AFS are carried at fair value with unrealized gains or losses on these securities recorded as part of AOCI in stockholders&#8217; equity, net of tax. Amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts on MBS is periodically adjusted for estimated prepayments. Trading securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses on these securities included in current period earnings. 

The Company's investment securities portfolio is utilized as collateral for borrowings, required collateral for public deposits and customer repurchase agreements, and to manage liquidity, capital, and interest rate risk. 

The following table summarizes the carrying value of the investment securities portfolio for each of the periods below:

Loans HFS 

The Company began acquiring loans held for sale through the AmeriHome acquisition and as part of its ongoing mortgage banking business, the Company continues to purchase residential mortgage loans for sale or securitization. At March 31, 2022, the Company had $4.8 billion of loans HFS, compared to $5.6 billion at December 31, 2021.

Loans classified as HFI are stated at the amount of unpaid principal, adjusted for net deferred fees and costs, premiums and discounts on acquired and purchased loans, and an allowance for credit losses. Net deferred loan fees of $92.5 million and $85.7 million reduced the carrying value of loans as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Net unamortized purchase premiums on acquired and purchased loans of $205.8 million and $184.8 million increased the carrying value of loans as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

Concentrations of Lending Activities 

The Company monitors concentrations of lending activities at the product and borrower relationship level. The Company&#8217;s loan portfolio includes significant credit exposure to the CRE market. Commercial and industrial loans made up 43% and 47% of the Company's HFI loan portfolio as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. In addition, CRE related loans accounted for approximately 29% of total loans at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Substantially all of these CRE loans are secured by first liens with an initial loan to value ratio of generally not more than 75%. Approximately 21% and 23% of these CRE loans, excluding construction and land loans, were owner-occupied at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. No borrower relationships at both the commitment and funded loan level exceeded 5% of total HFI loans as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

Non-performing Assets 

Total non-performing loans increased by $18.3 million at March 31, 2022 to $93.9 million from $75.6 million at December 31, 2021.

Troubled Debt Restructured Loans 

A TDR loan is a loan on which the Company, for reasons related to a borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that the Company would not otherwise consider. The loan terms that have been modified or restructured due to a borrower&#8217;s financial situation include, but are not limited to, a reduction in the stated interest rate, an extension of the maturity or renewal of the loan at an interest rate below current market, a reduction in the face amount of the debt, a reduction in the accrued interest, or deferral of interest payments. The majority of the Company's modifications are extensions in terms or deferral of payments which result in no lost principal or interest followed by reductions in interest rates or accrued interest. Consistent with regulatory guidance, a TDR loan that is subsequently modified in another restructuring agreement but has shown sustained performance and classification as a TDR, will be removed from TDR status provided that the modified terms were market-based at the time of modification. 

The following table presents TDR loans:

The allowance for credit losses on TDR loans totaled $1.0 million and zero as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. As of March 31, 2022, outstanding commitments on TDR loans totaled $4.0 million. There were no outstanding commitments on TDR loans as of December 31, 2021. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on HFI Loans 

The allowance for credit losses consists of the allowance for credit losses on loans and an allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments. The allowance for credit losses on HTM securities is estimated separately from loans and is discussed within the Investment Securities section. 

The following table summarizes the allocation of the allowance for credit losses on HFI loans by loan portfolio segment:

During the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, net loan charge-offs to average loans outstanding was approximately 0.00% and 0.02%, respectively. 

In addition to the allowance for credit losses on funded HFI loans, the Company maintains a separate allowance for credit losses related to off-balance sheet credit exposures, including unfunded loan commitments. This allowance balance totaled $43.3 million and $37.6 million at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, and is included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Problem Loans 

The Company classifies loans consistent with federal banking regulations using a nine category grading system. These loan grades are described in further detail in "Note 1.

Mortgage Servicing Rights 

The fair value of the Company's MSRs related to residential mortgage loans totaled $950.3 million as of March 31, 2022. 

The following is a summary of the UPB of loans underlying in the Company's MSR portfolio by type: 

March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (in millions) FNMA and FHLMC $ 45,495.2 &#160; $ 38,753.9 GNMA 18,732.5 &#160; 14,379.3 Non-agency 1,319.0 &#160; 1,214.4 Total unpaid principal balance of loans $ 65,546.7 &#160; $ 54,347.6 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

Goodwill represents the excess consideration paid for net assets acquired in a business combination over their fair value. Goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are determined to have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortization, but are subsequently evaluated for impairment at least annually. The Company has goodwill totaling $529.8 million at March 31, 2022. The increase from $491.3 million at December 31, 2021 is attributable to the DST acquisition in January 2022. See "Note 2. Mergers, Acquisitions and Dispositions" for further discussion of the acquisition. 

The Company performs its annual goodwill and intangibles impairment tests as of October 1 each year, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. During the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no events or circumstances that indicated an interim impairment test of goodwill or other intangible assets was necessary. 

Deferred Tax Assets 

As of March 31, 2022, the net DTA balance totaled $67.6 million, an increase of $46.7 million from $20.9 million at December 31, 2021. This overall increase in the net DTA was primarily the result of decreases in the fair market value of AFS securities, which were not fully offset by increases to MSRs. 

At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had no deferred tax valuation allowance. 

Deposits 

Deposits are the primary source for funding the Company's asset growth. Total deposits increased to $52.2 billion at March 31, 2022, from $47.6 billion at December 31, 2021, an increase of $4.5 billion, or 9.6%. By deposit type, the increase in deposits is primarily attributable to increases in non-interest bearing demand deposits of $2.2 billion, interest bearing demand deposits of $1.3 billion, and savings and money market accounts of $1.3 billion. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in certificates of deposit of $237.7 million. 

WAB is a participant in the IntraFi Network, a network that offers deposit placement services such as CDARS and ICS, which offer products that qualify large deposits for FDIC insurance. At March 31, 2022, the Company had $710.3 million of CDARS deposits and $2.0 billion of ICS deposits, compared to $729.2 million of CDARS deposits and $1.8 billion of ICS deposits at December 31, 2021. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company also had wholesale brokered deposits of $2.5 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. 

In addition, deposits for which the Company provides account holders with earnings credits or referral fees totaled $13.1 billion and $10.8 billion at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The Company incurred $8.7 million and $5.8 million in deposit related costs on these deposits during the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These costs are reported in Deposit costs as part of non-interest expense. The increase in these costs from the prior year is due to an increase in deposit balances eligible for earnings credits or referral fees. 

The average balances and weighted average rates paid on deposits are presented below: 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 2021 Average Balance Rate Average Balance Rate (dollars in millions) Interest-bearing transaction accounts $ 7,743.1 &#160; 0.14 &#160; % $ 3,905.4 0.13 % Savings and money market accounts 18,131.0 &#160; 0.21 &#160; 13,994.4 0.21 Certificates of deposit 1,920.2 &#160; 0.38 &#160; 1,681.1 0.59 Total interest-bearing deposits 27,794.3 &#160; 0.21 &#160; 19,580.9 0.22 Non-interest-bearing demand deposits 22,580.0 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 15,972.6 &#8212; Total deposits $ 50,374.3 &#160; 0.11 &#160; % $ 35,553.5 0.12 % 

Other Borrowings 

Short-Term Borrowings 

The Company utilizes short-term borrowed funds to support short-term liquidity needs generally created by increased loan demand. The majority of these short-term borrowed funds consist of advances from the FHLB, federal funds purchased from correspondent banks or the FHLB, and customer repurchase agreements. The Company&#8217;s borrowing capacity with the FHLB is determined based on collateral pledged, generally consisting of securities and loans. In addition, the Company has borrowing capacity from other sources, collateralized by securities, including securities sold under agreements to repurchase, which are reflected at the amount of cash received in connection with the transaction, and may require additional collateral based on the fair value of the underlying securities. At March 31, 2022, total short-term borrowed funds consisted of secured borrowings of $52.3 million and customer repurchase agreements of $18.0 million. At December 31, 2021, total short-term borrowed funds consisted of federal funds purchased of $675.0 million, secured borrowings of $35.3 million, and customer repurchase agreements of $16.6 million. 

Long-Term Borrowings 

The Company's long-term borrowings consist of AmeriHome senior notes from the acquisition on April 7, 2021 and credit linked notes issued during the year ended December 31, 2021, inclusive of issuance costs and fair market value adjustments. At March 31, 2022, the carrying value of long-term borrowings was $763.0 million, compared to $775.0 million at December 31, 2021. 

Qualifying Debt 

Qualifying debt consists of subordinated debt and junior subordinated debt, inclusive of issuance costs and fair market value adjustments. At March 31, 2022, the carrying value of qualifying debt was $893.3 million, compared to $895.8 million at December 31, 2021. 

Capital Resources 

The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could trigger certain mandatory or discretionary actions that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company&#8217;s business and financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items (discussed in "Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies" to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements) as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. 

In connection with its adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, the Company elected the five-year CECL transition option that delayed the estimated impact on regulatory capital resulting from the adoption of CECL. As a result of this election, the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital relative to regulatory capital determined under the prior incurred loss methodology was delayed for two years, followed by a three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of capital benefit provided during the initial two-year delay. Beginning as of March 31, 2022, capital ratios and amounts include a 25% reduction to the capital benefit that resulted from the increased allowance for credit losses related to the adoption of ASC 326. 

As a result of the Company's continued commercial loan growth and the acquisition of AmeriHome, the Company continues to undertake various capital actions to ensure that its capital levels remain strong, which during the three months ended March 31, 2022, included sales of common stock under the Company's ATM program. As of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company and the Bank exceeded the capital levels necessary to be classified as well-capitalized, as defined by the various banking agencies. The actual capital amounts and ratios for the Company and the Bank are presented in the following tables as of the periods indicated: 

Total Capital Tier 1 Capital Risk-Weighted Assets Tangible Average Assets Total Capital Ratio Tier 1 Capital Ratio Tier 1 Leverage Ratio Common Equity Tier 1 (dollars in millions) March 31, 2022 WAL $ 5,745.7 &#160; $ 4,667.9 &#160; $ 47,772.1 &#160; $ 58,687.4 &#160; 12.0 &#160; % 9.8 &#160; % 8.0 &#160; % 9.0 &#160; % WAB 5,393.0 &#160; 4,907.8 &#160; 47,728.8 &#160; 58,689.3 &#160; 11.3 &#160; 10.3 &#160; 8.4 &#160; 10.3 &#160; Well-capitalized ratios 10.0 &#160; 8.0 &#160; 5.0 &#160; 6.5 &#160; Minimum capital ratios 8.0 &#160; 6.0 &#160; 4.0 &#160; 4.5 &#160; December 31, 2021 WAL $ 5,499.0 $ 4,444.3 $ 44,697.0 $ 56,972.9 12.3 % 9.9 % 7.8 % 9.1 % WAB 5,119.9 4,657.5 44,726.1 56,961.6 11.4 10.4 8.2 10.4 Well-capitalized ratios 10.0 8.0 5.0 6.5 Minimum capital ratios 8.0 6.0 4.0 4.5 

With the acquisition of AmeriHome, the Company is also required to maintain specified levels of capital to remain in good standing with certain federal government agencies, including FNMA, FHLMC, GNMA, and HUD. These capital requirements are generally tied to the unpaid balances of loans included in the Company's servicing portfolio or loan production volume. Noncompliance with these capital requirements can result in various remedial actions up to, and including, removing the Company's ability to sell loans to and service loans on behalf of the respective agency. The Company believes that it is in compliance with these requirements as of March 31, 2022. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The critical accounting estimates upon which the Company's financial condition and results of operations depend, and which involve the most complex subjective decisions or assessments, are included in the discussion entitled "Critical Accounting Policies" in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, and all amendments thereto, as filed with the SEC. There were no material changes to the critical accounting policies disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Liquidity 

Liquidity is the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, fund asset growth and business operations, and meet contractual obligations through unconstrained access to funding at reasonable market rates. Liquidity management involves forecasting funding requirements and maintaining sufficient capacity to meet the needs and accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to changes in the Company's business operations or unanticipated events, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 

The ability to have readily available funds sufficient to repay fully maturing liabilities is of primary importance to depositors, creditors, and regulators. The Company's liquidity, represented by cash and amounts due from banks, federal funds sold, HFS mortgages, and non-pledged marketable securities, is a result of the Company's operating, investing, and financing activities and related cash flows. In order to ensure funds are available when necessary, on at least a quarterly basis, the Company projects the amount of funds that will be required over a twelve-month period and it also strives to maintain relationships with a diversified customer base. Liquidity requirements can also be met through short-term borrowings or the disposition of short-term assets. 

The following table presents the available and outstanding balances on the Company's lines of credit: 

March 31, 2022 Available Balance Outstanding Balance (in millions) Unsecured fed funds credit lines at correspondent banks $ 3,548.4 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; 

In addition to lines of credit, the Company has borrowing capacity with the FHLB and FRB from pledged loans and securities. The Company also has warehouse borrowing lines of credit assumed as part of the AmeriHome acquisition. The borrowing capacity, outstanding borrowings, and available credit as of March 31, 2022 are presented in the following table: 

March 31, 2022 (in millions) FHLB: Borrowing capacity $ 9,876.0 &#160; Outstanding borrowings &#8212; &#160; Letters of credit 21.0 &#160; Total available credit $ 9,855.0 &#160; FRB: Borrowing capacity $ 4,069.4 &#160; Outstanding borrowings &#8212; &#160; Total available credit $ 4,069.4 &#160; Warehouse borrowings: Borrowing capacity $ 1,000.0 &#160; Outstanding borrowings &#8212; &#160; Total available credit $ 1,000.0 &#160; 

The Company has a formal liquidity policy and, in the opinion of management, its liquid assets are considered adequate to meet cash flow needs for loan funding and deposit cash withdrawals for the next 90-120 days. At March 31, 2022, there was $10.5 billion in liquid assets, comprised of $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $2.7 billion in HFS loans, and $5.1 billion in 

unpledged marketable securities. At December 31, 2021, the Company maintained $8.7 billion in liquid assets, comprised of $516.4 million of cash and cash equivalents, $4.0 billion in HFS loans, and $4.2 billion of unpledged marketable securities. 

The Parent maintains liquidity that would be sufficient to fund its operations and certain non-bank affiliate operations for an extended period should funding from normal sources be disrupted. Since deposits are taken by WAB and not by the Parent, Parent liquidity is not dependent on the Bank's deposit balances. In the Company's analysis of Parent liquidity, it is assumed that the Parent is unable to generate funds from additional debt or equity issuances, receives no dividend income from subsidiaries and does not pay dividends to stockholders, while continuing to make non-discretionary payments needed to maintain operations and repayment of contractual principal and interest payments owed by the Parent and affiliated companies. Under this scenario, the amount of time the Parent and its non-bank subsidiary can operate and meet all obligations before the current liquid assets are exhausted is considered as part of the Parent liquidity analysis. Management believes the Parent maintains adequate liquidity capacity to operate without additional funding from new sources for over twelve months. 

WAB maintains sufficient funding capacity to address large increases in funding requirements, such as deposit outflows. This capacity is comprised of liquidity derived from a reduction in asset levels and various secured funding sources. On a long-term basis, the Company&#8217;s liquidity will be met by changing the relative distribution of its asset portfolios (for example, by reducing investment or loan volumes, or selling or encumbering assets). Further, the Company can increase liquidity by soliciting higher levels of deposit accounts through promotional activities and/or borrowing from correspondent banks, the FHLB of San Francisco, and the FRB. At March 31, 2022, the Company's long-term liquidity needs primarily relate to funds required to support loan originations, commitments, and deposit withdrawals, which can be met by cash flows from investment payments and maturities, and investment sales, if necessary. 

The Company&#8217;s liquidity is comprised of three primary classifications: 1) cash flows provided by operating activities; 2) cash flows used in investing activities; and 3) cash flows provided by financing activities. Net cash provided by or used in operating activities consists primarily of net income, adjusted for changes in certain other asset and liability accounts and certain non-cash income and expense items, such as the provision for credit losses, investment and other amortization and depreciation. For the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, net cash provided by operating activities was $622.9 million and $100.1 million, respectively. 

The Company's primary investing activities are the origination of real estate and commercial loans, the collection of repayments of these loans, and the purchase and sale of securities. The Company's net cash provided by and used in investing activities has been primarily influenced by its loan and securities activities. The Company's cash balance during the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 was reduced by $2.0 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, as a result of a net increase in loans as well as a net increase in investment securities of $517.7 million and $2.4 billion, respectively. 

Net cash provided by financing activities has been impacted significantly by increased deposit levels. During the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, net deposits increased $4.5 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively. 

Fluctuations in core deposit levels may increase the Company's need for liquidity as certificates of deposit mature or are withdrawn before maturity, and as non-maturity deposits, such as checking and savings account balances, are withdrawn. Additionally, the Company is exposed to the risk that customers with large deposit balances will withdraw all or a portion of such deposits, due in part to the FDIC limitations on the amount of insurance coverage provided to depositors. To mitigate the uninsured deposit risk, the Company participates in the CDARS and ICS programs, which allow an individual customer to invest up to $50.0 million and $150.0 million, respectively, through one participating financial institution or, a combined total of $200.0 million per individual customer, with the entire amount being covered by FDIC insurance. As of March 31, 2022, the Company has $710.3 million of CDARS and $2.0 billion of ICS deposits. 

As of March 31, 2022, the Company has $2.5 billion of wholesale brokered deposits outstanding. Brokered deposits are generally considered to be deposits that have been received from a third party who is engaged in the business of placing deposits on behalf of others. A traditional deposit broker will direct deposits to the banking institution offering the highest interest rate available. Federal banking laws and regulations place restrictions on depository institutions regarding brokered deposits because of the general concern that these deposits are not relationship based and are at a greater risk of being withdrawn and placed on deposit at another institution offering a higher interest rate, thus posing liquidity risk for institutions that gather brokered deposits in significant amounts. 

Federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid. The total amount of dividends which may be paid at any date is generally limited to the retained earnings of the bank. Dividends paid by WAB to the Parent would be prohibited if the effect thereof would cause the Bank&#8217;s capital to be reduced below applicable minimum capital requirements. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, there were no dividends paid from WAB to the Parent. Subsequent to March 31, 2022, WAB paid dividends to the Parent of $50.0 million.
