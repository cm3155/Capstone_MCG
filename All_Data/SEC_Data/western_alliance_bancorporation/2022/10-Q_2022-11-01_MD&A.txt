Recent Developments: Acquisition of Digital Disbursements 

On January 25, 2022, the Company completed its acquisition of Digital Settlement Technologies LLC, doing business as Digital Disbursements, a digital payments platform for the class action legal industry. DST's proprietary platform enables claimants to select their payment method, including direct-to-bank account options and popular digital wallets. This provides the Company with the internal capability to significantly increase efficacy, reduce distribution costs and improve potential fraud detection for the legal class action market. The acquisition is expected to grow the Company's deposit base and continue to extend the suite of legal banking services offered while serving adjacent sectors that will benefit from digital payments technology.

Asset Quality 

For all banks and bank holding companies, asset quality plays a significant role in the overall financial condition of the institution and results of operations. The Company measures asset quality in terms of nonaccrual loans as a percentage of gross loans and net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans. Net charge-offs are calculated as the difference between charged-off loans and recovery payments received on previously charged-off loans. The following table summarizes the Company's key asset quality metrics for HFI loans: 

September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 (dollars in millions) Nonaccrual loans $ 90 &#160; $ 73 Repossessed assets 11 &#160; 12 Non-performing assets 103 &#160; 87 Nonaccrual loans to funded loans 0.17 &#160; % 0.19 % Nonaccrual and repossessed assets to total assets 0.15 &#160; 0.15 Allowance for loan losses to funded loans 0.58 &#160; 0.65 Allowance for credit losses to funded loans 0.68 &#160; 0.74 Net (recoveries) charge-offs to average loans outstanding (1) (0.02) 0.02 

(1) Annualized on an actual/actual basis for the three months ended September 30, 2022. Actual year-to-date for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Asset and Deposit Growth 

The Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities are comprised primarily of loans and deposits. Therefore, the ability to originate new loans and attract new deposits is fundamental to the Company&#8217;s growth. 

Total assets increased to $69.2 billion at September 30, 2022 from $56.0 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase in total assets of $13.2 billion, or 23.5%, was driven by continued organic loan and deposit growth, which contributed to an increase in cash of $1.1 billion as well as an increase in investment securities of $941 million. HFI loans increased by $13.1 billion, or 33.6%, to $52.2 billion as of September 30, 2022, compared to $39.1 billion as of December 31, 2021. The increase in HFI loans from December 31, 2021 was driven by increases in residential real estate loans of $6.4 billion (includes a transfer of EBO loans from HFS to HFI in the second quarter of 2022 with a balance of $1.8 billion at September 30, 2022), commercial and industrial loans of $4.0 billion, CRE, non-owner occupied loans of $2.1 billion, and construction and land development loans of $598 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in CRE, owner occupied loans of $50 million. In addition, HFS loans decreased by $3.4 billion, from $5.6 billion as of December 31, 2021, primarily related to a transfer of EBO loans from HFS to HFI in the second quarter of 2022 with a balance of $1.8 billion at September 30, 2022. 

Total deposits increased $8.0 billion, or 16.8%, to $55.6 billion as of September 30, 2022 from $47.6 billion as of December 31, 2021. The increase in deposits from December 31, 2021 was driven by increases of $3.6 billion in non-interest bearing demand deposits, $1.9 billion in savings and money market accounts, $1.4 billion in interest bearing demand deposits, and $1.1 billion in certificates of deposit. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following table sets forth a summary financial overview for the comparable periods:

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

The following discussion and analysis contains financial information determined by methods other than those prescribed by GAAP. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in their analysis of the Company's performance. Management believes presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a complete understanding of the operating results of the Company. Since the presentation of these non-GAAP performance measures and their impact differ between companies, these non-GAAP disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. 

Pre-Provision Net Revenue 

Banking regulations define PPNR as the sum of net interest income and non-interest income less expenses before adjusting for loss provisions. Management believes that this is an important metric as it illustrates the underlying performance of the Company, it enables investors and others to assess the Company's ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through the credit cycle, and provides consistent reporting with a key metric used by bank regulatory agencies. 

The following table shows the components of PPNR for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 (in millions) Net interest income $ 602.1 &#160; $ 410.4 $ 1,576.6 &#160; $ 1,098.2 Total non-interest income 61.8 &#160; 138.1 263.1 &#160; 293.8 Net revenue $ 663.9 &#160; $ 548.5 $ 1,839.7 &#160; $ 1,392.0 Total non-interest expense 305.8 &#160; 233.8 823.3 &#160; 613.6 Pre-provision net revenue $ 358.1 &#160; $ 314.7 $ 1,016.4 &#160; $ 778.4 Less: Provision for (recovery of) credit losses 28.5 &#160; 12.3 65.0 &#160; (34.6) Income tax expense 65.6 &#160; 65.5 187.1 &#160; 159.8 Net income $ 264.0 &#160; $ 236.9 $ 764.3 &#160; $ 653.2 

Efficiency Ratio 

The following table shows the components used in the calculation of the efficiency ratio, which management uses as a metric for assessing cost efficiency: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 (dollars in millions) Total non-interest expense $ 305.8 &#160; $ 233.8 $ 823.3 &#160; $ 613.6 Divided by: Total net interest income 602.1 &#160; 410.4 1,576.6 &#160; 1,098.2 Plus: Tax equivalent interest adjustment 8.5 &#160; 8.5 24.7 &#160; 24.9 Total non-interest income 61.8 &#160; 138.1 263.1 &#160; 293.8 $ 672.4 &#160; $ 557.0 $ 1,864.4 &#160; $ 1,416.9 Efficiency ratio - tax equivalent basis 45.5 &#160; % 42.0 % 44.2 &#160; % 43.3 % 

Tangible Common Equity 

The following table presents financial measures related to tangible common equity. Tangible common equity represents total stockholders' equity, less identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. Management believes that tangible common equity financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company's capital strength, financial condition, and ability to manage potential losses. In addition, management believes that these measures improve comparability to other institutions that have not engaged in acquisitions that resulted in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets. 

September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 (dollars and shares in millions) Total stockholders' equity $ 5,021 &#160; $ 4,963 Less: Goodwill and intangible assets 682 &#160; 635 Preferred stock 295 &#160; 295 Total tangible common stockholders' equity 4,044 &#160; 4,033 Plus: deferred tax - attributed to intangible assets 3 &#160; 2 Total tangible common equity, net of tax $ 4,047 &#160; $ 4,035 Total assets $ 69,165 &#160; $ 55,983 Less: goodwill and intangible assets, net 682 &#160; 635 Tangible assets 68,483 &#160; 55,348 Plus: deferred tax - attributed to intangible assets 3 &#160; 2 Total tangible assets, net of tax $ 68,486 &#160; $ 55,350 Tangible common equity ratio 5.9 &#160; % 7.3 % Common shares outstanding 108.9 &#160; 106.6 Book value per common share $ 43.39 &#160; $ 43.78 Tangible book value per common share, net of tax 37.16 &#160; 37.84 

Regulatory Capital 

The following table presents certain financial measures related to regulatory capital under Basel III, which includes common equity tier 1 and total capital. The FRB and other banking regulators use CET1 and total capital as a basis for assessing a bank's capital adequacy; therefore, management believes it is useful to assess financial condition and capital adequacy using this same basis. Specifically, the total capital ratio takes into consideration the risk levels of assets and off-balance sheet financial instruments. In addition, management believes that the classified assets to CET1 plus allowance measure is an important regulatory metric for assessing asset quality. 

As permitted by the regulatory capital rules, the Company elected to delay the estimated impact of CECL on its regulatory capital over a five-year transition period ending December 31, 2024. Beginning in 2022, capital ratios and amounts include a 25% reduction to the capital benefit that resulted from the increased allowance for credit losses related to the adoption of ASC 326. 

September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 (dollars in millions) Common equity tier 1: Common equity $ 4,762 &#160; $ 4,715 Less: Non-qualifying goodwill and intangibles 675 &#160; 631 Disallowed deferred tax asset 52 &#160; &#8212; AOCI related adjustments (741) 16 Unrealized gain on changes in fair value liabilities 5 &#160; &#8212; Common equity tier 1 $ 4,771 &#160; $ 4,068 Divided by: Risk-weighted assets $ 55,053 &#160; $ 44,697 Common equity tier 1 ratio 8.7 &#160; % 9.1 % Common equity tier 1 $ 4,771 &#160; $ 4,068 Plus: Preferred stock and trust preferred securities 376 &#160; 376 Tier 1 capital $ 5,147 &#160; $ 4,444 Divided by: Tangible average assets $ 68,330 &#160; $ 56,973 Tier 1 leverage ratio 7.5 &#160; % 7.8 % Total capital: Tier 1 capital $ 5,147 &#160; $ 4,444 Plus: Subordinated debt 816 &#160; 815 Adjusted allowances for credit losses 319 &#160; 240 Tier 2 capital 1,135 &#160; 1,055 Total capital $ 6,282 &#160; $ 5,499 Total capital ratio 11.4 &#160; % 12.3 % Classified assets to tier 1 capital plus allowance: Classified assets $ 385 &#160; $ 301 Divided by: Tier 1 capital 5,147 &#160; 4,444 Plus: Adjusted allowances for credit losses 319 &#160; 240 Total Tier 1 capital plus adjusted allowances for credit losses $ 5,466 &#160; $ 4,684 Classified assets to tier 1 capital plus allowance 7.0 &#160; % 6.4 % 

Net Interest Margin 

The net interest margin is reported on a TEB. A tax equivalent adjustment is added to reflect interest earned on certain securities and loans that are exempt from federal and state income tax. The following tables set forth the average balances, interest income, interest expense, and average yield (on a fully TEB) for the periods indicated:

Comparison of interest income, interest expense and net interest margin 

The Company's primary source of revenue is interest income. For the three months ended September 30, 2022, interest income was $739.4 million, an increase of $296.6 million, or 67.0%, compared to $442.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. This increase was primarily the result of a $271.3 million increase in interest income from HFI loans that was driven by an $18.6 billion increase in the average HFI loan balance, coupled with a $32.4 million increase in interest income from investment securities due to higher investment yields and an increase in the average investment balance of $983 million. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, interest income was $1.8 billion, an increase of $628.1 million, or 53.4%, compared to $1.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. This increase was primarily the result of a $16.3 billion increase in the average HFI loan balance, which drove a $519.7 million increase in HFI loan interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as well as an increase in investment yields and the average investment balance of $1.0 billion resulting in an increase in interest income of $62.2 million. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2022, interest expense was $137.3 million, an increase of $104.9 million, or 323.8%, compared to $32.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. Increased interest expense was due to an increase in interest expense on deposits of $65.3 million driven by increased interest rates and a $6.3 billion increase in the average interest-bearing deposit balance combined with a $41.5 million increase in interest expense on other borrowings resulting from an increase in the average balance of $4.4 billion. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, interest expense was $226.9 million, an increase of $149.7 million, or 193.9%, compared to $77.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Interest expense on deposits increased by $84.1 million driven by an increase in deposit rates and an increase in the average deposit balance of $7.5 billion coupled with an increase in the average balance of other borrowings of $2.7 billion, which drove a $63.6 million increase in interest expense. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2022, net interest income was $602.1 million, an increase of $191.7 million, or 46.7%, compared to $410.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The increase in net interest income reflects a $15.7 billion increase in average interest-earning assets, partially offset by an increase of $10.5 billion in average interest-bearing liabilities. The increase in net interest margin of 35 basis points to 3.78% is largely the result of an increase in loan balances, partially offset by higher deposit balances and rates compared to the same period in 2021. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, net interest income was $1.6 billion, an increase of $478.4 million, or 43.6%, compared to $1.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The increase in net interest income reflects a $16.5 billion increase in average interest-earning assets, partially offset by an increase of $10.3 billion in average interest-bearing liabilities. The increase in net interest margin of 12 basis point to 3.56% is the result of an increase in loan balances, partially offset by higher deposit rates and increase in the balance of deposits and other borrowings compared to the same period in 2021. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses in each period is reflected as a reduction in earnings for that period and includes amounts related to funded loans, unfunded loan commitments, and investment securities. The provision is equal to the amount required to maintain the allowance for credit losses at a level that is adequate to absorb estimated lifetime credit losses inherent in the loan and investment securities portfolios at the time that the loan is originated or the security is purchased. The Company's CECL models incorporate historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts in measuring expected credit losses. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $28.5 million and $65.0 million, respectively, compared to $12.3 million and a release of credit loss provisions of $34.6 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. The increase in the provision for credit losses from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 is primarily related to loan growth and heightened economic uncertainty. 

Non-interest Income 

The following table presents a summary of non-interest income for the periods presented: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) (in millions) Net loan servicing revenue (expense) $ 23.0 &#160; $ 2.2 $ 20.8 &#160; $ 109.5 &#160; $ (18.6) $ 128.1 &#160; Net gain on loan origination and sale activities 14.5 &#160; 121.0 (106.5) 78.6 &#160; 253.0 (174.4) Service charges and fees 6.5 &#160; 7.1 (0.6) 21.1 &#160; 21.2 (0.1) Commercial banking related income 5.1 &#160; 4.6 0.5 &#160; 16.0 &#160; 12.5 3.5 &#160; Income from equity investments 4.3 &#160; 2.5 1.8 &#160; 13.6 &#160; 16.9 (3.3) Gain on recovery from credit guarantees 0.4 &#160; &#8212; 0.4 &#160; 11.7 &#160; &#8212; 11.7 &#160; Gain on sales of investment securities &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#160; 6.7 &#160; 0.1 6.6 &#160; Fair value loss on assets measured at fair value, net (2.8) (2.2) (0.6) (19.4) (0.5) (18.9) Other income 10.8 &#160; 2.9 7.9 &#160; 25.3 &#160; 9.2 16.1 &#160; Total non-interest income $ 61.8 &#160; $ 138.1 $ (76.3) $ 263.1 &#160; $ 293.8 $ (30.7) 

Total non-interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 decreased $76.3 million. Th e decrease in non-interest income was driven by a decrease in net gain on loan origination and sale activities of $106.5 million due to compressed margins, a decline in production volume, and losses due to fair value changes. This decrease was offset in part by an increase in net loan servicing revenue of $20.8 million fro m lower payoffs, gain on sales of MSRs, and higher servicing fees. 

Total non-interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 decreased $30.7 million. The decrease in non-interest income was driven by a decrease in net gain on loan origination and sale activities of $174.4 million due to compressed margins, decline in production volume in capitalized MSRs, and a decrease in gains due to fair value changes. Mark-to-market losses on equity securities also resulted in a decrease to non-interest income of $18.9 million. These decreases were offset in part by an increase in net loan servicing revenue of $128.1 million from lower payoffs, gain on sales of MSRs, and higher servicing fees. 

Non-interest Expense 

The following table presents a summary of non-interest expense for the periods presented: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) (in millions) Salaries and employee benefits $ 136.5 &#160; $ 133.5 $ 3.0 &#160; $ 413.8 &#160; $ 346.1 $ 67.7 &#160; Deposit costs 56.2 &#160; 7.3 48.9 &#160; 83.6 &#160; 20.7 62.9 &#160; Legal, professional, and directors' fees 24.8 &#160; 13.7 11.1 &#160; 73.9 &#160; 37.8 36.1 &#160; Data processing 21.8 &#160; 15.4 6.4 &#160; 59.1 &#160; 40.3 18.8 &#160; Loan servicing expenses 15.2 &#160; 15.6 (0.4) 40.7 &#160; 37.9 2.8 &#160; Occupancy 13.9 &#160; 12.4 1.5 &#160; 39.7 &#160; 31.4 8.3 &#160; Insurance 8.1 &#160; 6.2 1.9 &#160; 22.2 &#160; 15.9 6.3 &#160; Loan acquisition and origination expenses 5.8 &#160; 9.7 (3.9) 18.7 &#160; 20.2 (1.5) Business development and marketing 5.0 &#160; 2.8 2.2 &#160; 14.8 &#160; 7.4 7.4 &#160; Net gain on sales and valuations of repossessed and other assets (0.2) (1.3) 1.1 &#160; (0.4) (3.1) 2.7 &#160; Acquisition and restructure expenses &#8212; &#160; 2.4 (2.4) 0.4 &#160; 18.5 (18.1) Other expense 18.7 &#160; 16.1 2.6 &#160; 56.8 &#160; 40.5 16.3 &#160; Total non-interest expense $ 305.8 &#160; $ 233.8 $ 72.0 &#160; $ 823.3 &#160; $ 613.6 $ 209.7 &#160; 

Total non-interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2022 increased $72.0 million compared to the same period in 2021. The increase in non-interest expense was driven by increases in deposit costs, legal, professional, and directors' fees, and data processing costs. The increase in deposit costs primarily relates to an increase in overall deposits and higher average ECR rates. The increase in legal, professional, and directors' fees and data processing costs relates to an increase in project initiatives and consulting work to support ongoing implementations. 

Total non-interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased $209.7 million compared to the same period in 2021. The increase in non-interest expense was driven by increases in salaries and employee benefits, deposit costs, and legal, professional, and directors' fees. The increase in deposit costs primarily relates to an increase in overall deposits and higher average ECR rates. Salaries and employee benefits increased $67.7 million from an increase in headcount year over year. The increase in legal, professional, and directors' fees relates to an increase in project initiatives and consulting work to support ongoing implementations. 

Income Taxes 

The Company's effective tax rate was 19.9% and 21.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company's effective tax rate was 19.7%. The decrease in the three month effective tax rate was primarily due to increases in solar tax credit investments and a decrease in state tax expense.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS 

Total assets increased $13.2 billion, or 23.5%, to $69.2 billion at September 30, 2022, compared to $56.0 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase in total assets was driven by continued organic loan and deposit growth, which contributed to an increase in cash of $1.1 billion as well as an increase in investment securities of $941 million. HFI loans increased by $13.1 billion, or 33.6%, to $52.2 billion as of September 30, 2022, compared to $39.1 billion as of December 31, 2021. The increase in HFI loans from December 31, 2021 was driven by increases in residential real estate loans of $6.4 billion (including EBO loans transferred from HFS to HFI in the second quarter 2022 with a $1.8 billion balance at September 30, 2022), commercial and industrial loans of $4.0 billion, CRE, non-owner occupied loans of $2.1 billion, and construction and land development loans of $598 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in CRE, owner occupied loans of $50 million. In addition, HFS loans decreased by $3.4 billion, down from $5.6 billion as of December 31, 2021, primarily related to the transfer of EBO loans from HFS to HFI during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. 

Total liabilities increased $13.1 billion, or 25.7%, to $64.1 billion at September 30, 2022, compared to $51.0 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase in liabilities is due primarily to an increase in total deposits of $8.0 billion, or 16.8%, to $55.6 billion. The increase in deposits from December 31, 2021 was driven by increases of $3.6 billion in non-interest bearing demand deposits, $1.9 billion in savings and money market accounts, $1.4 billion in interest bearing demand deposits, and $1.1 billion in certificates of deposit. Other borrowings also increased $4.8 billion from December 31, 2021 due to an increase in short-term borrowings of $4.3 billion and issuance of two credit linked notes in June 2022, with a principal balance totaling $494 million. 

Total stockholders&#8217; equity of $5.0 billion at September 30, 2022 increased by $58 million, or 1.2%, from December 31, 2021. The increase in stockholders' equity is primarily a function of net income and net proceeds of $157.7 million from issuance of common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, offset by quarterly dividends to common and preferred shareholders and unrealized fair value losses on AFS securities recorded net of tax in other comprehensive income. 

Investment securities 

Debt securities are classified at the time of acquisition as either HTM, AFS, or trading based upon various factors, including asset/liability management strategies, liquidity and profitability objectives, and regulatory requirements. HTM securities are carried at amortized cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts. AFS securities are securities that may be sold prior to maturity based upon asset/liability management decisions. Investment securities classified as AFS are carried at fair value with unrealized gains or losses on these securities recorded in AOCI in stockholders&#8217; equity, net of tax. Amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts on MBS is periodically adjusted for estimated prepayments. Trading securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses on these securities included in current period earnings. 

The Company's investment securities portfolio is utilized as collateral for borrowings, required collateral for public deposits and customer repurchase agreements, and to manage liquidity, capital, and interest rate risk. 

The following table summarizes the carrying value of the investment securities portfolio for each of the periods below: 

September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Increase (Decrease) (in millions) Debt securities CLO $ 2,641 &#160; $ 926 $ 1,715 &#160; Commercial MBS issued by GSEs 62 &#160; 69 (7) Corporate debt securities 391 &#160; 383 8 &#160; Private label residential MBS 1,429 &#160; 1,725 (296) Residential MBS issued by GSEs 1,694 &#160; 1,993 (299) Tax-exempt 1,943 &#160; 2,105 (162) U.S. treasury securities &#8212; &#160; 13 (13) Other 70 &#160; 82 (12) Total debt securities $ 8,230 &#160; $ 7,296 $ 934 &#160; Equity securities CRA investments $ 49 &#160; $ 45 $ 4 &#160; Preferred stock 116 &#160; 114 2 &#160; Total equity securities $ 165 &#160; $ 159 $ 6 &#160; 

Loans HFS 

The Company purchases and originates residential mortgage loans through its AmeriHome mortgage banking business channel that are held for sale or securitization. At September 30, 2022, the Company had $2.2 billion of loans HFS, compared to $5.6 billion at December 31, 2021. The decrease in loans HFS from December 31, 2021 relates to sales, a decline in production volumes, and a transfer of EBO loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 that were previously classified as HFS to HFI. 

Loans HFI 

The table below summarizes the distribution of the Company&#8217;s held for investment loan portfolio:

Loans classified as HFI are stated at the amount of unpaid principal, adjusted for net deferred fees and costs, premiums and discounts on acquired and purchased loans, and an allowance for credit losses. Net deferred loan fees of $141 million and $86 million reduced the carrying value of loans as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Net unamortized purchase premiums on acquired and purchased loans of $197 million and $185 million increased the carrying value of loans as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

Concentrations of Lending Activities 

The Company monitors concentrations of lending activities at the product and borrower relationship level. Commercial and industrial loans made up 43% and 47% of the Company's HFI loan portfolio as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. In addition, the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio includes significant credit exposure to the CRE market as CRE related loans accounted for approximately 27% and 29% of total loans at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Substantially all of these CRE loans are secured by first liens with an initial loan to value ratio of generally not more than 75%. Approximately 18% and 23% of these CRE loans, excluding construction and land loans, were owner-occupied at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. No borrower relationships at both the commitment and funded loan level exceeded 5% of total HFI loans as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

Non-performing Assets 

Total non-performing loans increased $16 million to $92 million at September 30, 2022, from $76 million at December 31, 2021.

Troubled Debt Restructured Loans 

A TDR loan is a loan on which the Company, for reasons related to a borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that the Company would not otherwise consider. The loan terms that have been modified or restructured due to a borrower&#8217;s financial situation include, but are not limited to, a reduction in the stated interest rate, an extension of the maturity or renewal of the loan at an interest rate below current market, a reduction in the face amount of the debt, a reduction in the accrued interest, or deferral of interest payments. The majority of the Company's modifications are extensions in terms or deferral of payments which result in no lost principal or interest followed by reductions in interest rates or accrued interest. Consistent with regulatory guidance, a TDR loan that is subsequently modified in another restructuring agreement but has shown sustained performance and classification as a TDR, will be removed from TDR status provided that the modified terms were market-based at the time of modification. 

The following table presents TDR loans:

The allowance for credit losses on TDR loans totaled $5 million and zero as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. There were $1 million and zero outstanding commitments on TDR loans as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on HFI Loans 

The allowance for credit losses consists of the allowance for credit losses on loans and an allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments. The allowance for credit losses on HTM securities is estimated separately from loans and is discussed within the Investment Securities section. 

The following table summarizes the allocation of the allowance for credit losses on HFI loans by loan portfolio segment:

This allowance balance totaled $52.1 million and $37.6 million at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, and is included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Problem Loans 

The Company classifies loans consistent with federal banking regulations using a nine category grading system. These loan grades are described in further detail in "Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements" of this report. The following table presents information regarding potential and actual problem loans, consisting of loans graded as Special Mention, Substandard, Doubtful, and Loss, but which are still performing:

Mortgage Servicing Rights 

The fair value of the Company's MSRs related to residential mortgage loans totaled $1.0 billion and $698 million as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

The following is a summary of the UPB of loans underlying in the Company's MSR portfolio by type: 

September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 (in millions) FNMA and FHLMC $ 33,493 &#160; $ 38,754 GNMA 27,692 &#160; 14,379 Non-agency 1,656 &#160; 1,215 Total unpaid principal balance of loans $ 62,841 &#160; $ 54,348 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

Goodwill represents the excess consideration paid for net assets acquired in a business combination over their fair value. Goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are determined to have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortization, but are subsequently evaluated for impairment at least annually. The Company has goodwill totaling $526 million at September 30, 2022. The increase from $491 million at December 31, 2021 is attributable to the DST acquisition in January 2022. See "Note 2. Mergers, Acquisitions and Dispositions" for further discussion of the acquisition. 

The Company performs its annual goodwill and intangibles impairment tests as of October 1 each year, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, there were no events or circumstances that indicated an interim impairment test of goodwill or other intangible assets was necessary. 

Deferred Tax Assets 

As of September 30, 2022, the net DTA balance totaled $302 million, an increase of $281 million from $21 million at December 31, 2021. This overall increase in the net DTA was primarily the result of decreases in the fair market value of AFS securities and expected tax credit carryovers. These items were not fully offset by increases to MSRs. 

At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had no deferred tax valuation allowance. 

Deposits 

Deposits are the primary source for funding the Company's asset growth. Total deposits increased to $55.6 billion at September 30, 2022, from $47.6 billion at December 31, 2021, an increase of $8.0 billion, or 16.8%. By deposit type, the increase in deposits is attributable to increases in non-interest bearing demand deposits of $3.6 billion, savings and money market accounts of $1.9 billion, interest bearing demand deposits of $1.4 billion, and certificates of deposit of $1.1 billion. 

WAB is a participant in the IntraFi Network, a network that offers deposit placement services such as CDARS and ICS, which offer products that qualify large deposits for FDIC insurance. At September 30, 2022, the Company had $705 million of CDARS deposits and $2.2 billion of ICS deposits, compared to $729 million of CDARS deposits and $1.8 billion of ICS deposits at December 31, 2021. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company also had wholesale brokered deposits of $3.8 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. 

In addition, deposits for which the Company provides account holders with earnings credits or referral fees totaled $15.9 billion and $10.8 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The Company incurred $55.4 million and $6.6 million in deposit related costs on these deposits during the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company incurred $81.4 million and $12.4 million in deposit related costs on these deposits during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These costs are reported as Deposit costs in non-interest expense. The increase in these costs from the prior year is due to an increase in earnings credit rates as well as an increase in average deposit balances eligible for earnings credits or referral fees. 

The average balances and weighted average rates paid on deposits are presented below:

Other Borrowings 

Short-Term Borrowings 

The Company utilizes short-term borrowed funds to support short-term liquidity needs generally created by increased loan demand. The majority of these short-term borrowed funds consist of advances from the FHLB, federal funds purchased from correspondent banks or the FHLB, and repurchase agreements. The Company&#8217;s borrowing capacity with the FHLB is determined based on collateral pledged, generally consisting of securities and loans. In addition, the Company has borrowing capacity from other sources, collateralized by securities, including securities sold under agreements to repurchase, which are reflected at the amount of cash received in connection with the transaction, and may require additional collateral based on the fair value of the underlying securities. At September 30, 2022, total short-term borrowed funds consisted of FHLB advances of $4.0 billion, federal funds purchased of $1.0 billion, repurchase agreements of $26 million, and secured borrowings of $60 million. At December 31, 2021, total short-term borrowed funds consisted of federal funds purchased of $675 million, secured borrowings of $35 million, and repurchase agreements of $17 million. 

Long-Term Borrowings 

The Company's long-term borrowings consist of AmeriHome senior notes from the acquisition on April 7, 2021 and credit linked notes issued, inclusive of issuance costs and fair market value adjustments. At September 30, 2022, the carrying value of long-term borrowings was $1.2 billion, compared to $775 million at December 31, 2021. The increase in long-term borrowings from December 31, 2021 relates to new credit linked note issuances during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, totaling $486 million, net of issuance costs. 

Qualifying Debt 

Qualifying debt consists of subordinated debt and junior subordinated debt, inclusive of issuance costs and fair market value adjustments. At September 30, 2022, the carrying value of qualifying debt was $889 million, compared to $896 million at December 31, 2021. 

Capital Resources 

The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could trigger certain mandatory or discretionary actions that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company&#8217;s business and financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items (discussed in "Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies" to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements) as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. 

In connection with its adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, the Company elected the five-year CECL transition option that delayed the estimated impact on regulatory capital resulting from the adoption of CECL. As a result of this election, the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital relative to regulatory capital determined under the prior incurred loss methodology was delayed for two years, followed by a three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of capital benefit provided during the initial two-year delay. Beginning in 2022, capital ratios and amounts include a 25% reduction to the capital benefit that resulted from the increased allowance for credit losses related to the adoption of ASC 326. 

As a result of the Company's continued commercial loan growth and the acquisition of AmeriHome, the Company continues to undertake various capital actions to ensure that its capital levels remain strong, which during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, included sales of common stock under the Company's ATM program and two credit linked note issuances. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company and the Bank exceeded the capital levels necessary to be classified as well-capitalized, as defined by the various banking agencies. The actual capital amounts and ratios for the Company and the Bank are presented in the following tables as of the periods indicated: 

Total Capital Tier 1 Capital Risk-Weighted Assets Tangible Average Assets Total Capital Ratio Tier 1 Capital Ratio Tier 1 Leverage Ratio Common Equity Tier 1 (dollars in millions) September 30, 2022 WAL $ 6,282 &#160; $ 5,147 &#160; $ 55,053 &#160; $ 68,330 &#160; 11.4 &#160; % 9.3 &#160; % 7.5 &#160; % 8.7 &#160; % WAB 5,936 &#160; 5,394 &#160; 54,977 &#160; 68,264 &#160; 10.8 &#160; 9.8 &#160; 7.9 &#160; 9.8 &#160; Well-capitalized ratios 10.0 &#160; 8.0 &#160; 5.0 &#160; 6.5 &#160; Minimum capital ratios 8.0 &#160; 6.0 &#160; 4.0 &#160; 4.5 &#160; December 31, 2021 WAL $ 5,499 $ 4,444 $ 44,697 $ 56,973 12.3 % 9.9 % 7.8 % 9.1 % WAB 5,120 4,658 44,726 56,962 11.4 10.4 8.2 10.4 Well-capitalized ratios 10.0 8.0 5.0 6.5 Minimum capital ratios 8.0 6.0 4.0 4.5 

The Company is also required to maintain specified levels of capital to remain in good standing with certain federal government agencies, including FNMA, FHLMC, GNMA, and HUD. These capital requirements are generally tied to the unpaid balances of loans included in the Company's servicing portfolio or loan production volume. Noncompliance with these capital requirements can result in various remedial actions up to, and including, removing the Company's ability to sell loans to and service loans on behalf of the respective agency. The Company believes that it is in compliance with these requirements as of September 30, 2022. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The critical accounting estimates upon which the Company's financial condition and results of operations depend, and which involve the most complex subjective decisions or assessments, are included in the discussion entitled "Critical Accounting Policies" in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, and all amendments thereto, as filed with the SEC. There were no material changes to the critical accounting policies disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Liquidity 

Liquidity is the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, fund asset growth and business operations, and meet contractual obligations through unconstrained access to funding at reasonable market rates. Liquidity management involves forecasting funding requirements and maintaining sufficient capacity to meet the needs and accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to changes in the Company's business operations or unanticipated events. 

The ability to have readily available funds sufficient to repay fully maturing liabilities is of primary importance to depositors, creditors, and regulators. The Company's liquidity, represented by cash and amounts due from banks, federal funds sold, HFS mortgages, and non-pledged marketable securities, is a result of the Company's operating, investing, and financing activities and related cash flows. In order to ensure funds are available when necessary, on at least a quarterly basis, the Company projects the amount of funds that will be required over a twelve-month period and it also strives to maintain relationships with a diversified customer base. Liquidity requirements can also be met through short-term borrowings or the disposition of short-term assets. 

The following table presents the available and outstanding balances on the Company's lines of credit: 

September 30, 2022 Available Balance Outstanding Balance (in millions) Unsecured fed funds credit lines at correspondent banks $ 4,706 &#160; $ 1,010 &#160; 

In addition to lines of credit, the Company has borrowing capacity with the FHLB and FRB from pledged loans and securities and warehouse borrowing lines of credit. The borrowing capacity, outstanding borrowings, and available credit as of September 30, 2022 are presented in the following table: 

September 30, 2022 (in millions) FHLB: Borrowing capacity $ 11,084 &#160; Outstanding borrowings 4,000 &#160; Letters of credit 21 &#160; Total available credit $ 7,063 &#160; FRB: Borrowing capacity $ 4,976 &#160; Outstanding borrowings &#8212; &#160; Total available credit $ 4,976 &#160; Warehouse borrowings: Borrowing capacity $ 1,000 &#160; Outstanding borrowings &#8212; &#160; Total available credit $ 1,000 &#160; 

The Company has a formal liquidity policy and, in the opinion of management, its liquid assets are considered adequate to meet cash flow needs for loan funding and deposit cash withdrawals for the next 90-120 days. At September 30, 2022, there were $9.0 billion in liquid assets, comprised of $1.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $2.0 billion in HFS mortgages, and $5.4 billion in unpledged marketable securities. At December 31, 2021, the Company maintained $8.7 billion in liquid assets, 

comprised of $516 million of cash and cash equivalents, $4.0 billion in HFS mortgages, and $4.2 billion of unpledged marketable securities. 

The Parent maintains liquidity that would be sufficient to fund its operations and certain non-bank affiliate operations for an extended period should funding from normal sources be disrupted. Since deposits are taken by WAB and not by the Parent, Parent liquidity is not dependent on the Bank's deposit balances. In the Company's analysis of Parent liquidity, it is assumed that the Parent is unable to generate funds from additional debt or equity issuances, receives no dividend income from subsidiaries and does not pay dividends to stockholders, while continuing to make non-discretionary payments needed to maintain operations and repayment of contractual principal and interest payments owed by the Parent and affiliated companies. Under this scenario, the amount of time the Parent and its non-bank subsidiary can operate and meet all obligations before the current liquid assets are exhausted is considered as part of the Parent liquidity analysis. Management believes the Parent maintains adequate liquidity capacity to operate without additional funding from new sources for over twelve months. 

WAB maintains sufficient funding capacity to address large increases in funding requirements, such as deposit outflows. This capacity is comprised of liquidity derived from a reduction in asset levels and various secured funding sources. On a long-term basis, the Company&#8217;s liquidity will be met by changing the relative distribution of its asset portfolios (for example, by reducing investment or loan volumes, or selling or encumbering assets). Further, the Company can increase liquidity by soliciting higher levels of deposit accounts through promotional activities and/or borrowing from correspondent banks, the FHLB of San Francisco, and the FRB. At September 30, 2022, the Company's long-term liquidity needs primarily relate to funds required to support loan originations, commitments, and deposit withdrawals, which can be met by cash flows from investment payments and maturities, and investment sales, if necessary. 

The Company&#8217;s liquidity is comprised of three primary classifications: 1) cash flows provided by operating activities; 2) cash flows used in investing activities; and 3) cash flows provided by financing activities. Net cash provided by or used in operating activities consists primarily of net income, adjusted for changes in certain other asset and liability accounts and certain non-cash income and expense items, such as the provision for credit losses, investment and other amortization and depreciation. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $1.5 billion and $(3.3) billion, respectively. 

The Company's primary investing activities are the origination of real estate and commercial loans, the collection of repayments of these loans, and the purchase and sale of securities. The Company's net cash provided by and used in investing activities has been primarily influenced by its loan and securities activities. The Company's cash balance during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 was reduced by $11.7 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively, as a result of a net increase in loans as well as a net increase in investment securities of $1.8 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. 

Net cash provided by financing activities has been impacted significantly by increased deposit levels. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, net deposits increased $8.0 billion and $13.4 billion, respectively. 

Fluctuations in core deposit levels may increase the Company's need for liquidity as certificates of deposit mature or are withdrawn before maturity, and as non-maturity deposits, such as checking and savings account balances, are withdrawn. Additionally, the Company is exposed to the risk that customers with large deposit balances will withdraw all or a portion of such deposits, due in part to the FDIC limitations on the amount of insurance coverage provided to depositors. To mitigate the uninsured deposit risk, the Company participates in the CDARS and ICS programs, which allow an individual customer to invest up to $50.0 million and $150.0 million, respectively, through one participating financial institution or, a combined total of $200.0 million per individual customer, with the entire amount being covered by FDIC insurance. As of September 30, 2022, the Company has $705 million of CDARS and $2.2 billion of ICS deposits. 

As of September 30, 2022, the Company has $3.8 billion of wholesale brokered deposits outstanding. Brokered deposits are generally considered to be deposits that have been received from a third party who is engaged in the business of placing deposits on behalf of others. A traditional deposit broker will direct deposits to the banking institution offering the highest interest rate available. Federal banking laws and regulations place restrictions on depository institutions regarding brokered deposits because of the general concern that these deposits are not relationship based and are at a greater risk of being withdrawn and placed on deposit at another institution offering a higher interest rate, thus posing liquidity risk for institutions that gather brokered deposits in significant amounts. 

Federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid. The total amount of dividends which may be paid at any date is generally limited to the retained earnings of the bank. Dividends paid by WAB to the Parent would be prohibited if the effect thereof would cause the Bank&#8217;s capital to be reduced below applicable minimum capital requirements. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, WAB paid dividends to the Parent of $55 million and $105 million, respectively.
