Recent Developments: COVID-19 and the CARES Act 

The ongoing COVID-19 global and national health emergency has caused significant disruption in the United States and international economies and financial markets. The spread of COVID-19 in the United States has caused illness, quarantines, cancellation of events and travel, business and school shutdowns, reduction in commercial activity and financial transactions, supply chain interruptions, increased unemployment, and overall economic and financial market instability. Many states, including Arizona, where we are headquartered, and California and Nevada, in which we have significant operations, declared states of emergency. These states, like many others, subsequently moved to a phased reopening, but continue to be significantly impacted by the pandemic. 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CARES Act was signed into law by President Trump on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act provides for approximately $2.2 trillion in emergency economic relief measures including, among other things, loan programs for small and mid-sized businesses and other economic relief for impacted businesses and industries, including financial institutions. Separately, and also in response to COVID-19, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s FOMC has set the federal funds target rate - i.e., the interest rate at which depository institutions such as the Bank lend reserve balances to other depository institutions overnight on an uncollateralized basis - to a historic low. On March 16, 2020, the FOMC set the federal funds target rate at 0 to 0.25 percent. 

In addition to the general impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain provisions of the CARES Act and other recent legislative and regulatory relief efforts are expected to have a material impact on our operations, which are further discussed below. 

Financial position and results of operations 

The Company's financial position and results of operations as of and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The worsening of forecasted economic conditions from December 31, 2019 to March 31, 2020 and from March 31, 2020 to June 30, 2020 attributable to the pandemic contributed to the $92.0 million and $143.2 million provision for credit losses recognized during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively, under the new CECL accounting standard adopted by the Company on January 1, 2020. While the Company has not to date experienced significant writeoffs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the continued uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the pandemic and related economic effects will continue to affect the Company&#8217;s estimate of its allowance for credit losses and resulting provision for credit losses. To the extent the impact of the pandemic is prolonged and economic conditions continue to worsen or persist longer than forecast, such estimates may be insufficient and may change significantly in the future. The Company&#8217;s interest income also may be negatively impacted in future periods as we continue to work with our affected borrowers to defer payments, interest and fees. Additionally, net interest margin may be reduced generally as a result of the low rate environment. These uncertainties and the economic environment will continue to affect earnings, slow growth, and may result in deterioration of asset quality in the Company's loan and investment portfolios. 

The below table details the Company's exposure to borrowers in industries generally considered to be the most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic:

While the Company has not experienced disproportionate impacts among its business segments to date, borrowers in the industries detailed in the table above could have greater sensitivity to the economic downturn with potentially longer recovery periods than other business lines. 

Lending operations and accommodations to borrowers 

The CARES Act created a new guaranteed, unsecured loan program under the SBA, called the Payroll Protection Program, or the PPP, which the Bank participates in, to fund operational costs of eligible businesses, organizations and self-employed persons during the pandemic period. Nearly $660 billion in funds have been authorized for the PPP, which the SBA has used to guarantee 

100% of the amounts loaned under the PPP by lenders to eligible small businesses, nonprofits, veterans' organizations, and tribal businesses. One of the notable features of the PPP is that borrowers are eligible for loan forgiveness if borrowers maintain their staff and payroll and if loan amounts are used to cover eligible expenses, such as payroll, mortgage interest, rents and utilities payments. These loans have a two-year term and will earn interest at a rate of 1%. The Company assisted our customers with applications for resources through the program and approved over 4,700 applications. As of June 30, 2020 , the outstanding balance of loans originated under the PPP totaled $1.7 billion . 

The CARES Act permits financial institutions to suspend requirements under GAAP for loan modifications to borrowers affected by COVID-19 and is intended to provide interpretive guidance as to conditions that would constitute a short-term modification that would not meet the definition of a TDR. This includes the following (i) the loan modification is made between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of December 31, 2020 or 60 days after the end of the coronavirus emergency declaration, and (ii) the applicable loan was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019. The Company is applying this guidance to qualifying loan modifications and has implemented modifications meeting these conditions on approximately 600 loans, with an outstanding balance of $2.7 billion as of June 30, 2020 . We anticipate that short-term modifications related to the impact of COVID-19 will continue to increase. Further, the Company also has granted forbearance requests on approximately 300 residential mortgage loans, with an outstanding balance of $180.0 million as of June 30, 2020 . 

The MSLP supports lending to small and medium-sized businesses that were in sound financial condition before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The MSLP operates through three facilities: the Main Street New Loan Facility, the Main Street Priority Loan Facility, and the Main Street Expanded Loan Facility. The Federal Reserve is currently working to refine the MSLP&#8217;s operational infrastructure and facilities and is expected to release further rules and operational guidance. The Bank has registered as a lender under the MSLP and continues to monitor developments related thereto. 

Capital and liquidity 

While the Company has sufficient capital and does not anticipate any need for additional liquidity in response to the uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has taken several actions to ensure the strength of its capital and liquidity position. These actions include issuance of $225 million in subordinated debt, establishing a Federal Reserve lending facility in connection with funding loans to small and medium-sized businesses, and temporarily suspending stock repurchases from April 17, 2020 through the end of the second quarter 2020. In addition, the Company is also in a position to pledge additional collateral to increase its borrowing capacity with the FRB, if necessary. Further, management has elected to take advantage of the capital relief option that delays the estimated impact on regulatory capital by up to two years, with a three-year transition period to phase out the cumulative benefit to regulatory capital provided during the two-year delay. 

Asset valuation 

While the Company&#8217;s stock price has experienced a recent decline in value, management does not consider this decline to be a triggering event that would indicate that an interim goodwill impairment test was necessary as of June 30, 2020 . Continued and sustained declines in the Company's stock price and/or other credit related impacts could give rise to triggering events in the future that could result in a write-down in the value of our goodwill, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 

Our processes, controls and business continuity plan 

The Company has focused first on ensuring the well-being of our people, customers, and communities. Preventive health measures were put in place and the majority of employees worked remotely for the majority of the second quarter. The Company also established social distancing precautions for all employees in the office and customers visiting branches, preventive cleaning at offices and branches, and eliminated business-related travel. Near the end of the second quarter, the Company began returning employees to some of our offices pursuant to applicable health and safety procedures and in accordance with guidance from the CDC and local authorities, including regular symptom checks, requiring face cloth coverings in certain areas, increasing physical space between employees, staggering employee shifts and alternating schedules for employees in the workplace, and requiring employees with COVID-19 related symptoms or exposure to quarantine away from the office. 

The Company has also concentrated on implementing additional business continuity measures that include establishing a cross-functional COVID-19 team, monitoring potential business interruptions, making improvements to our remote working technology, and conducting regular discussions with our technology vendors. We have not experienced significant disruption to our business as we have been able to facilitate remote work for our employees and have online tools in place for our customers. We believe that we are positioned to continue these business continuity measures for the foreseeable future; however, no assurances can be provided as these circumstances may change depending on the duration of the pandemic. 

Included at the end of this section are updates to the Supervision and Regulation discussion disclosed in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 .

Asset Quality 

For all banks and bank holding companies, asset quality plays a significant role in the overall financial condition of the institution and results of operations. The Company measures asset quality in terms of nonaccrual loans as a percentage of gross loans and net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans. Net charge-offs are calculated as the difference between charged-off loans and recovery payments received on previously charged-off loans. The following table summarizes the Company's key asset quality metrics:

Asset and Deposit Growth 

The Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities are comprised primarily of loans and deposits. Therefore, the ability to originate new loans and attract new deposits is fundamental to the Company&#8217;s growth. 

Total assets increased to $31.9 billion at June 30, 2020 from $26.8 billion at December 31, 2019 . The increase in total assets of $5.1 billion , or 19.0% , relates primarily to loan growth. Total loans increased by $3.9 billion , or 18.5% , to $25.0 billion as of June 30, 2020 , compared to $21.1 billion as of December 31, 2019 . The increase in loans from December 31, 2019 , which includes $1.7 billion in PPP loans, was driven by commercial and industrial loans of $3.4 billion , with smaller increases in residential real estate, construction and land development, and CRE, non-owner occupied loans of $257.2 million , $245.4 million , and $98.6 million , respetively. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in CRE, owner occupied loans of $59.8 million . 

Total deposits increased $4.7 billion , or 20.8% , to $27.5 billion as of June 30, 2020 from $22.8 billion as of December 31, 2019 . The increase in deposits from December 31, 2019 was driven by an increase of $3.7 billion in non-interest bearing demand deposits, $747.2 million in interest bearing demand deposits, and $702.5 million in savings and money market accounts. These increases were offset in part by a decrease in certificates of deposit of $399.7 million .

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

The following discussion and analysis contains financial information determined by methods other than those prescribed by GAAP. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in their analysis of the Company's performance. These measurements typically adjust GAAP performance measures to exclude the effects of certain significant activities or transactions that, in management's opinion, do not reflect recurring period-to-period comparisons of the Company's performance. Management believes presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a complete understanding of the operating results of the Company's core businesses. Since the presentation of these non-GAAP performance measures and their impact differ between companies, these non-GAAP disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. 

Operating Pre-Provision Net Revenue 

Operating PPNR is defined by the Federal Reserve in SR 14-3, which requires companies subject to the rule to project PPNR over the planning horizon for each of the economic scenarios defined annually by the regulators. Banking regulations define PPNR as net interest income plus non-interest income less non-interest expense. Management has further adjusted this metric to exclude any non-recurring or non-operational elements of non-interest income or non-interest expense, which are outlined in the table below. Management believes that this is an important metric as it illustrates the underlying performance of the Company, it enables investors and others to assess the Company's ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through the credit cycle, and provides consistent reporting with a key metric used by bank regulatory agencies. 

The following table shows the components of operating PPNR for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 :

Tangible Common Equity 

The following table presents financial measures related to tangible common equity. Tangible common equity represents total stockholders' equity, less identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. Management believes that tangible common equity financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company's capital strength, financial condition, and ability to manage potential losses. In addition, management believes that these measures improve comparability to other institutions that have not engaged in acquisitions that resulted in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets.

Regulatory Capital 

The following table presents certain financial measures related to regulatory capital under Basel III, which includes common equity tier 1 and total capital. The FRB and other banking regulators use common equity tier 1 and total capital as a basis for assessing a bank's capital adequacy; therefore, management believes it is useful to assess financial condition and capital adequacy using this same basis. Specifically, the total capital ratio takes into consideration the risk levels of assets and off-balance sheet financial instruments. In addition, management believes that the classified assets to common equity tier 1 plus allowance measure is an important regulatory metric for assessing asset quality. 

As permitted by the regulatory capital rules, the Company elected to delay the estimated impact of CECL on its regulatory capital over a five-year transition period ending December 31, 2024. As a result, capital ratios and amounts as of June 30, 2020 exclude the impact of the increased allowance for credit losses related to the adoption of ASC 326.

Upon adoption of ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, the allowance for credit losses has been modified to also include amounts related to unfunded loan commitments and investment securities. Prior period amounts have been restated to conform to current presentation. 

Net Interest Margin 

The net interest margin is reported on a TEB. A tax equivalent adjustment is added to reflect interest earned on certain securities and loans that are exempt from federal and state income tax. The following tables set forth the average balances, interest income, interest expense, and average yield (on a fully TEB) for the periods indicated:

Changes attributable to both volume and rate are designated as volume changes. 

Comparison of interest income, interest expense and net interest margin 

The Company's primary source of revenue is interest income. For the three months ended June 30, 2020 , interest income was $318.2 million , an increase of $15.4 million , or 5.1% , compared to $302.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 . This increase was primarily the result of a $6.1 billion increase in the average loan balance, which drove a $19.2 million increase in loan interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2020 . This increase was offset in part by a decrease in other interest income from federal funds sold of $3.2 million and a decrease in interest income from investment securities of $0.6 million for the comparable period due to a decrease in interest rates from June 30, 2019 , which outweighed the increases in the related average asset balances. 

For the six months ended June 30, 2020 , interest income was $625.5 million , an increase of $31.4 million , or 5.3% , compared to $594.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 . This increase was primarily the result of a $4.9 billion increase in the average loan balance, which drove a $37.3 million increase in loan interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2020 . This increase was offset in part by a decrease in other interest income from federal funds sold of $3.4 million and a decrease in interest income from investment securities of $2.4 million for the comparable period due to a decrease in interest rates from June 30, 2019 , which outweighed the increases in the related average asset balances. 

For the three months ended June 30, 2020 , interest expense was $19.8 million , a decrease of $28.3 million , or 58.8% , compared to $48.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 . Interest expense on deposits decreased $26.9 million for the same period despite an increase in average interest-bearing deposits of $2.6 billion as repricing efforts in a lower rate environment drove a 95 basis point reduction in average cost of interest-bearing deposits. 

For the six months ended June 30, 2020 , interest expense was $58.0 million , a decrease of $34.0 million , or 36.9% , compared to $92.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 . Interest expense on deposits decreased $30.2 million for the same period despite an increase in average interest-bearing deposits of $2.7 billion as repricing efforts in a lower rate environment drove a 64 basis point reduction in average cost of interest-bearing deposits. 

For the three months ended June 30, 2020 , net interest income was $298.4 million , an increase of $43.7 million , or 17.2% , compared to $254.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 . The increase in net interest income reflects a $6.5 billion increase in average interest-earning assets, partially offset by an increase of $2.9 billion in average interest-bearing liabilities. The decrease in net interest margin of 40 basis points to 4.19% is the result of decreased yields on loans and investment securities, partially offset by lower deposit and funding costs for the three months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 . 

For the six months ended June 30, 2020 , net interest income was $567.4 million , an increase of $65.4 million , or 13.0% , compared to $502.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 . The increase in net interest income reflects a $5.5 billion increase in average interest-earning assets, partially offset by an increase of $2.8 billion in average interest-bearing liabilities. The decrease in net interest margin of 45 basis points to 4.20% is the result of decreased yields on loans and investment securities, partially offset by lower deposit and funding costs for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 . 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses in each period is reflected as a reduction in earnings for that period and, upon the adoption of CECL, includes amounts related to funded loans, unfunded loan commitments, and investment securities. The provision is equal to the amount required to maintain the allowance for credit losses at a level that is adequate to absorb estimated lifetime credit losses inherent in the loan and investment securities portfolios. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , the provision for credit losses was $92.0 million and $143.2 million , compared to $7.0 million and $11.5 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , respectively. The significant increase in the provision for credit losses from the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 is primarily related to the current economic environment and estimating expected credit losses under the new CECL accounting standard. This standard changes the methodology for estimating credit losses on financial instruments from an incurred loss model to an expected total loss model. This results in the recognition of expected losses over the life of loans and HTM investment securities at the time that the loan is originated or the security is purchased, rather than after a loss has been incurred, which results in an acceleration in the timing of loss recognition. Further, as the Company's CECL models incorporate historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts in measuring expected credit losses, the worsening of economic assumptions due to the ongoing pandemic has also contributed to an increased provision for credit losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 .

Total non-interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 increased by $7.1 million . The increase in non-interest income is due primarily to an increase in income from bank owned life insurance of $5.7 million as the Company received a one-time enhancement fee of $5.6 million from surrender and replacement of certain policies, which was intended to offset an increase in tax expense related to the surrender. In addition, the net fair value gain adjustment on assets measured at fair value was $4.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020 , compared to $1.6 million for the same period in 2019 , which predominately relates to valuation increases on preferred stock holdings of other banking companies after a significant decline in value during the three months ended March 31, 2020. These increases were offset in part by a $1.1 million decrease in other non-interest income from the three months ended June 30, 2019 due to a decrease in rental income on equipment leases. 

Total non-interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 decreased by $3.2 million . The decrease in non-interest income is due primarily a net fair value loss adjustment of $6.9 million incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2020 , which predominantly relates to valuation declines on preferred stock holdings of other banking companies. This decrease was offset in part by an increase in income from bank owned life insurance of $5.7 million primarily attributable to a one-time enhancement fee discussed above and an increase of $2.2 million in income from equity investments primarily related to an increase in income from SBIC investments.

Total non-interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2020 was relatively flat compared to the same period in 2019 , which increased $0.6 million . This increase primarily relates to salaries and employee benefits and data processing, which have increased as the Company supports its continued growth. These increases were offset in part by a decrease in deposit costs of $4.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 , primarily related to a decrease in deposit earnings credits paid to account holders in a lower rate environment. 

Total non-interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 increased $9.2 million, or 4.0% . This increase primarily relates to salaries and employee benefits, data processing, and legal, professional and directors' fees, which have increased as the Company supports its continued growth. These increases were offset in part by a decrease in deposit costs of $2.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 , primarily related to a decrease in deposit earnings credits paid to account holders in a lower rate environment. 

Income Taxes 

The Company's effective tax rate was 17.36% and 16.76% for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 , the Company's effective tax rate was 17.70% and 17.10% , respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate from the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 is due primarily to tax expense associated with a surrender of bank owned life insurance and increased state tax accruals, partially offset by increases in forecasted tax-exempt income and investment tax credits in 2020. 

Business Segment Results 

The Company's reportable segments are aggregated primarily based on geographic location, services offered, and markets served. The Company's regional segments, which include Arizona, Nevada, Southern California, and Northern California, provide full service banking and related services to their respective markets. The Company's NBL segments, which include HOA Services, Public &#38; Nonprofit Finance, Technology &#38; Innovation, HFF, and Other NBLs, provide specialized banking services to niche markets. These NBLs are managed centrally and are broader in geographic scope than the Company's other segments, though still predominately located within the Company's core market areas. The Corporate &#38; Other segment consists of corporate-related items, income and expense items not allocated to the Company's other reportable segments, and inter-segment eliminations.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS 

Total assets increased $5.1 billion , or 19.0% , to $31.9 billion at June 30, 2020 , compared to $26.8 billion at December 31, 2019 . The increase in total assets relates primarily to organic loan growth. Loans increased $3.9 billion , or 18.5% , to $25.0 billion at June 30, 2020 , compared to $21.1 billion at December 31, 2019 . The increase in loans from December 31, 2019 , which includes $1.7 billion in PPP loans, was driven by commercial and industrial loans of $3.4 billion , with smaller increases in residential real estate loans of $257.2 million , construction and land development loans of $245.4 million , and CRE, non-owner occupied loans of $98.6 million . These increases were partially offset by a decrease in CRE, owner occupied loans of $59.8 million . 

Total liabilities increased $5.0 billion , or 21.0% , to $28.8 billion at June 30, 2020 , compared to $23.8 billion at December 31, 2019 . The increase in liabilities is due primarily to an increase in total deposits of $4.7 billion , or 20.8% , to $27.5 billion . The increase in deposits from December 31, 2019 was driven by increases of $3.7 billion in non-interest bearing demand deposits, $747.2 million in interest bearing demand deposits, and $702.5 million in savings and money market accounts, partially offset by a decrease of $399.7 million in certificates of deposit. In addition, qualifying debt increased by $224.2 million due to issuance of $225.0 million of subordinated debt, recorded net of issue costs, during the three months ended June 30, 2020. 

Total stockholders&#8217; equity increased by $85.7 million , or 2.8% , to $3.1 billion at June 30, 2020 from December 31, 2019 . The increase in stockholders' equity is primarily a function of net income, partially offset by share repurchases and dividends to shareholders as well as the adoption impact of CECL. 

Investment securities 

Debt securities are classified at the time of acquisition as either HTM, AFS, or trading based upon various factors, including asset/liability management strategies, liquidity and profitability objectives, and regulatory requirements. HTM securities are carried at amortized cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts. AFS securities are securities that may be sold prior to maturity based upon asset/liability management decisions. Investment securities classified as AFS are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains or losses on AFS debt securities are recorded as part of AOCI in stockholders&#8217; equity, net of tax. Amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts on MBS is periodically adjusted for estimated prepayments. Trading securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in current period earnings. 

The Company's investment securities portfolio is utilized as collateral for borrowings, required collateral for public deposits and customer repurchase agreements, and to manage liquidity, capital, and interest rate risk. 

The following table summarizes the carrying value of the investment securities portfolio for each of the periods below:

Troubled Debt Restructured Loans 

A TDR loan is a loan on which the Company, for reasons related to a borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that the Company would not otherwise consider. The loan terms that have been modified or restructured due to a borrower&#8217;s financial situation include, but are not limited to, a reduction in the stated interest rate, an extension of the maturity or renewal of the loan at an interest rate below current market, a reduction in the face amount of the debt, a reduction in the accrued interest, or deferral of interest payments. The majority of the Company's modifications are extensions in terms or deferral of payments which result in no lost principal or interest followed by reductions in interest rates or accrued interest. Consistent with regulatory guidance, a TDR loan that is subsequently modified in another restructuring agreement but has shown sustained performance and classification as a TDR, will be removed from TDR status provided that the modified terms were market-based at the time of modification.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

Goodwill represents the excess consideration paid for net assets acquired in a business combination over their fair value. Goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are determined to have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortization, but are subsequently evaluated for impairment at least annually. The Company has goodwill and intangible assets totaling $296.9 million at June 30, 2020 , which have been allocated to the Nevada, Northern California, Technology &#38; Innovation, and HFF operating segments. 

The Company performs its annual goodwill and intangibles impairment tests as of October 1 each year, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 , there were no events or circumstances that indicated an interim impairment test of goodwill or other intangible assets was necessary. 

Deferred Tax Assets 

As of June 30, 2020 , the net deferred tax asset was $34.1 million , an increase of $16.0 million from December 31, 2019 . This overall increase in the net deferred tax asset was primarily the result of an increase in the allowance for credit losses under the new CECL accounting guidance, which upon adoption on January 1, 2020, increased the deferred tax asset by $8.7 million . 

At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , the Company had no deferred tax valuation allowance. 

Deposits 

Deposits are the primary source for funding the Company's asset growth. Total deposits increased to $27.5 billion at June 30, 2020 , from $22.8 billion at December 31, 2019 , an increase of $4.7 billion , or 20.8% . The increase in deposits is attributable to an increase across most deposit types, with the largest increases in non-interest bearing demand deposits of $3.7 billion , interest bearing demand deposits of $747.2 million , and $702.5 million in savings and money market accounts, partially offset by a decrease of $399.7 million in certificates of deposit. 

WAB is a participant in the Promontory Interfinancial Network, a network that offers deposit placement services such as CDARS and ICS, which offer products that qualify large deposits for FDIC insurance. At each of the periods ended June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , the Company also has $1.1 billion of wholesale brokered deposits. In addition, deposits for which the Company provides account holders with earnings credits and referral fees totaled $5.3 billion and $3.1 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. The Company incurred $3.1 million and $7.4 million in deposit related costs during the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. The Company incurred $10.2 million and $12.9 million in deposit related costs during the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 , respectively.

Other Borrowings 

The Company from time to time utilizes short-term borrowed funds to support short-term liquidity needs generally created by increased loan demand. The majority of these short-term borrowed funds consist of advances from the FHLB and customer repurchase agreements. The Company&#8217;s borrowing capacity with the FHLB is determined based on collateral pledged, generally consisting of securities and loans. In addition, the Company has borrowing capacity from other sources, collateralized by securities, including securities sold under agreements to repurchase, which are reflected at the amount of cash received in connection with the transaction, and may require additional collateral based on the fair value of the underlying securities. At June 30, 2020 , total short-term borrowed funds consist of FHLB advances of $10.0 million and customer repurchase agreements of $25.4 million . At December 31, 2019 , total short-term borrowed funds consisted of customer repurchase agreements of $16.7 million . 

Qualifying Debt 

Qualifying debt consists of subordinated debt and junior subordinated debt, inclusive of issuance costs and fair market value adjustments. At June 30, 2020 , the carrying value of qualifying debt was $617.7 million , compared to $393.6 million at December 31, 2019 . The increase in qualifying debt from December 31, 2019 is due to issuance of $225.0 million of subordinated debt, recorded net of issue costs, during the three months ended June 30, 2020. 

Capital Resources 

The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could trigger certain mandatory or discretionary actions that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company&#8217;s business and financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items (discussed in " Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies " to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements) as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. 

In March 2020, the federal bank regulatory authorities issued an interim final rule that delays the estimated impact on regulatory capital resulting from the adoption of CECL. The interim final rule provides banking organizations that implement CECL before the end of 2020 the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital relative to regulatory capital determined under the prior incurred loss methodology, followed by a three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of capital benefit provided during the initial two-year delay. The Company has elected the five-year CECL transition option in connection with its adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020. As a result, capital ratios and amounts as of June 30, 2020 exclude the impact of the increased allowance for credit losses related to the adoption of ASC 326. 

As of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , the Company and the Bank exceeded the capital levels necessary to be classified as well-capitalized, as defined by the banking agencies. The actual capital amounts and ratios for the Company and the Bank are presented in the following tables as of the periods indicated:

Critical Accounting Policies 

Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The critical accounting policies upon which the Company's financial condition and results of operations depend, and which involve the most complex subjective decisions or assessments, are included in the discussion entitled "Critical Accounting Policies" in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 , and all amendments thereto, as filed with the SEC. 

During the first quarter of 2020, the Company adopted the ASUs related to credit losses, which include ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , ASU 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments, ASU 2019-05, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, and ASU 2019-11, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments&#8212;Credit Losses . The new standards significantly change the impairment model for most financial assets that are measured at amortized cost, including off-balance sheet credit exposures, from an incurred loss model to an expected loss model. The amendments in ASU 2016-13 require that an organization measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. In future periods, evaluations of the overall loan portfolio, in light of the factors and forecasts then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses and credit loss expense in those future periods. The allowance level is influenced by loan volumes, loan asset quality ratings, delinquency status, historical credit loss experience, loan performance characteristics, and other conditions influencing loss expectations, such as reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. Changes to the assumptions in the model in future periods could have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. See " Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies " for a detailed discussion of the Company's methodologies for estimating expected credit losses. 

There were no other material changes to the critical accounting policies disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 . 

Liquidity 

Liquidity is the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, fund asset growth and business operations, and meet contractual obligations through unconstrained access to funding at reasonable market rates. Liquidity management involves forecasting funding requirements and maintaining sufficient capacity to meet the needs and accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to changes in the Company's business operations or unanticipated events, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 

The ability to have readily available funds sufficient to repay fully maturing liabilities is of primary importance to depositors, creditors, and regulators. The Company's liquidity, represented by cash and amounts due from banks, federal funds sold, and non-pledged marketable securities, is a result of the Company's operating, investing, and financing activities and related cash flows. In order to ensure funds are available when necessary, on at least a quarterly basis, the Company projects the amount of funds that will be required over a twelve-month period and it also strives to maintain relationships with a diversified customer base. Liquidity requirements can also be met through short-term borrowings or the disposition of short-term assets. 

While the Company does not anticipate any need for additional liquidity, in response to the uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has taken several actions to ensure the strength of its liquidity position. These actions include establishing a $1.8 billion Federal Reserve lending facility in connection with funding loans to small and medium-sized businesses and suspending stock repurchases from April 17, 2020 through the end of the second quarter 2020. In addition, the Company is also in a position to pledge additional collateral to increase its borrowing capacity with the FRB, if necessary. 

The following table presents the available and outstanding balances on the Company's lines of credit:

The Company has a formal liquidity policy and, in the opinion of management, its liquid assets are considered adequate to meet cash flow needs for loan funding and deposit cash withdrawals for the next 90-120 days. At June 30, 2020 , there was $4.1 billion in liquid assets, comprised of $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $2.6 billion in unpledged marketable securities. At December 31, 2019 , the Company maintained $2.9 billion in liquid assets, comprised of $434.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and $2.5 billion of unpledged marketable securities. 

The Parent maintains liquidity that would be sufficient to fund its operations and certain non-bank affiliate operations for an extended period should funding from normal sources be disrupted. Since deposits are taken by WAB and not by the Parent, Parent liquidity is not dependent on the Bank's deposit balances. In the Company's analysis of Parent liquidity, it is assumed that the Parent is unable to generate funds from additional debt or equity issuances, receives no dividend income from subsidiaries and does not pay dividends to stockholders, while continuing to make non-discretionary payments needed to maintain operations and repayment of contractual principal and interest payments owed by the Parent and affiliated companies. Under this scenario, the amount of time the Parent and its non-bank subsidiary can operate and meet all obligations before the current liquid assets are exhausted is considered as part of the Parent liquidity analysis. Management believes the Parent maintains adequate liquidity capacity to operate without additional funding from new sources for over twelve months. 

WAB maintains sufficient funding capacity to address large increases in funding requirements, such as deposit outflows. This capacity is comprised of liquidity derived from a reduction in asset levels and various secured funding sources. On a long-term basis, the Company&#8217;s liquidity will be met by changing the relative distribution of its asset portfolios (for example, by reducing investment or loan volumes, or selling or encumbering assets). Further, the Company can increase liquidity by soliciting higher levels of deposit accounts through promotional activities and/or borrowing from correspondent banks, the FHLB of San Francisco, and the FRB. At June 30, 2020 , the Company's long-term liquidity needs primarily relate to funds required to support loan originations, commitments, and deposit withdrawals, which can be met by cash flows from investment payments and maturities, and investment sales, if necessary. 

The Company&#8217;s liquidity is comprised of three primary classifications: 1) cash flows provided by operating activities; 2) cash flows used in investing activities; and 3) cash flows provided by financing activities. Net cash provided by or used in operating activities consists primarily of net income, adjusted for changes in certain other asset and liability accounts and certain non-cash income and expense items, such as the provision for credit losses, investment and other amortization and depreciation. For the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 , net cash provided by operating activities was $283.4 million and $330.3 million , respectively. 

The Company's primary investing activities are the origination of real estate and commercial loans, the collection of repayments of these loans, and the purchase and sale of securities. The Company's net cash provided by and used in investing activities has been primarily influenced by its loan and securities activities. The net increase in loans for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 was $3.8 billion and $1.5 billion , respectively. There was a net decrease in investment securities for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 of $164.8 million and $69.9 million , respectively. 

Net cash provided by financing activities has been impacted significantly by increased deposit levels. During the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 , net deposits increased $4.7 billion and $2.3 billion , respectively. 

Fluctuations in core deposit levels may increase the Company's need for liquidity as certificates of deposit mature or are withdrawn before maturity, and as non-maturity deposits, such as checking and savings account balances, are withdrawn. Additionally, the Company is exposed to the risk that customers with large deposit balances will withdraw all or a portion of such deposits, due in 

part to the FDIC limitations on the amount of insurance coverage provided to depositors. To mitigate the uninsured deposit risk, the Company participates in the CDARS and ICS programs, which allow an individual customer to invest up to $50.0 million and $150.0 million, respectively, through one participating financial institution or, a combined total of $200.0 million per individual customer, with the entire amount being covered by FDIC insurance. As of June 30, 2020 , the Company has $445.3 million of CDARS and $902.2 million of ICS deposits. 

As of June 30, 2020 , the Company has $1.1 billion of wholesale brokered deposits outstanding. Brokered deposits are generally considered to be deposits that have been received from a third party who is engaged in the business of placing deposits on behalf of others. A traditional deposit broker will direct deposits to the banking institution offering the highest interest rate available. Federal banking laws and regulations place restrictions on depository institutions regarding brokered deposits because of the general concern that these deposits are not relationship based and are at a greater risk of being withdrawn and placed on deposit at another institution offering a higher interest rate, thus posing liquidity risk for institutions that gather brokered deposits in significant amounts. 

Federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid. The total amount of dividends which may be paid at any date is generally limited to the retained earnings of the bank. Dividends paid by WAB to the Parent would be prohibited if the effect thereof would cause the Bank&#8217;s capital to be reduced below applicable minimum capital requirements. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , WAB paid dividends to the Parent of $35.0 million and $130.0 million , respectively. Subsequent to June 30, 2020 , WAB paid dividends to the Parent of $15.0 million . 

Recent accounting pronouncements 

See " Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ," of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1. Financial Statements for information on recent and recently adopted accounting pronouncements and their expected impact, if any, on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Supervision and Regulation 

The following information is intended to update, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained under the caption &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K and the supplemental disclosure related thereto contained under the same caption in the Company&#8217;s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020. 

CARES Act 

On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was passed by Congress and signed into law by the President. The CARES Act provided approximately $2.2 trillion in direct economic relief in response to the public health and economic impacts of COVID-19. Many of the CARES Act&#8217;s programs are, and remain, dependent upon the direct involvement of U.S. financial institutions like the Company and the Bank. These programs have been implemented through rules and guidance adopted by federal departments and agencies, including the U.S. Department of Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and other federal bank regulatory authorities, including those with direct supervisory jurisdiction over the Company and the Bank. Furthermore, as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, federal regulatory authorities continue to issue additional guidance with respect to the implementation, lifecycle, and eligibility requirements for the various CARES Act programs as well as industry-specific recovery procedures for COVID-19. In addition, it is possible that Congress will enact supplementary COVID-19 response legislation, including new bills comparable in scope to the CARES Act, prior to the end of 2020. 

Set forth below is a brief overview of select provisions of the CARES Act and other regulations and supervisory guidance related to the COVID-19 pandemic that are applicable to the operations and activities of the Company and its subsidiaries, including the Bank. The following description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the CARES Act and the statutes, regulations, and policies described herein. Future legislation and/or amendments to the provisions of the CARES Act or changes to any of the statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries could have a material effect on the Company. Such legislation and related regulations and supervisory guidance will be implemented over time and will remain subject to review by Congress and the implementing regulations issued by federal regulatory authorities. The Company continues to assess the impact of the CARES Act, the potential impact of new COVID-19 legislation, and other statutes, regulations, and supervisory guidance related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Paycheck Protection Program . The CARES Act amended the SBA&#8217;s loan program, in which the Bank participates, to create a guaranteed, unsecured loan program, the PPP, to fund operational costs of eligible businesses, organizations and self-employed persons during COVID-19. On June 5, 2020, the President signed the PPPFA into law, which among other things, gave borrowers additional time and flexibility to use PPP loan proceeds. Shortly thereafter, and due to the evolving impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the President signed additional legislation authorizing the SBA to resume accepting PPP applications on July 6, 2020 and extending the PPP application deadline to August 8, 2020. It is anticipated that additional revisions to the SBA&#8217;s interim final rules on forgiveness and loan review procedures will be forthcoming to address these and related changes. As a participating lender in the PPP, the Bank continues to monitor legislative, regulatory, and supervisory developments related thereto. 

Troubled Debt Restructuring and Loan Modifications for Affected Borrowers . The CARES Act permits banks to suspend requirements under GAAP for loan modifications to borrowers affected by COVID-19 that would otherwise be characterized as TDRs and suspend any determination related thereto if (i) the loan modification is made between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of December 31, 2020 or 60 days after the end of the COVID-19 emergency declaration, and (ii) the applicable loan was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019. Federal bank regulatory authorities also issued guidance to encourage banks to make loan modifications for borrowers affected by COVID-19 and to assure banks that they will not be criticized by examiners for doing so. 

Federal Reserve Programs and Other Recent Initiatives 

Main Street Lending Program . The CARES Act encouraged the Federal Reserve, in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury, to establish or implement various programs to help midsize businesses, nonprofits, and municipalities. On April 9, 2020, the Federal Reserve proposed the creation of the MSLP to implement certain of these recommendations. On June 15, 2020, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston opened the MSLP for lender registration. The MSLP supports lending to small and medium-sized businesses that were in sound financial condition before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The MSLP operates through three facilities: the Main Street New Loan Facility, the Main Street Priority Loan Facility, and the Main Street Expanded Loan Facility. The Federal Reserve is currently working to refine the MSLP&#8217;s operational infrastructure and facilities and is expected to release further rules and operational guidance. The Bank has registered as a lender under the MSLP and continues to monitor developments related thereto. 

Temporary Regulatory Capital Relief related to Impact of CECL. Concurrent with enactment of the CARES Act, the federal bank regulatory authorities issued an interim final rule that delays the estimated impact on regulatory capital resulting from the adoption of CECL. The interim final rule provides banking organizations that implement CECL before the end of 2020 the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital relative to regulatory capital determined under the prior incurred loss methodology, followed by a three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of capital benefit provided during the initial two-year delay. The Company has elected this capital relief option. 

Supervisory Developments. On June 25, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that it would take several actions to ensure large banks remain resilient despite the ongoing economic impact of COVID-19. Specifically, in the third quarter, the Federal Reserve will require large banks to preserve capital by suspending share repurchases, capping dividend payments, and allowing dividends according to a formula based on recent income. The Company and the Bank continue to monitor these developments to assess what effect (if any) they will have, but do not anticipate any material impact at this time. 

Modification of the Volcker Rule. Also on June 25, 2020, the Federal Reserve - along with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the SEC - issued a final rule modifying the Volcker Rule&#8217;s prohibition on banking entities investing in or sponsoring hedge funds or private equity funds (&#8220;covered funds&#8221;). The Volcker Rule generally prohibits banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading and from acquiring or retaining ownership interests in, sponsoring or having certain relationships with a hedge fund or private equity fund. The final rule modifies three areas of the Volcker Rule by: (1) streamlining the covered funds portion of the rule; (2) addressing the extraterritorial treatment of certain foreign funds; and (3) permitting banking entities to offer financial services and engage in other activities that do not raise concerns that the Volcker Rule was intended to address. The new rule becomes effective October 1, 2020. The Company and the Bank are currently reviewing this new rule to determine what effect (if any) it will have, but do not anticipate any material impact at this time.
