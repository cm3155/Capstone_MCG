Asset Quality 

For all banks and bank holding companies, asset quality plays a significant role in the overall financial condition of the institution and results of operations. The Company measures asset quality in terms of non-accrual loans as a percentage of gross loans and net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans. Net charge-offs are calculated as the difference between charged-off loans and recovery payments received on previously charged-off loans. The following table summarizes the Company's key asset quality metrics:

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

The following discussion and analysis contains financial information determined by methods other than those prescribed by GAAP. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in their analysis of the Company's performance. These measurements typically adjust GAAP performance measures to exclude the effects of certain activities or transactions that, in management's opinion, do not reflect recurring period-to-period comparisons of the Company's performance. Management believes presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a complete understanding of the operating results of the Company's core businesses. Since the presentation of these non-GAAP performance measures and their impact differ between companies, these non-GAAP disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. 

Operating Pre-Provision Net Revenue 

Operating PPNR is defined by the Federal Reserve in SR 14-3, which requires companies subject to the rule to project PPNR over the planning horizon for each of the economic scenarios defined annually by the regulators. Banking regulations define PPNR as net interest income plus non-interest income less non-interest expense. Management has further adjusted this metric to exclude any non-recurring or non-operational elements of non-interest income or non-interest expense, which are outlined in the table below. Management believes that this is an important metric as it illustrates the underlying performance of the Company, enables investors and others to assess the Company's ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through the credit cycle, and provides consistent reporting with a key metric used by bank regulatory agencies. 

The following table shows the components of operating PPNR for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 :

Regulatory Capital 

The following table presents certain financial measures related to regulatory capital under Basel III, which includes Common Equity Tier 1 and total capital. The FRB and other banking regulators use Common Equity Tier 1 and total capital as a basis for assessing a bank's capital adequacy; therefore, management believes it is useful to assess financial condition and capital adequacy using this same basis. Specifically, the total capital ratio takes into consideration the risk levels of assets and off-balance sheet financial instruments. In addition, management believes that the classified assets to Common Equity Tier 1 plus allowance measure is an important regulatory metric for assessing asset quality.

##TABLE_END Comparison of interest income, interest expense and net interest margin 

The Company's primary source of revenue is interest income. For the year ended December 31, 2019 , interest income was $1.2 billion , an increase of $191.6 million , or 18.5% , compared to $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 . This increase was primarily the result of a $3.1 billion increase in the average loan balance that drove a $182.5 million increase in loan interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 . Interest income from investment securities increased by $4.2 million for the comparable period primarily due to an increase in the average investment balance of $230.0 million , partially offset by a decrease in interest rates from December 31, 2018 . Other interest income increased $4.9 million from the comparable period due primarily to an increase in interest-bearing cash account balances. Average yield on interest earning assets increased to 5.30% for the year ended December 31, 2019 , compared to 5.27% in 2018 , which was primarily the result of increased yields on the Company's interest-bearing cash accounts. 

For the year ended December 31, 2019 , interest expense was $184.6 million , compared to $117.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 . Interest expense on deposits increased $67.9 million for the same period as average interest-bearing deposits increased $2.6 billion , which was paired with a 35 -basis point increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits. Interest expense on short-term borrowings decreased by $2.0 million as a result of a $126.0 million decrease in average short-term borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 . Interest expense on qualifying debt increased by $1.1 million due to changes in related interest rate swap expense arising from fluctuations in interest rates. 

For the year ended December 31, 2019 , net interest income was $1.0 billion , compared to $915.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 . The increase in net interest income reflects a $3.5 billion increase in average interest earning assets, offset by a $2.5 billion increase in average interest-bearing liabilities. The decrease in net interest margin of 16 basis points compared to 2018 is the result of higher deposit and funding costs. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses on loans in each period is reflected as a reduction in earnings for that period. The provision is equal to the amount required to maintain the allowance for credit losses at a level that is adequate to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2019 , the provision for credit losses was $18.5 million , compared to $23.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 . The decrease in the provision was primarily due to a reduction in net charge-offs and loan mix. 

The Company may also establish an additional allowance for credit losses on PCI loans through provision for credit losses when impairment is determined as a result of lower than expected cash flows. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the allowance for credit losses on PCI loans was $0.1 million . For non-PCI loans, an additional allowance for credit losses is established when the remaining credit marks on these loans are lower than the Company's calculated allowance for similar types of organic loans. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the allowance for credit losses on non-PCI loans was $0.9 million and $3.4 million , respectively. 

The Company also records estimated losses on unfunded loan commitments, which are classified as non-interest expense, with corresponding reserves in other liabilities. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the Company recorded $0.8 million and $2.0 million , respectively, in non-interest expense for estimated losses on unfunded loan commitments. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the loss contingency for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit was $9.0 million and $8.2 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively.

##TABLE_END

Total non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018 , increased by $22.0 million , or 51.0% . The increase is due to sales of investment securities and fair value adjustments. The net gain on sales of investment securities of $3.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 was the result of a portfolio re-balancing initiative. The net loss on sales of investment securities of $7.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 relates to sales of low yielding investment securities, which were replaced with investment securities with shorter durations and higher yields, as well as losses on sales of equity securities. The net fair value gain on assets measured at fair value was $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 , compared to a net loss of $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 , which resulted from changes in the fair market value of the Company's equity securities. Other increases in non-interest income were due to increases in service charges and fees and other non-interest income. The increase in service charges and fees of $1.1 million is due to continued growth in the Company's deposit base, which increased $3.6 billion during the year ended December 31, 2019 . The increase in other non-interest income of $3.7 million is due primarily to an increase in rental income on equipment leases. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in lending income of $1.2 million due to fewer gains on the sale of loans compared to the same period in 2018.

##TABLE_END

Total non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018 , increased $57.1 million , or 13.4% . This increase primarily relates to salaries and employee benefits, deposit costs, legal, professional, and directors' fees, data processing, net loss on sales/valuations of repossessed and other assets, and occupancy expenses. Salaries and employee benefits have increased as the Company supports its continued growth through hiring and incentives. Full-time equivalent employees increased 2.7% to 1,835 during the year ended December 31, 2019 . Deposit costs consist of fees to the Promontory Interfinancial Network and others for reciprocal deposits as well as earnings credits on select deposits. The increase in deposit costs of $12.8 million for 2019 compared to 2018 relates primarily to an increase in deposit earnings credits paid to account holders due to a higher amount of deposits eligible for these credits. The increase to legal, professional, and directors' fees of $8.3 million largely relates to consulting projects aimed at the implementation of CECL and other technology initiatives that will help position the Company for continued growth. The net loss on sales/valuations of repossessed and other assets of $3.8 million primarily relates to valuation adjustments on OREO properties. The other significant increases to non-interest expense consist of increases in data processing and occupancy of $7.9 million and $3.1 million , respectively, which relate to the Company's support of its continued growth. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in other non-interest expense of $5.2 million , which primarily relates to a non-recurring charitable donation of $7.6 million made in 2018 as well as a decrease in FDIC insurance costs of $2.4 million due to the elimination of the FDIC assessment surcharge in the fourth quarter of 2018. The decrease in other non-interest expense was offset in part by a $3.2 million increase in depreciation expense on leased equipment. 

Income Taxes 

For the year s ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 the Company's effective tax rate was 17.39% , 14.61% , and 27.96% , respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate from 2018 to 2019 is due primarily to management's decision during the third quarter of 2018 to carryback its 2017 federal NOLs. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 2017 to 2018 is due primarily to the decrease in the federal statutory rate effective in 2018, a reduction in excise taxes, and management's decision during the third quarter 2018 to carryback its 2017 federal NOLs. The reduction in excise taxes from 2017 to 2018 resulted from not deferring WAB's 2018 dividend from BW Real Estate as was the case in 2017 . The Company's 2017 federal NOLs resulted from the acceleration of deductions into and deferral of revenue from 2017. As the federal income tax rate was higher in the years to which the carryback is applicable, a larger tax benefit results from the decision to carryback the 2017 federal NOLs, rather than carryforward these losses to future taxable years. 

Business Segment Results 

The Company's reportable segments are defined primarily based on geographic location, services offered, and markets served.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS 

Total assets increased $3.7 billion , or 16.1% , to $26.8 billion at December 31, 2019 compared to $23.1 billion at December 31, 2018 . The increase in total assets relates primarily to organic loan growth. Loans increased $3.4 billion , or 19.3% , to $21.1 billion at December 31, 2019 , compared to $17.7 billion at December 31, 2018 . The increase in loans from December 31, 2018 was driven by commercial and industrial loans of $1.6 billion , CRE, non-owner occupied loans of $1.0 billion , and residential real estate loans of $943.3 million . 

Total liabilities increased $3.3 billion , or 16.1% , to $23.8 billion at December 31, 2019 , compared to $20.5 billion at December 31, 2018 . The increase in liabilities is due primarily to an increase in total deposits. Total deposits increased $3.6 billion , or 18.9% , to $22.8 billion at December 31, 2019 . The increase in deposits from December 31, 2018 was driven by an increase in savings and money market deposits of $1.8 billion , non-interest-bearing demand deposit of $1.1 billion , and certificates of deposits of $542.0 million from December 31, 2018 . 

Total stockholders&#8217; equity increased by $403.0 million , or 15.4% , to $3.0 billion at December 31, 2019 compared to $2.6 billion at December 31, 2018 . The increase in stockholders' equity relates primarily to net income for the year ended December 31, 2019 and an increase in the fair value of the Company's AFS portfolio, which is recognized as part of AOCI, partially offset by share repurchases under its common stock repurchase plan and dividends paid to shareholders. 

Investment securities 

Debt securities are classified at the time of acquisition as either HTM, AFS, or trading based upon various factors, including asset/liability management strategies, liquidity and profitability objectives, and regulatory requirements. HTM securities are carried at amortized cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts. AFS securities are securities that may be sold prior to maturity based upon asset/liability management decisions. Investment securities classified as AFS are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains or losses on AFS securities are recorded as part of AOCI in stockholders&#8217; equity. Amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts on MBS is periodically adjusted for estimated prepayments. Trading securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in current period earnings. 

The Company's investment securities portfolio is utilized as collateral for borrowings, required collateral for public deposits and customer repurchase agreements, and to manage liquidity, capital, and interest rate risk. 

The following table summarizes the carrying value of the investment securities portfolio for each of the periods below:

##TABLE_END

Loans that are held for investment are stated at the amount of unpaid principal, adjusted for net deferred fees and costs, premiums and discounts, purchase accounting fair value adjustments, and an allowance for credit losses. Net deferred loan fees as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 total $47.7 million and $36.3 million , respectively, which is a reduction in the carrying value of loans. Net unamortized purchase premiums on secondary market loan purchases total $29.9 million and $2.0 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Total loans held for investment are also net of interest rate and credit marks on acquired loans, which are a net reduction in the carrying value of loans. Interest rate marks were $3.8 million and $7.1 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Credit marks were $6.5 million and $14.6 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 

As of December 31, 2019 , the Company also had $21.8 million of HFS loans. There were no HFS loans as of December 31, 2018 . 

The following table sets forth the amount of loans, including HFS loans, outstanding by type of loan as of December 31, 2019 that were contractually due in one year or less, more than one year and less than five years, and more than five years based on remaining scheduled repayments of principal. Lines of credit or other loans having no stated final maturity and no stated schedule of repayments are reported as due in one year or less. The table also presents an analysis of the rate structure for loans within the same maturity time periods. Actual cash flows from these loans may differ materially from contractual maturities due to prepayment, refinancing, or other factors.

##TABLE_END

As of December 31, 2019 , approximately $9.7 billion , or 67.6% , of total variable rate loans were subject to rate floors with a weighted average interest rate of 4.8% . At December 31, 2018 , approximately $8.3 billion , or 69.3% of total variable rate loans were subject to rate floors with a weighted average interest rate of 4.8% . At December 31, 2019 , total loans consisted of 68.2% with floating rates and 31.8% with fixed rates, compared to 67.3% with floating rates and 32.7% with fixed rates at December 31, 2018 . 

Concentrations of Lending Activities 

The Company monitors concentrations within four broad categories: product, collateral, geography, and industry. The Company&#8217;s loan portfolio includes significant credit exposure to the CRE market. At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , CRE related loans accounted for approximately 45% and 49% of total loans, respectively. Substantially all of these loans are secured by first liens with an initial loan to value ratio of generally not more than 75%. Approximately 31% and 36% of these CRE loans, excluding construction and land loans, were owner occupied at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 

Impaired loans 

A loan is identified as impaired when it is no longer probable that interest and principal will be collected according to the contractual terms of the original loan agreement. Impaired loans are measured for reserve requirements in accordance with ASC 310 based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or, as a practical expedient, at the loan's observable market price or the fair value of the collateral less applicable disposition costs if the loan is collateral dependent. The amount of an impairment reserve, if any, and any subsequent changes are charged against the allowance for credit losses. 

In addition to the Company's own internal loan review process, regulators may from time to time direct the Company to modify loan grades, loan impairment calculations, or loan impairment methodology. 

Total non-performing loans increased by $19.5 million , or 30.1% , at December 31, 2019 to $84.3 million from $64.8 million at December 31, 2018 .

Troubled Debt Restructured Loans 

A TDR loan is a loan that is granted a concession, for reasons related to a borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties, that the lender would not otherwise consider. The loan terms that have been modified or restructured due to a borrower&#8217;s financial situation include, but are not limited to, a reduction in the stated interest rate, an extension of the maturity or renewal of the loan at an interest rate below current market, a reduction in the face amount of the debt, a reduction in accrued interest, extensions, deferrals, renewals, and rewrites. A TDR loan is also considered impaired. Generally, a loan that is modified at an effective market rate of interest is no longer disclosed as a TDR in years subsequent to the restructuring if it is performing based on the terms specified by the restructuring agreement. However, such loans continue to be considered impaired. 

As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the aggregate amount of loans classified as impaired was $116.3 million and $112.3 million , respectively, a net increase of 3.6% . The total specific allowance for credit losses related to these loans was $2.8 million and $0.7 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The Company had $28.4 million and $36.5 million in loans classified as accruing restructured loans at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

Goodwill represents the excess consideration paid for net assets acquired in a business combination over their fair value. Goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are determined to have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortization, but are subsequently evaluated for impairment at least annually. The Company has goodwill of $289.9 million and intangible assets totaling $7.7 million as of December 31, 2019 , which have been allocated to the Nevada, Northern California, Technology &#38; Innovation, and HFF operating segments. 

The Company performs its annual goodwill and intangibles impairment tests as of October 1 each year, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. During the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , there were no events or circumstances that indicated an interim impairment test of goodwill or other intangible assets was necessary and, based on the Company's annual goodwill and intangibles impairment tests as of October 1 of each of these years, it was determined that goodwill and intangible assets are not impaired. 

The following is a summary of acquired intangible assets:

Deferred Tax Assets 

Net deferred tax assets decreased $14.0 million to $18.0 million from December 31, 2018 . This overall decrease in net deferred tax assets was primarily the result of increases in the fair market value of AFS securities. In addition, there was a large decrease to the overall estimated loss reserve, which was largely offset by increases to DTLs related to premises and equipment and income associated with tax credits for lease pass-through transactions (50(d) income). 

As of December 31, 2019 , the Company has no deferred tax valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2018 , the Company's deferred tax valuation allowance of $2.4 million related to net capital loss carryovers. 

Deposits 

Deposits are the primary source for funding the Company's asset growth. Total deposits increased to $22.8 billion at December 31, 2019 from $19.2 billion at December 31, 2018 , an increase of $3.6 billion , or 18.9% . The increase in deposits is attributable to an increase across all deposit types, with the largest increases in savings and money market deposits of $1.8 billion and non-interest-bearing demand deposits of $1.1 billion from December 31, 2018 . 

WAB is a participant in the Promontory Interfinancial Network, a network that offers deposit placement services such as CDARS and ICS, which offer products that qualify large deposits for FDIC insurance. At December 31, 2019 , the Company has $407.7 million of CDARS deposits and $661.8 million of ICS deposits, compared to $322.9 million of CDARS deposits and $706.9 million of ICS deposits at December 31, 2018 . At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the Company also has $1.1 billion and $718.2 million , respectively, of wholesale brokered deposits. 

In addition, deposits for which the Company provides account holders with earnings credits or referral fees totaled $3.1 billion and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The Company incurred $30.5 million and $18.0 million in deposit related costs on these deposits during the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. These costs are reported in deposit costs as part of non-interest expense. The increase in these costs relates to both an increase in deposits eligible for earnings credits, along with higher average earnings credits paid during the first half of 2019. 

The average balances and weighted average rates paid on deposits are presented below:

Other Borrowings 

The Company from time to time utilizes short-term borrowed funds to support short-term liquidity needs generally created by increased loan demand. The majority of these short-term borrowed funds consist of advances from the FHLB, Federal funds purchased, and customer repurchase agreements. The Company&#8217;s borrowing capacity with the FHLB is determined based on collateral pledged, generally consisting of securities and loans. In addition, the Company has borrowing capacity from other sources, including Federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase. Federal funds purchased are unsecured borrowings with other banks. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are collateralized by securities and are reflected at the amount of cash received in connection with the transaction, and may require additional collateral based on the fair value of the underlying securities. At December 31, 2019 , total short-term borrowed funds consist of customer repurchase agreements of $16.7 million . At December 31, 2018 , total short-term borrowed funds consisted of Federal funds purchased of $256.0 million , FHLB overnight advances of $235.0 million , and customer repurchase agreements of $22.4 million . 

Qualifying Debt 

Qualifying debt consists of subordinated debt and junior subordinated debt, inclusive of issuance costs and fair market value adjustments. At December 31, 2019 , the carrying value of all subordinated debt issuances, which includes the fair value of related hedges, was $319.2 million , compared to $299.4 million at December 31, 2018 . 

The junior subordinated debt has contractual balances and maturity dates as follows:

Capital Resources 

The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could trigger certain mandatory or discretionary actions that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company&#8217;s business and financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items (discussed in " Note 15. Commitments and Contingencies " to the Consolidated Financial Statements) as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. 

As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the Company and the Bank's capital ratios exceeded the well-capitalized thresholds, as defined by the banking agencies. The actual capital amounts and ratios for the Company and the Bank are presented in the following tables as of the periods indicated:

Common Stock Repurchase Plan 

On December 12, 2018, the Company announced that it had adopted a common stock repurchase plan, pursuant to which the Company was authorized to repurchase up to $250 million of its shares of common stock through December 31, 2019. The Company had $94.3 million in authorized common stock repurchase capacity that expired under the original program as of December 31, 2019. The Company's common stock repurchase program was renewed through December 2020, authorizing the Company to repurchase up to an additional $250.0 million of its outstanding common stock. 

Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The Company enters into contracts for services in the ordinary course of business that may require payment for services to be provided in the future and may contain penalty clauses for early termination of the contracts. To meet the financing needs of customers, the Company has financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, including commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. The Company has also committed to irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee the payments or distributions with respect to the holders of preferred securities of the Company's eight statutory business trusts to the extent that the trusts have not made such payments or distributions, including: 1) accrued and unpaid distributions; 2) the redemption price; and 3) upon a dissolution or termination of the trust, the lesser of the liquidation amount and all accrued and unpaid distributions and the amount of assets of the trust remaining available for distribution. The Company does not believe that these off-balance sheet arrangements have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. However, there can be no assurance that such arrangements will not have a future effect. 

The following table sets forth the Company's significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 :

Critical Accounting Policies 

The Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contain a discussion of the Company's significant accounting policies, including information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements, adoption of such policies, and the related impact of their adoption. The Company believes that certain of these policies, along with various estimates that it is required to make in recording its financial transactions, are important to have a complete understanding of the Company's financial position. In addition, these estimates require management to make complex and subjective judgments, many of which include matters with a high degree of uncertainty. The following is a summary of these critical accounting policies and significant estimates. 

Allowance for credit losses 

Credit risk is inherent in the business of extending loans and leases to borrowers, for which the Company must maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is established through a provision for credit losses recorded to expense. Loans are charged against the allowance for credit losses when management believes that the contractual principal or interest will not be collected. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The allowance is an amount believed adequate to absorb estimated probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectable, based on evaluation of the collectability of loans and prior credit loss experience, together with other factors. The Company formally re-evaluates and establishes the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis. 

The allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific allowance applies to impaired loans. For impaired collateral dependent loans, the reserve is calculated based on the collateral value, net of estimated disposition costs. Generally, the Company obtains independent collateral valuation analysis for each loan over a specified dollar threshold every 12 months. Loans not collateral dependent are evaluated based on the expected future cash flows discounted at the original contractual interest rate. 

The general allowance covers all non-impaired loans and incorporates several quantitative and qualitative factors, which are used for all of the Company's portfolio segments. Quantitative factors include company-specific, 10-year historical net charge-offs stratified by loans with similar characteristics. Qualitative factors include: 1) levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans; 2) levels of and trends in charge-offs and recoveries; 3) trends in volume and terms of loans; 4) changes in underwriting standards or lending policies; 5) experience, ability, depth of lending staff; 6) national and local economic trends and conditions; 7) changes in credit concentrations; 8) out-of-market exposures; 9) changes in quality of loan review system; and 10) changes in the value of underlying collateral. 

Due to the credit concentration of the Company's loan portfolio in real estate secured loans, the value of collateral is heavily dependent on real estate values in Arizona, Nevada, and California. While management uses the best information available to make its evaluation, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if there are significant changes in economic or other conditions. In addition, regulators, as an integral part of their examination processes, periodically review the Bank's allowance for credit losses, and may require the Bank to make additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examination. Management regularly reviews the assumptions and formulae used in determining the allowance and makes adjustments if required to reflect the current risk profile of the portfolio. 

Income taxes 

The Company&#8217;s income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management&#8217;s best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid. The Company is subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States. Significant judgments and estimates are required in the determination of the consolidated income tax expense. 

Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. In evaluating the Company's ability to recover its deferred tax assets in the jurisdictions from which they arise, all available positive and negative evidence is considered, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies, projected future taxable income, and recent operating results. The assumptions about future taxable income require the use of significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying business. 

Liquidity 

Liquidity is the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, fund asset growth and business operations, and meet contractual obligations through unconstrained access to funding at reasonable market rates. Liquidity management involves forecasting funding requirements and maintaining sufficient capacity to meet the needs and accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to changes in the Company's business operations or unanticipated events. 

The ability to have readily available funds sufficient to repay fully maturing liabilities is of primary importance to depositors, creditors, and regulators. The Company's liquidity, represented by cash and amounts due from banks, federal funds sold, and non-pledged marketable securities, is a result of the Company's operating, investing, and financing activities and related cash flows. In order to ensure that funds are available when necessary, on at least a quarterly basis, the Company projects the amount of funds that will be required over a 12-month period and it also strives to maintain relationships with a diversified customer base. Liquidity requirements can also be met through short-term borrowings or the disposition of short-term assets.

##TABLE_END

The Company has a formal liquidity policy and, in the opinion of management, its liquid assets are considered adequate to meet cash flow needs for loan funding and deposit cash withdrawals for the next 90-120 days. At December 31, 2019 , there is $2.9 billion in liquid assets, comprised of $434.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.5 billion in unpledged marketable securities. At December 31, 2018 , the Company maintained $3.0 billion in liquid assets, comprised of $498.6 million of cash, cash equivalents, and money market investments, and $2.5 billion in unpledged marketable securities. 

The Parent maintains liquidity that would be sufficient to fund its operations and certain non-bank affiliate operations for an extended period should funding from normal sources be disrupted. Since deposits are taken by WAB and not by the Parent, Parent liquidity is not dependent on the Bank's deposit balances. In the Company's analysis of Parent liquidity, it is assumed that the Parent is unable to generate funds from additional debt or equity issuances, receives no dividend income from subsidiaries and does not pay dividends to stockholders, while continuing to make nondiscretionary payments needed to maintain operations and repayment of contractual principal and interest payments owed by the Parent and affiliated companies. Under this scenario, the amount of time the Parent and its non-bank subsidiaries can operate and meet all obligations before the current liquid assets are exhausted is considered as part of the Parent liquidity analysis. Management believes the Parent maintains adequate liquidity capacity to operate without additional funding from new sources for over 12 months. 

WAB maintains sufficient funding capacity to address large increases in funding requirements, such as deposit outflows. This capacity is comprised of liquidity derived from a reduction in asset levels and various secured funding sources. On a long-term basis, the Company&#8217;s liquidity will be met by changing the relative distribution of its asset portfolios (for example, by reducing investment or loan volumes, or selling or encumbering assets). Further, the Company can increase liquidity by soliciting higher levels of deposit accounts through promotional activities and/or borrowing from the FHLB of San Francisco and the FRB. At December 31, 2019 , the Company's long-term liquidity needs primarily relate to funds required to support loan originations, commitments, and deposit withdrawals, which can be met by cash flows from investment payments and maturities, and investment sales, if necessary. 

The Company&#8217;s liquidity is comprised of three primary classifications: 1) cash flows provided by operating activities; 2) cash flows used in investing activities; and 3) cash flows provided by financing activities. Net cash provided by or used in operating activities consists primarily of net income, adjusted for changes in certain other asset and liability accounts and certain non-cash income and expense items, such as the provision for credit losses, investment and other amortization and depreciation. For the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , net cash provided by operating activities was $717.8 million , $541.0 million , and $383.8 million , respectively. 

The Company's primary investing activities are the origination of real estate and commercial loans, the collection of repayments of these loans, and the purchase and sale of securities. The Company's net cash provided by and used in investing activities has been primarily influenced by its loan and securities activities. The net increase in loans for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , was $3.4 billion , $2.6 billion , and $1.9 billion , respectively. The net increase in investment securities for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 was $109.5 million , $12.4 million , and $1.1 billion , respectively. 

Net cash provided by financing activities has been impacted significantly by increased deposit levels. During the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , net deposits increased $3.6 billion , $2.2 billion , and $2.4 billion , respectively. 

Fluctuations in core deposit levels may increase the Company's need for liquidity as certificates of deposit mature or are withdrawn before maturity, and as non-maturity deposits, such as checking and savings account balances, are withdrawn. Additionally, the Company is exposed to the risk that customers with large deposit balances will withdraw all or a portion of such deposits, due in part to the FDIC limitations on the amount of insurance coverage provided to depositors. To mitigate the uninsured deposit risk, the Company participates in the CDARS and ICS programs, which allow an individual customer to invest up to $50.0 million and $120.0 million, respectively, through one participating financial institution, or a combined total of $185.0 million per individual customer, with the entire amount being covered by FDIC insurance. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company has $407.7 million of CDARS and $661.8 million of ICS deposits. 

As of December 31, 2019 , the Company has $1.1 billion of wholesale brokered deposits outstanding. Brokered deposits are generally considered to be deposits that have been received from a third party who is engaged in the business of placing deposits on behalf of others. A traditional deposit broker will direct deposits to the banking institution offering the highest interest rate available. Federal banking laws and regulations place restrictions on depository institutions regarding brokered deposits because of the general concern that these deposits are not relationship based and are at a greater risk of being withdrawn and placed on deposit at another institution offering a higher interest rate, thus posing liquidity risk for institutions that gather brokered deposits in significant amounts. 

Federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid. The total amount of dividends that may be paid at any date is generally limited to the retained earnings of the bank. Dividends paid by WAB to the Parent would be prohibited if the effect thereof would cause the Bank&#8217;s capital to be reduced below applicable minimum capital requirements. During the year ended December 31, 2019 , WAB and LVSP paid dividends to the Parent of $130.0 million and $4.0 million , respectively. Subsequent to December 31, 2019 , WAB paid dividends to the Parent of $35.0 million .

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 

WAL, WAB, and certain of its non-banking subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive regulation under federal and state laws. The regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks is intended to protect depositors, the DIF, and the U.S. banking system as a whole. This system is not designed to protect equity investors in bank holding companies such as WAL. 

Set forth below is a summary of the significant laws and regulations applicable to WAL and its subsidiaries. The description that follows is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations, and policies that are described. Such statutes, regulations, and policies are subject to ongoing review by Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies. A change in any of the statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies applicable to WAL and its subsidiaries could have a material effect on the results of the Company. 

Overview 

WAL is a separate and distinct legal entity from WAB and its other subsidiaries. As a registered bank holding company, WAL is subject to inspection, examination, and supervision by the FRB, and is regulated under the BHCA. WAL is also under the jurisdiction of the SEC and is subject to the disclosure and other regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Exchange Act, as administered by the SEC. The Company&#8217;s common stock is listed on the NYSE under the trading symbol &#8220;WAL&#8221; and the Company is subject to the rules of the NYSE for listed companies. The Company is a financial institution holding company within the meaning of Arizona law. WAL provides a full spectrum of deposit, lending, treasury management, and online banking products and services through WAB, its wholly-owned banking subsidiary. WAB is an Arizona chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System. WAB operates the following full-service banking divisions: ABA, BON, Bridge, FIB, and TPB. WAB is subject to the supervision of, and to regular examination by, the Arizona Department of Financial Institutions, the FRB as its primary federal regulator, and the FDIC as its deposit insurer. WAB's deposits are insured by the FDIC up to the applicable deposit insurance limits in accordance with FDIC laws and regulations. The Company also serves business customers through a national platform of specialized financial services providers. 

WAL and WAB are also supervised by the CFPB for compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws. The Company&#8217;s non-bank subsidiaries are subject to federal and state laws and regulations, including regulations of the FRB. 

The Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the financial regulatory regime in the United States. Since the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, U.S. banks and financial services firms have been subject to enhanced regulation and oversight. Several provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to further rulemaking, guidance, and interpretation by the federal banking agencies. While the current administration and its appointees to the federal banking agencies have expressed interest in reviewing, revising, and perhaps repealing portions of the Dodd-Frank Act and certain of its implementing regulations, is not clear whether any such legislation or regulatory changes will be enacted or, if enacted, what the effect on the Company would be. 

EGRRCPA 

On May 24, 2018, the President signed into law the EGRRCPA which, among other things, amended certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The EGRRCPA provides limited regulatory relief to certain financial institutions while preserving the existing framework under which U.S. financial institutions are regulated. The EGRRCPA relieves bank holding companies with less than $100 billion in assets, such as the Company, from the enhanced prudential standards imposed under Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act (including, but not limited to, resolution planning and enhanced liquidity and risk management requirements). In addition to amending the Dodd-Frank Act, the EGRRCPA also includes certain additional banking-related provisions, consumer protection provisions and securities law-related provisions. While many of the EGRRCPA&#8217;s changes have been implemented through rules adopted by federal agencies, the Company expects to continue to evaluate the potential impact of the EGRRCPA as it is further implemented. 

Bank Holding Company Regulation 

WAL is a bank holding company as defined under the BHCA. The BHCA generally limits the business of bank holding companies to banking, managing or controlling banks, and other activities that the FRB has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. Business activities that have been determined to be related to banking, and therefore appropriate for bank holding companies and their affiliates to engage in, include securities brokerage services, investment advisory services, fiduciary services, and certain management advisory and data processing services, among others. Bank holding companies that have elected to become financial holding companies may engage in any activity, or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any activity that is either: (i) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity (as determined by the FRB in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury) or (ii) complementary to a financial activity, and that does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally (as solely determined by the FRB). 

Activities that are financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting, and making merchant banking investments. 

Mergers and Acquisitions 

The BHCA, the Bank Merger Act, and other federal and state statutes regulate the direct and indirect acquisition of depository institutions. The BHCA requires prior FRB approval for a bank holding company to acquire, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of any class of voting securities of a commercial bank or its parent holding company and for a company, other than a bank holding company, to acquire 25% or more of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, any person, including a company, may not acquire, directly or indirectly, control of a bank without providing 60 days&#8217; prior notice and receiving a non-objection from the appropriate federal banking agency. 

Under the Bank Merger Act, the prior approval of the appropriate federal banking agency is required for insured depository institutions to merge or enter into purchase and assumption transactions. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and purchase and assumption transactions, the federal banking agencies will consider, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position of the combined banking organization, the applicant's performance record under the CRA, and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities. For further information relating to the CRA, see the section titled &#8220;Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws.&#8221; 

Under Section 6-142 of the Arizona Revised Statutes, no person may acquire control of a company that controls an Arizona bank without the prior approval of the Arizona Superintendent of Financial Institutions, or Arizona Superintendent. A person who has the power to vote 15% or more of the voting stock of a controlling company is presumed to control the company. 

Enhanced Prudential Standards 

Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act imposes enhanced prudential standards on larger banking organizations, with certain of these standards applicable to banking organizations over $10 billion, including WAL and WAB, as of the quarter ending June 30, 2014. In October 2012, the FDIC, the OCC, and the FRB issued separate but similar rules requiring covered banks and bank holding companies with $10 billion to $50 billion in total consolidated assets to conduct an annual company-run stress test. WAL and WAB conducted a company-run capital stress test as required by the Dodd-Frank Act in 2017 and provided the results to the FRB. WAL found the Company would have sufficient capital to maintain regulatory capital levels throughout an economic downturn. 

As a result of passage of the EGRRCPA, bank holding companies with less than $100 billion in assets, such as the Company, are exempt from the enhanced prudential standards imposed under Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act (including, but not limited to, the resolution planning and enhanced liquidity and risk management requirements therein). Notwithstanding these changes, the capital planning and risk management practices of the Company and the Bank will continue to be reviewed through the regular supervisory processes of the FRB. 

In February 2014, the FRB issued a rule further implementing the enhanced prudential standards required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Although most of the standards apply only to bank holding companies with more than $50 billion in assets, as directed by the Dodd-Frank Act, the rule contains certain standards that apply to bank holding companies with more than $10 billion in assets, including a requirement to establish a risk committee of the Company's BOD to manage enterprise-wide risk. The Company meets these requirements. The EGRRCPA increased the asset threshold for requiring a bank holding company to establish a separate risk committee of independent directors from $10 billion to $50 billion. Notwithstanding this change, the Company has retained its separate risk committee of independent directors. 

Volcker Rule 

Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, commonly known as the Volcker Rule, restricts the ability of banking entities, such as the Company and WAB, from: (i) engaging in &#8220;proprietary trading&#8221; and (ii) investing in or sponsoring certain covered funds, subject to certain limited exceptions. Under the Volcker Rule, the term "covered funds" is defined as any issuer that would be an investment company under the Investment Company Act but for the exemption in Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of that Act, which includes CLO and CDO securities. There are also several exemptions from the definition of covered fund, including, among other things, loan securitizations, joint ventures, certain types of foreign funds, entities issuing asset-backed commercial paper, and registered investment companies. Further, the final rules permit banking entities, subject to certain conditions and limitations, to invest in or sponsor a covered fund in connection with: (1) organizing and offering the covered fund; (2) certain risk-mitigating hedging activities; and (3) de minimis investments in covered funds. The EGRRCPA and subsequent promulgation of inter-agency final rules have aimed at simplifying and tailoring requirements related to the Volcker Rule, including by eliminating collection of certain metrics and reducing the compliance burdens associated with other metrics for banks with less than $20 billion in average trading assets and liabilities. Compliance with the Volcker Rule was required by July 21, 2017 and the Company believes it is fully compliant. 

Dividends 

Historically, the Company has not declared or paid cash dividends on its common stock, electing instead to retain earnings for growth. On July 30, 2019, WAL's BOD authorized the payment of regular quarterly dividends, declaring the Company's first quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock, which was paid on August 30, 2019. Whether the Company continues to pay quarterly dividends and the amount of any such dividends will be at the discretion of WAL's BOD and will depend on the Company&#8217;s earnings, financial condition, results of operations, business prospects, capital requirements, regulatory restrictions, contractual restrictions, and other factors that the BOD may deem relevant. 

The Company&#8217;s ability to pay dividends is subject to the regulatory authority of the FRB. The supervisory concern of the FRB focuses on a bank holding company&#8217;s capital position, its ability to meet its financial obligations as they come due, and its capacity to act as a source of financial strength to its insured depository institution subsidiaries. In addition, FRB policy discourages the payment of dividends by a bank holding company that is not supported by current operating earnings. 

As a Delaware corporation, the Company is also subject to limitations under Delaware law on the payment of dividends. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, dividends may only be paid out of surplus or out of net profits for the year in which the dividend is declared or the preceding year, and no dividends may be paid on common stock at any time during which the capital of outstanding preferred stock or preference stock exceeds the Company's net assets. 

From time to time, the Company may become a party to financing agreements and other contractual obligations that have the effect of limiting or prohibiting the declaration or payment of dividends under certain circumstances. Holding company expenses and obligations with respect to its outstanding trust preferred securities and corresponding subordinated debt also may limit or impair the Company&#8217;s ability to declare and pay dividends. 

Since the Company has no significant assets other than the voting stock of its subsidiaries, it currently depends on dividends from WAB and, to a lesser extent, its non-bank subsidiaries, for a substantial portion of its revenue and as the primary sources of its cash flow. The ability of a state member bank, such as WAB, to pay cash dividends is restricted by the FRB and the State of Arizona. The FRB&#8217;s Regulation H states that a member bank may not declare or pay a dividend if the total of all dividends declared during that calendar year exceed the bank&#8217;s net income during that calendar year and the retained net income of the prior two years. Further, without receiving prior approval from both the FRB and two-thirds of its shareholders, a bank cannot declare or pay a dividend that would exceed its undivided profits or withdraw any portion of its permanent capital. 

Under Section 6-187 of the Arizona Revised Statutes, WAB may pay dividends on the same basis as any other Arizona corporation, except that cash dividends paid out of capital surplus require the prior approval of the Arizona Superintendent. Under Section 10-640 of the Arizona Revised Statutes, a corporation may not make a distribution to stockholders if to do so would render the corporation insolvent or unable to pay its debts as they become due. However, an Arizona bank may not declare a non-stock dividend out of capital surplus without the approval of the Arizona Superintendent. 

Federal Reserve System 

As a member of the Federal Reserve System, WAB is required by law to maintain reserves against its transaction deposits. The reserves must be held in cash or with the FRB. Banks are permitted to meet this requirement by maintaining the specified amount as an average balance over a two-week period. The total of reserve balances was approximately $164.1 million and $145.9 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 

Source of Strength Doctrine 

FRB policy requires bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. Section 616 of the Dodd-Frank Act codified the requirement that bank holding companies act as a source of financial strength. As a result, the Company is expected to commit resources to support WAB, including at times when the Company may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides that, in the event of a bank holding company's bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal banking agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment. 

Capital Adequacy and Prompt Corrective Action 

The Capital Rules established a comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The Capital Rules generally implement the Basel Committee's Basel III final capital framework for strengthening international capital standards. The Capital Rules revise the definitions and the components of regulatory capital, as well as address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions&#8217; regulatory capital ratios. The Capital Rules also address asset risk weights and other matters affecting the denominator in banking institutions&#8217; regulatory capital ratios and replaced the existing general risk-weighting approach with a more risk-sensitive approach. 

The Capital Rules: (i) include CET1 and the related regulatory capital ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets; (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and &#8220;Additional Tier 1 capital&#8221; instruments meeting certain revised requirements; (iii) mandate that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital; and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions from and adjustments to capital as compared to existing regulations. Under the Capital Rules, for most banking organizations, the most common form of Additional Tier 1 capital is non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, and the most common forms of Tier 2 capital are subordinated notes and a portion of the allocation for loan and lease losses, in each case, subject to the Capital Rules&#8217; specific requirements. 

Pursuant to the Capital Rules, the minimum capital ratios are as follows: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

6.0% Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

8.0% Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

4.0% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (called &#8220;leverage ratio&#8221;). 

##TABLE_END The Capital Rules also include a &#8220;capital conservation buffer,&#8221; composed entirely of CET1, in addition to these minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity, and other capital instrument repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The Capital Rules became fully phased-in on January 1, 2019. Thus, the capital standards applicable to the Company include an additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of CET1, effectively resulting in minimum ratios inclusive of the capital conservation buffer of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%, and (iii) Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%. 

The Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing assets, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks, and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1. The Capital Rules further prescribe that the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss items reported as a component of stockholders&#8217; equity be included in CET1 capital; however, non-advanced approaches banking organizations may make a one-time permanent election to exclude these items. The Company, as a non-advanced approaches institution, has made this one-time election. 

The Capital Rules also preclude certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities, issued on or after May 19, 2010 from inclusion in bank holding companies&#8217; Tier 1 capital. The Company has used trust preferred securities in the past as a tool for raising additional Tier 1 capital and otherwise improving its regulatory capital ratios. Although the Company may continue to include its existing trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital, the prohibition on the use of these securities as Tier 1 capital going forward may limit the Company&#8217;s ability to raise capital in the future. 

The risk-weighting categories in the Capital Rules are standardized and include a risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset classes. 

In September 2017, the federal banking agencies proposed simplifying the Capital Rules. On July 9, 2019, the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule (replacing a substantially similar interim rule) to simplify several requirements of the regulatory capital rules for non-advanced approaches institutions, such as the Company. The final rule simplifies the capital treatment for mortgage servicing assets, certain deferred tax assets, investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions, and minority interest. The final rule will be effective as of April 1, 2020 for the amendments to simplify the capital rules. 

Management believes the Company is in compliance, and will continue to be in compliance, with the targeted capital ratios. 

Prompt Corrective Action and Safety and Soundness 

Pursuant to Section 38 of the FDIA, federal banking agencies are required to take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; should a depository institution fail to meet certain capital adequacy standards. At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits. Furthermore, if an insured depository institution is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking agency, and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan. Based upon its capital levels, a bank that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment. 

For purposes of prompt corrective action, to be: (i) well-capitalized, a bank must have a total risk based capital ratio of at least 10%, a Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of at least 8%, a CET1 risk based capital ratio of at least 6.5%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%; (ii) adequately capitalized, a bank must have a total risk based capital ratio of at least 8%, a Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of at least 6%, a CET1 risk based capital ratio of at least 4.5%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4%; (iii) undercapitalized, a bank would have a total risk based capital ratio of less than 8%, a Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of less than 6%, a CET1 risk based capital ratio of less than 4.5%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 4%; (iv) significantly undercapitalized, a bank would have a total risk based capital ratio of less than 6%, a Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of less than 4%, a CET1 risk based capital ratio of less than 3%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 3%; (v) critically undercapitalized, a bank would have a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is less than or equal to 2%. 

Bank holding companies and insured banks also may be subject to potential enforcement actions of varying levels of severity by the federal banking agencies for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their business, or for violation of any law, rule, regulation, condition imposed in writing by the agency or term of a written agreement with the agency. In more serious cases, enforcement actions may include: (i) the issuance of directives to increase capital; (ii) the issuance of formal and informal agreements; (iii) the imposition of civil monetary penalties; (iv) the issuance of a cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced; (v) the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against officers, directors, and other institution-affiliated parties; (vi) the termination of the bank&#8217;s deposit insurance; (vii) the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the bank; and (viii) the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders based upon a judicial determination that the agency would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted. 

Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders 

Under federal law, transactions between insured depository institutions and their affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the FRA and implementing Regulation W. In a bank holding company context, at a minimum, the parent holding company of a bank, and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company, are affiliates of the bank. Generally, Sections 23A and 23B of the FRA are intended to protect insured depository institutions from losses arising from transactions with non-insured affiliates by limiting the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate and with all affiliates of the bank in the aggregate, and requiring that such transactions be on terms consistent with safe and sound banking practices. 

Further, Section 22(h) of the FRA and its implementing Regulation O restricts loans to directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders (&#8220;insiders&#8221;). Under Section 22(h), loans to insiders and their related interests may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such persons and affiliated entities, the institution's total capital and surplus. Loans to insiders above specified amounts must receive the prior approval of the BOD. Further, under Section 22(h) of the FRA, loans to directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders must be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons, except that such insiders may receive preferential loans made under a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to the bank's employees and does not give preference to the insider over the employees. Section 22(g) of the FRA places additional limitations on loans to executive officers. 

Lending Limits 

In addition to the requirements set forth above, state banking law generally limits the amount of funds that a state-chartered bank may lend to a single borrower. Under Section 6-352 of the Arizona Revised Statutes, the obligations of one borrower to a bank may not exceed 20% of the bank&#8217;s capital, plus an additional 10% of its capital if the additional amounts are fully secured by readily marketable collateral. 

Brokered Deposits 

Section 29 of the FDIA and FDIC regulations generally limit the ability of any bank to accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless it is &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; or, with the FDIC&#8217;s approval, &#8220;adequately capitalized.&#8221; However, as a result of the EGRRCPA, the FDIC has undertaken a comprehensive review of its regulatory approach to brokered deposits, including reciprocal deposits, and interest rate caps applicable to banks that are less than &#8220;well capitalized.&#8221; On December 12, 2019, the FDIC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to modernize its brokered deposit regulations. At this time, it is difficult to predict what changes, if any, to the brokered deposit regulations will actually be implemented or the effect of such changes on the Bank. 

Consumer Protection and CFPB Supervision 

The Dodd-Frank Act centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating the CFPB, an independent agency charged with responsibility for implementing, enforcing, and examining compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws. The Company is subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Procedures Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Practices Act, various state law counterparts, and the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, which is part of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act does not prevent states from adopting stricter consumer protection standards. State regulation of financial products and potential enforcement actions could also adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, or operations. 

Depositor Preference 

The FDIA provides that, in the event of the &#8220;liquidation or other resolution&#8221; of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including the parent bank holding company, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution. 

Federal Deposit Insurance 

Substantially all of the deposits of WAB are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC&#8217;s DIF. The basic limit on FDIC deposit insurance is $250,000 per depositor. WAB is subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. 

The FDIC uses a risk-based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a risk matrix that takes into account a bank's CAMELS rating. The risk matrix utilizes different risk categories distinguished by capital levels and supervisory ratings. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, the base for insurance assessments is now consolidated average assets less average tangible equity. Assessment rates are calculated using formulas that take into account the risk of the institution being assessed. WAB is classified as, and subject to the scorecard for, a large and highly complex institution to determine its total base assessment rate. 

The Dodd-Frank Act requires that the FDIC raise the minimum reserve ratio of the DIF from 1.15% to 1.35%, and that the FDIC offset the effect of this increase on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion. In March 2016, the FDIC finalized a rule to impose a surcharge of 4.5 cents per $100 of their assessment base on deposit insurance assessment rates paid by insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion. As of June 30, 2016, the minimum reserve ratio reached 1.17% and as such, WAB was subject to the surcharge beginning July 1, 2016. At September 30, 2018, the reserve ratio reached 1.36%, exceeding the statutorily required minimum. As a result, WAB was no longer subject to the surcharge as of September 30, 2018. The FDIC also has authority to further increase deposit insurance assessments. FDIC deposit insurance expense also includes FICO assessments related to outstanding FICO bonds. These assessments will continue until the FICO bonds mature, with such maturities beginning in 2017 and continuing through 2019. 

Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. The Company&#8217;s management is not aware of any practice, condition, or violation that might lead to the termination of its deposit insurance. 

Financial Privacy and Data Security 

The Company is subject to federal laws, including the GLBA, and certain state laws containing consumer privacy protection provisions. These provisions limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to affiliated and non-affiliated third parties and limit the reuse of certain consumer information received from non-affiliated institutions. These provisions require notice of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to affiliates or non-affiliated third parties by means of &#8220;opt out&#8221; or &#8220;opt in&#8221; authorizations. 

For example, in August 2018, the CFPB published its final rule to update Regulation P pursuant to the amended GLBA. Under this rule, certain qualifying financial institutions are not required to provide annual privacy notices to customers. To qualify, a financial institution must not share nonpublic personal information about customers except as described in certain statutory exceptions that do not trigger a customer&#8217;s statutory opt-out right. In addition, the financial institution must not have changed its disclosure policies and practices from those disclosed in its most recent privacy notice. The rule sets forth timing requirements for delivery of annual privacy notices in the event that a financial institution that qualified for the annual notice exemption later changes its policies or practices in such a way that it no longer qualifies for the exemption. 

The GLBA also requires that financial institutions implement comprehensive written information security programs that include administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect consumer information. Further, pursuant to interpretive guidance issued under the GLBA and certain state laws, financial institutions are required to notify customers of security breaches that result in unauthorized access to their nonpublic personal information. 

For example, under California law, every business that owns or licenses personal information about a California resident must maintain reasonable security procedures and policies to protect that information and comply with specific requirements relating to the destruction of records containing personal information and disclosure of breaches to customers, and restrictions on the use of customer information unless the customer "opts in." Other states, including Arizona and Nevada where WAB has branches, may also have applicable laws requiring businesses that retain consumer personal information to develop reasonable security policies and procedures, notify consumers of a security breach, or provide disclosures about the use and sharing of consumer personal information. 

The federal banking agencies, including the FRB, through the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, have adopted guidelines to encourage financial institutions to address cybersecurity risks and identify, assess, and mitigate these risks, both internally and at critical third-party services providers. In October 2016, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued proposed rules on enhanced cybersecurity risk management and resilience standards that would apply to very large financial institutions and to services provided by third parties to these institutions. The comment period for these proposed rules has closed and a final rule has not been published. Although the proposed rules would apply only to bank holding companies and banks with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets, these rules could influence the federal bank regulatory agencies&#8217; expectations and supervisory requirements for information security standards and cybersecurity programs of financial institutions with less than $50 billion in total consolidated assets. 

These laws and regulations impose compliance costs and create obligations and, in some cases, reporting obligations, and compliance with these laws, regulations, and obligations require significant resources of WAL and WAB. 

Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws 

WAB has a responsibility under the CRA to help meet the credit needs of its communities, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution's discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit discrimination in lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. WAB&#8217;s failure to comply with the provisions of the CRA could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities and the activities of the Company. WAB&#8217;s failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions. WAB received a rating of &#8220;Satisfactory&#8221; in its most recent CRA examination, in January 2019. 

On December 17, 2019, the OCC and the FDIC issued a joint notice of proposed rulemaking to modernize the regulations implementing the CRA. While the proposed rule will not apply to WAB because its primary federal regulator is the FRB, it may impact the overall environment as it relates to CRA compliance and portend future changes by the FRB. Under the rulemaking, the federal banking agencies intend to: (i) clarify which activities qualify for CRA credit; (ii) update where activities count for CRA credit; (iii) create a more transparent and objective method for measuring CRA performance; and (iv) provide for more transparent, consistent, and timely CRA-related data collection, record keeping, and reporting. WAL and WAB expect to monitor 

developments with respect to this rulemaking and assess the impact, if any, of changes to the CRA regulations proposed by the federal banking agencies. 

Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco 

WAB is a member of the FHLB of San Francisco, which is one of 12 regional FHLBs that provide funding to their members to support residential lending, as well as affordable housing and community development loans. Each FHLB serves as a reserve, or central bank, for the members within its assigned region. Each FHLB makes loans to its members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the board of directors of the FHLB. As a member, WAB must purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB of San Francisco. At December 31, 2019 , WAB&#8217;s total investment in FHLB stock was $17.3 million . 

Incentive Compensation 

The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal banking agencies and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities, including the Company and WAB, with at least $1 billion in total consolidated assets, that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. The federal banking agencies and the SEC most recently proposed such regulations in 2016, but the regulations have not yet been finalized. If the regulations are adopted in the form initially proposed, they will restrict the manner in which executive compensation is structured. 

The Dodd-Frank Act also requires publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation at least every three years and on so-called &#8220;golden parachute&#8221; payments in connection with approvals of mergers and acquisitions. WAL gives stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation annually. 

Preventing Suspicious Activity 

Under Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act, all financial institutions are required to take certain measures to identify their customers, prevent money laundering, monitor customer transactions, and report suspicious activity to U.S. law enforcement agencies. Financial institutions also are required to respond to requests for information from federal banking agencies and law enforcement agencies. Information sharing among financial institutions for the above purposes is encouraged by an exemption granted to complying financial institutions from the privacy provisions of the GLBA and other privacy laws. Financial institutions that hold correspondent accounts for foreign banks or provide private banking services to foreign individuals are required to take measures to avoid dealing with certain foreign individuals or entities, including foreign banks with profiles that raise money laundering concerns, and are prohibited from dealing with foreign &#8220;shell banks&#8221; and persons from jurisdictions of particular concern. The primary federal banking agencies and the Secretary of the Treasury have adopted regulations to implement several of these provisions. The new Customer Due Diligence Rule, that was effective beginning May 11, 2018, clarified and strengthened the existing obligations for identifying new and existing customers and explicitly included risk-based procedures for conducting ongoing customer due diligence. All financial institutions also are required to establish internal anti-money laundering programs. The effectiveness of a financial institution in combating money laundering activities is a factor to be considered in any application submitted by the financial institution under the Bank Merger Act. The Company has a Bank Secrecy Act and USA PATRIOT Act Board-approved compliance program and engages in relatively few transactions with foreign financial institutions or foreign persons. 

The FCRA&#8217;s Red Flags Rule requires financial institutions with covered accounts (e.g., consumer bank accounts and loans) to develop, implement, and administer an identity theft prevention program. This program must include reasonable policies and procedures to detect suspicious patterns or practices that indicate the possibility of identity theft, such as inconsistencies in personal information or changes in account activity. 

Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation 

The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals, and others. These are typically known as the OFAC rules based on their administration by the OFAC. The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on &#8220;U.S. persons&#8221; engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off, or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences. 

Future Legislative Initiatives 

Federal and state legislatures may introduce legislation that will impact the financial services industry. In addition, federal banking agencies may introduce regulatory initiatives that are likely to impact the financial services industry, generally. However it is not clear whether such changes will be enacted or, if enacted, what their effect on the Company will be. New legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment of the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities, or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. The Company cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it or any implementing regulations would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. A change in statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies applicable to WAL or any of its subsidiaries could have a material effect on the business of the Company.
