 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 2) 

The following is Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of certain significant factors that have affected Fifth Third Bancorp&#8217;s (the &#8220;Bancorp&#8221; or &#8220;Fifth Third&#8221;) financial condition and results of operations during the periods included in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which are a part of this filing. Reference to the Bancorp incorporates the parent holding company and all consolidated subsidiaries. The Bancorp&#8217;s banking subsidiary is referred to as the Bank. 

OVERVIEW 

Fifth Third Bancorp is a diversified financial services company headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio. At March 31, 2024, the Bancorp had $215 billion in assets and operated 1,070 full-service banking centers and 2,082 Fifth Third branded ATMs in eleven states throughout the Midwestern and Southeastern regions of the U.S. The Bancorp reports on three business segments: Commercial Banking, Consumer and Small Business Banking and Wealth and Asset Management. 

This overview of MD&#38;A highlights selected information in the financial results of the Bancorp and may not contain all of the information that is important to you. For a more complete understanding of trends, events, commitments, uncertainties, liquidity, capital resources and critical accounting policies and estimates, you should carefully read this entire document as well as the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Each of these items could have an impact on the Bancorp&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, refer to the Glossary of Abbreviations and Acronyms in this report for a list of terms included as a tool for the reader of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The abbreviations and acronyms identified therein are used throughout this MD&#38;A, as well as the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Net interest income, net interest margin, net interest rate spread and the efficiency ratio are presented in MD&#38;A on an FTE basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and leases and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. The FTE basis for presenting net interest income is a non-GAAP measure. For further information, refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of MD&#38;A. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s revenues are dependent on both net interest income and noninterest income. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income provided 66% and 34% of total revenue, respectively. The Bancorp derives the majority of its revenues within the U.S. from customers domiciled in the U.S. Revenue from foreign countries and external customers domiciled in foreign countries was immaterial to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Changes in interest rates, credit quality, economic trends and the capital markets are primary factors that drive the performance of the Bancorp. As discussed later in the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A, risk identification, measurement, monitoring, control and reporting are important to the management of risk and to the financial performance and capital strength of the Bancorp. 

Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on assets such as loans, leases and securities, and interest expense incurred on liabilities such as deposits, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Net interest income is affected by the general level of interest rates, the relative level of short-term and long-term interest rates, changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Generally, the rates of interest the Bancorp earns on its assets and pays on its liabilities are established for a period of time. The change in market interest rates over time exposes the Bancorp to interest rate risk through potential adverse changes to net interest income and financial position. The Bancorp manages this risk by continually analyzing and adjusting the composition of its assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates, the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, the Bancorp enters into certain derivative transactions as part of its overall strategy to manage its interest rate and prepayment risks. The Bancorp is also exposed to the risk of loss on its loan and lease portfolio as a result of changing expected cash flows caused by borrower credit events, such as loan defaults and inadequate collateral. 

Noninterest income is derived from wealth and asset management revenue, service charges on deposits, commercial banking revenue, card and processing revenue, mortgage banking net revenue, leasing business revenue, other noninterest income and net securities gains or losses. Noninterest expense includes compensation and benefits, technology and communications, net occupancy expense, equipment expense, marketing expense, leasing business expense, card and processing expense and other noninterest expense. 

Current Economic Conditions 

With economic growth above the long-term trend and unemployment below 4%, returning inflation to 2% on a sustained basis may take longer than previously expected. In response to persistent inflationary pressures, FRB officials have signaled that a longer period of restrictive monetary policy may be necessary to return inflation to 2% on a sustained basis. The FRB will continue to monitor the cumulative economic effects of their policy actions, including tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, when determining future monetary actions. Financial markets continue to anticipate interest rate cuts later this year, although the timing and magnitude remains uncertain. 

Changes in interest rates can affect numerous aspects of the Bancorp&#8217;s business and may impact the Bancorp&#8217;s future performance. If financial markets remain volatile, this may impact the future performance of various segments of the Bancorp&#8217;s business, in addition to the 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

value of the Bancorp&#8217;s investment securities portfolio. The Bancorp continues to closely monitor the pace of inflation and the impacts of inflation on the broader market. 

For more information on current economic conditions, refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A. Additionally, refer to the Interest Rate and Price Risk Management and Liquidity Risk Management subsections of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A for additional information about the Bancorp&#8217;s interest rate risk management and liquidity risk management activities. 

FDIC Special Assessment 

The bank failures that occurred in the first half of 2023 generated significant market volatility and increased regulatory and market focus on the liquidity, asset-liability management and unrealized securities losses of banks. In response to these failures, the U.S. banking agencies have proposed a number of regulatory amendments to improve the stability of U.S. banking institutions. Among these amendments, in November 2023, the FDIC issued a final rule for a special deposit insurance assessment on banking organizations with greater than $5 billion in assets to recover the costs associated with protecting uninsured depositors following these closures. The Bancorp&#8217;s initial estimate of its allocated share of the special assessment under the provisions of the final rule was $224 million, which was recognized in earnings upon issuance of the final rule in November 2023. During the first quarter of 2024, the FDIC announced that it expected to incur additional losses related to these bank closures beyond its initial estimates. These incremental losses, if incurred, would result in an increase to the amount of the special assessment allocated to each member bank. As a result of this announcement, in the first quarter of 2024, the Bancorp recorded an incremental liability and expense of $33 million associated with the special assessment. The special assessment will be paid to the FDIC over an anticipated total of eight quarterly assessment periods beginning with the first quarter of 2024. The estimate of the cost associated with protecting the uninsured depositors will continue to be subject to periodic adjustment until the final loss is determined upon the termination of the receiverships by the FDIC. 

Senior Notes Offering 

On January 29, 2024, the Bancorp issued and sold $1.0 billion of fixed-rate/floating-rate senior notes which will mature on January 29, 2032. The senior notes will bear interest at a rate of 5.631% per annum to, but excluding, January 29, 2031. From, and including January 29, 2031 until, but excluding January 29, 2032, the senior notes will bear interest at a rate of compounded SOFR plus 1.840%. Refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 

Transfer of Securities 

In January 2024, the Bancorp transferred $12.6 billion (amortized cost basis) of securities from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity to reflect the Bancorp&#8217;s change in intent to hold these securities to maturity in order to reduce potential capital volatility associated with investment security market price fluctuations. The transfer included U.S. Treasury and federal agencies securities, agency residential mortgage-backed securities and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. Refer to the Investment Securities subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A for more information. 

Proposed Updates to Regulatory Requirements for Capital and Long-Term Debt 

On July 27, 2023, the U.S. banking agencies released a notice of proposed rulemaking to revise the Basel III Capital Rules, which would modify its existing risk-based capital framework for large banks and introduce a new framework that implements international capital standards. The proposed rulemaking would increase capital requirements applicable to banking organizations with total assets of $100 billion or more, including Fifth Third, and would align the calculation of regulatory capital and the calculation of risk-weighted assets across large banking organizations. As proposed, the rules would be effective for the Bancorp on July 1, 2025 and phased in over a three-year transition period. The Bancorp is in the process of evaluating this proposed rulemaking and assessing its potential impact. 

On August 29, 2023, the U.S. banking agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to require that certain banking organizations with $100 billion or more in consolidated assets, including Fifth Third, comply with certain long-term debt requirements at the holding company and insured depository institution levels. These proposed requirements are intended to absorb losses and recapitalize the insured depository institution in the event of the failure of a banking organization. As proposed, the rules would be phased in over a three-year period after their effective date. The Bancorp is in the process of evaluating this proposed rulemaking and assessing its potential impact, which is dependent on the finalization of the aforementioned proposed capital rule. 

Key Performance Indicators 

The Bancorp, as a banking institution, utilizes various key indicators of financial condition and operating results in managing and monitoring the performance of the business. In addition to traditional financial metrics, such as revenue and expense trends, the Bancorp monitors other financial measures that assist in evaluating growth trends, capital strength and operational efficiencies. The Bancorp analyzes these key performance indicators against its past performance, its forecasted performance and with the performance of its peer banking institutions. These indicators may change from time to time as the operating environment and businesses change. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

The following are some of the key indicators used by management to assess the Bancorp&#8217;s business performance, including those which are considered in the Bancorp&#8217;s compensation programs: 

&#8226; CET1 Capital Ratio: CET1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets as defined by the Basel III standardized approach to risk-weighting of assets 

&#8226; Return on Average Tangible Common Equity (non-GAAP): Tangible net income available to common shareholders divided by average tangible common equity 

&#8226; Return on Average Common Equity, Excluding AOCI (non-GAAP): Net income available to common shareholders divided by total equity, excluding AOCI and preferred stock 

&#8226; Net Interest Margin (non-GAAP): Net interest income on an FTE basis divided by average interest-earning assets 

&#8226; Efficiency Ratio (non-GAAP): Noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income 

&#8226; Earnings Per Share, Diluted: Net income allocated to common shareholders divided by average common shares outstanding after the effect of dilutive stock-based awards 

&#8226; Nonperforming Portfolio Assets Ratio: Nonperforming portfolio assets divided by portfolio loans and leases and OREO 

&#8226; Net Charge-off Ratio: Net losses charged-off divided by average portfolio loans and leases 

&#8226; Return on Average Assets: Net income divided by average assets 

&#8226; Loan-to-Deposit Ratio: Total loans divided by total deposits 

&#8226; Household Growth: Change in the number of consumer households with retail relationship-based checking accounts 

The list of indicators above is intended to summarize some of the most important metrics utilized by management in evaluating the Bancorp&#8217;s performance and does not represent an all-inclusive list of all performance measures that may be considered relevant or important to management or investors.

Earnings Summary 

The Bancorp&#8217;s net income available to common shareholders for the first quarter of 2024 w a s $480 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, which was net of $40 million in preferred stock dividends. The Bancorp&#8217;s net income available to co mmon shareholders for the first quarter of 2023 wa s $535 million, or $0.78 p er diluted share, which was net of $23 million in preferred stock dividends. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $1.4 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024, a decrease of $132 million compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income was negatively impacted by higher funding costs due to increases in 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

market interest rates and deposit balance migration into higher yielding products. Rates paid on average interest-bearing core deposits and average long-term debt increased for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. The deposit balance migration impacting net interest income resulted in decreases in the average balances of demand deposits and increases in the average balances of interest-bearing core deposits for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. Additionally, net interest income was negatively impacted by a decrease in the average balances of commercial and industrial loans and an increase in the average balances of long-term debt for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. These negative impacts were partially offset by increases in yields on average loans and leases and average taxable securities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income also benefited from an increase in average other short-term investments for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.86% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to 3.29% for the same period in the prior year. 

The provision for credit losses was $94 million and $164 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Provision expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was affected by factors which caused a slight decrease in the ACL from December 31, 2023, including improvement in the economic forecasts used to calculate the ACL and lower period-end loan and lease balances, partially offset by increases in specific reserves on individually evaluated commercial loans. Provision expense for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was driven by factors which caused an increase in the ACL from December 31, 2022, including growth in period-end loan and lease balances and increases to specific reserves on individually evaluated commercial loans. Net losses charged off as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases were 0.38% and 0.26% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, nonperforming portfolio assets as a percent of portfolio loans and leases and OREO were 0.64% and 0.59%, respectively. For more information on credit quality, refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A as well as Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Noninterest income increased $14 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in other noninterest income, wealth and asset management revenue and service charges on deposits, partially offset by decreases in commercial banking revenue, leasing business revenue and mortgage banking net revenue. 

Noninterest expense increased $11 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in other noninterest expense and net occupancy expense, partially offset by decreases in leasing business expense and compensation and benefits expense. 

For more information on net interest income, provision for credit losses, noninterest income and noninterest expense refer to the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&#38;A. 

Capital Summary 

The Bancorp calculated its regulatory capital ratios under the Basel III standardized approach to risk-weighting of assets and pursuant to the five-year transition provision option to phase in the effects of CECL on regulatory capital as of March 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2024, the Bancorp&#8217;s capital ratios, as defined by the U.S. banking agencies, were: 

&#8226; CET1 capital ratio: 10.47%; 

&#8226; Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio: 11.77%; 

&#8226; Total risk-based capital ratio: 13.81%; 

&#8226; Leverage ratio: 8.94%.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 

The following are non-GAAP financial measures which provide useful insight to the reader of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements but should be supplemental to primary U.S. GAAP measures and should not be read in isolation or relied upon as a substitute for the primary U.S. GAAP measures. The Bancorp encourages readers to consider the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. 

The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and leases and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. 

The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of net interest income on an FTE basis, interest income on an FTE basis, net interest margin, net interest rate spread and the efficiency ratio to U.S. GAAP: 

TABLE 2: Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Financial Measures and Ratios on an FTE basis For the three months ended March 31, ($ in millions) 2024 2023 Net interest income (U.S. GAAP) $ 1,384 &#160; 1,517 Add: FTE adjustment 6 &#160; 5 Net interest income on an FTE basis (1) $ 1,390 &#160; 1,522 Net interest income on an FTE basis (annualized) (2) 5,591 &#160; 6,173 Interest income (U.S. GAAP) $ 2,608 &#160; 2,213 Add: FTE adjustment 6 &#160; 5 Interest income on an FTE basis $ 2,614 &#160; 2,218 Interest income on an FTE basis (annualized) (3) 10,513 &#160; 8,995 Interest expense (annualized) (4) $ 4,923 &#160; 2,823 Noninterest income (5) 710 &#160; 696 Noninterest expense (6) 1,342 &#160; 1,331 Average interest-earning assets (7) 195,349 &#160; 187,407 Average interest-bearing liabilities (8) 146,533 &#160; 129,280 Ratios: Net interest margin on an FTE basis (2) / (7) 2.86 &#160; % 3.29 Net interest rate spread on an FTE basis ((3) / (7)) - ((4) / (8)) 2.02 &#160; 2.62 Efficiency ratio on an FTE basis (6) / ((1) + (5)) 63.9 &#160; 60.0 

The Bancorp believes return on average tangible common equity is an important measure for comparative purposes with other financial institutions, but is not defined under U.S. GAAP, and therefore is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. This measure is useful for evaluating the performance of a business as it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measure of return on average tangible common equity to U.S. GAAP: 

TABLE 3: Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Return on Average Tangible Common Equity For the three months ended March 31, ($ in millions) 

2024 2023 Net income available to common shareholders (U.S. GAAP) $ 480 &#160; 535 Add: Intangible amortization, net of tax 8 &#160; 9 Tangible net income available to common shareholders $ 488 &#160; 544 Tangible net income available to common shareholders (annualized) (1) 1,963 &#160; 2,206 Average Bancorp shareholders&#8217; equity (U.S. GAAP) $ 18,727 &#160; 17,977 Less: Average preferred stock 2,116 &#160; 2,116 Average goodwill 4,918 &#160; 4,915 Average intangible assets 121 &#160; 163 Average tangible common equity (2) $ 11,572 &#160; 10,783 Return on average tangible common equity (1) / (2) 17.0 &#160; % 20.5 

The Bancorp considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including the tangible equity ratio and tangible common equity ratio, in addition to capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies. These calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies for both absolute and comparative purposes. As U.S. GAAP does not include capital ratio measures, the Bancorp believes there are no comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures to these ratios. These ratios are not formally defined by U.S. GAAP or codified in the federal banking regulations and, therefore, are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures. 

The following table reconciles non-GAAP capital ratios to U.S. GAAP: 

TABLE 4: Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Capital Ratios As of ($ in millions) March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 Total Bancorp Shareholders&#8217; Equity (U.S. GAAP) $ 19,018 &#160; 19,172 Less: Preferred stock 2,116 &#160; 2,116 Goodwill 4,918 &#160; 4,919 Intangible assets 115 &#160; 125 AOCI (4,888) (4,487) Tangible common equity, excluding AOCI (1) $ 16,757 &#160; 16,499 Add: Preferred stock 2,116 &#160; 2,116 Tangible equity (2) $ 18,873 &#160; 18,615 Total Assets (U.S. GAAP) $ 214,506 &#160; 214,574 Less: Goodwill 4,918 &#160; 4,919 Intangible assets 115 &#160; 125 AOCI, before tax (6,187) (5,680) Tangible assets, excluding AOCI (3) $ 215,660 &#160; 215,210 Ratios: Tangible equity as a percentage of tangible assets (2) / (3) 8.75 &#160; &#160;% 8.65 Tangible common equity as a percentage of tangible assets (1) / (3) 7.77 &#160; 7.67

RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 

Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements provides a discussion of the significant new accounting standards applicable to the Bancorp and the expected impact of a significant accounting standard issued, but not yet required to be adopted. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The Bancorp&#8217;s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain accounting policies require management to exercise judgment in determining methodologies, economic assumptions and estimates that may materially affect the Bancorp&#8217;s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Bancorp&#8217;s critical accounting policies include the accounting for the ALLL, reserve for unfunded commitments, valuation of servicing rights, fair value measurements, goodwill and legal contingencies. These accounting policies are discussed in detail in the Critical Accounting Policies section of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes to the valuation techniques or models during the three months ended March 31, 2024. 

STATEMENTS OF INCOME ANALYSIS 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is the interest earned on loans and leases (including yield-related fees), securities and other short-term investments less the interest incurred on core deposits and wholesale funding (including CDs over $250,000, federal funds purchased, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt). The net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets. Net interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is typically greater than net interest rate spread due to the interest income earned on those assets that are funded by noninterest-bearing liabilities, or free funding, such as demand deposits or shareholders&#8217; equity. 

Table 5 presents the components of net interest income, net interest margin and net interest rate spread for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, as well as the relative impact of changes in the average balance sheet and changes in interest rates on net interest income. Nonaccrual loans and leases and loans and leases held for sale have been included in the average loan and lease balances. Average outstanding securities balances are based on amortized cost with any unrealized gains or losses included in average other assets. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $1.4 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024, a decrease of $132 million compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income was negatively impacted by higher funding costs due to increases in market interest rates and deposit balance migration into higher yielding products. Rates paid on average interest-bearing core deposits and average long-term debt increased 124 bps and 103 bps, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. The deposit balance migration impacting net interest income resulted in decreases in the average balances of demand deposits of $9.9 billion and increases in the average balances of interest-bearing core deposits of $16.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. Additionally, net interest income was negatively impacted by a decrease in the average balances of commercial and industrial loans of $4.9 billion and an increase in the average balances of long-term debt of $2.0 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. These negative impacts were partially offset by increases in yields of 73 bps on average loans and leases and 20 bps on average taxable securities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income also benefited from an increase in average other short-term investments of $15.9 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. 

Net interest rate spread on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.02% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to 2.62% for the same period in the prior year. Rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities increased 118 bps, partially offset by a 58 bps increase in yields on average interest-earning assets for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to same period in the prior year. 

Net interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.86% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to 3.29% for the comparable period in the prior year. Net interest margin for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was negatively impacted by the migration of average balances of deposits from demand deposits to interest-bearing deposits, increases in rates paid on and average balances of wholesale funding and decreases in average balances of loans and leases, partially offset by higher market interest rates on interest-earning assets and growth in average balances of other short-term investments. Net interest margin results are expected to modestly increase over the next several quarters driven by fixed-rate asset repricing and deposit growth, partially offset by the impact of continued deposit margin compression. However, net interest margin may be negatively impacted by increased deposit competition or higher levels of cash and other short-term investments. 

Interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) from loans and leases increased $146 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily driven by the previously mentioned increases in market interest rates, partially offset by a decrease in average balances of commercial and industrial loans. For more information on the Bancorp&#8217;s loan and lease portfolio, refer to the Loans and Leases subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A. Interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) from investment securities and other short-term investments increased $250 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024

compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily due to the previously mentioned increase in the average balances of other short-term investments and increase in yields on average taxable securities. 

Interest expense on average core deposits increased $448 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily due to the previously mentioned increase in the cost of average interest-bearing core deposits to 291 bps for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from 167 bps for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as a result of higher short-term interest rates and greater competition for deposits. Refer to the Deposits subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A for additional information on the Bancorp&#8217;s deposits. 

Interest expense on average wholesale funding increased $80 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily due to the previously mentioned increases in rates paid on and average balances of long-term debt. The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was also driven by an increase in the average balances of CDs over $250,000 of $1.2 billion and an increase in the rates paid on average CDs over $250,000 of 107 bps. These negative impacts were partially offset by a decrease in the average balances of FHLB advances of $1.7 billion. Refer to the Borrowings subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A for additional information on the Bancorp&#8217;s borrowings. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, average wholesale funding represented 17% of average interest-bearing liabilities compared to 18% for the three months ended March 31, 2023. For more information on the Bancorp&#8217;s interest rate risk management, including estimated earnings sensitivity to changes in market interest rates, refer to the Interest Rate and Price Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The Bancorp provides, as an expense, an amount for expected credit losses within the loan and lease portfolio and the portfolio of unfunded commitments that is based on factors discussed in the Critical Accounting Policies section of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The provision is recorded to bring the ALLL and reserve for unfunded commitments to a level deemed appropriate by the Bancorp to cover losses expected in the portfolios. Actual credit losses on loans and leases are charged against the ALLL. The amount of loans and leases actually removed from the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are referred to as charge-offs. Net charge-offs include current period charge-offs less recoveries on previously charged-off loans and leases. 

The provision for credit losses was $94 million and $164 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Provision expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was affected by factors which caused a slight decrease in the ACL from December 31, 2023, including improvement in the economic forecasts used to calculate the ACL and lower period-end loan and lease balances, partially offset by increases in specific reserves on individually evaluated commercial loans. Provision expense for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was driven by factors which caused an increase in the ACL from December 31, 2022, including growth in period-end loan and lease balances and increases to specific reserves on individually evaluated commercial loans. 

The ALLL decreased $4 million from December 31, 2023 to $2.3 billion at March 31, 2024. At March 31, 2024, the ALLL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases increased to 1.99%, compared to 1.98% at December 31, 2023. The reserve for unfunded commitments decreased $12 million from December 31, 2023 to $154 million at March 31, 2024. The ACL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases was 2.12% at both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A as well as Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the provision for credit losses, including an analysis of loan and lease portfolio composition, nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and other factors considered by the Bancorp in assessing the credit quality of the loan and lease portfolio and determining the level of the ACL. 

Noninterest Income 

Noninterest income increased $14 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. 

The following table presents the components of noninterest income: 

TABLE 6: Components of Noninterest Income For the three months ended March 31, ($ in millions) 2024 2023 % Change Wealth and asset management revenue $ 161 &#160; 146 10 Service charges on deposits 151 &#160; 137 10 Commercial banking revenue 143 &#160; 161 (11) Card and processing revenue 102 &#160; 100 2 Mortgage banking net revenue 54 &#160; 69 (22) Leasing business revenue 39 &#160; 57 (32) Other noninterest income 50 &#160; 22 127 Securities gains, net 10 &#160; 4 150 Securities gains, net &#8211; non-qualifying hedges on mortgage servicing rights 

&#8212; &#160; &#8212; NM Total noninterest income $ 710 &#160; 696 2 

Wealth and asset management revenue 

Wealth and asset management revenue increased $15 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily driven by increases in personal asset management revenue and broker income. The Bancorp&#8217;s trust and registered investment advisory businesses had approximately $634 billion and $542 billion in total assets under care as of March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and managed $62 billion and $57 billion in assets for individuals, corporations and not-for-profit organizations as of March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Service charges on deposits 

Service charges on deposits increased $14 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily due to an increase in service charges on commercial deposits. Service charges on commercial deposits were $112 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, an increase of $12 million from the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily due to an increase in revenue from commercial payments activities, which include traditional treasury management and embedded payments. Service charges on 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

consumer deposits were $39 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, an increase of $2 million from the three months ended March 31, 2023. 

Commercial banking revenue 

Commercial banking revenue decreased $18 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily driven by decreases in revenue from commercial customer derivatives, merger and acquisition fees and loan syndication fees, partially offset by an increase in corporate bond fees. 

Card and processing revenue 

Card and processing revenue increased $2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily due to increases in credit and debit card interchange and electronic funds transfer income, partially offset by increased reward costs. 

Mortgage banking net revenue 

Mortgage banking net revenue decreased $15 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. 

The following table presents the components of mortgage banking net revenue: 

TABLE 7: Components of Mortgage Banking Net Revenue For the three months ended March 31, ($ in millions) 2024 2023 Origination fees and gains on loan sales $ 14 &#160; 18 Net mortgage servicing revenue: Gross mortgage servicing fees 78 &#160; 83 Net valuation adjustments on MSRs and free-standing derivatives purchased to economically hedge MSRs 

(38) (32) Net mortgage servicing revenue 40 &#160; 51 Total mortgage banking net revenue $ 54 &#160; 69 

Origination fees and gains on loan sales decreased $4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily driven by lower volumes of residential mortgage loan originations as well as a decrease in mark-to-market gains recognized on held for investment loans measured at fair value. Residential mortgage loan originations decreased to $1.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from $1.4 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily due to the impact of higher market interest rates on originations. 

The following table presents the components of net valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio and the impact of the Bancorp&#8217;s non-qualifying hedging strategy:

$ (38) (32) 

(a) Primarily reflects changes in prepayment speed and OAS assumptions which are updated based on market interest rates. 

(b) Primarily reflects changes due to realized cash flows and the passage of time. 

The Bancorp recognized income of $8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and losses of $53 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 in mortgage banking net revenue for valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio. The valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio included an increase of $41 million and a decrease of $19 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, due to changes in market rates and other inputs in the valuation model, including future prepayment speeds and OAS assumptions. Mortgage rates increased slightly during the three months ended March 31, 2024, which caused a decrease in prepayment speeds. The fair value of the MSR portfolio decreased $33 million and $34 million as a result of contractual principal payments and actual prepayment activity for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Further detail on the valuation of MSRs can be found in Note 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the valuation of the MSR portfolio. Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the free-standing derivatives used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio. 

In addition to the derivative positions used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio, the Bancorp acquires various securities as a component of its non-qualifying hedging strategy. Gains and losses on these securities are recorded in securities gains, net &#8211; non-qualifying hedges on mortgage servicing rights in the Bancorp&#8217;s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s total residential mortgage loans serviced as of March 31, 2024 and 2023 were $115.7 billion and $120.4 billion, respectively, with $99.6 billion and $103.4 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage loans serviced for others. 

Leasing business revenue 

Leasing business revenue decreased $18 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily driven by decreases in operating lease income and lease remarketing fees. 

Other noninterest income 

The following table presents the components of other noninterest income: 

TABLE 9: Components of Other Noninterest Income For the three months ended March 31, ($ in millions) 2024 2023 BOLI income $ 16 &#160; 15 Cardholder fees 13 &#160; 14 Private equity investment income 8 &#160; 8 Equity method investment income 7 &#160; 4 Banking center income 6 &#160; 6 Gains (losses) on sale of businesses 6 &#160; &#8212; Consumer loan fees 5 &#160; 5 Loss on swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares (17) (31) Other, net 6 &#160; 1 Total other noninterest income $ 50 &#160; 22 

Other noninterest income increased $28 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily due to a decrease in the loss on the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares. 

The Bancorp recognized negative valuation adjustments of $17 million related to the Visa total return swap during the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to negative valuation adjustments of $31 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023. For additional information on the valuation of the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares, refer to Note 21 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Securities gains (losses), net 

Net securities gains were $10 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to $4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. For more information, refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

(a) This is a non-GAAP measure. For further information, refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of MD&#38;A. 

Compensation and benefits expense decreased $4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in performance-based compensation and severance expense. The effect of merit increases in the first quarter of 2024 on base compensation expense was largely offset by a reduction in full-time equivalent employees which totaled 18,657 at March 31, 2024 compared to 19,474 at March 31, 2023 . 

Net occupancy expense increased $6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by higher expenses associated with the maintenance and renovation of banking centers and expenses associated with the Bancorp&#8217;s continued expansion into Southeast markets. 

Leasing business expense decreased $9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by a decrease in depreciation expense associated with operating lease equipment. 

The following table presents the components of other noninterest expense: 

TABLE 11: Components of Other Noninterest Expense For the three months ended March 31, ($ in millions) 2024 2023 FDIC insurance and other taxes $ 73 &#160; 40 Loan and lease 29 &#160; 30 Losses and adjustments 22 &#160; 22 Data processing 20 &#160; 22 Dues and subscriptions 15 &#160; 15 Travel 14 &#160; 17 Securities recordkeeping 13 &#160; 12 Postal and courier 13 &#160; 11 Cash and coin processing 12 &#160; 12 Intangible amortization 10 &#160; 12 Professional service fees 9 &#160; 12 Other, net 41 &#160; 48 Total other noninterest expense $ 271 &#160; 253 

Other noninterest expense increased $18 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in FDIC insurance and other taxes. 

FDIC insurance and other taxes increased $33 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the incremental expense associated with the Bancorp&#8217;s updated estimate of its allocated share of the FDIC&#8217;s special assessment, as further discussed in the Overview section of MD&#38;A. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Applicable Income Taxes 

The Bancorp&#8217;s income before income taxes, applicable income tax expense and effective tax rate are as follows: 

TABLE 12: Applicable Income Taxes For the three months ended March 31, ($ in millions) 2024 2023 Income before income taxes $ 658 &#160; 718 Applicable income tax expense 138 &#160; 160 Effective tax rate 21.1 &#160; &#160;% 22.3 

Applicable income tax expense for all periods presented includes the benefits from tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments and tax credits (and other related tax benefits), partially offset by the effect of proportional amortization of qualifying investments and certain nondeductible expenses. The tax credits are primarily associated with the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program established under Section 42 of the IRC, the New Markets Tax Credit program established under Section 45D of the IRC, the Rehabilitation Investment Tax Credit program established under Section 47 of the IRC and the Qualified Zone Academy Bond program established under Section 1397E of the IRC. 

The effective tax rate decreased to 21.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to 22.3% for the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in state tax expense associated with the recognition of certain previously unrecognized tax benefits during the three months ended March 31, 2024 .

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS 

Loans and Leases 

The Bancorp classifies its commercial loans and leases based upon primary purpose and consumer loans based upon product or collateral. Table 13 summarizes end of period loans and leases, including loans and leases held for sale, and Table 14 summarizes average total loans and leases, including average loans and leases held for sale.

Total loans and leases, including loans and leases held for sale, decreased $788 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by a decrease in commercial loans and leases. 

Commercial loans and leases decreased $842 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2023 primarily due to a decrease in commercial and industrial loans, partially offset by increases in commercial construction loans and commercial mortgage loans. Commercial and industrial loans decreased $1.1 billion, or 2%, from December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of payoffs exceeding loan originations. Commercial construction loans increased $168 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2023 as draws on existing commitments and loan originations exceeded payoffs. Commercial mortgage loans increased $70 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2023 as loan originations exceeded payoffs. 

Consumer loans increased $54 million from December 31, 2023 primarily due to increases in indirect secured consumer loans and solar energy installation loans, partially offset by decreases in other consumer loans and credit card. Indirect secured consumer loans increased $341 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by loan production exceeding payoffs. Solar energy installation loans increased $143 million, or 4%, from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by increased loan originations. Other consumer loans decreased $211 million, or 7%, from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by the paydowns of loans originated in connection with one third-party point-of-sale company with which the Bancorp discontinued the origination of new loans in September 2022. Credit card decreased $128 million, or 7%, from December 31, 2023 primarily due to seasonal paydowns on year-end balances.

Average loans and leases, including average loans and leases held for sale, decreased $5.9 billion, or 5%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year driven by decreases in average commercial loans and leases and average consumer loans. 

Average commercial loans and leases decreased $4.6 billion, or 6%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year due to decreases in average commercial and industrial loans and average commercial leases, partially offset by increases in average commercial construction loans and average commercial mortgage loans. Average commercial and industrial loans decreased $4.9 billion, or 9%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of a planned reduction in balances in the second half of 2023. Average commercial leases decreased $120 million, or 5%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of a planned reduction in indirect non-relationship-based lease originations. Average commercial construction loans increased $225 million, or 4%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year as loan originations exceeded payoffs. Average commercial mortgage loans increased $218 million, or 2%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year as loan originations exceeded payoffs. 

Average consumer loans decreased $1.3 billion, or 3%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreases in average indirect secured consumer loans, average residential mortgage loans, average other consumer loans and average home equity, partially offset by an increase in average solar energy installation loans. Average indirect secured consumer loans decreased $1.4 billion, or 9%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by paydowns exceeding loan originations and a planned reduction in balances. Average residential mortgage loans decreased $1.1 billion, or 6%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower origination volumes and a decrease in residential mortgage loans held for sale as the Bancorp sold government-guaranteed loans that were previously in forbearance programs. Average other consumer loans decreased $349 million, or 11%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by the paydowns of loans originated in connection with one third-party point-of-sale company with which the Bancorp discontinued the origination of new loans in September 2022. Average home equity decreased $73 million, or 2%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year as payoffs exceeded loan originations and new advances. Average solar energy installation loans increased $1.6 billion, or 75%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increased loan originations. 

Investment Securities 

The Bancorp uses investment securities as a means of managing interest rate risk, providing collateral for pledging purposes and for liquidity risk management. Total investment securities were $51.8 billion and $51.9 billion at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The taxable available-for-sale debt and other investment securities portfolio had an effective duration o f 5.8 at March 31, 2024 compared to 4.8 at December 31, 2023. The taxable held-to-maturity securities portfolio had an effective duration of 4.2 at March 31, 2024. 

Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale when, in management&#8217;s judgment, they may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, changes in market conditions. Securities that management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

reported at amortized cost. Debt securities are classified as trading typically when bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the ne ar term. At March 31, 2024, the Bancorp&#8217;s investment securities portfolio consisted primarily of AAA-rated available-for-sale debt and other securities and held-to-maturity securities. The Bancorp held an immaterial amount of below-investment grade available-for-sale debt and other securities and held-to-maturity securities at both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

At both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bancorp did not recognize an allowance for credit losses for its investment securities. The Bancorp also did not recognize a provision for credit losses for investment securities during both the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Bancorp recognized $5 million of impairment losses on its available-for-sale debt and other securities, included in securities gains, net, in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. These losses related to certain securities in unrealized loss positions where the Bancorp has determined that it no longer intends to hold the securities until the recovery of their amortized cost bases. The Bancorp did not recognize impairment losses on its available-for-sale debt and other securities for the three months ended March 31, 2023. 

The following table summarizes the end of period components of investment securities:

(a) Other securities consist of FHLB, FRB and DTCC restricted stock hold ings that are carried at cost. 

(b) Includes a discount of $962 at March 31, 2024 pertaining to the unamortized portion of unrealized losses on securities. 

In January 2024, the Bancorp transferred $12.6 billion (amortized cost basis) of securities from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity to reflect the Bancorp&#8217;s change in intent to hold these securities to maturity in order to reduce potential capital volatility associated with investment security market price fluctuations. The transfer included U.S. Treasury and federal agencies securities, agency residential mortgage-backed securities and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. On the date of the transfer, pre-tax unrealized losses of $994 million were included in AOCI related to these transferred securities. The unrealized losses that existed on the date of transfer will continue to be reported as a component of AOCI and will be amortized into income over the remaining life of the securities as an adjustment to yield, offsetting the amortization of the discount resulting from the transfer recorded at fair value. 

On an amortized cost basis, available-for-sale debt and other securities and held-to-maturity securities comprised 28% of total interest-earning assets at both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The estimated weighted-average life of the debt securities in the available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio was 5.5 years and 6.2 years at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In addition, the debt securities in the available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio had a weighted-average yield of 3.07% and 3.06% at March 31, 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. At March 31, 2024, the held-to-maturity securities portfolio had an estimated weighted-average life of 7.4 years and a weighted-average yield of 3.31% . 

Information presented in Tables 16 and 17 is on a weighted-average life basis, anticipating future prepayments. Yield information is presented on an FTE basis and is computed using amortized cost balances and reflects the impact of prepayments. Maturity and yield calculations for the total available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio exclude other securities that have no stated yield or maturity. 

The fair values of investment securities are impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. The fair value of the Bancorp&#8217;s investment securities portfolio generally decreases when interest rates increase or when credit spreads widen. Total net unrealized losses on the available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio were $4.6 billion and $5.4 billion at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Other Short-Term Investments 

Other short-term investments have original maturities less than one year and primarily include interest-bearing balances that are funds on deposit at other depository institutions or the FRB. The Bancorp uses other short-term investments as part of its liquidity risk management tools. Other short-term investments were $22.8 billion at March 31, 2024, an increase of $758 million from December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to stable deposit levels and a decrease in end-of-period loan and lease balances during the three months ended March 31, 2024.

Deposits 

The Bancorp&#8217;s deposit balances represent an important source of funding and revenue growth opportunity. The Bancorp continues to focus on core deposit growth in its retail and commercial franchises by improving customer satisfaction, building full relationships and offering competitive rates. Average core deposits represented 76% of average total assets for both the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

(a) Includes $4.3 billion and $4.4 billion of retail brokered certificates of deposit which are fully covered by FDIC insurance as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Core deposits increased $672 million from December 31, 2023 primarily due to an increase in transaction deposits, partially offset by a decrease in CDs $250,000 or less. Transaction deposits increased $887 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2023 as increases in interest checking deposits and money market deposits were partially offset by a decrease in demand deposits. In response to the higher interest rate environment, deposit balances have migrated from noninterest-bearing products or lower interest-bearing products into higher interest-bearing products. Interest checking deposits increased $1.6 billion, or 3%, from December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of the aforementioned balance migration, partially offset by lower balances per customer account. Money market deposits increased $651 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of higher balances per consumer customer account due to higher offering rates and the aforementioned balance migration. Demand deposits decreased $1.3 billion, or 3%, from December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of the aforementioned balance migration, partially offset by commercial balance growth and higher balances per consumer customer account. CDs $250,000 or less decreased $215 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2023 primarily due to maturities which outpaced new issuances given current market conditions.

On an average basis, core deposits increased $6.3 billion, or 4%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year due to increases in average CDs $250,000 or less and average transaction deposits. In response to the higher interest rate environment, deposit balances have migrated from noninterest-bearing products or lower interest-bearing products into higher interest-bearing products. Average CDs $250,000 or less increased $5.1 billion, or 98%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher offering rates. Average transaction deposits increased $1.2 billion, or 1%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by increases in average interest checking deposits and average money market deposits, partially offset by decreases in average demand deposits and average savings deposits. Average interest checking deposits increased $10.0 billion, or 20%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of the aforementioned balance migration as well as average commercial balance growth, partially offset by lower average balances per consumer customer account. Average money market deposits increased $6.2 billion, or 22%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of higher average balances per consumer customer account due to higher offering rates and the aforementioned balance migration. Average demand deposits decreased $9.9 billion, or 20%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of the aforementioned balance migration and lower average balances per consumer customer account, partially offset by average commercial balance growth. Average savings deposits decreased $5.0 billion, or 22%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower average balances per consumer customer account due to increased consumer spending and the impact of consumer preferences for products with higher offering rates. 

Average CDs over $250,000 increased $1.2 billion, or 27%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in retail brokered CDs issued. 

Contractual maturities 

The contractual maturities of CDs as of March 31, 2024 are summarized in the following table:

(a) Includes CDs $250,000 or less and CDs over $250,000. 

Deposit insurance 

The FDIC generally provides a standard amount of insurance of $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category defined by the FDIC. Depositors may qualify for coverage of accounts over $250,000 if they have funds in different ownership categories and all FDIC requirements are met. All deposits that an account owner has in the same ownership category at the same bank are added together and insured up to the standard insurance amount. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately $99.2 billion, or 59%, and $97.6 billion, or 58%, respectively, of the Bancorp&#8217;s domestic deposits were estimated to be insured. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately $70.3 billion and $71.1 billion, respectively, of the Bancorp&#8217;s domestic deposits were estimated to be uninsured. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately $3.3 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, of the Bancorp&#8217;s time deposits were estimated to be not fully insured. The estimated uninsured portions of those time deposits were $1.9 billion at both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Where information is not readily available to determine the amount of insured deposits, the amount of uninsured deposits is estimated, consistent with the methodologies and assumptions utilized in providing information to the Bank&#8217;s regulators. 

Borrowings 

The Bancorp accesses a variety of short-term and long-term funding sources. Borrowings with original maturities of one year or less are classified as short-term and include federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings. Total average borrowings as a percent of average interest-bearing liabilities we re 13% and 15% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

The following table summarizes the end of period components of borrowings: 

TABLE 21: Components of Borrowings As of ($ in millions) March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 Federal funds purchased $ 247 &#160; 193 Other short-term borrowings 2,866 &#160; 2,861 Long-term debt 15,444 &#160; 16,380 Total borrowings $ 18,557 &#160; 19,434 

Total borr owings decreased $877 million , or 5%, fro m December 31, 2023 primarily due to a decrease in long-term debt of $936 million which was driven by the redemptions or maturities of $2.3 billion of notes, $129 million of paydowns associated with loan securitizations and $91 million of fair value adjustments associated with hedged long-term debt. These decreases were partially offset by the issuance of senior fixed-rate/floating-rate notes in January of 2024 totaling $1.0 billion. Additionally, in March of 2024 the Bancorp obtained $500 million in new FHLB advances that will mature in 2026, utilizing its existing borrowing capacity. 

The following table summarizes components of average borrowings for the three months ended: 

TABLE 22: Components of Average Borrowings ($ in millions) March 31, 2024 March 31, 2023 Federal funds purchased $ 201 &#160; 487 Other short-term borrowings 3,534 &#160; 5,375 Long-term debt 15,515 &#160; 13,510 Total average borrowings $ 19,250 &#160; 19,372 

Total average borrowin gs decreased $122 million, or 1%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreases in average other short-term borrowings and average federal funds purchased, partially offset by an increase in average long-term debt. Average other short-term borrowings and average federal funds purchased decreased $1.8 billion and $286 million , respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increased long-term debt which reduced the need for short-term funding during the period. T he level of other short-term borrowings can fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on funding needs and the sources that are used to satisfy those needs. For further information on the components of other short-term borrowings, ref er to Note 14 of th e Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Average long-term debt increased $2.0 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by the issuance of senior fixed-rate/floating-rate notes of $1.25 billion in July of 2023, the issuance of asset-backed securities of $1.5 billion in August of 2023 related to an automobile loan securitization and $1.5 billion in new FHLB advances obtained by the Bancorp since March 31, 2023 as well as the aforementioned issuance of senior fixed-rate/floating-rate notes in 2024 of $1.0 billion. These increases were partially offset by redemptions or maturities of $2.8 billion of notes, $325 million of paydowns associated with loan securitizations and $155 million of fair value adjustments associated with hedged long-term debt since March 31, 2023. Information on the average rates paid on borrowings is discussed in the Net Interest Income subsection of the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&#38;A. In addition, refer to the Liquidity Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A for a discussion on the role of borrowings in the Bancorp&#8217;s liquidity management.

BUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW 

The Bancorp reports on three business segments: Commercial Banking, Consumer and Small Business Banking and Wealth and Asset Management. Additional information on each business segment is included in Note 22 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of the Bancorp&#8217;s business segments are presented based on its management structure and management accounting practices. The structure and accounting practices are specific to the Bancorp; therefore, the financial results of the Bancorp&#8217;s business segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial institutions. The Bancorp refines its methodologies from time to time as management&#8217;s accounting practices and businesses change. 

During the first quarter of 2024, the Bancorp eliminated certain revenue sharing agreements between Wealth and Asset Management and Consumer and Small Business Banking. As a result, the results of operations for the Wealth and Asset Management segment for the three months ended March 31, 2023 were adjusted to reflect the impact of the elimination of these revenue sharing agreements between Wealth and Asset Management and Consumer and Small Business Banking. 

The Bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the corporate level. By employing an FTP methodology, the business segments are insulated from most benchmark interest rate volatility, enabling them to focus on serving customers through the origination of loans and acceptance of deposits. The FTP methodology assigns charge and credit rates to classes of assets and liabilities, respectively, based on the estimated amount and timing of the cash flows for each transaction. Assigning the FTP rate based on matching the duration of cash flows allocates interest income and interest expense to each business segment so its resulting net interest income is insulated from future changes in benchmark interest rates. The Bancorp&#8217;s FTP methodology also allocates the contribution to net interest income of the asset-generating and deposit-providing businesses on a duration-adjusted basis to better attribute the driver of the performance. As the asset and liability durations are not perfectly matched, the residual impact of the FTP methodology is captured in General Corporate and Other. The charge and credit rates are determined using the FTP rate curve, which is based on an estimate of Fifth Third&#8217;s marginal borrowing cost in the wholesale funding markets. The FTP curve is constructed using the U.S. swap curve, brokered CD pricing and unsecured debt pricing. 

The Bancorp adjusts the FTP charge and credit rates as dictated by changes in interest rates for various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and by the review of behavioral assumptions, such as prepayment rates on interest-earning assets and the estimated durations for indeterminate-lived deposits. Key assumptions, including the credit rates provided for deposit accounts, are reviewed annually. Credit rates for deposit products and charge rates for loan products may be reset more frequently in response to changes in market conditions. In general, the charge rates on assets increased since December 31, 2023 as they were affected by the prevailing level of interest rates and repricing characteristics of the portfolio. The credit rates for deposit products decreased modestly since December 31, 2023 due to modified assumptions and an inverted yield curve. As a result, net interest income for each segment was negatively impacted during the three months ended March 31, 2024 as a result of these updates to FTP charge and credit rates. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s methodology for allocating provision for credit losses to the business segments includes charges or benefits associated with changes in criticized commercial loan levels in addition to actual net charge-offs experienced by the loans and leases owned by each business segment. Provision for credit losses attributable to loan and lease growth and changes in ALLL factors is captured in General Corporate and Other. The financial results of the business segments include allocations for shared services and headquarters expenses. Additionally, the business segments form synergies by taking advantage of relationship depth opportunities and funding operations by accessing the capital markets as a collective unit. 

The following table summarizes net income (loss) by business segment:

Net income was $369 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to $580 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in net interest income on an FTE basis, an increase in provision for credit losses and a decrease in noninterest income, partially offset by a decrease in noninterest expense. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis decreased $290 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by increases in average balances of and rates paid on interest checking deposits and savings and money market deposits as well as increases in FTP charge rates on commercial loans and leases. These negative impacts were partially offset by increases in yields on average commercial loans and leases as well as increases in FTP credits on interest checking deposits . 

Provision for credit losses increased $ 25 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by an increase in the allocated provision for credit losses related to commercial criticized assets as well as an increase in net charge-offs on commercial and industrial loans. Annualized net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases increased to 18 bps for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to 15 bps for the same period in the prior year. 

Noninterest income decreased $10 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in commercial banking revenue and leasing business revenue, partially offset by increases in service charges on deposits and other noninterest income.

Net income was $46 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to $74 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in net interest income and an increase in noninterest expense, partially offset by an increase in noninterest income. 

Net interest income decreased $42 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by an increase in rates paid on average deposits, a decrease in FTP credits on deposits and an increase in FTP charge rates on loans and leases. These negative impacts were partially offset by an increase in yields on loans and leases for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. 

Noninterest income increased $10 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in wealth and asset management revenue, which increased $9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 driven by an increase in personal asset management revenue. 

Noninterest expense increased $3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by an increase in other noninterest expense. Other noninterest expense increased $2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 primarily as the result of increases in allocated expenses . 

Average loans and leases decreased $289 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in average residential mortgage loans, average other consumer loans and average commercial and industrial loans as payoffs exceeded loan production. 

Average deposits decreased $1.6 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in average interest checking deposits, average demand deposits and average savings and money market deposits as a result of lower average balances per customer account, partially offset by an increase in average certificates of deposit. 

General Corporate and Other 

General Corporate and Other includes the unallocated portion of the investment securities portfolio, securities gains and losses, certain non-core deposit funding, unassigned equity, unallocated provision for credit losses or a benefit from the reduction of the ACL, the payment of preferred stock dividends and certain support activities and other items not attributed to the business segments. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Net interest income on an FTE basis increased $332 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by increases in FTP charge rates on loans and leases allocated to the business segments as well as an increase in interest income on other short-term investments. These positive impacts were partially offset by increases in FTP credits on deposits allocated to the business segments as well as an increase in interest expense on long-term debt. The increases in both FTP credits and FTP charges allocated to the business segments were driven by increases in market interest rates. Under the Bancorp&#8217;s internal reporting methodology, the Bancorp insulates the business segments from interest rate risk associated with fixed-rate lending by transferring this risk to General Corporate and Other through the FTP methodology. As a result, the amount of FTP credits on deposits earned by the business segments has increased at a faster pace than the amount of allocated FTP charges on loans and leases. If market interest rates remain at current levels, the FTP charges to the business segments for loans and leases will increase over time as fixed-rate loans mature and are replaced with new originations. 

The benefit from credit losses was $61 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to a provision for credit losses of $67 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in the benefit from credit losses was primarily driven by an increase in allocations to the business segments. 

Noninterest income increased $21 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by a decrease in the loss on the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B shares. 

Noninterest expense increased $64 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by a decrease in corporate overhead allocations from General Corporate and Other to the other business segments as well as the incremental expense associated with the Bancorp&#8217;s updated estimate of its allocated share of the FDIC&#8217;s special assessment. These impacts were partially offset by a decrease in compensation and benefits primarily driven by decreases in performance-based compensation and base compensation.

RISK MANAGEMENT - OVERVIEW 

The Risk Management Overview section included in Item 7 of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K describes the Bancorp&#8217;s Enterprise Risk Management Framework and Three Lines of Defense structure as well as key areas of risk, which include credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, price risk, legal and regulatory compliance risk, operational risk, reputation risk and strategic risk. Item 7 of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K also includes additional detailed information about the Bancorp&#8217;s processes related to operational risk management as well as legal and regulatory compliance risk management. The following information should be read in conjunction with the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT 

Credit risk management utilizes a framework that encompasses consistent processes for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting credit risk. These processes are supported by a credit risk governance structure that includes Board oversight, policies, risk limits and risk committees. 

The objective of the Bancorp&#8217;s credit risk management strategy is to quantify and manage credit risk on an aggregate portfolio basis, as well as to limit the risk of loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to honor its financial or contractual obligations to the Bancorp. The Bancorp&#8217;s credit risk management strategy is based on three core principles: conservatism, diversification and monitoring. The Bancorp believes that effective credit risk management begins with conservative lending practices which are described below. These practices include the use of intentional risk-based limits for single name exposures and counterparty selection criteria designed to reduce or eliminate exposure to borrowers who have higher than average default risk and defined weaknesses in financial performance. The Bancorp carefully designs and monitors underwriting, documentation and collection standards. The Bancorp&#8217;s credit risk management strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry, product and customer level as well as ongoing portfolio monitoring and timely management reviews of large credit exposures and credits experiencing deterioration of credit quality. Credit officers with the authority to extend credit are delegated specific authority based on risk and exposure amount, the use of which is closely monitored. Underwriting activities are centrally managed, and Credit Risk Management manages the policy and the authority delegation process directly. The Credit Risk Review function provides independent and objective assessments of the quality of underwriting and documentation, the accuracy of risk ratings and the charge-off, nonaccrual and reserve analysis process. The Bancorp&#8217;s credit review process and overall assessment of the adequacy of the ACL is based on quarterly assessments of the estimated losses expected in the loan and lease portfolio. The Bancorp uses these assessments to maintain an adequate ACL and record any necessary charge-offs. Certain loans and leases with probable or observed credit weaknesses receive enhanced monitoring and undergo a periodic review. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Bancorp&#8217;s credit rating categories, which are derived from standard regulatory rating definitions. In addition, stress testing is performed on various commercial and consumer portfolios utilizing various models. For certain portfolios, such as real estate and leveraged lending, stress testing is performed at the individual loan level during credit underwriting. 

In addition to the individual review of larger commercial loans that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses, the commercial credit review process includes the use of two risk rating systems. The first of these risk rating systems is based on regulatory guidance for credit risk rating systems. These ratings are used by the Bancorp to monitor and manage its credit risk. The Bancorp also separately maintains a dual risk rating system for credit approval and pricing, portfolio monitoring and capital allocation that includes a &#8220;through-the-cycle&#8221; rating philosophy for assessing a borrower&#8217;s creditworthiness. This &#8220;through-the-cycle&#8221; ra ting philosophy uses a grading scale that assigns ratings based on average default rates through an entire business cycle for borrowers with similar financial performance. The dual risk rating system includes thirteen categories for estimating probabilities of default and an additional eleven categories for estimating losses given an event of default. The probability of default and loss given default evaluations are not separated in the regulatory risk rating system. 

The Bancorp utilizes internally developed models to estimate expected credit losses for portfolio loans and leases. For loans and leases that are collectively evaluated, the Bancorp utilizes these models to forecast expected credit losses over a reasonable and supportable forecast period based on the probability of a loan or lease defaulting, the expected balance at the estimated date of default and the expected loss percentage given a default. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for additional information about the Bancorp&#8217;s processes for developing these models, for estimating credit losses for periods beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period and for estimating credit losses for individually evaluated loans. 

For the commercial portfolio segment, the estimated probabilities of default are primarily based on the probability of default ratings assigned under the dual risk rating system and historical observations of how those ratings migrate to a default over time in the context of macroeconomic conditions. For loans with available credit, the estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected utilization rates, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. 

For collectively evaluated loans in the consumer and residential mortgage portfolio segments, the Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models primarily utilize the borrower&#8217;s FICO score and delinquency history in combination with macroeconomic conditions when estimating the probability of default. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those

characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. The expected balance at the estimated date of default is also especially impactful in the expected credit loss models for portfolio classes which generally have longer terms (such as residential mortgage loans and home equity) and portfolio classes containing a high concentration of loans with revolving privileges (such as home equity). The estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected prepayment and utilization rates where applicable, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. The Bancorp also utilizes various scoring systems, analytical tools and portfolio performance monitoring processes to assess the credit risk of the consumer and residential mortgage portfolios. 

Overview 

During the first quarter of 2024, economic growth remained resilient as strong job growth, improved capital markets activity and fiscal deficit spending supported above-trend economic growth while the downward trend in inflation reversed, driven by acceleration in inflation for services. With the FOMC less likely to cut rates in the near-term, market expectations for rate cuts this year shifted from seven in mid-January 2024 to three by the end of the first quarter of 2024. The FOMC continues to seek a soft landing for the economy while balancing the risks of cutting rates too soon and allowing price pressures to become entrenched against the risks associated with maintaining a restrictive policy for too long. 

Going forward, it is unclear whether inflation can return sustainably to the FOMC&#8217;s long-run target of 2% without an extended period of tighter monetary policy leading to below-potential growth and a softer labor market. The risk remains that inflation may be more persistent than expected by the FOMC and financial markets. Geopolitical tensions remain elevated and have the potential to become very disruptive to the economic outlook if they continue to escalate. Against this backdrop, tighter liquidity in the banking sector is limiting the supply of credit in the economy. Over time, these factors may adversely impact business investment, job growth and consumer spending, potentially leading to a downturn in the economy. 

Commercial Portfolio 

The Bancorp&#8217;s credit risk management strategy seeks to minimize concentrations of risk through diversification. The Bancorp has commercial loan concentration limits based on industry, lines of business within the commercial segment, geography and credit product type. The risk within the commercial loan and lease portfolio is managed and monitored through an underwriting process utilizing detailed origination policies, continuous loan level reviews, monitoring of industry concentration and product type limits and continuous portfolio risk management reporting. 

The Bancorp is closely monitoring various economic factors and their impacts on commercial borrowers, including, but not limited to, the level of inflation, higher-for-longer interest rates, labor and supply chain issues, volatility and changes in consumer discretionary spending patterns, including debt and default levels. The Bancorp maintains focus on disciplined client selection, adherence to underwriting policy and attention to concentrations. 

The Bancorp provides loans to a variety of customers ranging from large multinational firms to middle market businesses, sole proprietors and high net worth individuals. The origination policies for commercial and industrial loans outline the risks and underwriting requirements for loans to businesses in various industries. Included in the policies are maturity and amortization terms, collateral and leverage requirements, cash flow coverage measures and hold limits. The Bancorp aligns credit and sales teams with specific industry and regional expertise to better monitor and manage different industry and geographic segments of the portfolio.

The origination policies for commercial real estate outline the risks and underwriting requirements for owner and nonowner-occupied and construction lending. Included in the policies are maturity and amortization terms, maximum LTVs, minimum debt service coverage ratios, construction loan monitoring procedures, appraisal requirements, pre-leasing requirements (as applicable), pro forma analysis requirements and interest rate sensitivity. The Bancorp requires a valuation of real estate collateral, which may include third-party appraisals, be performed at the time of origination and renewal in accordance with regulatory requirements and on an as-needed basis when market conditions justify. The Bancorp maintains an appraisal review department to order and review third-party appraisals in accordance with regulatory requirements. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Nonaccrual assets with relationships exceeding $1 million are reviewed quarterly to assess the appropriateness of the value ascribed in the assessment of charge-offs and specific reserves. Additionally, collateral values are also reviewed at least annually for all criticized assets. 

The Bancorp assesses all real estate and non-real estate collateral securing a loan and considers all cross-collateralized loans in the calculation of the LTV ratio. The following tables provide detail on the most recent LTV ratios for commercial mortgage loans greater than $1 million, excluding commercial mortgage loans that are individually evaluated for an ACL. The Bancorp does not typically aggregate the LTV ratios for commercial mortgage loans less than $1 million.

Consumer Portfolio 

The Bancorp&#8217;s consumer portfolio is materially comprised of six categories of loans: residential mortgage loans, home equity, indirect secured consumer loans, credit card, solar energy installation loans and other consumer loans. The Bancorp has identified certain credit characteristics within these six categories of loans which it believes represent a higher level of risk compared to the rest of the consumer loan portfolio. The Bancorp does not update LTVs for the consumer portfolio subsequent to origination except as part of the charge-off process for real estate secured loans. The Bancorp actively manages the consumer portfolio through concentration limits, which mitigate credit risk through limiting the exposure to lower FICO scores, higher LTVs, specific geographic concentration risks and additional risk elements. 

The Bancorp continues to ensure that underwriting standards and guidelines adequately account for the broader economic conditions that the consumer portfolio faces in a rising-rate environment. Guidelines are designed to ensure that the various consumer products fall within the Bancorp&#8217;s risk appetite. These guidelines are monitored and adjusted as deemed appropriate in response to the prevailing economic conditions while remaining within the Bancorp&#8217;s risk tolerance limits. 

The payment structures for certain variable rate products (such as residential mortgage loans, home equity and credit card) are susceptible to changes in benchmark interest rates. With increases in interest rates, minimum payments on these products also increase, raising the potential for the environment to be disruptive to some borrowers. The Bancorp actively monitors the portion of its consumer portfolio that is susceptible to increases in minimum payments and continues to assess the impact on the overall risk appetite and soundness of the portfolio. 

Residential mortgage portfolio 

The Bancorp manages credit risk in the residential mortgage portfolio through underwriting guidelines that limit exposure to loan characteristics determined to influence credit risk. Additionally, the portfolio is governed by concentration limits that ensure geographic, product and channel diversification. The Bancorp may also package and sell loans in the portfolio. 

The Bancorp does not originate residential mortgage loans that permit customers to make payments that are less than the accruing interest. The Bancorp originates both fixed-rate and ARM loans. Within the ARM portfolio, approximately $528 million of ARM loans will have rate resets during the next twelve months. Of these resets, 95% are expected to experience an increase in rate, with an average increase of approximately 1.66%. Underlying characteristics of these borrowers are relatively strong with a weighted average origination debt-to-income ratio of 35% and weighted average origination LTV of 72%. 

Certain residential mortgage products have characteristics that may increase the Bancorp&#8217;s credit loss rates in the event of a decline in housing values. These types of mortgage products offered by the Bancorp include loans with high LTVs, multiple loans secured by the same collateral that when combined result in an LTV greater than 80% and interest-only loans. The Bancorp has deemed residential mortgage loans with greater than 80% LTVs and no mortgage insurance as loans that represent a higher level of risk.

Home equity portfolio 

The Bancorp&#8217;s home equity portfolio is primarily comprised of home equity lines of credit. Beginning in the first quarter of 2013, the Bancorp&#8217;s newly originated home equity lines of credit have a 10-year interest-only draw period followed by a 20-year amortization period. The home equity line of credit previously offered by the Bancorp was a revolving facility with a 20-year term, minimum payments of interest-only and a balloon payment of principal at maturity. Approximately 27% of the outstanding balances of the Bancorp&#8217;s portfolio of home equity lines of credit have a balloon structure at maturity. Peak maturity years for the balloon home equity lines of credit are 2025 to 2028 and approximately 6% of the balances mature before 2025. 

The ACL provides coverage for expected losses in the home equity portfolio. The allowance attributable to the portion of the home equity portfolio that is collectively evaluated is determined on a pooled basis using a probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default model framework to generate expected losses. The expected losses for the home equity portfolio are dependent upon loan 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

delinquency, FICO scores, LTV, loan age and their historical correlation with macroeconomic variables including unemployment and the home price index. The expected losses generated from models are adjusted by certain qualitative adjustment factors to reflect risks associated with current conditions and trends. The qualitative factors include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, economic conditions, portfolio mix, lending and risk management personnel, results of internal audit and quality control reviews, collateral values and geographic concentrations. 

The home equity portfolio is managed in two primary groups: loans outstanding with a combined LTV greater than 80% and those loans with an LTV of 80% or less based upon appraisals at origination. For additional information on these loans, refer to Table 36 and Table 37. Of the total $3.9 billion of outstanding home equity loans: 

&#8226; 75% reside within the Bancorp&#8217;s Midwest footprint of Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky as of March 31, 2024; 

&#8226; 34% are in senior lien positions and 66% are in junior lien positions at March 31, 2024; 

&#8226; 75% of non-delinquent borrowers made at least one payment greater than the minimum payment during the three months ended March 31, 2024; and 

&#8226; The portfolio had a weighted average refreshed FICO score of 749 at March 31, 2024. 

The Bancorp actively manages lines of credit and makes adjustments in lending limits when it believes it is necessary based on FICO score deterioration and property devaluation. The Bancorp does not routinely obtain appraisals on performing loans to update LTVs after origination. However, the Bancorp monitors the local housing markets by reviewing various home price indices and incorporates the impact of the changing market conditions in its ongoing credit monitoring processes. For junior lien home equity loans which become 60 days or more past due, the Bancorp tracks the performance of the senior lien loans in which the Bancorp is the servicer and utilizes consumer credit bureau attributes to monitor the status of the senior lien loans that the Bancorp does not service. If the senior lien loan is found to be 120 days or more past due, the junior lien home equity loan is placed on nonaccrual status unless both loans are well-secured and in the process of collection. Additionally, if the junior lien home equity loan becomes 120 days or more past due and the senior lien loan is also 120 days or more past due, the junior lien home equity loan is assessed for charge-off. Refer to the Analysis of Nonperforming Assets subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A and Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for more information.

Analysis of Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and leases for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of the principal and/or interest is uncertain and certain other assets, including OREO and other repossessed property. A summary of nonperforming assets is included in Table 47. For further information on the Bancorp&#8217;s policies related to accounting for delinquent and nonperforming loans and leases, refer to the Nonaccrual Loans and Leases section of Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Nonperforming assets were $748 million at March 31, 2024 compared to $689 million at December 31, 2023. At March 31, 2024, $5 million of nonaccrual loans were held for sale, compared to $1 million at December 31, 2023. 

Nonperforming portfolio assets as a percent of portfolio loans and leases and OREO were 0.64% and 0.59% at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Nonaccrual loans and leases secured by real estate were 34% of nonaccrual loans and leases as of March 31, 2024 compared to 32% as of December 31, 2023. 

Portfolio commercial nonaccrual loans and leases were $372 million at March 31, 2024, an increase of $46 million from December 31, 2023. Portfolio residential mortgage and consumer nonaccrual loans were $336 million at March 31, 2024, an increase of $13 million from December 31, 2023. Refer to Table 48 for a rollforward of portfolio nonaccrual loans and leases. 

OREO and other repossessed property was $35 million and $39 million at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Bancorp recognized an immaterial amount in losses on the transfer, sale or write-down of OREO properties for both the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately $17 million and $10 million, respectively, of interest income would have been recognized if the nonaccrual portfolio loans and leases had been current in accordance with their contractual terms. Although these values help demonstrate the costs of carrying nonaccrual credits, the Bancorp does not expect to recover the full amount of interest as nonaccrual loans and leases are generally carried below their principal balance.

Analysis of Net Loan Charge-offs 

Net charge-offs were 38 bps and 26 bps of average portfolio loans and leases for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Table 50 provides a summary of credit loss experience and net charge-offs as a percentage of average portfolio loans and leases outstanding by loan category. 

The ratio of commercial loan and lease net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio commercial loans and leases increased to 19 bps during the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to 17 bps during the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in net charge-offs on commercial and industrial loans of $5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. 

The ratio of consumer loan net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio consumer loans increased to 67 bps during the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to 42 bps during the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in net charge-offs on indirect secured consumer loans of $10 million and solar energy installation loans of $9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses is comprised of the ALLL and the reserve for unfunded commitments. As described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Bancorp maintains the ALLL to absorb the amount of credit losses that are expected to be incurred over the remaining contractual terms of the related loans and leases (as adjusted for prepayments). The Bancorp&#8217;s methodology for determining the ALLL includes an estimate of expected credit losses on a collective basis for groups of loans and leases with similar risk characteristics and specific allowances for loans and leases which are individually evaluated. For collectively evaluated loans and leases, the Bancorp uses quantitative models to forecast expected credit losses based on the probability of a loan or lease defaulting, the expected balance at the estimated date of default and the expected loss percentage given a default. The Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models consider historical credit loss experience, current market and economic conditions, and forecasted changes in market and economic conditions if such forecasts are considered reasonable and supportable. 

The Bancorp also considers qualitative factors in determining the ALLL. Qualitative adjustments are used to capture characteristics in the portfolio that impact expected credit losses which are not fully captured within the Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models. These factors include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, lending and risk management personnel and results of internal audit and quality control reviews. In addition, the qualitative adjustment framework can be utilized to address specific idiosyncratic risks such as geopolitical events, natural disasters or changes in current economic conditions that are not reflected in the quantitative credit loss models, and their effects on regional borrowers and changes in product structures. Qualitative factors may also be used to address the impacts of unforeseen events on key inputs and assumptions within the Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models, such as the reasonable and supportable forecast period, changes to historical loss information or changes to the reversion period or methodology. 

In addition to the ALLL, the Bancorp maintains a reserve for unfunded commitments recorded in other liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The methodology used to determine the adequacy of this reserve is similar to the Bancorp&#8217;s methodology for determining the ALLL. The provision for unfunded commitments is included in the provision for credit losses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 

For the commercial portfolio segment, the estimates for probability of default are primarily based on internal ratings assigned to each commercial borrower on a 13-point scale and historical observations of how those ratings migrate to a default over time in the context of macroeconomic conditions. For loans with available credit, the estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected utilization rates, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. 

For collectively evaluated loans in the consumer and residential mortgage portfolio segments, the Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models primarily utilize the borrower&#8217;s FICO score and delinquency history in combination with macroeconomic conditions when estimating the probability of default. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. The expected balance at the estimated date of default is also especially impactful in the expected credit loss models for portfolio classes which generally have longer terms (such as residential mortgage loans and home equity) and portfolio classes containing a high concentration of loans with revolving privileges (such as home equity). The estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected prepayment and utilization rates where applicable, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. 

At both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bancorp used three forward-looking economic scenarios during the reasonable and supportable forecast period in its expected credit loss models to address the inherent imprecision in macroeconomic forecasting. Each of the three scenarios was developed by a third party that is subject to the Bancorp&#8217;s Third-Party Risk Management program including oversight by the Bancorp&#8217;s independent model risk management group. The scenarios included a most likely outcome (Baseline) and two less probable scenarios with one being more favorable than the Baseline and the other being less favorable. The more favorable alternative scenario (Upside) depicted a stronger near-term growth outlook while the less favorable outlook (Downside) depicted a moderate recession. 

The Baseline scenario was developed such that the expectation is that the economy will perform better than the projection 50% of the time and worse than the projection 50% of the time. The Upside scenario was developed such that there is a 10% probability that the economy will perform better than the projection and a 90% probability that it will perform worse. The Downside scenario was developed such that there is a 90% probability that the economy will perform better than the projection and a 10% probability that it will perform worse. 

March 31, 2024 ACL 

The ACL as of March 31, 2024 was impacted by several factors when compared to December 31, 2023, including a more favorable macroeconomic forecast and lower period-end loan and lease balances, partially offset by increases to specific reserves on individually evaluated commercial loans. As of March 31, 2024, the Bancorp&#8217;s macroeconomic scenarios included estimates of the expected impacts of the changes in economic conditions caused by expected interest rate cuts and geopolitical risks. At March 31, 2024, the Bancorp assigned an 80% probability weighting to the Baseline scenario and 10% to each of the Upside and Downside scenarios. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

The Baseline scenario assumed average annual real GDP growth of 2.5% for 2024 with the forecast decreasing to 1.5% in 2025 and then increasing to 1.9% in 2026. The Baseline scenario also assumed an average unemployment rate of 3.9% for 2024, increasing to an average of 4.1% in 2025 and slightly decreasing to an average of 4.0% in 2026. Lastly, the Baseline scenario assumed cuts to the target federal funds rate starting in the third quarter of 2024, with an average federal funds rate of 5.2% in 2024 that decreases to an average of 4.3% and 3.3% in 2025 and 2026, respectively. The Upside scenario assumed that, on an average annual basis, the change in real GDP is 3.3% in 2024, slightly decreasing to an average of 3.0% in 2025 and further decreasing to an average of 2.3% in 2026. The Upside scenario also assumed an average unemployment rate of 3.4%, 3.2% and 3.4% in 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. In the Upside scenario, the forecast for federal funds rate cuts was generally consistent with the Baseline scenario. The Downside scenario included significant worsening of economic conditions, causing the U.S. economy to fall into a recession in the second quarter of 2024. The Downside scenario assumed that average annual real GDP growth declines to (3.2%) in the second quarter of 2024, modestly recovering to an average of (0.6%) in 2025 and further recovering to an average of 2.4% in 2026. The Downside scenario assumed an average unemployment rate of 5.8% in 2024, increasing to an average of 7.5% in 2025 and decreasing to an average of 6.4% in 2026. In the Downside scenario, the forecast for the federal funds rate included fewer rate cuts than the Baseline scenario, with an average target rate of 4.7% in 2024, followed by a series of steeper rate cuts to an average of 2.1% and 1.0% in 2025 and 2026, respectively. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s quantitative credit loss models are sensitive to changes in economic forecast assumptions over the reasonable and supportable forecast period. Applying a 100% probability weighting to the Downside scenario rather than using the probability-weighted three scenario approach would result in an increase in the quantitative ACL of approximately $2.1 billion. This sensitivity calculation only reflects the impact of changing the probability weighting of the scenarios in the quantitative credit loss models and excludes any additional considerations associated with the qualitative component of the ACL that might be warranted if probability weights were adjusted. 

The following table provides a rollforward of the Bancorp&#8217;s ACL:

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

INTEREST RATE AND PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT 

Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from movement of interest rates. This risk primarily impacts the Bancorp&#8217;s income categories through changes in interest income on earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, and through fee items that are related to interest-sensitive activities such as mortgage origination and servicing income and through earnings credits earned on commercial deposits that offset commercial deposit fees. Price risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from changes in the value of financial instruments and portfolios due to movements in interest rates, volatilities, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices. Management considers interest rate risk a prominent market risk in terms of its potential impact on earnings. Interest rate risk may occur for any one or more of the following reasons: 

&#8226; Assets and liabilities mature or reprice at different times; 

&#8226; Short-term and long-term market interest rates change by different amounts; or 

&#8226; The expected maturities of various assets or liabilities shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. 

In addition to the direct impact of interest rate changes on NII and interest-sensitive fees, interest rates can impact earnings through their effect on loan and deposit demand, credit losses, mortgage origination volumes, the value of servicing rights and other sources of the Bancorp&#8217;s earnings. Changes in interest rates and other market factors can impact earnings through changes in the value of portfolios, if not appropriately hedged. Stability of the Bancorp&#8217;s net income is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk and to a lesser extent price risk. 

Management continually reviews the Bancorp&#8217;s on- and off-balance sheet composition, earnings flows, and hedging strategies and models interest rate risk and price risk exposures, and possible actions to manage these risks, given numerous possible future interest rate and market factor scenarios. A series of policy limits and key risk indicators are employed to ensure that risks are managed within the Bancorp&#8217;s risk tolerance for interest rate risk and price risk. 

The Commercial Banking and Wealth and Asset Management lines of business manage price risk for capital markets sales and trading activities related to their respective businesses. The Consumer and Small Business Banking line of business manages price risk for the origination and sale of conforming residential mortgage loans to government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises. The Bancorp&#8217;s Treasury department manages interest rate risk and price risk for all other activities. Independent oversight is provided by ERM, and key risk indicators and Board-approved policy limits are used to ensure risks are managed within the Bancorp&#8217;s risk tolerance. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s Market Risk Management Committee, which includes senior management representatives and reports to the Corporate Credit Committee (accountable to the ERMC), provides oversight and monitors price risk for the capital markets sales and trading activities. The Bancorp&#8217;s ALCO, which includes senior management representatives and is accountable to the ERMC, provides oversight and monitors interest rate and price risks for Mortgage and Treasury activities. 

Net Interest Income Sensitivity 

The Bancorp employs a variety of measurement techniques to identify and manage its interest rate risk, including the use of an NII simulation model to analyze the sensitivity of NII to changes in interest rates. The model is based on contractual and estimated cash flows and repricing characteristics for all of the Bancorp&#8217;s assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet exposures and incorporates market-based assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and attrition rates of certain liabilities. The model also includes senior management&#8217;s projections of the future volume and pricing of each of the product lines offered by the Bancorp as well as other pertinent assumptions. The NII simulation model does not represent a forecast of the Bancorp&#8217;s net interest income but is a tool utilized to assess the risk of the impact of changing market interest rates across a range of market interest rate environments. As a result, actual results will differ from simulated results for multiple reasons, which may include actual balance sheet composition differences, timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, deviations from projected customer behavioral assumptions as well as from changes in market conditions and management strategies. 

As of March 31, 2024, the Bancorp&#8217;s interest rate risk exposure is governed by a risk framework that utilizes the change in NII over 12-month and 24-month horizons under parallel and non-parallel ramped increases and decreases in interest rates. Policy limits are utilized for scenarios assuming a 200 bps increase and a 200 bps decrease in interest rates over 12-month and 24-month horizons. The Bancorp routinely analyzes various potential and extreme scenarios, including parallel ramps and shocks as well as steepening and other non-parallel shifts in rates, to assess where risks to net interest income persist or develop as changes in the balance sheet and market rates evolve, and employs policy limits and/or key risk indicators to monitor and manage exposures under these types of scenarios. Additionally, the Bancorp routinely evaluates its exposures to changes in the bases between interest rates. 

In order to recognize the risk of noninterest-bearing demand deposit balance migration or attrition in a rising interest rate environment, the Bancorp&#8217;s NII sensitivity modeling assumes additional attrition of approximately $350 million of demand deposit balances over a period of 24 months for each 100 bps increase in short-term market interest rates. Similarly, the Bancorp&#8217;s NII sensitivity modeling incorporates approximately $350 million of incremental growth in noninterest-bearing deposit balances over 24 months for each 100 bps decrease in short- 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

term market interest rates. The incremental balance attrition and growth are modeled to flow into and out of funding products that reprice in conjunction with short-term market rate changes. 

Another important deposit modeling assumption is the amount by which interest-bearing deposit rates will increase or decrease when market interest rates increase or decrease. This deposit repricing sensitivity is known as the beta, and it represents the expected amount by which the Bancorp&#8217;s interest-bearing deposit rates will change for a given change in short-term market rates. The Bancorp utilizes dynamic deposit beta models to adjust assumed repricing sensitivity depending on market rate levels. The dynamic beta models were developed utilizing the Bancorp&#8217;s performance during prior interest rate cycles. Since the beginning of the current tightening cycle, the Bancorp&#8217;s actual cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta through March 31, 2024 was slightly above 50% as repricing has been similar to what was experienced in prior interest rate cycles. Using the dynamic beta models, the Bancorp&#8217;s NII sensitivity modeling assumes weighted-average rising-rate interest-bearing deposit betas at the end of the ramped parallel scenarios of 78% for both a 100 bps and 200 bps increase in rates. In the event of rate cuts, this approach assumes a weighted-average falling-rate interest-bearing deposit beta at the end of the ramped parallel scenarios of 68% and 67% for a 100 bps and 200 bps decrease in rates, respectively. In falling rate scenarios, deposit rate floors are utilized to ensure modeled deposit rates will not become negative. NII simulation modeling assumes no lag between the timing of changes in market rates and the timing of deposit repricing despite such timing lags having occurred in prior rate cycles. In addition, modeled and forecasted deposit migration from low-beta deposit products to more rate-sensitive deposit products results in an additional beta of approximately 5% in the rising-rate scenarios, and a reduction in beta of approximately 5% in the falling-rate scenarios in the Bancorp&#8217;s baseline NII sensitivity profile. Future actual performance will be dependent on market conditions, the level of competition for deposits and the magnitude of continued interest rate increases. The Bancorp provides sensitivity analysis in Tables 54 and 55 for key assumptions related to its deposit modeling, including beta and demand deposit balance performance. 

The Bancorp continually evaluates the sensitivity of its interest rate risk measures to these important deposit modeling assumptions. The Bancorp also regularly monitors the sensitivity of other important modeling assumptions, such as loan and security prepayments and early withdrawals on fixed-rate customer liabilities. 

The following table shows the Bancorp&#8217;s estimated NII sensitivity profile and ALCO policy limits as of: 

TABLE 53: Estimated NII Sensitivity Profile and ALCO Policy Limits March 31, 2024 March 31, 2023 % Change in NII (FTE) ALCO Policy Limit % Change in NII (FTE) ALCO Policy Limit Change in Interest Rates (bps) 12 Months 13-24 Months 12 Months 13-24 Months 12 Months 13-24 Months 12 Months 13-24 Months +200 Ramp over 12 months (2.76) &#160;% (4.62) (5.00) (6.00) (3.11) (5.16) (4.00) (6.00) +100 Ramp over 12 months (1.36) (2.20) N/A N/A (1.46) (2.30) N/A N/A

Table 53 presents the change in estimated net interest income for 12 month and 13-24 month horizons for alternative interest rate scenarios relative to the net interest income projection for a static rate scenario for those same time horizons. As previously mentioned, these numbers do not represent a forecast, but are instead risk measures that are monitored to evaluate the consolidated interest rate risk position of the Bancorp. At March 31, 2024, the Bancorp&#8217;s NII sensitivity in the rising-rate scenarios is negative in years one and two as interest expense is expected to increase more than interest income due to deposit repricing and balance migration estimates given the high interest rate environment. The Bancorp&#8217;s NII simulation projects an increase in NII in year one and a decrease in NII in year two under the parallel 200 bps ramp decrease in interest rates. The NII increase in year one is driven by deposits repricing faster than earning assets. However, in year two, some deposits have reached their floors but assets continue to reprice down generating less NII. The changes in the estimated NII sensitivity profile compared to March 31, 2023 were primarily attributable to increased core deposit balances and fixed rate long-term debt funding largely offset by higher market interest rates driving higher expected betas combined with a shift in deposit mix to higher-beta products. 

Tables 54 and 55 provide the sensitivity of the Bancorp&#8217;s estimated NII profile at March 31, 2024 to changes to certain deposit balance and deposit repricing sensitivity (beta) assumptions. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)

(a) Applies a +/- 10% multiple on assumed betas. 

Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity 

The Bancorp also uses EVE as a measurement tool to govern and manage its interest rate risk exposure. The exposure is governed by a risk framework that uses policy limits for scenarios assuming an instantaneous 200 bps increase and a 200 bps decrease in interest rates. The Bancorp routinely analyzes exposures to other interest rate scenarios and employs policy limits and/or key risk indicators to monitor and manage exposures. Whereas the NII sensitivity analysis highlights the impact on forecasted NII on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) over one- and two-year time horizons, EVE is a point-in-time analysis of the economic sensitivity of current balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions that incorporates all cash flows over their estimated remaining lives. The EVE of the balance sheet is defined as the discounted present value of all asset and net derivative cash flows less the discounted value of all liability cash flows. Due to this longer horizon, the sensitivity of EVE to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of longer-term interest rate risk. EVE values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate any assumptions related to continued production or renewal activities used in the NII sensitivity analysis. As with the NII simulation model, assumptions about the timing and variability of existing balance sheet cash flows are critical in the EVE analysis. Particularly important are assumptions driving loan and security prepayments and the expected balance attrition and pricing of indeterminate-lived deposits. 

The following table shows the Bancorp&#8217;s estimated EVE sensitivity profile as of: 

TABLE 56: Estimated EVE Sensitivity Profile March 31, 2024 March 31, 2023 Change in Interest Rates (bps) % Change in EVE ALCO Policy Limit % Change in EVE ALCO Policy Limit +200 Shock (4.37) % (12.00) (5.08) (12.00) +100 Shock (1.80) N/A (2.11) N/A -100 Shock 0.94 &#160; N/A 1.02 N/A -200 Shock 0.14 &#160; (12.00) (0.84) (12.00) 

The EVE sensitivity is negative in a +200 bps rising-rate scenario and positive in a -200 bps falling-rate scenario at March 31, 2024. The changes in the estimated EVE sensitivity profile from March 31, 2023 were primarily related to higher modeled dynamic betas in both rising and falling rate scenarios, which was largely offset by the shortening of the investment portfolio duration and the reduction of received fixed-rate swaps. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

While an instantaneous shift in spot interest rates is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure, the Bancorp believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (e.g., the current fiscal year). Further, EVE does not account for factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships and changing product spreads that could mitigate or exacerbate the impact of changes in interest rates. The NII simulations and EVE analyses do not necessarily include certain actions that management may undertake to manage risk in response to actual changes in interest rates. 

The Bancorp regularly evaluates its exposures to a static balance sheet forecast, basis risks relative to the Prime Rate and various SOFR terms, yield curve twist risks and embedded options risks. In addition, the impacts on NII on an FTE basis and EVE of extreme changes in interest rates are modeled, wherein the Bancorp employs the use of yield curve shocks and environment-specific scenarios. 

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate Risk 

An integral component of the Bancorp&#8217;s interest rate risk management strategy is its use of derivative instruments to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in market interest rates. Examples of derivative instruments that the Bancorp may use as part of its interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps, interest rate floors, interest rate caps, forward contracts, forward starting interest rate swaps, options, swaptions and TBA securities. 

Tables 57 and 58 show all swap and floor positions that are utilized for purposes of managing the Bancorp&#8217;s exposures to the variability of interest rates. These positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed-upon amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index, to hedge the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognized asset attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate or to hedge forecasted transactions for the variability in cash flows attributable to the contractually specified interest rate. The volume, maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as the Bancorp adjusts its broader interest rate risk management objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. For further information, refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Additionally, as part of its overall risk management strategy relative to its residential mortgage banking activities, the Bancorp enters into forward contracts accounted for as free-standing derivatives to economically hedge IRLCs that are also considered free-standing derivatives. The Bancorp economically hedges its exposure to residential mortgage loans held for sale through the use of forward contracts and mortgage options as well. Refer to the Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights and Price Risk section for the discussion of the use of derivatives to economically hedge this exposure. 

The Bancorp also enters into derivative contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge market risks assumed in interest rate derivative contracts with commercial customers. Generally, these contracts have similar terms in order to protect the Bancorp from market volatility. Credit risk arises from the possible inability of the counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts, which the Bancorp minimizes through collateral arrangements, approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. The Bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not being taken in providing this service to customers. These controls include an independent determination of interest rate volatility and potential future exposure on these contracts and counterparty credit approvals performed by independent risk management. For further information, including the notional amount and fair values of these derivatives, refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights and Price Risk 

The fair value of the residential MSR portfolio was $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The value of servicing rights can fluctuate sharply depending on changes in interest rates and other factors. Generally, as interest rates decline and loans are prepaid to take advantage of refinancing, the total value of existing servicing rights declines because no further servicing fees are collected on repaid loans. For further information on the significant drivers and components of the valuation adjustments on MSRs, refer to the Noninterest Income subsection of the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&#38;A. The Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy relative to its mortgage banking activity in order to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the value of its MSR portfolio as a result of changing interest rates. The Bancorp may adjust its hedging strategy to reflect its assessment of the composition of its MSR portfolio, the cost of hedging and the anticipated effectiveness of the hedges given the economic environment. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on servicing rights and the instruments used to hedge price risk on MSRs. 

Foreign Currency Risk 

The Bancorp may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to economically hedge certain foreign denominated loans. The derivatives are classified as free-standing instruments with the revaluation gain or loss being recorded in other noninterest income in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The balance of the Bancorp&#8217;s foreign denominated loans at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $923 million and $1.0 billion, respectively. The Bancorp also enters into foreign exchange contracts for the benefit of commercial customers to hedge their exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Similar to the hedging of price risk from interest rate derivative contracts entered into with commercial customers, the Bancorp also enters into foreign exchange contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge a substantial portion of the exposure from client driven foreign exchange activity. The Bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not being taken in providing this service to customers. These controls include an independent determination of currency volatility and potential future exposure on these contracts, counterparty credit approvals and country limits performed by independent risk management. 

Commodity Risk 

The Bancorp also enters into commodity contracts for the benefit of commercial customers to hedge their exposure to commodity price fluctuations. Similar to the hedging of foreign exchange and price risk from interest rate derivative contracts, the Bancorp also enters into commodity contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge a substantial portion of the exposure from client driven commodity activity. The Bancorp may also offset this risk with exchange-traded commodity contracts. The Bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not taken in providing this service to customers. These controls include an independent determination of commodity volatility and potential future exposure on these contracts and counterparty credit approvals performed by independent risk management.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT 

The goal of liquidity management is to provide adequate funds to meet changes in loan and lease demand, unexpected levels of deposit withdrawals and other contractual obligations. Mitigating liquidity risk is accomplished by maintaining liquid assets in the form of cash and investment securities, maintaining sufficient unused borrowing capacity in the debt markets and delivering consistent growth in core deposits. A summary of certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts is included in Note 16 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s Treasury department manages funding and liquidity based on point-in-time metrics as well as forward-looking projections, which incorporate different sources and uses of funds under base and stress scenarios. Liquidity risk is monitored and managed by the Treasury department with independent oversight provided by ERM, and a series of Policy Limits and Key Risk Indicators are established to ensure risks are managed within the Bancorp&#8217;s risk tolerance. The Bancorp maintains a contingency funding plan that provides for liquidity stress testing, which assesses the liquidity needs under varying market conditions, time horizons, asset growth rates and other events. The contingency plan provides for ongoing monitoring of unused borrowing capacity and available sources of contingent liquidity to prepare for unexpected liquidity needs and to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity. The contingency plan also outlines the Bancorp&#8217;s response to various levels of liquidity stress and actions that should be taken during various scenarios. 

Liquidity risk is monitored and managed for both Fifth Third Bancorp and its subsidiaries. The Bancorp (parent company) receives substantially all of its liquidity from dividends from its subsidiaries, primarily Fifth Third Bank, National Association. Subsidiary dividends are supplemented with term debt to enable the Bancorp to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet its cash obligations, including debt service and scheduled maturities, common and preferred dividends, unfunded commitments to subsidiaries and other planned capital actions in the form of share repurchases. Liquidity resources are more limited at the Bancorp, making its liquidity position more susceptible to market disruptions. Bancorp liquidity is assessed using a cash coverage horizon, ensuring the entity maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a period of sustained market disruption while meeting its anticipated obligations over an extended stressed horizon. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s ALCO, which includes senior management representatives and is accountable to the ERMC, monitors and manages liquidity and funding risk within Board-approved policy limits. In addition to the risk management activities of ALCO, the Bancorp has a liquidity risk management function as part of ERM that provides independent oversight of liquidity risk management. 

Sources of Funds 

The Bancorp&#8217;s primary sources of funds include revenue from noninterest income as well as cash flows from loan and lease repayments, payments from securities related to sales and maturities, the sale or securitization of loans and leases and funds generated by core deposits, in addition to the use of public and private debt offerings. 

Of the $50.3 billion o f securities in the Bancorp&#8217;s available-for-sale debt and other securities and held-to-maturity securities portfolios at March 31, 2024, $5.5 billion in principal and interest is expected to be received in the next 12 months and an additional $8.4 billion is expected to be received in the next 13 to 24 months. For further information on the Bancorp&#8217;s securities portfolio, refer to the Investment Securities subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A. 

Asset-driven liquidity is provided by the Bancorp&#8217;s ability to pledge, sell or securitize loans and leases. In order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations and to manage liquidity, the Bancorp has developed securitization and sale procedures for several types of interest-sensitive assets. A majority of the long-term, fixed-rate single-family residential mortgage loans underwritten according to FHLMC or FNMA guidelines are sold for cash upon origination. Additional assets such as certain other residential mortgage loans, certain commercial loans and leases, home equity loans, automobile loans, solar energy installation loans and other consumer loans are also capable of being securitized or sold. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Bancorp sold or securitized loans and leases totaling $858 million and $1.3 billion, respectively. For further information, refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Core deposits have historically provided the Bancorp with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. The Bancorp&#8217;s average core deposits and average shareholders&#8217; equity funded 85% of its average total assets for both the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 . In addition to core deposit funding, the Bancorp also accesses a variety of other short-term and long-term funding sources, which include the use of the FHLB system. Management does not rely on any one source of liquidity and manages availability in response to changing balance sheet needs. 

In June of 2023, the Board of Directors authorized $10.0 billion of debt or other securities for issuance, of which $7.75 billion of debt or other securities were available for issuance as of March 31, 2024. The Bancorp is authorized to file any necessary registration statements with the SEC to permit ready access to the public securities markets; however, access to these markets may depend on market conditions. The Bancorp issued and sold fixed-rate/floating-rate senior notes of $1.0 billion in January of 2024 as further discussed in Note 15 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

As of March 31, 2024, the Bank&#8217;s global bank note program had a borrowing capacit y of $25.0 billion , of which $20.9 billion was available for issuance. Additionally, at March 31, 2024, the Bank had approximately $65.3 billion of borrowing capacity available through secured borrowing sources, including the FRB and the FHLB. 

Current Liquidity Position 

The Bancorp maintains a strong liquidity profile driven by strong core deposit funding and over $100 billion in current available liquidity. Refer to the Deposits subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A for more information regarding the Bancorp&#8217;s deposit portfolio characteristics. The Bancorp is managing liquidity prudently in the current environment and maintains a liquidity profile focused on core deposit and stable long-term funding sources, while supplementing with a variety of secured and unsecured wholesale funding sources across the maturity spectrum, which allows for the effective management of concentration and rollover risk. The Bancorp&#8217;s investment portfolio remains highly concentrated in liquid and readily marketable instruments and is a significant source of secured borrowing capacity. As part of its liquidity management activities, the Bancorp maintains collateral at its secured funding providers to ensure immediate availability of funding. Additionally, the Bancorp executes periodic test trades to assess the operational processes associated with its secured funding sources. 

As of March 31, 2024, the Bancorp (parent company) had sufficient liquidity to meet contractual obligations and all preferred and common dividends without accessing the capital markets or receiving upstream dividends from the Bank subsidiary f or 37 months. 

Credit Ratings 

The cost and availability of financing to the Bancorp and Bank are impacted by its credit ratings. A downgrade to the Bancorp&#8217;s or Bank&#8217;s credit ratings could affect its ability to access the credit markets and increase its borrowing costs, thereby adversely impacting the Bancorp&#8217;s or Bank&#8217;s financial condition and liquidity. Key factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong credit quality, strong capital ratios and diverse funding sources, in addition to disciplined liquidity monitoring procedures. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s and Bank&#8217;s credit ratings are summarized in Table 59. The ratings reflect the ratings agency&#8217;s view on the Bancorp&#8217;s and Bank&#8217;s capacity to meet financial commitments.* 

* As an investor, you should be aware that a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, that it may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Additional information on the credit rating ranking within the overall classification system is located on the website of each credit rating agency.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 

Management regularly reviews the Bancorp&#8217;s capital levels to help ensure it is appropriately positioned under various operating environments. The Bancorp has established a Capital Committee which is responsible for making capital plan recommendations to management. These recommendations are reviewed by the ERMC and the annual capital plan is approved by the Board of Directors. The Capital Committee is responsible for execution and oversight of the capital actions of the capital plan. 

Regulatory Capital Ratios 

The Basel III Final Rule sets minimum regulatory capital ratios as well as defines the measure of &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; for insured depository institutions. 

TABLE 60: Prescribed Capital Ratios Minimum Well-Capitalized CET1 capital: Fifth Third Bancorp 4.50 &#160;% N/A Fifth Third Bank, National Association

8.00 10.00 Leverage: Fifth Third Bancorp 4.00 N/A Fifth Third Bank, National Association 

4.00 5.00 

The Bancorp is subject to the stress capital buffer requirement and must maintain capital ratios above its buffered minimum (regulatory minimum plus stress capital buffer) in order to avoid certain limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses to executive officers. The FRB uses the supervisory stress test to determine the Bancorp&#8217;s stress capital buffer, subject to a floor of 2.5%. The Bancorp&#8217;s stress capital buffer requirement has been 2.5% since the introduction of this framework and was most recently affirmed as part of Fifth Third&#8217;s 2023 Capital Plan submission with an effective date of October 1, 2023. The Bancorp&#8217;s capital ratios have exceeded the stress capital buffer requirement for all periods presented. 

The Bancorp adopted ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020 and elected the five-year transition phase-in option for the impact of CECL on regulatory capital with its regulatory filings as of March 31, 2020. The Bancorp&#8217;s modified CECL transition amount began phasing out on January 1, 2022, and will be fully phased-out by January 1, 2025. The impact of the modified CECL transition amount on the Bancorp&#8217;s regulatory capital at March 31, 2024 was an increase in capital of approximatel y $124 million. On a fully phased-in basis, the Bancorp&#8217;s CET1 capital ratio would be reduced by 7 bps a s of March 31, 2024. 

On July 27, 2023, the U.S. banking agencies released a notice of proposed rulemaking to revise the Basel III Capital Rules, which would modify its existing risk-based capital framework for large banks and introduce a new framework that implements international capital standards. The proposed rulemaking would increase capital requirements applicable to banking organizations with total assets of $100 billion or more, including Fifth Third, and would align the calculation of regulatory capital and the calculation of risk-weighted assets across large banking organizations. As proposed, the rules would be effective for the Bancorp on July 1, 2025 and phased in over a three-year transition period. The Bancorp is in the process of evaluating this proposed rulemaking and assessing its potential impact. 

On August 29, 2023, the U.S. banking agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to require that certain banking organizations with $100 billion or more in consolidated assets, including Fifth Third, comply with certain long-term debt requirements at the holding company and insured depository institution levels. These proposed requirements are intended to absorb losses and recapitalize the insured depository institution in the event of the failure of a banking organization. As proposed, the rules would be phased in over a three-year period after their effective date. The Bancorp is in the process of evaluating this proposed rulemaking and assessing its potential impact, which is dependent on the finalization of the aforementioned proposed capital rule. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

The following table summarizes the Bancorp&#8217;s capital ratios as of:

(c) Regulatory capital ratios as of both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are calculated pursuant to the five-year transition provision option to phase in the effects of CECL on regulatory capital. 

Capital Planning 

In 2011, the FRB adopted the capital plan rule, which requires BHCs with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more to submit annual capital plans to the FRB for review. Under the rule, these capital plans must include detailed descriptions of the following: the BHC&#8217;s internal processes for assessing capital adequacy; the policies governing capital actions such as common stock issuances, dividends and share repurchases; and all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon. Furthermore, each BHC must report to the FRB the results of stress tests conducted by the BHC under a number of scenarios that assess the sources and uses of capital under baseline and stressed economic conditions. 

Under the Enhanced Prudential Standards tailoring rules, the Bancorp is subject to Category IV standards, under which the Bancorp is no longer required to file semi-annual, company-run stress tests with the FRB and publicly disclose the results. However, the Bancorp is required to develop and maintain a capital plan approved by the Board of Directors on an annual basis. As an institution subject to Category IV standards, the Bancorp is subject to the FRB&#8217;s supervisory stress tests every two years, the Board capital plan rule and certain FR Y-14 reporting requirements. The supervisory stress tests are forward-looking quantitative evaluations of the impact of stressful economic and financial market conditions on the Bancorp&#8217;s capital. The Bancorp became subject to Category IV standards on December 31, 2019, and the requirements outlined above apply to the stress test cycle that started on January 1, 2020. The Bancorp was subject to the 2024 supervisory stress test conducted by the FRB and submitted the Board-approved capital plan and information contained in Schedule C - Regulatory Capital Instruments as required by the April 5, 2024 deadline. 

The Bancorp maintains a comprehensive process for managing capital that considers the current and forward-looking macroeconomic and regulatory environments and makes capital distributions that are consistent with the requirements in the FRB&#8217;s capital plan rule, inclusive of the Bancorp&#8217;s stress capital buffer requirement. 

Dividend Policy and Stock Repurchase Program 

The Bancorp&#8217;s common stock dividend policy and stock repurchase program reflect its earnings outlook, desired payout ratios, the need to maintain adequate capital levels, the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends and the need to comply with safe and sound banking practices as well as meet regulatory requirements and expectations. The Bancorp declared dividends per common share of $0.35 and $0.33 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)
