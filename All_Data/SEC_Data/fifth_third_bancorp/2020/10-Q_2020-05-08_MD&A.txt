Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)

&#160;

OVERVIEW 

Fifth Third Bancorp is a diversified financial services company headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio. At March 31, 2020, the Bancorp had $185.4 billion in assets and operated 1,123 full-service banking centers and 2,464 Fifth Third branded ATMs in ten states throughout the Midwestern and Southeastern regions of the U.S. The Bancorp reports on four business segments: Commercial Banking, Branch Banking, Consumer Lending and Wealth and Asset Management. 

This overview of MD&#38;A highlights selected information in the financial results of the Bancorp and may not contain all of the information that is important to you. For a more complete understanding of trends, events, commitments, uncertainties, liquidity, capital resources and critical accounting policies and estimates, you should carefully read this entire document as well as the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2019. Each of these items could have an impact on the Bancorp&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, refer to the Glossary of Abbreviations and Acronyms in this report for a list of terms included as a tool for the reader of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.

The abbreviations and acronyms identified therein are used throughout this MD&#38;A, as well as the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Net interest income, net interest margin, net interest rate spread and the efficiency ratio are presented in MD&#38;A on an FTE basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored

status of income from certain loans and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable

amounts. The FTE basis for presenting net interest income is a non-GAAP

measure. For further information, refer to the Non-GAAP

Financial Measures section of MD&#38;A.

The Bancorp&#8217;s revenues are dependent on both net interest income and noninterest income. For the three months ended March 31, 2020, net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income provided 65% and 35% of total revenue, respectively. The Bancorp derives the majority of its revenues within the U.S. from customers domiciled in the U.S. Revenue from foreign countries and external customers domiciled in foreign countries was immaterial to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three months ended March 31, 2020. Changes in interest rates, credit quality, economic trends and the capital markets are primary factors that drive the performance of the Bancorp. As discussed later in the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A, risk identification, measurement, monitoring, control and reporting are important to the management of risk and to the financial performance and capital strength of the Bancorp. 

Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on assets such as loans, leases and securities, and interest expense incurred on liabilities such as deposits, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Net interest income is affected by the general level of interest rates, the relative level of short-term and long-term interest rates, changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Generally, the rates of interest the Bancorp earns on its assets and pays on its liabilities are established for a period of time. The change in market interest rates over time exposes the Bancorp to interest rate risk through potential adverse changes to net interest income and financial position. The Bancorp manages this risk by continually analyzing and adjusting the composition of its assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates, the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, the Bancorp enters into certain derivative transactions as part of its overall strategy to manage its interest rate and prepayment risks. The Bancorp is also exposed to the risk of loss on its loan and lease portfolio, as a result of changing expected cash flows caused by borrower credit events, such as loan defaults and inadequate collateral. 

Noninterest income is derived from service charges on deposits, wealth and asset management revenue, commercial banking revenue, mortgage banking net revenue, card and processing revenue, leasing business revenue, net securities gains or losses and other noninterest income. Noninterest expense includes compensation and benefits, technology and communication costs, net occupancy expense, leasing business expense, equipment expense, marketing expense, card and processing expense and other noninterest expense. 

COVID-19

Global Pandemic 

The U.S. economy retracted at the end of the first quarter of 2020 as the spread of COVID-19

became a global pandemic. With concerns increasing that COVID-19

may overwhelm the health care system, states across the U.S. declared lockdowns which restricted social gatherings and ordered temporary closures of businesses deemed non-essential.

As the cases of COVID-19

continued to rise, the disruption in the financial markets led the FRB to enact unprecedented policies to offset the forced liquidations and restore liquidity in the financial markets. The FRB cut rates to the zero lower bound, announced unlimited purchases of treasuries along with agency mortgage-backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities, and announced several facilities designed to support the smooth functioning of credit markets.

Government Response to the COVID-19

Pandemic 

Congress, the FRB and the other U.S. state and federal financial regulatory agencies have taken actions to mitigate disruptions to economic activity and financial stability resulting from the COVID-19

pandemic. The descriptions below summarize certain significant government actions taken in response to the COVID-19

pandemic. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provisions or government programs summarized.

The CARES Act 

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020. Among other provisions, the CARES Act includes funding for the SBA to expand lending, relief from certain U.S. GAAP requirements to allow COVID-19-related

loan modifications to not be categorized as troubled debt restructurings and a range of incentives to encourage deferment, forbearance or modification of consumer credit and mortgage contracts. One of the key CARES Act programs is the Paycheck Protection Program, which

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)

&#160;

temporarily expands the SBA&#8217;s business loan guarantee program through June 30, 2020. Paycheck Protection Program loans are available to a broader range of entities than ordinary SBA loans, require six-month

deferral of principal and interest repayment, and the loan may be forgiven in an amount equal to payroll costs and certain other expenses during an eight-week covered period.

The CARES Act contains additional protections for homeowners and renters of properties with federally-backed mortgages, including a 60-day

moratorium on the initiation of foreclosure proceedings beginning on March 18, 2020 and a 120-day

moratorium on initiating eviction proceedings effective March 27, 2020. Borrowers of federally-backed mortgages have the right under the CARES Act to request up to 360 days of forbearance on their mortgage payments if they experience financial hardship directly or indirectly due to the coronavirus-related public health emergency.

Also pursuant to the CARES Act, the U.S. Treasury has the authority to provide loans, guarantees and other investments in support of eligible businesses, states and municipalities affected by the economic effects of COVID-19.

Some of these funds have been used to support several FRB programs and facilities described below or additional programs or facilities that are established by its authority under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act and meeting certain criteria.

FRB Actions 

The FRB has taken a range of actions to support the flow of credit to households and businesses. For example, on March 15, 2020, the FRB reduced the target range for the federal funds rate to 0 to 0.25% and announced that it would increase its holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities and begin purchasing agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. The FRB has also encouraged depository institutions to borrow from the discount window and has lowered the primary credit rate for such borrowing by 150 basis points while extending the term of such loans up to 90 days. Reserve requirements have been reduced to zero as of March 26, 2020. 

In addition, the FRB has established, or has taken steps to establish, a range of facilities and programs to support the U.S. economy and U.S. marketplace participants in response to economic disruptions associated with COVID-19.

Through these facilities and programs, the FRB, relying on its authority under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, has taken steps to directly or indirectly purchase assets from, or make loans to, U.S. companies, financial institutions, municipalities and other market participants.

FRB facilities and programs established, or in the process of being established, include: 

&#160; &#8226; a Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility to provide financing related to Paycheck Protection Program loans made by banks; &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; a Main Street New Loan Facility, a Main Street Priority Loan Facility, and a Main Street Expanded Loan Facility to purchase loan participations, under specified conditions, from banks lending to small and medium U.S. businesses; &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; a Primary Dealer Credit Facility to provide liquidity to primary dealers through a secured lending facility; &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; a Commercial Paper Funding Facility to purchase the commercial paper of certain U.S. issuers; &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; a Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility to purchase corporate bonds directly from, or make loans directly, to eligible participants; &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; a Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility to purchase corporate bonds trading in secondary markets, including from exchange-traded funds, that were issued by eligible participants; &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; a Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to make loans secured by asset-backed securities; &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; a Municipal Liquidity Facility to purchase bonds directly from U.S. state, city and county issuers; and &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; a Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility to purchase certain assets from, or make loans to, financial institutions providing financing to eligible money market mutual funds. &#160;

&#160;

These facilities and programs are in various stages of development, and the Bancorp and the Bank may in the future participate in some of them, including as an agent or intermediary on behalf of clients or customers or in an advisory capacity. For commercial and consumer customers, Fifth Third has provided a host of relief options, including loan covenant relief, loan maturity extensions, payment deferrals and fee waivers. For further discussion on Fifth Third&#8217;s hardship relief programs, refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A. 

Paycheck Protection Program 

As discussed above, the Bancorp is participating in the SBA&#8217;s Paycheck Protection Program which was created by the CARES Act on March 27, 2020. The Bancorp has originated approximately 11,000 loans in the amount of $3.5 billion under the program as of April 30, 2020. The Bancorp has received preliminary approval from the SBA for approximately 20,000 additional loan applications in the amount of approximately $2.1 billion under the Paycheck Protection Program as of April 30, 2020. 

For more information related to Fifth Third&#8217;s hardship relief programs as a result of the COVID-19

pandemic, refer to Note 4 and Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Senior Notes Offering 

On January 31, 2020, the Bank issued and sold, under its bank notes program, $1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior fixed-rate notes. The bank notes consisted of $650 million of 1.80% senior fixed-rate notes, with a maturity of three years, due on January 30, 2023; and $600 million of 2.25% senior fixed-rate notes, with a maturity of seven years, due on February 1, 2027. For more information on the senior notes offering, including disclosure on the redemption options, refer to Note 17 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)

&#160;

LIBOR Transition 

In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the &#8220;FCA&#8221;), which regulates LIBOR, announced that FCA will stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. Since then, central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, have commissioned working groups of market participants and official sector representatives with the goal of finding suitable replacements for LIBOR. The Bancorp has substantial exposure to LIBOR-based products within its commercial lending, commercial deposits, business banking, consumer lending and capital markets lines of business as well as corporate treasury function. It is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative reference rates will occur over the course of the next few years. Although the full impact of such reforms and actions remains unclear, the Bancorp is preparing to transition from LIBOR to these alternative reference rates. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s transition plan includes a number of key work streams, including continued engagement with central bank and industry working groups and regulators, active client engagement, comprehensive review of legacy documentation, internal operational readiness, and risk management, among other things, to facilitate the transition to alternative reference rates. 

The transition away from LIBOR is expected to be gradual and complicated. There remain a number of unknown factors regarding the transition from LIBOR that could impact the Bancorp&#8217;s business, including, for example, the pace of the transition to replacement rates, including industry coalescence around an alternative reference rate such as SOFR, our ability to identify exposures to LIBOR across our business lines, the specific terms and parameters for any potential alternative reference rates, the prices of and the liquidity of trading markets for products based on the alternative reference rates, our ability to transition to and develop appropriate systems and analytics for one or more alternative reference rates, our ability to maintain contractual continuity and our ability to identify and remediate any operational issues. For a further discussion of the various risks the Bancorp faces in connection with the expected replacement of LIBOR on its operations, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Market Risks&#8212;The replacement of LIBOR could adversely affect Fifth Third&#8217;s revenue or expenses and the value of those assets or obligations.&#8221; in Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Earnings Summary 

The Bancorp&#8217;s net income available to common shareholders for the first quarter of 2020 was $29 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, which was net of $17 million in preferred stock dividends. The Bancorp&#8217;s net income available to common shareholders for the first quarter of 2019 was $760 million, or $1.12 per diluted share, which was net of $15 million in preferred stock dividends. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP)

was $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Net interest income was positively impacted by increases in average commercial and industrial loans, average commercial mortgage loans, average indirect secured consumer loans and average residential mortgage loans of $5.6 billion, $3.6 billion, $2.6 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019. Additionally, net interest income benefited from decreases in the rates paid on average interest-bearing core deposits and average long-term debt of 31 bps and 23 bps, respectively, compared to the same period in the prior year. These positive impacts were partially offset by decreases in yields on average loans and leases of 29 bps and average taxable securities of 17 bps for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019. Net interest income was also negatively impacted by an increase in average interest-bearing core deposits of $12.5 billion compared to the same period in the prior year. Additionally, net interest income was adversely impacted by the March 2020, October 2019, September 2019 and August 2019 decisions of the FOMC to lower the target range of the federal funds rate. Net interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 included $16 million and $1 million, respectively, of amortization and accretion of premiums and discounts on acquired loans and leases and assumed deposits and long-term debt from acquisitions. Net interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP)

was 3.28% for both the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019.

Effective January 1, 2020, the Bancorp adopted ASU 2016-13

which established a new approach for estimating credit losses on certain types of financial instruments. The Bancorp recognized an initial increase to the ACL of approximately $653 million upon adoption of ASU 2016-13

on January 1, 2020, which included $171 million from the non-PCD

loan portfolio resulting from the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition. The provision for credit losses was $640 million and $90 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in provision expense for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to an increase in the ACL reflecting deterioration in the macroeconomic environment as a result of the impact of the COVID-19

pandemic, continued pressure on energy prices and commercial loan growth due to increased utilization levels on existing commitments. The increase in the provision for credit losses also reflected the impact of the change in methodology for estimating credit losses from the incurred loss methodology used in the first quarter of 2019 to the expected credit loss methodology used in the first quarter of 2020. Net losses charged-off 

as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases were 0.44% and 0.32% for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. At March 31, 2020, nonperforming portfolio assets as a percent of portfolio loans and leases and OREO decreased to 0.60% compared to 0.62% at December 31, 2019. For further discussion on credit quality refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A as well as Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Noninterest income decreased $430 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 primarily due to a decrease in other noninterest income partially offset by an increase in mortgage banking net revenue. Other noninterest income decreased $562 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 primarily due to the gain on sale of Worldpay, Inc. shares recognized during the first quarter of 2019 as well as a decrease in private equity investment income. These negative impacts were partially offset by decreases in the net losses on disposition and impairment of bank premises and equipment and the loss on the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares. Mortgage banking net revenue increased $64 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 primarily due to increases in origination fees and gains on loan sales. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)

&#160;

Noninterest expense increased $103 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits expense, other noninterest expense, leasing business expense and technology and communications expense. The Bancorp recognized $7 million of merger-related expenses related to the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to $76 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. Compensation and benefits expense increased $37 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 primarily driven by the addition of personnel costs from the acquisition of MB Financial, Inc., partially offset by a decrease in deferred compensation expense. Compensation and benefits expense for the three months ended March 31, 2020 included $3 million of special payments to employees providing essential banking services through the COVID-19

pandemic. Other noninterest expense increased $36 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 primarily due to increases in losses and adjustments and intangible amortization expense, partially offset by a decrease in professional service fees. Leasing business expense increased $16 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 primarily due to an increase in operating lease expense driven by the acquisition of MB Financial, Inc. Technology and communications expense increased $10 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 primarily driven by increased investment in contemporizing information technology architecture, mitigating information security risks and growth initiatives.

Capital Summary 

The Bancorp calculated its regulatory capital ratios under the Basel III standardized approach to risk-weighting of assets and pursuant to the five-year transition provision option to phase in the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The Bancorp&#8217;s capital ratios exceed the &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; guidelines as defined by the U.S. banking agencies with the CET1 capital ratio of 9.37%, Tier I risk-based capital ratio of 10.56%, Total risk-based capital ratio of 13.59% and Tier I leverage ratio of 9.37% as of March 31, 2020.

NON-GAAP

FINANCIAL MEASURES 

The following are non-GAAP

measures which provide useful insight to the reader of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements but should be supplemental to primary U.S. GAAP measures and should not be read in isolation or relied upon as a substitute for the primary U.S. GAAP measures.

The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored

status of income from certain loans and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable

amounts.

The following table reconciles the non-GAAP

financial measures of net interest income on an FTE basis, interest income on an FTE basis, net interest margin, net interest rate spread and the efficiency ratio to U.S. GAAP:

The Bancorp believes return on average tangible common equity is an important measure for comparative purposes with other financial institutions, but is not defined under U.S. GAAP, and therefore is considered a non-GAAP

financial measure. This measure is useful for evaluating the performance of a business as it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization.

financial measure of return on average tangible common equity to U.S. GAAP for the three months ended:

The Bancorp considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including the tangible equity ratio and tangible common equity ratio, in addition to capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies. These calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies for both absolute and comparative purposes. Because U.S. GAAP does not include capital ratio measures, the Bancorp believes there are no comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures to these ratios. These ratios are not formally defined by U.S. GAAP or codified in the federal banking regulations and, therefore, are considered to be non-GAAP

financial measures. The Bancorp encourages readers to consider its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 

Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements provides a discussion of the significant new accounting standards applicable to the Bancorp and the expected impact of significant accounting standards issued, but not yet required to be adopted. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The Bancorp&#8217;s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain accounting policies require management to exercise judgment in determining methodologies, economic assumptions and estimates that may materially affect the Bancorp&#8217;s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Bancorp&#8217;s critical accounting policies include the accounting for the ALLL, reserve for unfunded commitments, valuation of servicing rights, fair value measurements, goodwill and legal contingencies. These accounting policies are discussed in detail in the Critical Accounting Policies section of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2019. On January 1, 2020, the Bancorp adopted on a prospective basis ASU 2016 -

13 (&#8220;Financial Instruments&#8212;Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments&#8221;) and its related subsequent amendments, along with ASU 2017 -

04 (&#8220;Intangibles&#8212;Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment&#8221;). For additional information about these ASUs and their impacts on the Bancorp, refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. In conjunction with the adoption of these ASUs, the Bancorp has revised its Critical Accounting Policies for the ALLL, reserve for unfunded commitments and goodwill as described below. Refer to the Critical Accounting Policies section of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2019 for discussion on the critical accounting policies for the ALLL, reserve for unfunded commitments and goodwill for periods prior to January 1, 2020. There have been no other material changes to the valuation techniques or models during the three months ended March 31, 2020.

ALLL 

The Bancorp disaggregates its portfolio loans and leases into portfolio segments for purposes of determining the ALLL. The Bancorp&#8217;s portfolio segments include commercial, residential mortgage and consumer. The Bancorp further disaggregates its portfolio segments into classes for purposes of monitoring and assessing credit quality based on certain risk characteristics. For an analysis of the Bancorp&#8217;s ALLL by portfolio segment and credit quality information by class, refer to Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Bancorp maintains the ALLL to absorb the amount of credit losses that are expected to be incurred over the remaining contractual terms of the related loans and leases. Contractual terms are adjusted for expected prepayments but are not adjusted for expected extensions, renewals or modifications except in circumstances where the Bancorp reasonably expects to execute a TDR with the borrower or where certain extension or renewal options are embedded in the original contract and not unconditionally cancellable by the Bancorp. Accrued interest receivables on loans and leases are presented in other assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. When accrued interest is deemed to be uncollectible (typically when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status), interest income is reversed. The Bancorp follows established policies for placing loans on nonaccrual status, so uncollectible accrued interest receivable is reversed in a timely manner. As a result, the Bancorp has elected not to measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivables. For additional information on the Bancorp&#8217;s accounting policies related to nonaccrual loans and leases, refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)

&#160;

Credit losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the ALLL. The ALLL is maintained at a level the Bancorp considers to be adequate and is based on ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations of the collectability of loans and leases, including historical credit loss experience, current and forecasted market and economic conditions and consideration of various qualitative factors that, in management&#8217;s judgment, deserve consideration in estimating expected credit losses. Provisions for credit losses are recorded for the amounts necessary to adjust the ALLL to the Bancorp&#8217;s current estimate of expected credit losses on portfolio loans and leases. The Bancorp&#8217;s strategy for credit risk management includes a combination of conservative exposure limits significantly below legal lending limits and conservative underwriting, documentation and collections standards. The strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level, regular credit examinations and quarterly management reviews of large credit exposures and loans experiencing deterioration of credit quality. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s methodology for determining the ALLL requires significant management judgment and includes an estimate of expected credit losses on a collective basis for groups of loans and leases with similar risk characteristics and specific allowances for loans and leases which are individually evaluated. 

Larger commercial loans and leases included within aggregate borrower relationship balances exceeding $1 million that exhibit observed credit weaknesses, as well as loans that have been modified in a TDR, are individually evaluated for an ALLL. The Bancorp considers the current value of collateral, credit quality of any guarantees, the guarantor&#8217;s liquidity and willingness to cooperate, the loan or lease structure and other factors when determining the amount of the ALLL. Other factors may include the borrower&#8217;s susceptibility to risks presented by the forecasted macroeconomic environment, the industry and geographic region of the borrower, size and financial condition of the borrower, cash flow and leverage of the borrower and the Bancorp&#8217;s evaluation of the borrower&#8217;s management. Significant management judgment is required when evaluating which of these factors are most relevant in individual circumstances, and when estimating the amount of expected credit losses based on those factors. When loans and leases are individually evaluated, allowances are determined based on management&#8217;s estimate of the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay the loan or lease given the availability of collateral and other sources of cash flow, as well as an evaluation of legal options available to the Bancorp. Allowances for individually evaluated loans and leases that are collateral dependent are typically measured based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, less expected costs to sell. Individually evaluated loans and leases that are not collateral dependent are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan&#8217;s effective interest rate. The Bancorp evaluates the collectability of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual. Specific allowances on individually evaluated commercial loans and leases, including TDRs, are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower and/or collateral conditions and actual collection and charge-off

experience.

Expected credit losses are estimated on a collective basis for loans and leases that are not individually evaluated. These include commercial loans and leases that do not meet the criteria for individual evaluation as well as homogeneous loans in the residential mortgage and consumer portfolio segments. For collectively evaluated loans and leases, the Bancorp uses models to forecast expected credit losses based on the probability of a loan or lease defaulting, the expected balance at the estimated date of default and the expected loss percentage given a default. The estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers prepayments and, for loans with available credit, expected utilization rates. The Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models were developed based on historical credit loss experience and observations of migration patterns for various credit risk characteristics (such as internal credit risk grades, external credit ratings or scores, delinquency status, loan-to-value

trends, etc.) over time, with those observations evaluated in the context of concurrent macroeconomic conditions. The Bancorp developed its models from historical observations capturing a full economic cycle when possible.

The Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models consider historical credit loss experience, current market and economic conditions, and forecasted changes in market and economic conditions if such forecasts are considered reasonable and supportable. Generally, the Bancorp considers its forecasts to be reasonable and supportable for a period of up to three years from the estimation date. For periods beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period, expected credit losses are estimated by reverting to historical loss information without adjustment for changes in economic conditions. This reversion is phased in rateably over a two-year

period. The Bancorp evaluates the length of its reasonable and supportable forecast period, its reversion period and reversion methodology at least annually, or more often if warranted by economic conditions or other circumstances.

The Bancorp also considers qualitative factors in determining the ALLL. These considerations inherently require significant management judgment to determine the appropriate factors to be considered and the extent of their impact on the ALLL estimate. Qualitative factors are used to capture characteristics in the portfolio that impact expected credit losses but that are not fully captured within the Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models. These include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, lending and risk management personnel and results of internal audit and quality control reviews. These may also include adjustments, when deemed necessary, for specific idiosyncratic risks such as geopolitical events, natural disasters and their effects on regional borrowers and changes in product structures. Qualitative factors may also be used to address the impacts of unforeseen events on key inputs and assumptions within the Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models, such as the reasonable and supportable forecast period, changes to historical loss information or changes to the reversion period or methodology. When evaluating the adequacy of allowances, consideration is also given to regional geographic concentrations and the closely associated effect that changing economic conditions may have on the Bancorp&#8217;s customers. 

Overall, the collective evaluation process requires significant management judgment when determining the estimation methodology and inputs into the models, as well as in evaluating the reasonableness of the modeled results and the appropriateness of qualitative adjustments. The Bancorp&#8217;s forecasts of market and economic conditions and the internal risk grades assigned to loans and leases in the commercial portfolio segment are examples of inputs to the expected credit loss models that require significant management judgment. These inputs have the potential to drive significant variability in the resulting ALLL.

Refer to the Allowance for Credit Losses subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A for a discussion on the Bancorp&#8217;s ALLL sensitivity analysis. 

Reserve for Unfunded Commitments 

The reserve for unfunded commitments is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated expected credit losses related to unfunded credit facilities and is included in other liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The determination of the adequacy of the reserve is based upon expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life of the commitments, taking into consideration the current funded balance and estimated exposure over the reasonable and supportable forecast period. This process takes into consideration the same risk elements that are analyzed in the determination of the adequacy of the Bancorp&#8217;s ALLL, as previously discussed. Net adjustments to the reserve for unfunded commitments are included in provision for credit losses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Goodwill 

Business combinations entered into by the Bancorp typically include the recognition of goodwill. U.S. GAAP requires goodwill to be tested for impairment at the Bancorp&#8217;s reporting unit level on an annual basis, which for the Bancorp is September 30, and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. 

Impairment exists when a reporting unit&#8217;s carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. In testing goodwill for impairment, U.S. GAAP permits the Bancorp to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. In this qualitative assessment, the Bancorp evaluates events and circumstances which may include, but are not limited to, the general economic environment, banking industry and market conditions, the overall financial performance of the Bancorp, the performance of the Bancorp&#8217;s common stock, the key financial performance metrics of the Bancorp&#8217;s reporting units and events affecting the reporting units to determine if it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the quantitative impairment test is required or the decision to bypass the qualitative assessment is elected, the Bancorp performs the goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. A recognized impairment loss cannot be reversed in future periods even if the fair value of the reporting unit subsequently recovers. 

The fair value of a reporting unit is the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As none of the Bancorp&#8217;s reporting units are publicly traded, individual reporting unit fair value determinations cannot be directly correlated to the Bancorp&#8217;s stock price. The determination of the fair value of a reporting unit is a subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments, particularly related to cash flows, the appropriate discount rates and an applicable control premium. The Bancorp employs an income-based approach, utilizing the reporting unit&#8217;s forecasted cash flows (including a terminal value approach to estimate cash flows beyond the final year of the forecast) and the reporting unit&#8217;s estimated cost of equity as the discount rate. Significant management judgment is necessary in the preparation of each reporting unit&#8217;s forecasted cash flows surrounding expectations for earnings projections, growth and credit loss expectations and actual results may differ from forecasted results. Additionally, the Bancorp determines its market capitalization based on the average of the closing price of the Bancorp&#8217;s stock during the month including the measurement date, incorporating an additional control premium, and compares this market-based fair value measurement to the aggregate fair value of the Bancorp&#8217;s reporting units in order to corroborate the results of the income approach. During the first quarter of 2020, in consideration of the deterioration in macroeconomic conditions and industry and market conditions due to the COVID-19

pandemic, the Bancorp performed a qualitative assessment of its goodwill. Based upon this assessment, the Bancorp concluded it was not more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units were less than their carrying amounts. While there was no indication of impairment as of March 31, 2020, further deterioration in economic conditions could significantly impact the impairment analysis and may result in future goodwill impairment charges that, if incurred, could have a material adverse effect on the Bancorp&#8217;s results of operations in the period such charges are recognized. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Bancorp&#8217;s goodwill.

STATEMENTS OF INCOME ANALYSIS 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is the interest earned on loans and leases (including yield-related fees), securities and other short-term investments less the interest paid for core deposits (includes transaction deposits and other time deposits) and wholesale funding (includes certificates $100,000 and over, other deposits, federal funds purchased, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt). The net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets. Net interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is typically greater than net interest rate spread due to the interest income earned on those assets that are funded by noninterest-bearing liabilities, or free funding, such as demand deposits or shareholders&#8217; equity. 

Table 5 presents the components of net interest income, net interest margin and net interest rate spread for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, as well as the relative impact of changes in the average balance sheet and changes in interest rates on net interest income. Nonaccrual loans and leases and loans and leases held for sale have been included in the average loan and lease balances. Average outstanding securities balances are based on amortized cost with any unrealized gains or losses included in average other assets. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP)

was $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Net interest income was positively impacted by increases in average commercial and industrial loans, average commercial mortgage loans, average indirect secured consumer loans and average residential mortgage loans of $5.6 billion, $3.6 billion, $2.6 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019. Additionally, net interest income benefited from decreases in the rates paid on average interest-bearing core deposits and average long-term debt of 31 bps and 23 bps, respectively, compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income for the first quarter of 2020 was also positively impacted by LIBOR/Federal Funds spread widening, as the Federal Funds rate has fallen faster than LIBOR. These positive impacts were partially offset by decreases in yields on average loans and leases of 29 bps and average taxable securities of 17 bps for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019. Net interest income was also negatively impacted by an increase in average interest-bearing core deposits of $12.5 billion compared to the same period in the prior year. Additionally, net interest income was adversely impacted by the March 2020, October 2019, September 2019 and August 2019 decisions of the FOMC to lower the target range of the federal funds rate. Net interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 included $16 million and $1 million, respectively, of amortization and accretion of premiums and discounts on acquired loans and leases and assumed deposits and long-term debt from acquisitions. The LIBOR/Federal Funds spread widening typically benefits the Bancorp as it generally results in loan yields decreasing more slowly than deposit costs. The Bancorp expects this spread to normalize during 2020 and net interest income will be impacted by the speed and magnitude of the spread compression. To the extent that 1-Month

LIBOR average converges towards the Federal Funds rate, net interest income could be negatively impacted by approximately $1 million per quarter for each basis point of LIBOR/Federal Funds spread contraction. However, the impact of lower LIBOR rates on net interest income should be partially offset by additional deposit rate reductions and a higher contribution from the derivative portfolio.

Net interest rate spread on an FTE basis (non-GAAP)

was 2.98% during the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to 2.87% in the same period in the prior year. Rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities decreased 37 bps, partially offset by a 26 bps decrease in the yields on average interest-earning assets for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019.

Net interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP)

was 3.28% for both the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019. Net interest margin was positively impacted by the previously mentioned increase in the net interest rate spread as well as an increase in average free funding balances. The increase in average free funding balances was driven by increases in average demand deposits and average shareholders&#8217; equity of $5.2 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019. These positive impacts were offset by an increase in average interest-earning assets of $16.8 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest margin results are expected to be negatively impacted in the second quarter of 2020 as a result of increased liquidity levels in the form of excess cash balances which increased in size near the end of the first quarter of 2020 and continued to increase in the month of April, the impact of the $3.5 billion in loans originated in April of 2020 through the Paycheck Protection Program, as well as the aforementioned LIBOR/Federal Funds spread dynamics.

Interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP)

from loans and leases increased $92 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 driven by the previously mentioned increases in average commercial and industrial loans, average commercial mortgage loans, average indirect secured consumer loans and average residential mortgage loans, partially offset by the previously mentioned decrease in yields on average loans and leases. For more information on the Bancorp&#8217;s loan and lease portfolio, refer to the Loans and Leases subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A. Interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) 

from investment securities and other short-term investments remained flat during the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 as increases in average investment securities and average other short-term investments were offset by decreases in the yields on average investment securities and average other short-term investments.

Interest expense on core deposits decreased $35 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 primarily due to a decrease in the cost of average interest-bearing core deposits to 68 bps for the three months ended March 31, 2020 from 99 bps for the three months ended March 31, 2019. The decrease in the cost of average interest-bearing core deposits from March 31, 2019 was primarily due to decreases in the cost of average interest checking deposits and average money market deposits of 43 bps and 31 bps, respectively. Refer to the Deposits subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A for additional information on the Bancorp&#8217;s deposits. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)

&#160;

Interest expense on average wholesale funding decreased $20 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 primarily due to decreases in the balance of and rates paid on average federal funds purchased as well as a decrease in the rates paid on average long-term debt. Refer to the Borrowings subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A for additional information on the Bancorp&#8217;s borrowings. During the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, average wholesale funding represented 20% and 23%, respectively, of average interest-bearing liabilities. For more information on the Bancorp&#8217;s interest rate risk management, including estimated earnings sensitivity to changes in market interest rates, see the Interest Rate and Price Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)

&#160;

Provision for Credit Losses 

The Bancorp provides as an expense an amount for expected credit losses within the loan and lease portfolio and the portfolio of unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit that is based on factors discussed in the Critical Accounting Policies section of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

The provision is recorded to bring the ALLL and reserve for unfunded commitments to a level deemed appropriate by the Bancorp to cover losses expected in the portfolios. Actual credit losses on loans and leases are charged against the ALLL. The amount of loans and leases actually removed from the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are referred to as charge-offs. Net charge-offs include current period charge-offs less recoveries on previously charged-off

loans and leases.

The provision for credit losses was $640 million and $90 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in provision expense for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to an increase in the ACL reflecting deterioration in the macroeconomic environment as a result of the impact of the COVID-19

pandemic, continued pressure on energy prices and commercial loan growth due to increased utilization levels on existing commitments. The increase in the provision for credit losses also reflected the impact of the change in methodology for estimating credit losses from the incurred loss methodology used in the first quarter of 2019 to the expected credit loss methodology used in the first quarter of 2020.

The ALLL increased $1.1 billion from December 31, 2019 to $2.3 billion at March 31, 2020. At March 31, 2020, the ALLL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases increased to 1.99%, compared to 1.10% at December 31, 2019. The reserve for unfunded commitments increased $25 million from December 31, 2019 to $169 million at March 31, 2020. The ACL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases increased to 2.13% at March 31, 2020, compared to 1.23% at December 31, 2019. These increases reflect the adoption of ASU 2016-13,

which resulted in a combined increase to the ALLL and reserve for unfunded commitments of approximately $653 million, as well as the previously mentioned items impacting the provision for credit losses.

Refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A as well as Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on the provision for credit losses, including an analysis of loan and lease portfolio composition, nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and other factors considered by the Bancorp in assessing the credit quality of the loan and lease portfolio, ALLL and reserve for unfunded commitments. 

Noninterest Income 

Noninterest income decreased $430 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019. 

The following table presents the components of noninterest income:

During the first quarter of 2020, certain noninterest income line items were reclassified to better align disclosures to business activities. These reclassifications were retrospectively applied to all prior periods presented. Total noninterest income did not change as a result of these reclassifications.

&#160;

Service charges on deposits 

Service charges on deposits increased $17 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 due to an increase of $18 million in commercial deposit fees partially offset by a decrease of $1 million in consumer deposit fees. 

Wealth and asset management revenue 

Wealth and asset management revenue increased $22 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019. The increase from the prior year was primarily driven by increases in private client service fees, broker income and institutional fees of $10 million, $6 million, and $5 million, respectively. The Bancorp&#8217;s trust and registered investment advisory businesses had approximately $374 billion and $394 billion in total assets under care as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and managed $42 billion and $44 billion in assets for individuals, corporations and not-for-profit

organizations as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Bancorp expects wealth and asset management revenue to be adversely affected by the recent equity market dynamics.

Commercial banking revenue 

Commercial banking revenue increased $21 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019. The increase from the prior year was primarily driven by increases in institutional sales, contract revenue from commercial customer derivatives and bridge fees of $8 million, $7 million and $5 million, respectively.

Mortgage banking net revenue 

Mortgage banking net revenue increased $64 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019. The Bancorp expects mortgage banking net revenue in the second quarter of 2020 to be adversely impacted by COVID-19.

Origination fees and gains on loan sales increased $56 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 primarily driven by an increase in originations due to the lower interest rate environment. Residential mortgage loan originations increased to $4.0 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 from $1.6 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2019. 

Net mortgage servicing revenue increased $8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 due to an increase in gross mortgage servicing fees of $12 million, partially offset by an increase in net negative valuation adjustments of $4 million.

Mortgage rates decreased during both the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 which caused modeled prepayment speeds to rise. The fair value of the MSR portfolio decreased $331 million and $57 million, respectively, due to changes to inputs to the valuation model including prepayment speeds and OAS assumptions and decreased $47 million and $27 million, respectively, due to the impact of contractual principal payments and actual prepayment activity during the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019. 

Further detail on the valuation of MSRs can be found in Note 14 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying

hedging strategy to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the valuation of the MSR portfolio. Refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the free-standing derivatives used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio.

In addition to the derivative positions used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio, the Bancorp acquires various securities as a component of its non-qualifying

hedging strategy. The Bancorp recognized net gains of $3 million during both the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 recorded in securities gains, net - non-qualifying

hedges on MSRs in the Bancorp&#8217;s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.

The Bancorp&#8217;s total residential mortgage loans serviced as of March 31, 2020 and 2019 were $99.8 billion and $101.3 billion, respectively, with $81.9 billion and $83.9 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage loans serviced for others. 

Card and processing revenue 

Card and processing revenue increased $7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 primarily driven by the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition as well as increases in other interchange revenue, the number of actively used cards and customer spend volume. 

Leasing business revenue 

Leasing business revenue increased $41 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019. The increase from the prior year was primarily driven by increases in operating lease income, lease syndication fees and leasing business solutions revenue of $18 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively. The increases in operating lease income and leasing business solutions revenue were driven by the acquisition of MB Financial, Inc.

Other noninterest income decreased $562 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 primarily due to the gain on sale of Worldpay, Inc. shares recognized during the first quarter of 2019 as well as a decrease in private equity investment income. These negative impacts were partially offset by decreases in the net losses on disposition and impairment of bank premises and equipment and the loss on the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares. 

The Bancorp recognized a $562 million gain related to the sale of Worldpay, Inc. shares during the three months ended March 31, 2019. Private equity investment income decreased $18 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by valuation adjustments and impairment charges recognized on certain private equity investments during the three months ended March 31, 2020. For additional information on the valuation of private equity investments, refer to Note 23 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Net losses on disposition and impairment of bank premises and equipment decreased $17 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019. The decrease was driven by the impact of impairment charges of $3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to $20 million during the three months ended March 31, 2019. For additional information, refer to Note 8 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bancorp recognized negative valuation adjustments of $22 million related to the Visa total return swap during the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to negative valuation adjustments of $31 million during the three months ended March 31, 2019. For additional information on the valuation of the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares, refer to Note 23 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Noninterest Expense 

Noninterest expense increased $103 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits expense, other noninterest expense, leasing business expense and technology and communications expense.

Compensation and benefits expense increased $37 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 primarily driven by the addition of personnel costs from the acquisition of MB Financial, Inc., partially offset by a decrease in deferred compensation expense. Compensation and benefits expense for the three months ended March 31, 2020 included $3 million of special payments to employees providing essential banking services through the COVID-19

pandemic. Full-time equivalent employees totaled 20,182 at March 31, 2020 compared to 20,115 at March 31, 2019.

Technology and communications expense increased $10 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 primarily driven by increased investment in contemporizing information technology architecture, mitigating information security risks and growth initiatives. 

Leasing business expense increased $16 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 primarily due to an increase in operating lease expense driven by the acquisition of MB Financial, Inc.

Other noninterest expense increased $36 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 primarily due to increases in losses and adjustments and intangible amortization expense, partially offset by a decrease in professional service fees. 

Losses and adjustments increased $32 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 primarily due to an increase in credit valuation adjustments on derivatives associated with customer accommodation contracts. Intangible amortization expense increased $10 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 primarily driven by the amortization of intangible assets identified in the acquisition of MB Financial, Inc. Professional service fees decreased $9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 primarily due to a decrease in consulting fees.

Applicable income tax expense for all periods includes the benefit from tax-exempt

income, tax-advantaged

investments and tax credits (and other related tax benefits), partially offset by the effect of proportional amortization of qualifying LIHTC investments and certain nondeductible expenses. The tax credits are primarily associated with the Low-Income

Housing Tax Credit program established under Section 42 of the IRC, the New Markets Tax Credit program established under Section 45D of the IRC, the Rehabilitation Investment Tax Credit program established under Section 47 of the IRC and the Qualified Zone Academy Bond program established under Section 1397E of the IRC.

The increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily related to an increase in state income tax expense, partially offset by certain other items. 

For stock-based awards, U.S. GAAP requires that the tax consequences for the difference between the expense recognized for financial reporting and the Bancorp&#8217;s actual tax deduction for the stock-based awards be recognized through income tax expense in the interim periods in which they occur. The Bancorp cannot predict its stock price or whether and when its employees will exercise stock-based awards in the future. Based on its stock price at March 31, 2020, the Bancorp estimates that it may be necessary to recognize $14 million of additional income tax expense over the next twelve months related to the settlement of stock-based awards primarily in the second quarter of 2020. However, the amount of income tax expense or benefit recognized upon settlement may vary significantly from expectations based on the Bancorp&#8217;s stock price and the number of SARs exercised by employees.

Total loans and leases, including loans and leases held for sale, increased $8.7 billion, or 8%, from December 31, 2019. The increase from December 31, 2019 was the result of an $8.0 billion, or 11%, increase in commercial loans and leases as well as a $743 million, or 2%, increase in consumer loans. 

Commercial loans and leases increased $8.0 billion from December 31, 2019 due to increases in commercial and industrial loans, commercial construction loans and commercial mortgage loans, partially offset by a decrease in commercial leases. Commercial and industrial loans increased $7.6 billion, or 15%, from December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of an increase in revolving line of credit utilization, as well as a decrease in payoffs during the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase in revolving line of credit utilization was primarily experienced during the last month of the quarter. Since quarter-end,

revolving line of credit utilization rates have generally stabilized, as certain commercial borrowers, particularly middle market clients, have begun paying down revolving lines of credit reflecting the stabilizing market conditions and the ability to access other funding sources. Commercial construction loans increased $372 million, or 7% from December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of increased line of credit utilization as well as seasonally low payoffs. Commercial mortgage loans increased $197 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of increases in loan originations and permanent financing from the Bancorp&#8217;s commercial construction loan portfolio. Commercial leases decreased $240 million, or 7% from December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of a planned reduction in indirect non-relationship

based lease originations.

Consumer loans increased $743 million from December 31, 2019 due to increases in indirect secured consumer loans, residential mortgage loans and other consumer loans, partially offset by decreases in home equity and credit card. Indirect secured consumer loans increased $512 million, or 4%, from December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of loan production exceeding payoffs. Residential mortgage loans increased $278 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2019 primarily driven by higher production and the continued retention of certain ARMs and certain other fixed-rate loans. Other consumer loans increased $188 million, or 7%, from December 31, 2019 primarily due to growth in point-of-sale

loan originations. Home equity decreased $120 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2019 as payoffs exceeded new loan production. Credit card decreased $115 million, or 5%, from December 31, 2019 as a result of seasonal paydowns on year-end

balances.

Average loans and leases, including average loans and leases held for sale, increased $13.8 billion, or 14%, for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of a $9.2 billion, or 15%, increase in average commercial loans and leases as well as a $4.6 billion, or 13%, increase in average consumer loans. 

Average commercial loans and leases increased $9.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year due to increases in average commercial and industrial loans, average commercial mortgage loans and average commercial construction loans, partially offset by a decrease in average commercial leases. Average commercial and industrial loans increased $5.6 billion, or 12%, for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by the acquisition of MB Financial, Inc. as well as an increase in revolving line of credit utilization, as discussed above. Average commercial mortgage loans increased $3.6 billion, or 49%, for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the acquisition of MB Financial, Inc. Average commercial construction loans increased $294 million, or 6%, for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of an increase in draw levels on existing commitments. Average commercial leases decreased $354 million, or 10%, for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of a planned reduction in indirect non-relationship

based lease originations.

Average consumer loans increased $4.6 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year due to increases in average indirect secured consumer loans, average residential mortgage loans, average other consumer loans and average credit card, partially offset by a decrease in average home equity. Average indirect secured consumer loans increased $2.6 billion, or 29%, for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the acquisition of MB Financial, Inc. and loan production exceeding payoffs. Average residential mortgage loans increased $1.9 billion, or 12%, for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by the acquisition of MB Financial, Inc., higher production and the continued retention of certain ARMs and certain other fixed-rate loans. Average other consumer loans increased $393 million, or 16%, for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to growth in point-of-sale

loan originations. Average credit card increased $102 million, or 4%, for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in balance-active customers and average balance per active customer. Average home equity decreased $350 million, or 6%, for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year as payoffs exceeded new loan production.

Investment Securities 

The Bancorp uses investment securities as a means of managing interest rate risk, providing collateral for pledging purposes and for liquidity to satisfy regulatory requirements. Total investment securities were $39.6 billion and $36.9 billion at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The taxable available-for-sale

debt and other investment securities portfolio had an effective duration of 4.7 years at March 31, 2020 compared to 5.1 years at December 31, 2019.

Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale

when, in management&#8217;s judgment, they may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, changes in market conditions. Securities that management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity

and reported at amortized cost. Debt securities are classified as trading when bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. At March 31, 2020, the Bancorp&#8217;s investment portfolio consisted primarily of AAA-rated

available-for-sale

debt and other securities. The Bancorp held an immaterial amount in below-investment grade available-for-sale

debt and other securities at both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.

Upon adoption of ASU 2016-13

on January 1, 2020, the Bancorp evaluates available-for-sale

debt and other securities in an unrealized loss position to determine whether all or a portion of the unrealized loss on such securities is a credit loss. If credit losses are identified, they are generally recognized as an allowance for credit losses (a contra account to the amortized cost basis of the securities) with the periodic change in the allowance recognized in earnings. Prior to January 1, 2020, investment securities were evaluated for OTTI with any identified OTTI recognized as a charge to income and a direct reduction of the amortized cost basis of the securities.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)

&#160;

At March 31, 2020, the Bancorp completed its evaluation of the available-for-sale

debt and other securities in an unrealized loss position and did not recognize an allowance for credit losses. During the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Bancorp did not recognize any OTTI on its available-for-sale

debt and other securities.

(a)

Other securities consist of FHLB, FRB and DTCC restricted stock holdings of $136, $478 and $2, respectively, at March 31, 2020 and $76, $478 and $2, respectively, at December 31, 2019, that are carried at cost.

&#160;

&#160;

On an amortized cost basis, available-for-sale

debt and other securities increased $1.5 billion from December 31, 2019 primarily due to an increase in agency commercial mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities and other debt securities, partially offset by a decrease in agency residential mortgage-backed securities.

On an amortized cost basis, available-for-sale

debt and other securities were 22% and 24% of total interest-earning assets at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The estimated weighted-average life of the debt securities in the available-for-sale

debt and other securities portfolio was 6.4 years at March 31, 2020 compared to 6.6 years at December 31, 2019. In addition, at March 31, 2020, the debt securities in the available-for-sale

debt and other securities portfolio had a weighted-average yield of 3.16% compared to 3.22% at December 31, 2019.

Information presented in Table 17 is on a weighted-average life basis, anticipating future prepayments. Yield information is presented on an FTE basis and is computed using amortized cost balances. Maturity and yield calculations for the total available-for-sale

debt and other securities portfolio exclude other securities that have no stated yield or maturity. Total net unrealized gains on the available-for-sale

debt and other securities portfolio were $2.2 billion at March 31, 2020 compared to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2019. The fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. The fair value of investment securities generally increases when interest rates decrease or when credit spreads contract.

Other Short-Term Investments 

Other short-term investments primarily include overnight interest-earning investments, including reserves held at the Federal Reserve. The Bancorp uses other short-term investments as part of its liquidity risk management tools. Other short-term investments were $6.3 billion and $2.0 billion at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The increase of $4.3 billion from December 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to the decision to draw down on FHLB borrowing capacity to hold more balance sheet liquidity at the end of March given the uncertain economic environment.

Deposits 

The Bancorp&#8217;s deposit balances represent an important source of funding and revenue growth opportunity. The Bancorp continues to focus on core deposit growth in its retail and commercial franchises by improving customer satisfaction, building full relationships and offering competitive rates. Average core deposits represented 72% and 71% of the Bancorp&#8217;s average asset funding base at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.

&#160;

Core deposits increased $8.9 billion, or 7%, from December 31, 2019 as a result of an increase in transaction deposits, partially offset by a decrease in other time deposits. Transaction deposits increased $9.4 billion, or 8%, from December 31, 2019 primarily due to increases in interest checking deposits, demand deposits and savings deposits. Interest checking deposits increased $4.1 billion, or 10%, and demand deposits increased $3.6 billion, or 10%, from December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of higher balances per commercial customer account due to the current economic environment. Savings deposits increased $1.3 billion, or 9%, from December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of promotional product offerings and higher balances per customer account due to the current economic environment. Other time deposits decreased $554 million, or 11%, from December 31, 2019 primarily due to lower rates on certificates less than $100,000. 

Certificates $100,000 and over decreased $886 million, or 24%, from December 31, 2019 primarily due to a decrease in retail brokered certificates of deposit issued since December 31, 2019.

Includes $1.7 billion and $2.0 billion of average institutional, retail and wholesale certificates $250,000 and over for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

On an average basis, core deposits increased $17.7 billion, or 17%, for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase of $17.4 billion in average transaction deposits. The increase in average transaction deposits was driven primarily by increases in average interest checking deposits, average demand deposits, average money market deposits and average savings deposits. Average interest checking deposits increased $6.6 billion, or 20%, for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in average balance per commercial customer account and the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition. Average demand deposits increased $5.2 billion, or 17%, for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition. Average money market deposits increased $4.0 billion, or 17%, for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition as well as promotional product offerings, which drove consumer customer acquisition. Average savings deposits increased $1.7 billion, or 13%, for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition. 

Average other deposits decreased $469 million, or 65%, primarily due to a decrease in average Eurodollar trade deposits.

Borrowings 

The Bancorp accesses a variety of short-term and long-term funding sources. Borrowings with original maturities of one year or less are classified as short-term and include federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings. Average total borrowings as a percent of average interest-bearing liabilities were 17% at both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. 

The following table summarizes the end of period components of borrowings:

Total borrowings increased $6.2 billion, or 38%, from December 31, 2019 due to increases in other short-term borrowings, federal funds purchased and long-term debt. Other short-term borrowings increased $3.5 billion from December 31, 2019 primarily from FHLB advances to fund the previously discussed increase in other short-term investments. The level of other short-term borrowings can fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on funding needs and the sources that are used to satisfy those needs. For further information on the components of other short-term borrowings, refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Federal funds purchased increased $1.4 billion from December 31, 2019 primarily due to increased liquidity needs as a result of the current economic environment. Long-term debt increased $1.3 billion from December 31, 2019 primarily driven by the issuance of $1.3 billion of unsecured senior fixed-rate bank notes and $226 million of fair value adjustments associated with interest rate swaps hedging long-term debt during the three months ended March 31, 2020. These increases were partially offset by $161 million of paydowns on long-term debt associated with automobile loan securitizations. For further information on a subsequent event related to long-term debt, refer to Note 25 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Total average borrowings increased $117 million, or 1%, compared to March 31, 2019 due to increases in average other short-term borrowings and average long-term debt, partially offset by a decrease in average federal funds purchased. Average other short-term borrowings increased $1.1 billion compared to March 31, 2019, primarily driven by an increase in FHLB advances. Average long-term debt increased $378 million compared to March 31, 2019 driven by the issuance of $1.3 billion of unsecured senior fixed-rate bank notes in the first quarter of 2020, the issuance of $750 million of unsecured senior fixed-rate notes in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the issuance of asset-

backed securities of $1.3 billion related to an automobile loan securitization in the second quarter of 2019. These increases were partially offset by the maturities of $1.9 billion in unsecured senior bank notes and $758 million of paydowns on long-term debt associated with automobile loan securitizations since March 31, 2019. Despite the increase in federal funds purchased at the end of the first quarter of 2020 to address liquidity needs associated with the current economic environment, average federal funds purchased decreased $1.4 billion compared to March 31, 2019 primarily due to a reduction in short-term funding needs as a result of average deposit growth. Information on the average rates paid on borrowings is discussed in the Net Interest Income subsection of the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&#38;A. In addition, refer to the Liquidity Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A for a discussion on the role of borrowings in the Bancorp&#8217;s liquidity management.

BUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW 

The Bancorp reports on four business segments: Commercial Banking, Branch Banking, Consumer Lending and Wealth and Asset Management. Additional information on each business segment is included in Note 24 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of the Bancorp&#8217;s business segments are presented based on its management structure and management accounting practices. The structure and accounting practices are specific to the Bancorp; therefore, the financial results of the Bancorp&#8217;s business segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial institutions. The Bancorp refines its methodologies from time to time as management&#8217;s accounting practices and businesses change. 

The Bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the corporate level. By employing an FTP methodology, the business segments are insulated from most benchmark interest rate volatility, enabling them to focus on serving customers through the origination of loans and acceptance of deposits. The FTP methodology assigns charge and credit rates to classes of assets and liabilities, respectively, based on the estimated amount and timing of cash flows for each transaction. Assigning the FTP rate based on matching the duration of cash flows allocates interest income and interest expense to each business segment so its resulting net interest income is insulated from future changes in benchmark interest rates. The Bancorp&#8217;s FTP methodology also allocates the contribution to net interest income of the asset-generating and deposit-providing businesses on a duration-adjusted basis to better attribute the driver of the performance. As the asset and liability durations are not perfectly matched, the residual impact of the FTP methodology is captured in General Corporate and Other. The charge and credit rates are determined using the FTP rate curve, which is based on an estimate of Fifth Third&#8217;s marginal borrowing cost in the wholesale funding markets. The FTP curve is constructed using the U.S. swap curve, brokered CD pricing and unsecured debt pricing. 

The Bancorp adjusts the FTP charge and credit rates as dictated by changes in interest rates for various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and by the review of behavioral assumptions, such as prepayment rates on interest-earning assets and the estimated durations for indeterminate-lived deposits. Key assumptions, including the credit rates provided for deposit accounts, are reviewed annually. Credit rates for deposit products and charge rates for loan products may be reset more frequently in response to changes in market conditions. In general, the charge rates on assets have declined since December 31, 2019 as they were affected by the prevailing level of interest rates and by the duration and repricing characteristics of the portfolio. The credit rates for deposit products also declined due to interest rates and modified assumptions. Thus net interest income for asset-generating business segments improved while deposit-providing business segments were negatively impacted during the three months ended March 31, 2020. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s methodology for allocating provision for credit losses expense to the business segments includes charges or benefits associated with changes in criticized commercial loan levels in addition to actual net charge-offs experienced by the loans and leases owned by each business segment. Provision for credit losses expense attributable to loan and lease growth and changes in ALLL factors is captured in General Corporate and Other. The financial results of the business segments include allocations for shared services and headquarters expenses. Additionally, the business segments form synergies by taking advantage of cross-sell opportunities and funding operations by accessing the capital markets as a collective unit. 

The following table summarizes net income (loss) by business segment:

&#160;

&#160;

Net income was $224 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to $294 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to increases in noninterest expense and provision for credit losses partially offset by an increase in noninterest income. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis decreased $2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in FTP credit rates on interest checking deposits and demand deposits. These negative impacts were partially offset by a decrease in FTP charge rates on loans and leases, a decrease in rates paid on average interest checking deposits and an increase in average commercial loans and leases. 

Provision for credit losses increased $25 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in net charge-offs on commercial and industrial loans and commercial leases partially offset by an improvement in the mix of criticized assets. Net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases increased to 27 bps for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to 8 bps for the same period in the prior year. 

Noninterest income increased $60 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year driven by increases in leasing business revenue, commercial banking revenue and service charges on deposits partially offset by a decrease in other noninterest income. Leasing business revenue increased $41 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by increases in operating lease income, lease syndication fees and leasing business solutions revenue. The increases in operating lease income and leasing business solutions revenue were driven by the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition. Commercial banking revenue increased $21 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by increases in institutional sales, contract revenue from commercial customer derivatives and bridge fees. Service charges on deposits increased $18 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition and lower earnings credit rates. Other noninterest income decreased $20 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by a decrease in private equity investment income driven by valuation adjustments and impairment charges recognized on certain private equity investments during the three months ended March 31, 2020. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)

&#160;

Noninterest expense increased $124 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year driven by increases in other noninterest expense, compensation and benefits and leasing business expense. Other noninterest expense increased $67 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in credit valuation adjustments on derivatives associated with customer accommodation contracts, overhead allocations and intangible amortization expense driven by the amortization of intangible assets identified in the acquisition of MB Financial, Inc. Compensation and benefits increased $41 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in personnel costs primarily as a result of the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition. Leasing business expense increased $16 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in operating lease expense driven by the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition. 

Average commercial loans and leases increased $9.0 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in average commercial and industrial loans and average commercial mortgage loans. Average commercial and industrial loans increased $5.6 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition as well as an increase in revolving line of credit utilization. Average commercial mortgage loans increased $3.5 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition. 

Average core deposits increased $8.3 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in average interest checking deposits, average demand deposits and average savings and money market deposits. Average interest checking deposits increased $4.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in average balances per commercial customer account and the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition. Average demand deposits increased $2.7 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition. Average savings and money market deposits increased $1.3 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition.

Net income was $121 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to net income of $217 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in net income was primarily due to a decrease in net interest income as well as increases in noninterest expense and provision for credit losses partially offset by an increase in noninterest income. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)

&#160;

Net interest income decreased $79 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in FTP credit rates on core deposits as well as a decrease in both yields on and average balances of home equity loans. These negative impacts were partially offset by a decrease in FTP charge rates on loans and leases, an increase in average other consumer loans and decreases in the rates paid on average savings and money market deposits and other time deposits. 

Provision for credit losses increased $10 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in net charge-offs on commercial and industrial loans, credit card and other consumer loans. Net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases increased to 157 bps for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to 139 bps for the same period in the prior year. 

Noninterest income increased $15 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by increases in wealth and asset management revenue and card and processing revenue. Wealth and asset management revenue increased $8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in broker income. Card and processing revenue increased $4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition as well as increases in other interchange revenue, the number of actively used cards and customer spend volume. 

Noninterest expense increased $48 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits and other noninterest expense. Compensation and benefits increased $25 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year driven by higher base compensation primarily as a result of the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition as well as increases in employee benefits expense and incentive compensation. Other noninterest expense increased $22 million primarily driven by increases in corporate overhead allocations and intangible amortization expense associated with the amortization of intangible assets identified in the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition. 

Average consumer loans increased $78 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year driven by an increase in average other consumer loans of $370 million primarily due to growth in point-of-sale

loan originations. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in average home equity loans of $325 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year as payoffs exceeded new loan production. Average commercial loans increased $269 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by increases in average commercial and industrial loans and average commercial mortgage loans.

Average core deposits increased $7.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by increases in average savings and money market deposits, average demand deposits and average interest checking deposits. Average savings and money market deposits increased $3.6 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition as well as promotional product offerings, which drove consumer customer acquisition. Average demand deposits increased $1.8 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition. Average interest checking deposits increased $1.6 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition. 

Consumer Lending 

Consumer Lending includes the Bancorp&#8217;s residential mortgage, automobile and other indirect lending activities.

Residential mortgages are primarily originated through a dedicated sales force and through third-party correspondent lenders. Automobile and other indirect lending activities include extending loans to consumers through automobile dealers, motorcycle dealers, powersport dealers, recreational vehicle dealers and marine dealers.

Net income was $61 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to net income of $8 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in net income was primarily driven by increases in noninterest income and net interest income partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense. 

Net interest income increased $26 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by increases in both yields on and average balances of indirect secured consumer loans and an increase in average residential mortgage loans. These benefits were partially offset by an increase in FTP charges on loans and leases driven by higher average balances. 

Noninterest income increased $63 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in mortgage banking net revenue as a result of increases in origination fees and gains on loan sales as well as net mortgage servicing revenue. Refer to the Noninterest Income subsection of the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&#38;A for additional information on the fluctuations in mortgage banking net revenue. 

Noninterest expense increased $21 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year due to increases in other noninterest expense and compensation and benefits. Other noninterest expense increased $15 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by an increase in corporate overhead allocations. Compensation and benefits increased $6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in incentive compensation and base compensation resulting from the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition. 

Average consumer loans and leases increased $4.3 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in average indirect secured consumer loans and average residential mortgage loans. Average indirect secured consumer loans increased $2.7 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition and higher loan production exceeding payoffs. Average residential mortgage loans increased $1.7 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition, higher production and the continued retention of certain other fixed-rate loans.

Net income was $22 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to net income of $26 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in net income was primarily driven by an increase in noninterest expense and a decrease in net interest income partially offset by an increase in noninterest income. 

Net interest income decreased $12 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in FTP credit rates on interest checking deposits and a decrease in yields on average loans and leases. These negative impacts were partially offset by a decrease in rates paid on average interest checking deposits and a decrease in FTP charge rates on loans and leases. 

Noninterest income increased $21 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by an increase in wealth and asset management revenue as a result of increases in private client service fees, broker income and institutional fees. 

Noninterest expense increased $13 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year driven by increases in other noninterest expense and compensation and benefits. Other noninterest expense increased $8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by an increase in corporate overhead allocations. Compensation and benefits increased $5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by higher base and incentive compensation due to the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition. 

Average loans and leases, including held for sale, increased $175 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year driven by an increase in average residential mortgage loans primarily due to the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition. This increase was partially offset by a decline in average commercial and industrial loans as payoffs exceeded new loan production. 

Average core deposits increased $1.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in average interest checking deposits and average savings and money market deposits as a result of higher balances per customer account due to the current economic environment. The increase in average interest checking deposits also benefited from the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition.

&#160;

General Corporate and Other 

General Corporate and Other includes the unallocated portion of the investment securities portfolio, securities gains and losses, certain non-core

deposit funding, unassigned equity, unallocated provision for credit losses expense or a benefit from the reduction of the ACL, the payment of preferred stock dividends and certain support activities and other items not attributed to the business segments.

Net interest income increased $214 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by a decrease in the FTP credit rates on deposits allocated to the business segments, an increase in interest income on loans and leases and decreases in interest expense on federal funds purchased and long-term debt. These positive impacts were partially offset by a decrease in the benefit related to FTP charge rates on loans and leases. 

Provision for credit losses increased $514 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in the ACL reflecting deterioration in the macroeconomic environment as a result of the impact of the COVID-19

pandemic, continued pressure on energy prices and commercial loan growth due to increased utilization levels on existing commitments. The increase in the provision for credit losses also reflected the impact of the change in methodology for estimating credit losses from the incurred loss methodology used in the first quarter of 2019 to the expected credit loss methodology used in the first quarter of 2020.

Noninterest income decreased $582 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by the recognition of a $562 million gain related to the sale of Worldpay, Inc. shares during the three months ended March 31, 2019. The decrease also included securities losses of $24 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to securities gains of $16 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. These negative impacts were partially offset by a decrease in net losses on disposition and impairment of bank premises and equipment as well as a decrease in the loss on the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B shares for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year. 

Noninterest expense decreased $96 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in corporate overhead allocations from General Corporate and Other to the other business segments as well as a decrease in employee benefits expense driven by a decrease in deferred compensation expense.

RISK MANAGEMENT &#8211; OVERVIEW 

Risk management is critical to effectively serving customers&#8217; financial needs while protecting the Bancorp and achieving strategic goals. It is also essential to reducing the volatility of earnings and safeguarding the Bancorp&#8217;s brand and reputation. Further, risk management is integral to the Bancorp&#8217;s strategic, financial, and capital planning processes. It is essential that the Bancorp&#8217;s business strategies consistently align to its overall risk appetite and capital considerations. 

Key elements of Fifth Third&#8217;s Risk Management Framework are as follows: 

&#160; &#9679;

The Bancorp ensures transparency of risk through defined risk policies, governance, and a reporting structure that includes the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors, the Enterprise Risk Management Committee and risk management committees. &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#9679;

The Bancorp establishes a risk appetite in alignment with its strategic, financial, and capital plans. The Bancorp&#8217;s risk appetite is defined using quantitative metrics and qualitative measures to ensure prudent risk taking, drive balanced decision making and ensure that no excessive risks are taken. &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#9679;

Fifth Third&#8217;s core values and culture provide a foundation for supporting sound risk management practices by setting expectations for appropriate conduct and accountability across the organization. All employees are expected to conduct themselves in alignment with Fifth Third&#8217;s core values and Code of Business Conduct &#38; Ethics, which may be found on www.53.com, while carrying out their responsibilities. Fifth Third&#8217;s Corporate Responsibility and Reputation Committee provides oversight of business conduct policies, programs and strategies, and monitors reporting of potential misconduct, trends or themes across the enterprise. Prudent risk management is a responsibility that is expected from all employees across the first, second and third lines of defense and is a foundational element of Fifth Third&#8217;s culture. &#160;

&#160;

Fifth Third drives accountability for managing risk through its Three Lines of Defense structure: 

&#160; &#9679;

The first line of defense is comprised of front line units that create risk and are accountable for managing risk. These groups are the Bancorp&#8217;s primary risk takers and are responsible for implementing effective internal controls and maintaining processes for identifying, assessing, controlling and mitigating the risks associated with their activities consistent with established risk appetite and limits. The first line of defense also includes business units that provide information technology, operations, servicing, processing or other support. &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#9679;

The second line of defense, or Independent Risk Management, consists of Risk Management, Compliance, and Credit Review. The second line is responsible for developing frameworks and policies to govern risk-taking activities, overseeing risk-taking of the organization, advising on controlling that risk and providing input on key risk decisions. Risk Management complements the front line&#8217;s management of risk taking activities through its monitoring and reporting responsibilities, including adherence to the risk appetite. Additionally, Risk Management is responsible for identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling aggregate and emerging risks enterprise-wide. &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#9679;

The third line of defense is Internal Audit, which provides oversight of the first and second lines of defense, and independent assurance to the Board on the effectiveness of governance, risk management and internal controls. &#160;

&#160;

The Bancorp has eight defined risk types and manages each to a prescribed tolerance. The risk types are as follows: 

&#160; &#9679;

Credit Risk &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#9679;

Liquidity Risk &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#9679;

Interest Rate Risk &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#9679;

Price Risk &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#9679;

Legal and Regulatory Compliance Risk &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#9679;

Operational Risk &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#9679;

Reputational Risk &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#9679;

Strategic Risk &#160;

&#160;

Fifth Third&#8217;s Risk Management processes ensure a consistent and comprehensive approach in how to identify, measure and assess, manage, monitor and report risks. The Bancorp has also established processes and programs to manage and report concentration risks; to ensure robust talent, compensation and performance management; and to aggregate risks across the enterprise. 

Below are the Bancorp&#8217;s core principles and qualitative factors that define its risk appetite and are used to ensure the Bancorp is operating in a safe and sound manner: 

&#160; &#9679;

Act with integrity in all activities. &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#9679;

Understand the risks the Bancorp takes and ensure that they are in alignment with its business strategies and risk appetite. &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#9679;

Avoid risks that cannot be understood, managed or monitored. &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#9679;

Provide transparency of risk to the Bancorp&#8217;s management and Board, and escalate risks and issues as necessary. &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#9679;

Ensure Fifth Third&#8217;s products and services are aligned to its core customer base and are designed, delivered and maintained to provide value and benefit to customers and to Fifth Third. &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#9679;

Do not offer products or services that are not appropriate or suitable for customers. &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#9679;

Focus on providing operational excellence by providing reliable, accurate and efficient services to meet customer&#8217;s needs. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Risk appetite is measured and monitored to ensure: 

&#160; &#9679;

Risk-taking activities remain aligned with the Bancorp&#8217;s established risk appetite, tolerances and limits; &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#9679;

Business decisions are based on a holistic and forward-looking view of risk and returns, including interactions between risks and results of stress tests, leading to an efficient use of capital; &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#9679;

Risk management activities are maintained through periods of economic decline as well as periods of economic growth when risk management can be most critical and challenging. &#160;

&#160;

Quantitative metrics and limits are used to provide a view of the overall risk profile of the Bancorp, which includes monitoring top risks and areas of concentration risk. 

Fifth Third&#8217;s success is dependent on effective risk management and understanding and controlling the risks taken in order to deliver sustainable returns for employees and shareholders. The Bancorp&#8217;s goal is to ensure that aggregate risks do not exceed its risk capacity, and that risks taken are supportive of the Bancorp&#8217;s portfolio diversification and profitability objectives. Fifth Third&#8217;s strategic plan is approved by the Board of Directors annually. The strategic plan includes a comprehensive assessment of risks that currently have an impact on the Bancorp or risks that could have an impact on risk appetite and impact on capital, liquidity and earnings during the time period covered by the plan. 

Fifth Third&#8217;s Risk Management Framework states its risk appetite and the linkage to strategic and capital planning, defines and sets the tolerance for each of the eight risk types, explains the process used to manage risk across the enterprise and sets forth its risk governance structure. 

&#160; &#9679;

The Board of Directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) and executive management define the risk appetite, which is considered in the development of business strategies, and forms the basis for enterprise risk management. The Bancorp&#8217;s risk appetite is set annually in alignment with the strategic, capital and financial plans, and is reviewed by the Board on an annual basis. &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#9679;

The Risk Management Process provides a consistent and integrated approach for managing risks and ensuring appropriate risk mitigants and controls are in place, and risks and issues are appropriately escalated. Five components are utilized for effective risk management; identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and independent governance reporting of risk. &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#9679;

The Board and executive management have identified eight risk types (defined above) for monitoring the overall risk of the Bancorp, and have also qualitatively established a risk tolerance, which is defined as the maximum amount of risk the Bancorp is willing to take for each of the eight risk types. These risk types are assessed using quantitative measurements and qualitative factors on an ongoing basis and reported to the Board each quarter, or more frequently, if necessary. In addition, each business and operational function (first line of defense) is accountable for proactively identifying and managing risk using its risk management process. Risk tolerances and risk limits are also established, where appropriate, in order to ensure that business and operational functions across the enterprise are able to monitor and manage risks at a more granular level, while ensuring that aggregate risks across the enterprise do not exceed the overall risk appetite. &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#9679;

The Bancorp&#8217;s risk governance structure includes management committees operating under delegation from, and providing information directly or indirectly to, the Board. The Bancorp Board delegates certain responsibilities to Board sub-committees, 

including the RCC as outlined in each respective Committee Charter, which may be found on www.53.com. The ERMC, which reports to the RCC, comprises senior management from across the Bancorp and reviews and approves risk management frameworks and policies, oversees the management of all risk types to ensure that aggregated risks remain within the Bancorp&#8217;s risk appetite and fosters a risk culture to ensure appropriate escalation and transparency of risks. &#160;

&#160;

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT 

The objective of the Bancorp&#8217;s credit risk management strategy is to quantify and manage credit risk on an aggregate portfolio basis, as well as to limit the risk of loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to honor its financial or contractual obligations to the Bancorp. The Bancorp&#8217;s credit risk management strategy is based on three core principles: conservatism, diversification and monitoring. The Bancorp believes that effective credit risk management begins with conservative lending practices which are described below. These practices include the use of intentional risk-based limits for single name exposures and counterparty selection criteria designed to reduce or eliminate exposure to borrowers who have higher than average default risk and defined weaknesses in financial performance. The Bancorp carefully designed and monitors underwriting, documentation and collection standards. The Bancorp&#8217;s credit risk management strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level as well as ongoing portfolio monitoring and timely management reviews of large credit exposures and credits experiencing deterioration of credit quality. Credit officers with the authority to extend credit are delegated specific authority amounts, the utilization of which is closely monitored. Underwriting activities are centrally managed, and ERM manages the policy and the authority delegation process directly. The Credit Risk Review function provides independent and objective assessments of the quality of underwriting and documentation, the accuracy of risk grades and the charge-off,

nonaccrual and reserve analysis process. The Bancorp&#8217;s credit review process and overall assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is based on quarterly assessments of the estimated losses expected in the loan and lease portfolio. The Bancorp uses these assessments to promptly identify potential problem loans or leases within the portfolio, maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses and take any necessary charge-offs. The Bancorp defines potential problem loans and leases as those rated substandard that do not meet the definition of a nonaccrual loan or a restructured loan. Refer to Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Bancorp&#8217;s credit grade categories, which are derived from standard regulatory rating definitions. In addition, stress testing is performed on various commercial and consumer portfolios using the CCAR model and for certain portfolios, such as real estate and leveraged lending, stress testing is performed by Credit department personnel at the individual loan level during credit underwriting.

&#160;

In addition to the individual review of larger commercial loans that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses, the commercial credit review process includes the use of two risk grading systems. The first of these risk grading systems encompasses ten categories, which are based on regulatory guidance for credit risk systems. These ratings are used by the Bancorp to monitor and manage its credit risk. The Bancorp also maintains a dual risk rating system for credit approval and pricing, portfolio monitoring and capital allocation that includes a &#8220;through-the-cycle&#8221;

rating philosophy for assessing a borrower&#8217;s creditworthiness. A &#8220;through-the-cycle&#8221;

rating philosophy uses a grading scale that assigns ratings based on average default rates through an entire business cycle for borrowers with similar financial performance. The dual risk rating system includes thirteen probabilities of default grade categories and an additional eleven grade categories for estimating losses given an event of default. The probability of default and loss given default evaluations are not separated in the ten-category

regulatory risk rating system.

The Bancorp has also developed models to estimate expected credit losses as part of the Bancorp&#8217;s adoption of ASU 2016-13

&#8220; Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments

&#8221; on January 1, 2020. For loans and leases that are collectively evaluated, the Bancorp utilizes these models to forecast expected credit losses over a reasonable and supportable forecast period based on the probability of a loan or lease defaulting, the expected balance at the estimated date of default and the expected loss percentage given a default. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the Bancorp&#8217;s processes for developing these models, estimating credit losses for periods beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period and for estimating credit losses for individually evaluated loans.

For the commercial portfolio segment, the estimated probabilities of default are primarily based on the probability of default ratings assigned under the through-the-cycle

dual risk rating system and historical observations of how those ratings migrate to a default over time in the context of macroeconomic conditions. For loans with available credit, the estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected utilization rates, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions.

For collectively evaluated loans in the consumer and residential mortgage portfolio segments, the Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models primarily utilize the borrower&#8217;s FICO score and delinquency history in combination with macroeconomic conditions when estimating the probability of default. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. The expected balance at the estimated date of default is also especially impactful in the expected credit loss models for portfolio classes which generally have longer terms (such as residential mortgage loans and home equity) and portfolio classes containing a high concentration of loans with revolving privileges (such as credit card and home equity). The estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected prepayment and utilization rates where applicable, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. The Bancorp also utilizes various scoring systems, analytical tools and portfolio performance monitoring processes to assess the credit risk of the consumer and residential mortgage portfolios. 

Overview 

The U.S. economy retracted at the end of the first quarter of 2020 as the spread of COVID-19

became a global pandemic. With concerns increasing that COVID-19

may overwhelm the health care system, states across the U.S. declared lockdowns which restricted social gatherings and ordered temporary closures of businesses deemed non-essential.

As the cases of COVID-19

continued to rise, the disruption in the financial markets led the FRB to enact unprecedented policies to offset the forced liquidations and restore liquidity in the financial markets. The FRB cut rates to the zero lower bound, announced unlimited purchases of treasuries along with agency mortgage-backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities, and announced several facilities designed to support the smooth functioning of credit markets.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)

&#160;

On March 27, 2020 Congress passed the $2 trillion CARES Act which included direct payments to households, increased unemployment benefits, direct aid to states, small business forgivable loans, tax deferrals and loans to businesses, a backstop for losses in lending facilities established by the FRB and assistance to hospitals. The CARES Act represented the largest fiscal package in U.S. history as fiscal authorities tried to offset the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19

outbreak.

As the economic toll from the pandemic continues to mount, the ability of fiscal and monetary policies to provide a bridge to the recovery may be challenged absent robust COVID-19

testing and contact-tracing. Absent these measures, reopening the economy may prove challenging and continue to weigh on economic growth. The decline in the job market may lead to a tightening in credit conditions across all credit markets as individuals and companies may struggle to service their debts. As the risk continues to increase that credit losses could exceed previous cycles, monetary and fiscal authorities may need to enact further measures to offset the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19

pandemic until a vaccine for the disease is found.

Commercial Portfolio 

The Bancorp&#8217;s credit risk management strategy seeks to minimize concentrations of risk through diversification. The Bancorp has commercial loan concentration limits based on industry, lines of business within the commercial segment, geography and credit product type. The risk within the commercial loan and lease portfolio is managed and monitored through an underwriting process utilizing detailed origination policies, continuous loan level reviews, monitoring of industry concentration and product type limits and continuous portfolio risk management reporting. 

The Bancorp provides loans to a variety of customers ranging from large multi-national firms to middle market businesses, sole proprietors and high net worth individuals. The origination policies for commercial and industrial loans outline the risks and underwriting requirements for loans to businesses in various industries. Included in the policies are maturity and amortization terms, collateral and leverage requirements, cash flow coverage measures and hold limits. The Bancorp aligns credit and sales teams with specific industry expertise to better monitor and manage different industry segments of the portfolio. 

The acquired MB Financial, Inc. commercial and industrial portfolio is comprised primarily of small business and middle market commercial loans but also includes specialty lending products, including lease banking, small business leasing and asset-based lending. These products serve distinct client needs and broaden Fifth Third&#8217;s lending capabilities. The portfolios have been evaluated for credit quality and will be managed within Fifth Third&#8217;s credit risk framework to ensure adherence to risk appetite. 

During the first quarter of 2020, certain industries experienced increased stress due to the COVID-19

pandemic. The following table presents industries impacted the most severely within the Bancorp&#8217;s commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loan portfolios as of March 31, 2020:

The origination policies for commercial real estate outline the risks and underwriting requirements for owner and nonowner-occupied and construction lending. Included in the policies are maturity and amortization terms, maximum LTVs, minimum debt service coverage ratios, construction loan monitoring procedures, appraisal requirements, pre-leasing

requirements (as applicable), pro forma analysis requirements and interest rate sensitivity. The Bancorp requires a valuation of real estate collateral, which may include third-party appraisals, be performed at the time of origination and renewal in accordance with regulatory requirements and on an as-needed

basis when market conditions justify. Although the Bancorp does not back test these collateral value assumptions, the Bancorp maintains an appraisal review department to order and review third-party appraisals in accordance with regulatory requirements. Collateral values on criticized assets with relationships exceeding $1 million are reviewed quarterly to assess the appropriateness of the value ascribed in the assessment of charge-offs and specific reserves.

The Bancorp assesses all real estate and non-real

estate collateral securing a loan and considers all cross-collateralized loans in the calculation of the LTV ratio. The following tables provide detail on the most recent LTV ratios for commercial mortgage loans greater than $1 million, excluding commercial mortgage loans that are individually evaluated. The Bancorp does not typically aggregate the LTV ratios for commercial mortgage loans less than $1 million.

The Bancorp views non-owner-occupied

commercial real estate as a higher credit risk product compared to some other commercial loan portfolios due to the higher volatility of the industry.

The following tables provide an analysis of nonowner-occupied commercial real estate loans by state (excluding loans held for sale):

Consumer Portfolio 

Consumer credit risk management utilizes a framework that encompasses consistent processes for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting credit risk. These processes are supported by a credit risk governance structure that includes Board oversight, policies, risk limits and risk committees. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s consumer portfolio is materially comprised of five categories of loans: residential mortgage loans, home equity, indirect secured consumer loans, credit card and other consumer loans. The Bancorp has identified certain credit characteristics within these five categories of loans which it believes represent a higher level of risk compared to the rest of the consumer loan portfolio. The Bancorp does not update LTVs for the consumer portfolio subsequent to origination except as part of the charge-off

process for real estate secured loans. Credit risk management continues to closely monitor the indirect secured consumer portfolio performance, which includes automobile loans. The automobile market has exhibited industry-wide gradual loosening of credit standards such as lower FICOs, longer terms and higher LTVs. The Bancorp has adjusted credit standards focused on improving risk-adjusted returns while maintaining credit risk tolerance. The Bancorp actively manages the automobile portfolio through concentration limits, which mitigate credit risk through limiting the exposure to lower FICO scores, higher advance rates and extended term originations.

Residential mortgage portfolio 

The Bancorp manages credit risk in the residential mortgage portfolio through underwriting guidelines that limit exposure to higher LTVs and lower FICO scores. Additionally, the portfolio is governed by concentration limits that ensure geographic, product and channel diversification. The Bancorp may also package and sell loans in the portfolio. 

The Bancorp does not originate residential mortgage loans that permit customers to defer principal payments or make payments that are less than the accruing interest. The Bancorp originates both fixed-rate and ARM loans. Within the ARM portfolio, approximately $653 million of ARM loans will have rate resets during the next twelve months. Of these resets, 17% are expected to experience an increase in rate, with an average increase of approximately 0.5%. Underlying characteristics of these borrowers are relatively strong with a weighted average origination DTI of 33% and weighted average origination LTV of 72%. 

Certain residential mortgage products have contractual features that may increase credit exposure to the Bancorp in the event of a decline in housing values. These types of mortgage products offered by the Bancorp include loans with high LTVs, multiple loans secured by the same collateral that when combined result in an LTV greater than 80% and interest-only loans. The Bancorp has deemed residential mortgage loans with greater than 80% LTVs and no mortgage insurance as loans that represent a higher level of risk. 

Portfolio residential mortgage loans from 2010 and later vintages represented 94% of the portfolio as of March 31, 2020 and had a weighted-average origination LTV of 73% and a weighted-average origination FICO of 760. 

In response to the COVID-19

pandemic, the Bancorp has provided forbearances for up to 180 days for customers who are experiencing a hardship related to COVID-19. 

The following table provides an analysis of the residential mortgage portfolio loans outstanding by LTV at origination as of:

Home equity portfolio 

The Bancorp&#8217;s home equity portfolio is primarily comprised of home equity lines of credit. Beginning in the first quarter of 2013, the Bancorp&#8217;s newly originated home equity lines of credit have a 10-year

interest-only draw period followed by a 20-year

amortization period. The home equity line of credit previously offered by the Bancorp was a revolving facility with a 20-year

term, minimum payments of interest-only and a balloon payment of principal at maturity. Peak maturity years for the balloon home equity lines of credit are 2025 to 2028 and approximately 24% of the balances mature before 2025.

The ALLL provides coverage for expected losses in the home equity portfolio. The allowance attributable to the portion of the home equity portfolio that has not been restructured in a TDR is determined on a pooled basis using a probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default model framework to generate expected losses. The expected losses for the home equity portfolio are dependent upon loan delinquency, FICO scores, LTV, loan age and their historical correlation with macroeconomic variables including unemployment and the home price index. The expected losses generated from models are adjusted by certain qualitative adjustment factors to reflect risks associated with current conditions and trends. The qualitative factors include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, economic conditions, portfolio mix, lending and risk management personnel, results of internal audit and quality control reviews, collateral values and geographic concentrations. 

The home equity portfolio is managed in two primary groups: loans outstanding with a combined LTV greater than 80% and those loans with an LTV of 80% or less based upon appraisals at origination. For additional information on these loans, refer to Table 42 and Table 43. Of the total $6.0 billion of outstanding home equity loans: 

&#160; &#9679;

91% reside within the Bancorp&#8217;s Midwest footprint of Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, Indiana and Illinois as of March 31, 2020; &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#9679;

38% are in senior lien positions and 62% are in junior lien positions at March 31, 2020; &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#9679;

79% of non-delinquent

borrowers made at least one payment greater than the minimum payment during the three months ended March 31, 2020; and &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#9679;

The portfolio had a weighted average refreshed 

FICO score of 744 at March 31, 2020. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Bancorp actively manages lines of credit and makes adjustments in lending limits when it believes it is necessary based on FICO score deterioration and property devaluation. The Bancorp does not routinely obtain appraisals on performing loans to update LTVs after origination. However, the Bancorp monitors the local housing markets by reviewing various home price indices and incorporates the impact of the changing market conditions in its ongoing credit monitoring processes. For junior lien home equity loans which become 60 days or more past due, the Bancorp tracks the performance of the senior lien loans in which the Bancorp is the servicer and utilizes consumer credit bureau attributes to monitor the status of the senior lien loans that the Bancorp does not service. If the senior lien loan is found to be 120 days or more past due, the junior lien home equity loan is placed on nonaccrual status unless both loans are well-secured and in the process of collection. Additionally, if the junior lien home equity loan becomes 120 days or more past due and the senior lien loan is also 120 days or more past due, the junior lien home equity loan is assessed for charge-off.

Refer to the Analysis of Nonperforming Assets subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A for more information.

As of March 31, 2020, 95% of the indirect secured consumer loan portfolio is comprised of automobile loans, powersport loans and motorcycle loans. It is a common industry practice to advance on these types of loans an amount in excess of the collateral value due to the inclusion of negative equity trade-in,

maintenance/warranty products, taxes, title and other fees paid at closing. The Bancorp monitors its exposure to these higher risk loans. The remainder of the indirect secured consumer loan portfolio is comprised of marine and recreational vehicle loans. The Bancorp&#8217;s credit policies limit the maximum advance rate on these to 100% of collateral value.

Other consumer portfolio loans 

Other consumer portfolio loans are comprised of secured and unsecured loans originated through the Bancorp&#8217;s branch network as well as point-of-sale

loans originated in connection with third-party financial technology companies. The Bancorp had $387 million in unfunded commitments associated with loans originated in connection with third-party financial technology companies as of March 31, 2020. The Bancorp closely monitors the credit performance of point-of-sale

loans which, for the Bancorp, is impacted by the credit loss protection coverage provided by the third-party financial technology companies.

Analysis of Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and leases for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of the principal and/or interest is uncertain; restructured commercial, credit card and certain consumer loans which have not yet met the requirements to be classified as a performing asset; restructured consumer loans which are 90 days past due based on the restructured terms unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection; and certain other assets, including OREO and other repossessed property. A summary of nonperforming assets is included in Table 50. For further information on the Bancorp&#8217;s policies related to accounting for delinquent and nonperforming loans and leases, refer to the Nonaccrual Loans and Leases section of Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Nonperforming assets were $710 million at March 31, 2020 compared to $687 million at December 31, 2019. At March 31, 2020, $1 million of nonaccrual loans were held for sale, compared to $7 million at December 31, 2019. 

Nonperforming portfolio assets as a percent of portfolio loans and leases and OREO were 0.60% as of March 31, 2020 compared to 0.62% as of December 31, 2019. Nonaccrual loans and leases secured by real estate were 40% of nonaccrual loans and leases as of March 31, 2020 compared to 35% as of December 31, 2019. 

Portfolio commercial nonaccrual loans and leases were $445 million at March 31, 2020, an increase of $48 million from December 31, 2019. Portfolio consumer nonaccrual loans were $202 million at March 31, 2020, a decrease of $19 million from December 31, 2019. Refer to Table 51 for a rollforward of the portfolio nonaccrual loans and leases. 

OREO and other repossessed property was $62 million at both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The Bancorp recognized $4 million and $2 million in losses on the transfer, sale or write-down of OREO properties for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

For the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, approximately $8 million and $7 million, respectively, of interest income would have been recognized if the nonaccrual and renegotiated loans and leases on nonaccrual status had been current in accordance with their original terms. Although these values help demonstrate the costs of carrying nonaccrual credits, the Bancorp does not expect to recover the full amount of interest as nonaccrual loans and leases are generally carried below their principal balance.

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

A loan is accounted for as a TDR if the Bancorp, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. TDRs include concessions granted under reorganization, arrangement or other provisions of the Federal Bankruptcy Act. A TDR typically involves a modification of terms such as a reduction of the stated interest rate or remaining principal amount of the loan, a reduction of accrued interest or an extension of the maturity date at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for a new loan with similar risk. 

At the time of modification, the Bancorp maintains certain consumer loan TDRs (including certain residential mortgage loans, home equity loans and other consumer loans) on accrual status, provided there is reasonable assurance of repayment and performance according to the modified terms based upon a current, well-documented credit evaluation. Loans discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower are classified as collateral-dependent TDRs and placed on nonaccrual status regardless of the borrower&#8217;s payment history or capacity to repay in the future. These loans are returned to accrual status provided there is a sustained payment history of twelve months after bankruptcy and collectability is reasonably assured for all remaining contractual payments. Commercial loans modified as part of a TDR are maintained on accrual status provided there is a sustained payment history of six months or greater prior to the modification in accordance with the modified terms and all remaining contractual payments under the modified terms are reasonably assured of collection. TDRs of commercial loans and credit card loans that do not have a sustained payment history of six months or greater in accordance with the modified terms remain on nonaccrual status until a six-month

payment history is sustained.

Consumer restructured loans on accrual status totaled $976 million and $965 million at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. As of March 31, 2020, the percent of restructured residential mortgage loans, home equity loans and credit card loans that were past due 30 days or more from their modified terms were 29%, 18% and 35%, respectively. 

The following tables summarize portfolio TDRs by loan type and delinquency status:

Analysis of Net Loan Charge-offs 

Net charge-offs were 44 bps and 32 bps of average portfolio loans and leases for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Table 55 provides a summary of credit loss experience and net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases outstanding by loan category. 

The ratio of commercial loan and lease net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio commercial loans and leases increased to 32 bps during the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to 11 bps during the three months ended March 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to a $32 million increase in net charge-offs on commercial and industrial loans. 

The ratio of consumer loan net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio consumer loans decreased to 66 bps during the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to 68 bps during the three months ended March 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in average consumer loans primarily as a result of the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition.

(a) 

For the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, the Bancorp recorded $13 and $11, respectively, in both losses charged-off and recoveries of losses previously charged-off related to customer defaults on point-of-sale consumer loans for which the Bancorp obtained recoveries under third-party credit enhancements.

&#160;

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses is comprised of the ALLL and the reserve for unfunded commitments. As further described in Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the Bancorp adopted ASU 2016-13

on January 1, 2020 which established a new approach for estimating credit losses on certain types of financial instruments. After adoption of this amended guidance, the Bancorp

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)

&#160;

maintains the ALLL to absorb the amount of credit losses that are expected to be incurred over the remaining contractual terms of the related loans and leases (as adjusted for prepayments and reasonably expected TDRs). The Bancorp&#8217;s methodology for determining the ALLL includes an estimate of expected credit losses on a collective basis for groups of loans and leases with similar risk characteristics and specific allowances for loans and leases which are individually evaluated. For collectively evaluated loans and leases, the Bancorp uses quantitative models to forecast expected credit losses based on the probability of a loan or lease defaulting, the expected balance at the estimated date of default and the expected loss percentage given a default. The Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models consider historical credit loss experience, current market and economic conditions, and forecasted changes in market and economic conditions if such forecasts are considered reasonable and supportable. 

The Bancorp also considers qualitative factors in determining the ALLL. Qualitative adjustments are used to capture characteristics in the portfolio that impact expected credit losses which are not fully captured within the Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models. These factors include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, lending and risk management personnel and results of internal audit and quality control reviews. In addition, the qualitative adjustment framework can be utilized to address specific idiosyncratic risks such as geopolitical events, natural disasters or changes in current economic conditions that are not reflected in the quantitative credit loss models, and their effects on regional borrowers and changes in product structures. Qualitative factors may also be used to address the impacts of unforeseen events on key inputs and assumptions within the Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models, such as the reasonable and supportable forecast period, changes to historical loss information or changes to the reversion period or methodology. 

Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2019 for discussion of the accounting policies for the ALLL and reserve for unfunded commitments for periods prior to January 1, 2020.

In addition to the ALLL, the Bancorp maintains a reserve for unfunded commitments recorded in other liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The methodology used to determine the adequacy of this reserve is similar to the Bancorp&#8217;s methodology for determining the ALLL. The provision for unfunded commitments is included in the provision for credit losses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 

For the commercial portfolio segment, the estimates for probability of default are primarily based on internal ratings assigned to each commercial borrower on a 13-point

scale and historical observations of how those ratings migrate to a default over time in the context of macroeconomic conditions. For loans with available credit, the estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected utilization rates, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions.

For collectively evaluated loans in the consumer and residential mortgage portfolio segments, the Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models primarily utilize the borrower&#8217;s FICO score and delinquency history in combination with macroeconomic conditions when estimating the probability of default. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. The expected balance at the estimated date of default is also especially impactful in the expected credit loss models for portfolio classes which generally have longer terms (such as residential mortgage loans and home equity) and portfolio classes containing a high concentration of loans with revolving privileges (such as credit card and home equity). The estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected prepayment and utilization rates where applicable, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. 

Day 1 Adoption Impact 

Upon adoption of ASU 2016-13

on January 1, 2020, the Bancorp used three forward-looking economic scenarios during the reasonable and supportable forecast period in its expected credit loss models to address the inherent imprecision in macroeconomic forecasting. Each of the three scenarios was developed by a third party that is subject to the Bancorp&#8217;s Third-Party Risk Management program including oversight by the Bancorp&#8217;s independent model risk management group. The scenarios included a most likely outcome (Baseline) and two less probable scenarios with one being more favorable than the Baseline and the other being less favorable. The more favorable alternative scenario (Upside) depicted a stronger near-term growth outlook while the less favorable outlook (Downside) depicted a moderate recession. The Baseline scenario was assigned a probability weighting of 80% with each of the Upside and Downside scenarios being assigned a 10% weighting.

The Baseline scenario was developed such that the expectation is that the economy will perform better than the projection 50% of the time and worse than the projection 50% of the time. The Upside scenario was developed such that there is a 10% probability that the economy will perform better than the projection and a 90% probability that it will perform worse. The Downside scenario was developed such that there is a 90% probability that the economy will perform better than the projection and a 10% probability that it will perform worse. 

March 31, 2020 ACL 

The ACL as of March 31, 2020 was impacted by several factors, including a significantly weaker economic outlook, lower oil prices, higher funded loan balances, and the impact of unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus from the U.S. Government. As a result of these factors, the Bancorp incorporated a combination of quantitative model-based estimates and qualitative overlays. For the quantitative estimates, the Bancorp incorporated three scenarios developed by the third party in mid-March

that included estimates of the expected impacts of the deterioration in economic conditions caused by the spread of the COVID-19

pandemic. The COVID-19

critical pandemic scenario was assigned a probability weighting of 60%, with a more favorable scenario (Upside) assigned a probability weighting of 25% and a less

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)

&#160;

favorable scenario (Downside) assigned a probability of 15%. The critical pandemic scenario assumes the U.S. experiences a meaningful decline in economic output and employment and a very slow recovery (&#8220;U shaped&#8221;), which results in GDP declining and not returning to the 2019 levels until 2021. Additionally, this scenario assumes U.S. unemployment remains above 6% through the first half of 2021 until slowly recovering. The Upside scenario assumed a relatively benign economic outlook, albeit generally weaker than the Baseline scenario utilized under the Day 1 credit loss modeling process, with GDP growth remaining below 3% throughout the three year reasonable and supportable period and unemployment steadily increasing over the forecast period to just below 4.5%. The Downside scenario utilized macroeconomic variables that were more stressful than the Critical Pandemic scenario, resulting in an even longer recessionary period and slower recovery. Under this scenario, GDP does not return to 2019 levels until the end of 2021, and unemployment remains above 7% for almost the entire forecast period. 

Given the continued economic deterioration and the stimulus actions taken by the U.S Government subsequent to the preparation of the third party scenarios that were utilized in the quantitative credit loss models, the Bancorp considered an updated economic scenario from the third party that was published on March 27, 2020, among other considerations, to inform the qualitative component of the ACL at March 31, 2020. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s quantitative credit loss models are sensitive to changes in economic forecast assumptions over the reasonable and supportable forecast period. Applying a 100% probability weighting to the Downside scenario rather than using the probability-weighted three scenario approach would result in an increase in the quantitative ACL of approximately $600 million. This sensitivity calculation only reflects the impact of changing the probability weighting of the scenarios in the quantitative credit loss models and excludes any additional considerations associated with the qualitative component of the ACL that might be warranted in the circumstance.

As previously mentioned, the Bancorp adopted ASU 2016-13

on January 1, 2020. Based on portfolio characteristics and economic conditions and expectations as of January 1, 2020, the Bancorp recorded a combined increase to the ALLL and reserve for unfunded commitments on January 1, 2020 of approximately $653 million upon the adoption of ASU 2016-13.

The increase in the ALLL at the date of adoption was primarily attributable to longer duration home equity and residential mortgage loans.

The Bancorp&#8217;s ALLL may vary significantly from period to period after the adoption date as it will be based on changes in economic conditions, economic forecasts and the composition and credit quality of the Bancorp&#8217;s loan and lease portfolio. The adoption of ASU 2016-13

will also have an impact on the provision for credit losses in periods after adoption, which could differ materially from historical trends. For additional information on ASU 2016-13,

refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)

&#160;

INTEREST RATE AND PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT 

Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from movement of interest rates. This risk primarily impacts the Bancorp&#8217;s income categories through changes in interest income on earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, and through fee items that are related to interest sensitive activities such as mortgage origination and servicing income and through earnings credits earned on commercial deposits that offset commercial deposit fees. Price risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from changes in the value of financial instruments and portfolios due to movements in interest rates, volatilities, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices. Management considers interest rate risk a prominent market risk in terms of its potential impact on earnings. Interest rate risk may occur for any one or more of the following reasons: 

&#160; &#9679;

Assets and liabilities mature or reprice at different times; &#160;

&#160; &#9679;

Short-term and long-term market interest rates change by different amounts; or &#160;

&#160; &#9679;

The expected maturities of various assets or liabilities shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. &#160;

In addition to the direct impact of interest rate changes on NII and interest-sensitive fees, interest rates can impact earnings through their effect on loan and deposit demand, credit losses, mortgage origination volumes, the value of servicing rights and other sources of the Bancorp&#8217;s earnings. Changes in interest rates and other market factors can impact earnings through changes in the value of portfolios, if not appropriately hedged. Stability of the Bancorp&#8217;s net income is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk and to a lesser extent price risk. Management continually reviews the Bancorp&#8217;s on-

and off-balance

sheet composition, earnings flows, and hedging strategies and models interest rate risk and price risk exposures, and possible actions to manage these risks, given numerous possible future interest rate and market factor scenarios. A series of Policy Limits and Key Risk Indicators are employed to ensure that risks are managed within the Bancorp&#8217;s risk tolerance for interest rate risk and price risk.

In addition to the traditional forms of interest rate risk discussed in this section, the Bancorp is exposed to interest rate risk associated with the retirement and replacement of LIBOR. For more information on the LIBOR transition, refer to the Overview section of MD&#38;A. 

The Commercial and Wealth and Asset Management lines of business manage price risk for capital markets sales and trading activities related to their respective businesses. The Mortgage line of business manages price risk for the origination and sale of conforming residential mortgage loans to government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises. The Bancorp&#8217;s Treasury department manages interest rate risk and price risk for all other activities. Independent oversight is provided by ERM, and key risk indicators and board approved policy limits are used to ensure risks are managed within the Bancorp&#8217;s risk tolerance.

The Bancorp&#8217;s Market Risk Management Committee (&#8220;MRMC&#8221;), which includes senior management representatives, is accountable to the ERMC, provides oversight and monitors price risk for the capital markets and sales and trading activities. The Bancorp&#8217;s ALCO, which includes senior management representatives and is accountable to the ERMC, provides oversight and monitors interest rate and price risks for Mortgage and Treasury activities.

Net Interest Income Sensitivity 

The Bancorp employs a variety of measurement techniques to identify and manage its interest rate risk, including the use of an NII simulation model to analyze the sensitivity of NII to changes in interest rates. The model is based on contractual and estimated cash flows and repricing characteristics for all of the Bancorp&#8217;s assets, liabilities and off-balance

sheet exposures and incorporates market-based assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and attrition rates of certain liabilities. The model also includes senior management&#8217;s projections of the future volume and pricing of each of the product lines offered by the Bancorp as well as other pertinent assumptions. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, deviations from projected assumptions as well as from changes in market conditions and management strategies.

As of March 31, 2020, the Bancorp&#8217;s interest rate risk exposure is governed by a risk framework that utilizes the change in NII over 12-month

and 24-month

horizons assuming a 200 bps parallel ramped increase in interest rates. Given the uncertainty associated with a negative rate environment, the Bancorp does not have policy limit for scenarios that include negative rates. Therefore, the Bancorp has no policy limit for a scenario with a decrease in interest rates currently in effect as the Federal Funds target range is currently zero and 25 basis points. However, the Bancorp routinely analyzes various potential and extreme scenarios, including ramps, shocks and non-parallel

shifts in rates, including negative rate scenarios, to assess where risks to net interest income persist or develop as changes in the balance sheet and market rates evolve. Additionally, the Bancorp routinely evaluates its exposures to changes in the bases between interest rates. The spread between LIBOR and Federal Funds has widened significantly in the current environment as the Federal Funds rate has fallen faster than LIBOR. This type of widening typically benefits the Bancorp as it should result in loan yields decreasing more slowly than deposit costs. At March 31, 2020, 1-Month

LIBOR was 99 bps while the Federal Funds target rate was 0 &#8211; 25 bps. At December 31, 2019, 1-Month

LIBOR was 176 bps while the Federal Funds target rate was 150 &#8211; 175 bps. The Bancorp is exposed to earnings volatility arising from faster than anticipated changes in this basis risk, as the spread between loan yields and deposit costs could compress. The Bancorp expects this spread to normalize during 2020 and net interest income will be impacted by the speed and magnitude of the spread compression. To the extent the 1-Month

LIBOR average for the second quarter converges towards the Federal Funds rate, net interest income could be negatively impacted. In general, each basis point of LIBOR/Federal Funds spread contraction is worth approximately $1 million per quarter. However, the impact of lower LIBOR rates on net interest income should be partially offset by additional deposit rate reductions and a higher contribution from the derivative portfolio.

In order to recognize the risk of noninterest-bearing demand deposit balance run-off

in a rising interest rate environment, the Bancorp&#8217;s NII sensitivity modeling assumes that approximately $750 million of additional demand deposit balances run-off

over 24 months above what is included in senior management&#8217;s baseline projections for each 100 bps increase in short-term market interest rates. Similarly, the Bancorp&#8217;s NII sensitivity modeling incorporates approximately $750 million of incremental growth in noninterest-bearing deposit balances over 24 months above senior management&#8217;s baseline projections for each 100 bps decrease in short-term market interest rates. The incremental balance run-off

and growth are modeled to flow into and out of funding products that reprice in conjunction with short-term market rate changes.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)

&#160;

Another important deposit modeling assumption is the amount by which interest-bearing deposit rates will increase or decrease when market interest rates increase or decrease. This deposit repricing sensitivity is known as the beta, and it represents the expected amount by which Bancorp deposit rates will change for a given change in short-term market rates. The Bancorp&#8217;s NII sensitivity modeling assumes a weighted-average rising-rate interest-bearing deposit beta of 71% at March 31, 2020, which is approximately 10 to 30 percentage points higher than the average beta that the Bancorp experienced in the FRB tightening cycles from June 2004 to June 2006 and from December 2015 to December 2018. In the event of further rate cuts by the Federal Reserve into negative territory, the Bancorp&#8217;s NII sensitivity modeling assumes a weighted-average falling-rate interest-bearing deposit beta of 42% at March 31, 2020 while maintaining that deposit rates themselves will not become negative. In addition, the modeling assumes there is no lag between the timing of changes in market rates and the timing of deposit repricing despite such timing lags having occurred in prior rate cycles. 

The Bancorp continually evaluates the sensitivity of its interest rate risk measures to these important deposit modeling assumptions. The Bancorp also regularly monitors the sensitivity of other important modeling assumptions, such as loan and security prepayments and early withdrawals on fixed-rate customer liabilities. 

The following table shows the Bancorp&#8217;s estimated NII sensitivity profile and ALCO policy limits as of:

At March 31, 2020, the Bancorp&#8217;s NII sensitivity under the parallel rate ramp increases is near neutral in the first year and would benefit in the second year. The asymmetric NII sensitivity profile is attributable to the level of floating-rate assets, including the predominantly floating-rate commercial loan portfolio, exceeding the level of floating-rate liabilities due to the increased amount of deposits rates near zero in this low interest rate environment and other fixed-rate borrowings. Reductions in the yield of the commercial loan portfolio would be expected to be only partially offset by a decline in the cost of interest-bearing deposits in this scenario. However, proactive management of the securities and derivatives portfolios has reduced the ongoing near-term risk to declining market rates and provided significant protection from the decline in rates experienced as the COVID-19

pandemic unfolded. The changes in the estimated NII sensitivity profile compared to March 31, 2019 were primarily attributable to a more asset sensitive balance sheet concentration marked by increased noninterest-bearing and low cost interest-bearing deposits. The down rate scenarios were also impacted by lower market interest rates as the higher composition of low-cost

deposits resulted in deposits hitting their floor rates more quickly in the current year scenarios. However, the strategic repositioning of the investment portfolio into securities that are less callable in the near term more than offset the more asset sensitive balance sheet concentration on NII at risk in year one and partially offset the impact in year two.

Tables 59 and 60 provide the sensitivity of the Bancorp&#8217;s estimated NII profile at March 31, 2020 to changes to certain deposit balance and deposit repricing sensitivity (betas) assumptions.

Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity 

The Bancorp also uses EVE as a measurement tool in managing interest rate risk. Whereas the NII sensitivity analysis highlights the impact on forecasted NII on an FTE basis (non-GAAP)

over one and two-year

time horizons, EVE is a point-in-time

analysis of the economic sensitivity of current positions that incorporates all cash flows over their estimated remaining lives. The EVE of the balance sheet is defined as the discounted present value of all asset and net derivative cash flows less the discounted value of all liability cash flows. Due to this longer horizon, the sensitivity of EVE to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of longer-term interest rate risk. EVE values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the balance growth assumptions used in the NII sensitivity analysis. As with the NII simulation model, assumptions about the timing and variability of existing balance sheet cash flows are critical in the EVE analysis. Particularly important are assumptions driving loan and security prepayments and the expected balance attrition and pricing of indeterminate-lived deposits.

The following table shows the Bancorp&#8217;s estimated EVE sensitivity profile as of: 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; TABLE 61: Estimated EVE Sensitivity Profile

The EVE sensitivity is moderately negative in a +200 bps rising-rate scenario at March 31, 2020. The changes in the estimated EVE sensitivity profile from March 31, 2019 were primarily related to noninterest-bearing and low cost interest-bearing deposits growth and a decrease in market interest rates. These items were partially offset by strategic repositioning of the investment portfolio into securities that are less callable in the near term. 

While an instantaneous shift in interest rates is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure, the Bancorp believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (e.g., the current fiscal year). Further, EVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships and changing product spreads that could mitigate or exacerbate the impact of changes in interest rates. The NII simulations and EVE analyses do not necessarily include certain actions that management may undertake to manage risk in response to actual changes in interest rates. 

The Bancorp regularly evaluates its exposures to a static balance sheet forecast, LIBOR, Prime Rate and other basis risks, yield curve twist risks and embedded options risks. In addition, the impacts on NII on an FTE basis and EVE of extreme changes in interest rates are modeled, wherein the Bancorp employs the use of yield curve shocks and environment-specific scenarios.

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate Risk 

An integral component of the Bancorp&#8217;s interest rate risk management strategy is its use of derivative instruments to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in market interest rates. Examples of derivative instruments that the Bancorp may use as part of its interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps, interest rate floors, interest rate caps, forward contracts, forward starting interest rate swaps, options, swaptions and TBA securities. 

Tables 62 and 63 show all swap and floor positions that are utilized for purposes of managing the Bancorp&#8217;s exposures to the variability of interest rates. These positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed-upon amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index or to hedge forecasted transactions for the variability in cash flows attributable to the contractually specified interest rate. The volume, maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as the Bancorp adjusts its broader interest rate risk management objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. For further information including the notional amount and fair values of these derivatives, refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The following tables present additional information about the interest rate swaps and floors used in Fifth Third&#8217;s asset and liability management activities:

Additionally, as part of its overall risk management strategy relative to its residential mortgage banking activities, the Bancorp enters into forward contracts accounted for as free-standing derivatives to economically hedge IRLCs that are also considered free-standing derivatives. The Bancorp economically hedges its exposure to residential mortgage loans held for sale through the use of forward contracts and mortgage options as well. See the Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights and Price Risk section for the discussion of the use of derivatives to economically hedge this exposure. 

The Bancorp also enters into derivative contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge market risks assumed in interest rate derivative contracts with commercial customers. Generally, these contracts have similar terms in order to protect the Bancorp from market volatility. Credit risk arises from the possible inability of the counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts, which the Bancorp minimizes through collateral arrangements, approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. The Bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not being taken in providing this service to customers. These controls include an independent determination of interest rate volatility and credit equivalent exposure on these contracts and counterparty credit approvals performed by independent risk management. For further information, including the notional amount and fair values of these derivatives, refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Portfolio Loans and Leases and Interest Rate Risk 

Although the Bancorp&#8217;s portfolio loans and leases contain both fixed and floating/adjustable-rate products, the rates of interest earned by the Bancorp on the outstanding balances are generally established for a period of time. The interest rate sensitivity of loans and leases is directly related to the length of time the rate earned is established. 

The following table summarizes the carrying value of the Bancorp&#8217;s portfolio loans and leases expected cash flows, excluding interest receivable, as of March 31, 2020:

Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights and Price Risk 

The fair value of the residential MSR portfolio was $685 million and $993 million at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The value of servicing rights can fluctuate sharply depending on changes in interest rates and other factors. Generally, as interest rates decline and loans are prepaid to take advantage of refinancing, the total value of existing servicing rights declines because no further servicing fees are collected on repaid loans. The Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying

hedging strategy relative to its mortgage banking activity in order to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the value of its MSR portfolio as a result of changing interest rates.

Mortgage rates decreased during both the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 which caused modeled prepayment speeds to rise. The fair value of the MSR portfolio decreased $331 million and $57 million, respectively, due to changes to inputs to the valuation model including prepayment speeds and OAS assumptions and decreased $47 million and $27 million, respectively, due to the impact of contractual principal payments and actual prepayment activity during the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019. 

The Bancorp recognized net gains of $353 million on its non-qualifying

hedging strategy for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to $63 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. These amounts include net gains on securities related to the Bancorp&#8217;s non-qualifying

hedging strategy which were $3 million for both the three months ended March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2019. The Bancorp may adjust its hedging strategy to reflect its assessment of the composition of its MSR portfolio, the cost of hedging and the anticipated effectiveness of the hedges given the economic environment. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on servicing rights and the instruments used to hedge price risk on MSRs.

&#160;

Foreign Currency Risk 

The Bancorp may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to economically hedge certain foreign denominated loans. The derivatives are classified as free-standing instruments with the revaluation gain or loss being recorded in other noninterest income in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The balance of the Bancorp&#8217;s foreign denominated loans at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 was $766 million and $880 million, respectively. The Bancorp also enters into foreign exchange contracts for the benefit of commercial customers to hedge their exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Similar to the hedging of price risk from interest rate derivative contracts entered into with commercial customers, the Bancorp also enters into foreign exchange contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge a substantial portion of the exposure from client driven foreign exchange activity. The Bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not being taken in providing this service to customers. These controls include an independent determination of currency volatility and credit equivalent exposure on these contracts, counterparty credit approvals and country limits performed by independent risk management. 

Commodity Risk 

The Bancorp also enters into commodity contracts for the benefit of commercial customers to hedge their exposure to commodity price fluctuations. Similar to the hedging of foreign exchange and price risk from interest rate derivative contracts, the Bancorp also enters into commodity contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge a substantial portion of the exposure from client driven commodity activity. The Bancorp may also offset this risk with exchange-traded commodity contracts. The Bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not taken in providing this service to customers. These controls include an independent determination of commodity volatility and credit equivalent exposure on these contracts and counterparty credit approvals performed by independent risk management. 

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT 

The goal of liquidity management is to provide adequate funds to meet changes in loan and lease demand, unexpected levels of deposit withdrawals and other contractual obligations. Mitigating liquidity risk is accomplished by maintaining liquid assets in the form of cash and investment securities, maintaining sufficient unused borrowing capacity in the debt markets and delivering consistent growth in core deposits. A summary of certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts is included in Note 18 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s Treasury department manages funding and liquidity based on point-in-time

metrics as well as forward-looking projections, which incorporate different sources and uses of funds under base and stress scenarios. Liquidity risk is monitored and managed by the Treasury department with independent oversight provided by ERM, and a series of Policy Limits and Key Risk Indicators are established to ensure risks are managed within the Bancorp&#8217;s risk tolerance. The Bancorp maintains a contingency funding plan that provides for liquidity stress testing, which assesses the liquidity needs under varying market conditions, time horizons, asset growth rates and other events. The contingency plan provides for ongoing monitoring of unused borrowing capacity and available sources of contingent liquidity to prepare for unexpected liquidity needs and to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity. The contingency plan also outlines the Bancorp&#8217;s response to various levels of liquidity stress and actions that should be taken during various scenarios.

Liquidity risk is monitored and managed for both Fifth Third Bancorp and its subsidiaries. The Bancorp receives substantially all of its liquidity from dividends from its subsidiaries, primarily Fifth Third Bank, National Association. Subsidiary dividends are supplemented with term debt to enable the Bancorp to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet its cash obligations, including debt service and scheduled maturities, common and preferred dividends, unfunded commitments to subsidiaries and other planned capital actions in the form of share repurchases. Liquidity resources are more limited at the Bancorp, making its liquidity position more susceptible to market disruptions. Bancorp liquidity is assessed using a cash coverage horizon, ensuring the entity maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a period of sustained market disruption while meeting its anticipated obligations over an extended stressed horizon. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s ALCO, which includes senior management representatives and is accountable to the ERMC, monitors and manages liquidity and funding risk within Board-approved policy limits. In addition to the risk management activities of ALCO, the Bancorp has an Interest Rate and Price Risk Management function as part of ERM that provides independent oversight of liquidity risk management.

The Bancorp&#8217;s primary sources of funds relate to cash flows from loan and lease repayments, payments from securities related to sales and maturities, the sale or securitization of loans and leases and funds generated by core deposits, in addition to the use of public and private debt offerings. 

Table 64 of the Interest Rate and Price Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A illustrates the expected maturities from loan and lease repayments. Of the $38.6 billion of securities in the Bancorp&#8217;s available-for-sale

debt and other securities portfolio at March 31, 2020, $3.8 billion in principal and interest is expected to be received in the next 12 months and an additional $4.4 billion is expected to be received in the next 13 to 24 months. For further information on the Bancorp&#8217;s securities portfolio, refer to the Investment Securities subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A.

Asset-driven liquidity is provided by the Bancorp&#8217;s ability to sell or securitize loans and leases. In order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations and to manage liquidity, the Bancorp has developed securitization and sale procedures for several types of interest-sensitive

&#160;

assets. A majority of the long-term, fixed-rate single-family residential mortgage loans underwritten according to FHLMC or FNMA guidelines are sold for cash upon origination. Additional assets such as certain other residential mortgage loans, certain commercial loans, home equity loans, automobile loans and other consumer loans are also capable of being securitized or sold. For the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, the Bancorp sold or securitized loans and leases totaling $3.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. For further information, refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Core deposits have historically provided the Bancorp with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost

funds. The Bancorp&#8217;s average core deposits and average shareholders&#8217; equity funded 84% and 82% of its average total assets for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition to core deposit funding, the Bancorp also accesses a variety of other short-term and long-term funding sources, which include the use of the FHLB system. Certificates $100,000 and over and certain deposits in the Bancorp&#8217;s foreign branch located in the Cayman Islands are wholesale funding tools utilized to fund asset growth. Management does not rely on any one source of liquidity and manages availability in response to changing balance sheet needs.

As of March 31, 2020, $4.8 billion of debt or other securities were available for issuance under the current Bancorp&#8217;s Board of Directors&#8217; authorizations and the Bancorp is authorized to file any necessary registration statements with the SEC to permit ready access to the public securities markets; however, access to these markets may depend on market conditions. For further information on a subsequent event related to long-term debt, refer to Note 25 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

As of March 31, 2020, the Bank&#8217;s global bank note program had a borrowing capacity of $25.0 billion, of which $18.0 billion was available for issuance. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, the Bank issued and sold $1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior fixed-rate notes. Additionally, at March 31, 2020, the Bank had approximately $46.2 billion of borrowing capacity available through secured borrowing sources including the FRB and FHLB. 

Current Liquidity Position 

The global spread of COVID-19

has significantly impacted financial markets, including short-term liquidity markets and the debt capital markets. The Bancorp maintains a strong liquidity profile driven by strong core deposit funding and over $60 billion in contingent funding sources. The Bancorp is managing liquidity prudently in the current environment and maintains a liquidity profile focused on core deposit and stable long-term funding sources which allows for the effective management of concentration and rollover risk.

In the first quarter of 2020, the Bancorp experienced significant asset growth from revolving line of credit utilization, which was fully funded by core deposit growth. Additionally, the Bancorp increased its on-balance

sheet liquidity by increasing other short-term investments to $6.3 billion at March 31, 2020. Line draw activity began to stabilize during the beginning of the second quarter of 2020; however, historically strong deposit growth trends continued.

As of March 31, 2020, the Bancorp has sufficient liquidity to meet contractual obligations and all preferred and common dividends without accessing the capital markets or receiving upstream dividends from the Bank subsidiary for 24 months. 

Credit Ratings 

The cost and availability of financing to the Bancorp and Bank are impacted by its credit ratings. A downgrade to the Bancorp&#8217;s or Bank&#8217;s credit ratings could affect its ability to access the credit markets and increase its borrowing costs, thereby adversely impacting the Bancorp&#8217;s or Bank&#8217;s financial condition and liquidity. Key factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong credit quality, strong capital ratios and diverse funding sources, in addition to disciplined liquidity monitoring procedures. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s and Bank&#8217;s credit ratings are summarized in Table 66. The ratings reflect the ratings agency&#8217;s view on the Bancorp&#8217;s and Bank&#8217;s capacity to meet financial commitments.* 

* As an investor, you should be aware that a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, that it may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Additional information on the credit rating ranking within the overall classification system is located on the website of each credit rating agency.

&#160;

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT 

Operational risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human errors or misconduct or adverse external events that are neither market nor credit-related. Operational risk is inherent in the Bancorp&#8217;s activities and can manifest itself in various ways including fraudulent acts, business interruptions, inappropriate behavior of employees, unintentional failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, poor design or delivery of products and services, cyber security or physical security incidents and privacy breaches or failure of vendors to perform in accordance with their arrangements. These events could result in financial losses, litigation and regulatory fines, as well as other damage to the Bancorp. The Bancorp&#8217;s risk management goal is to keep operational risk at appropriate levels consistent with the Bancorp&#8217;s risk appetite, financial strength, the characteristics of its businesses, the markets in which it operates and the competitive and regulatory environment to which it is subject. 

To control, monitor and govern operational risk, the Bancorp maintains an overall Risk Management Framework which comprises governance oversight, risk assessment, capital measurement, monitoring and reporting as well as a formal three lines of defense approach. ERM is responsible for prescribing the framework to the lines of business and corporate functions and providing independent oversight of its implementation (second line of defense). Business Controls groups are in place in each of the lines of business to ensure consistent implementation and execution of managing day-to-day

operational risk (first line of defense).

The Bancorp&#8217;s risk management framework consists of five integrated components, including identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and independent governance reporting of risk. The corporate Operational Risk Management function within Enterprise Risk is responsible for developing and overseeing the implementation of the Bancorp&#8217;s approach to managing operational risk. This includes providing governance, awareness and training, tools, guidance and oversight to support implementation of key risk programs and systems as they relate to operational risk management, such as risk and control self-assessments, new product/initiative risk reviews, key risk indicators, Third-Party Risk Management, cyber security risk management and review of operational losses. The function is also responsible for developing reports that support the proactive management of operational risk across the enterprise. The lines of business and corporate functions are responsible for managing the operational risks associated with their areas in accordance with the risk management framework. The framework is intended to enable the Bancorp to function with a sound and well-controlled operational environment. These processes support the Bancorp&#8217;s goals to minimize future operational losses and strengthen the Bancorp&#8217;s performance by maintaining sufficient capital to absorb operational losses that are incurred. 

The Bancorp also maintains a robust information security program to support the management of cyber security risk within the organization with a focus on prevention, detection and recovery processes. Fifth Third utilizes a wide array of techniques to secure its operations and proprietary information such as Board-approved policies and programs, network monitoring and testing, access controls and dedicated security personnel. Fifth Third has adopted the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework for the management and deployment of cyber security controls and is an active participant in the financial sector information sharing organization structure, known as the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center. To ensure resiliency of key Bancorp functions, Fifth Third also employs redundancy protocols that include a robust business continuity function that works to mitigate any potential impacts to Fifth Third customers and its systems. 

Fifth Third also focuses on the reporting and escalation of operational control issues to senior management and the Board of Directors. The Operational Risk Committee is the key committee that oversees and supports Fifth Third in the management of operational risk across the enterprise. The Operational Risk Committee reports to the ERMC, which reports to the Risk and Compliance Joint Committee of the Board of Directors of Fifth Third Bancorp and Fifth Third Bank, National Association. 

The COVID-19

pandemic has created heightened operational risks and impacts to the Bancorp, including risks related to new systems and processes to support remote work strategies, new customer hardship programs and functions that cannot be fully executed by outsourced service providers. Additionally, increased external threats have increased fraud and cyber security risks. These risks are being carefully managed and monitored to ensure effective controls are in place, with appropriate oversight and governance by the second line of defense. Fifth Third has a defined pandemic plan and robust business continuity management process, which are being leveraged to support the continuity of processes across the Bank. Fifth Third&#8217;s operational risk management team has been actively engaged to oversee and evaluate business changes required to ensure continuity of critical business services with the focus on impacts to customers and Bancorp employees.

LEGAL AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT 

Legal and regulatory compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss or damage to reputation as a result of noncompliance with (i) applicable laws, regulations, rules and other regulatory requirements (including but not limited to the risk of consumers experiencing economic loss or other legal harm as a result of noncompliance with consumer protection laws, regulations and requirements); (ii) internal policies and procedures, standards of best practice or codes of conduct; and (iii) principles of integrity and fair dealing applicable to Fifth Third&#8217;s activities and functions. Legal risks include the risk of actions against the institution that results in unenforceable contracts, lawsuits, legal sanctions, or adverse judgments, which disrupt or otherwise negatively affect the operations or condition of the institution. Failure to effectively manage such risks can elevate the risk level or manifest itself as other types of key risks, including reputational or operational risk. Fifth Third focuses on managing regulatory compliance risk in accordance with the Bancorp&#8217;s integrated risk management framework, which ensures consistent processes for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting risks. The Bancorp&#8217;s risk management goal is to keep compliance risk at appropriate levels consistent with the Bancorp&#8217;s risk appetite. 

To mitigate such risks, Compliance Risk Management provides independent oversight to ensure consistency and sufficiency in the execution of the program, and ensures that lines of business, regions and support functions are adequately identifying, assessing and monitoring legal 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)

&#160;

and regulatory compliance risks and adopting proper mitigation strategies. Compliance Risk Management and the Legal Division provide guidance to the lines of business and enterprise functions, who are ultimately responsible for managing such risks associated with their areas. The Chief Compliance Officer is responsible for formulating and directing the strategy, development, implementation, communication, and maintenance of the Compliance Risk Management program, which implements key compliance processes, including but not limited to, executive- and board-level governance and reporting routines, compliance-related policies, risk assessments, key risk indicators, issues tracking, regulatory compliance testing and monitoring, and privacy. The Chief Compliance Officer partners with the Financial Crimes Division to oversee anti-money laundering processes and also partners with the Community and Economic Development team to oversee the Bancorp&#8217;s compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. 

Fifth Third also focuses on the reporting and escalation of compliance issues to senior management and the Board of Directors. The Management Compliance Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Compliance Officer, is the key committee that oversees and supports Fifth Third in the management of compliance risk across the enterprise. The Management Compliance Committee oversees Fifth Third-wide compliance issues, industry best practices, legislative developments, regulatory concerns and other leading indicators of legal and regulatory compliance risk. The Management Compliance Committee reports to the ERMC, which reports to the Risk and Compliance Joint Committee of the Board of Directors of Fifth Third Bancorp and Fifth Third Bank, National Association. 

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 

Management regularly reviews the Bancorp&#8217;s capital levels to help ensure it is appropriately positioned under various operating environments. The Bancorp has established a Capital Committee which is responsible for making capital plan recommendations to management. These recommendations are reviewed by the ERMC and the annual capital plan is approved by the Board of Directors. The Capital Committee is responsible for execution and oversight of the capital actions of the capital plan. 

Regulatory Capital Ratios 

The Basel III Final Rule sets minimum regulatory capital ratios as well as defines the measure of &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; for insured depository institutions.

The Bancorp is currently subject to a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, in addition to the minimum capital ratios, in order to avoid limitations on certain capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The Bancorp exceeded these &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; ratios for all periods presented. 

In March 2020, the FRB issued a final rule amending regulatory capital rules, capital plan rules and stress test rules. Under the final rule, the capital conservation buffer is replaced with a stress capital buffer requirement. The FRB will use the Bancorp&#8217;s supervisory stress test to determine its stress capital buffer. The FRB will provide notice to the Bancorp of its stress capital buffer requirement, which is subject to a floor rate of 2.5%, by June 30, 2020. Similar to the capital conservation buffer, the Bancorp must maintain capital ratios above the sum of its minimum risk-based capital ratios and the stress capital buffer to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The final rule is applicable to BHC&#8217;s with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets and is effective on October 1, 2020. 

In April 2018, the federal banking regulators proposed transitional arrangements to permit banking organizations to phase in the day-one 

impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13,

referred to as CECL, on regulatory capital over a period of three years. The proposed rule was adopted as final effective July 1, 2019. The phase-in

provisions of the final rule are optional for a banking organization that experiences a reduction in retained earnings due to CECL adoption as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the banking organization adopts CECL. A banking organization that elects the phase-in

provisions of the final rule for regulatory capital purposes must phase in 25% of the transitional amounts impacting regulatory capital in the first year of adoption of CECL, 50% in the second year, 75% in the third year, with full impact beginning in the fourth year.

In March 2020, the banking agencies issued an interim final rule for additional transitional relief to regulatory capital related to the impact of the adoption of CECL given the disruption in economic activity caused by the COVID-19

pandemic. The interim final rule provides banking organizations that adopt CECL in the 2020 calendar year with the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory

&#160;

capital, followed by the aforementioned three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of benefit during the initial two-year 

delay for a total five-year transition. The estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital (modified CECL transitional amount) is calculated as the sum of the day-one

impact on retained earnings upon adoption of CECL (CECL transitional amount) and the calculated change in the ACL relative to the day-one

ACL upon adoption of CECL multiplied by a scaling factor of 25%. The scaling factor is used to approximate the difference in the ACL under CECL relative to the incurred loss methodology. The modified CECL transitional amount will be calculated each quarter for the first two years of the five-year transition. The amount of the modified CECL transition amount will be fixed as of December 31, 2021 and that amount will be subject to the three-year phase out.

The Bancorp adopted ASU 2016-13

on January 1, 2020 and elected the five-year transition phase-in

option for the impact of CECL on regulatory capital with its regulatory filings as of March 31, 2020. For additional information on ASU 2016-13,

refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

On July 22, 2019, the federal banking regulators published the Regulatory Capital Simplification final rule in the Federal Register. Under the final rule, non-advanced

approach banks, such as the Bancorp, will be subject to simpler regulatory capital requirements for mortgage servicing assets, certain deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions than those currently applied. The final rule increases the deduction threshold for mortgage servicing assets, certain deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions from 10% to 25% of CET1, but increases the risk-weighted assets percentage for the non-deducted

elements from 100% to 250%. The final rule pertaining to these regulatory capital elements was effective on April 1, 2020.

The following table summarizes the Bancorp&#8217;s capital ratios as of:

Capital Planning 

In 2011 the FRB adopted the capital plan rule, which requires BHCs with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more to submit annual capital plans to the FRB for review. Under the rule, these capital plans must include detailed descriptions of the following: the BHC&#8217;s internal processes for assessing capital adequacy; the policies governing capital actions such as common stock issuances, dividends and share repurchases; and all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon. Furthermore, each BHC must report to the FRB the results of stress tests conducted by the BHC under a number of scenarios that assess the sources and uses of capital under baseline and stressed economic conditions. 

On October 10, 2019, the Federal Reserve Board adopted final rules to tailor certain prudential standards for large domestic and foreign banking organizations. Under the newly adopted tailoring rules the Bancorp is subject to category IV standards, under these standards the Bancorp is no longer required to conduct and publicly report company run stress tests pursuant to the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. As an institution subject to category IV standards, the Bancorp is subject to the FRB&#8217;s supervisory stress tests on a biennial basis, the Board capital plan rule and FR Y-14

reporting requirements. The Bancorp became subject to category IV standards on December 31, 2019, and the requirements outlined above apply to the stress test cycle that started on January 1, 2020. As noted above, the Bancorp remains subject to the Board&#8217;s capital plan rule, and its requirement to develop and maintain a capital plan, and the Board of Directors of the Bancorp must review and approve the capital plan.

On March 4, 2020, the Bancorp was informed by the FRB that the deadline to submit the required information related to its capital plan within the FR Y-14A

was extended until April 5, 2021, with the exception of the information contained in the Schedule C &#8211; Regulatory Capital Instruments. The information contained in Schedule C remained due on or before April 6, 2020, which the Bancorp submitted as required.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)

&#160;

In June of 2019, the Bancorp announced its capital distribution capacity of approximately $2 billion for the period of July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020. This includes the ability to execute share repurchases up to $1.24 billion as well as increase quarterly common stock dividends by up to $0.03 per share. These distributions will be governed under the FRB&#8217;s 2019 extended stress test process for BHCs with less than $250 billion of total consolidated assets. On March 16, 2020, the Bancorp announced it was temporarily suspending share repurchases that it had capacity to execute under the 2019 CCAR plan. The decision on share repurchases is consistent with Fifth Third&#8217;s objective to use the Bancorp&#8217;s capital and liquidity to provide support to individuals, businesses and the broader economy through lending and other important services. Fifth Third did not execute any open market or accelerated share repurchases in the first quarter of 2020. 

Dividend Policy and Stock Repurchase Program 

The Bancorp&#8217;s common stock dividend policy and stock repurchase program reflect its earnings outlook, desired payout ratios, the need to maintain adequate capital levels, the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends, the need to comply with safe and sound banking practices as well as meet regulatory requirements and expectations. The Bancorp declared dividends per common share of $0.27 and $0.22 for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

The following table summarizes the monthly share repurchase activity for the three months ended March 31, 2020:

OFF-BALANCE

SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

In the ordinary course of business, the Bancorp enters into financial transactions that are considered off-balance

sheet arrangements as they involve varying elements of market, credit and liquidity risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the Bancorp&#8217;s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Bancorp&#8217;s off-balance

sheet arrangements include commitments, guarantees, contingent liabilities and transactions with non-consolidated

VIEs. A brief discussion of these transactions is as follows:

Commitments 

The Bancorp has certain commitments to make future payments under contracts, including commitments to extend credit, letters of credit, forward contracts related to residential mortgage loans held for sale, purchase obligations, capital commitments for private equity investments and capital expenditures. Refer to Note 18 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on commitments. 

Guarantees and Contingent Liabilities 

The Bancorp has performance obligations upon the occurrence of certain events provided in certain contractual arrangements, including residential mortgage loans sold with representation and warranty provisions or credit recourse. Refer to Note 18 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on guarantees and contingent liabilities. 

Transactions with Non-consolidated

VIEs 

The Bancorp engages in a variety of activities that involve VIEs, which are legal entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities, or the equity investors of the entities as a group lack any of the characteristics of a controlling interest. The investments in those entities in which the Bancorp was determined not to be the primary beneficiary but holds a variable interest in the entity are accounted for under the equity method of accounting or other accounting standards as appropriate and not consolidated. Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on non-consolidated

VIEs.
