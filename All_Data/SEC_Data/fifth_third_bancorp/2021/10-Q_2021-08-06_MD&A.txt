Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 2) 

The following is Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of certain significant factors that have affected Fifth Third Bancorp&#8217;s (the &#8220;Bancorp&#8221; or &#8220;Fifth Third&#8221;) financial condition and results of operations during the periods included in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which are a part of this filing. Reference to the Bancorp incorporates the parent holding company and all consolidated subsidiaries. The Bancorp&#8217;s banking subsidiary is referred to as the Bank. 

OVERVIEW 

Fifth Third Bancorp is a diversified financial services company headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio. At June 30, 2021, the Bancorp had $205 billion in assets and operated 1,096 full-service banking centers and 2,369 Fifth Third branded ATMs in eleven states throughout the Midwestern and Southeastern regions of the U.S. The Bancorp reports on four business segments: Commercial Banking, Branch Banking, Consumer Lending and Wealth and Asset Management. 

This overview of MD&#38;A highlights selected information in the financial results of the Bancorp and may not contain all of the information that is important to you. For a more complete understanding of trends, events, commitments, uncertainties, liquidity, capital resources and critical accounting policies and estimates, you should carefully read this entire document as well as the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. Each of these items could have an impact on the Bancorp&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, refer to the Glossary of Abbreviations and Acronyms in this report for a list of terms included as a tool for the reader of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The abbreviations and acronyms identified therein are used throughout this MD&#38;A, as well as the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Net interest income, net interest margin, net interest rate spread and the efficiency ratio are presented in MD&#38;A on an FTE basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and leases and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. The FTE basis for presenting net interest income is a non-GAAP measure. For further information, refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of MD&#38;A. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s revenues are dependent on both net interest income and noninterest income. For both the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income provided 62% and 38% of total revenue, respectively. The Bancorp derives the majority of its revenues within the U.S. from customers domiciled in the U.S. Revenue from foreign countries and external customers domiciled in foreign countries was immaterial to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021. Changes in interest rates, credit quality, economic trends and the capital markets are primary factors that drive the performance of the Bancorp. As discussed later in the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A, risk identification, measurement, monitoring, control and reporting are important to the management of risk and to the financial performance and capital strength of the Bancorp. 

Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on assets such as loans, leases and securities, and interest expense incurred on liabilities such as deposits, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Net interest income is affected by the general level of interest rates, the relative level of short-term and long-term interest rates, changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Generally, the rates of interest the Bancorp earns on its assets and pays on its liabilities are established for a period of time. The change in market interest rates over time exposes the Bancorp to interest rate risk through potential adverse changes to net interest income and financial position. The Bancorp manages this risk by continually analyzing and adjusting the composition of its assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates, the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, the Bancorp enters into certain derivative transactions as part of its overall strategy to manage its interest rate and prepayment risks. The Bancorp is also exposed to the risk of loss on its loan and lease portfolio, as a result of changing expected cash flows caused by borrower credit events, such as loan defaults and inadequate collateral. 

Noninterest income is derived from commercial banking revenue, service charges on deposits, wealth and asset management revenue, card and processing revenue, mortgage banking net revenue, leasing business revenue, other noninterest income and net securities gains or losses. Noninterest expense includes compensation and benefits, technology and communications, net occupancy expense, equipment expense, leasing business expense, card and processing expense, marketing expense and other noninterest expense. 

COVID-19 Global Pandemic 

The COVID-19 pandemic created significant economic uncertainty and financial disruptions during the year ended December 31, 2020, which has continued into 2021. Government and public responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, including temporary closures of businesses and the implementation of social distancing protocols, have caused and continue to cause, reductions and instability in economic activity that have resulted in increased unemployment levels in certain industries and volatility in the financial markets. During the year ended December 31, 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021, low interest rates, reduced economic activity and market volatility have had the most immediate negative impacts on the Bancorp&#8217;s performance. The Bancorp is unable to estimate the extent of the impact that these factors have had on its operating results since the pandemic began and it is likely that these factors will continue to adversely impact its future operating results. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

The increased availability of COVID-19 vaccinations has begun to mitigate the public health effects of the pandemic, although there has been a rise of the Delta variant of COVID-19 and slower progress on vaccination rates, and recovery from the related economic crisis continues to disproportionately affect certain industries, geographies and demographics more than others. This uneven recovery, combined with the unprecedented nature of the government response to the pandemic, makes it difficult to predict the extent to which the pandemic will continue to adversely impact the Bancorp and its customers. Furthermore, resurgence risk remains present as new virus variants are identified. The Bancorp continues to closely monitor the pandemic and its effects on customers, employees, communities and markets. 

The Bancorp has provided a variety of relief options for both commercial and consumer customers that were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including loan covenant relief, loan maturity extensions, payment deferrals, forbearances and fee waivers. For further information about these programs, refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A included herein, and also Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

Government Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic 

Congress, the FRB and the other U.S. state and federal financial regulatory agencies have taken actions to mitigate disruptions to economic activity and financial stability resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The descriptions below summarize certain significant government actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provisions or government programs summarized. 

The CARES Act 

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (&#8220;CARES&#8221;) Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020 and has subsequently been amended several times, including by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021. Among other provisions, the CARES Act included funding for the SBA to expand lending, relief from certain U.S. GAAP requirements to allow COVID-19-related loan modifications to not be categorized as TDRs, direct stimulus payments and a range of incentives to encourage deferment, forbearance or modification of consumer credit and mortgage contracts. One of the key CARES Act programs is the Paycheck Protection Program, discussed further below, which temporarily expanded the SBA&#8217;s business loan guarantee program. 

The CARES Act contains additional protections for homeowners and renters of properties with federally-backed mortgages, including a 60-day moratorium on the initiation of foreclosure proceedings beginning on March 18, 2020 and a 120-day moratorium on initiating eviction proceedings effective March 27, 2020. Borrowers of federally-backed mortgages have the right under the CARES Act to request up to 360 days of forbearance on their mortgage payments if they experience financial hardship directly or indirectly due to the COVID-19 public health emergency. The FHA, FNMA and FHLMC independently extended their moratorium on foreclosures and evictions for single-family federally-backed mortgages through July 31, 2021. 

Also pursuant to the CARES Act, the U.S. Treasury has the authority to provide loans, guarantees and other investments in support of eligible businesses, states and municipalities affected by the economic effects of COVID-19. Some of these funds have been used to support several FRB programs and facilities described below or additional programs or facilities that are established by its authority under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act which meet certain criteria. 

FRB Actions 

The FRB has taken a range of actions to support the flow of credit to households and businesses, offset forced liquidations and restore liquidity in the financial markets. For example, on March 15, 2020, the FRB reduced the target range for the federal funds rate to 0 to 0.25% and announced that it would increase its holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities and begin purchasing agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. The FRB has also encouraged depository institutions to borrow from the discount window and has lowered the primary credit rate for such borrowing by 150 basis points while extending the term of such loans up to 90 days. Reserve requirements have been reduced to zero as of March 26, 2020. 

In addition, the FRB established a range of facilities and programs to support the U.S. economy and U.S. marketplace participants in response to economic disruptions associated with COVID-19. Through these facilities and programs, the FRB, relying on its authority under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, has taken steps to directly or indirectly purchase assets from, or make loans to, U.S. companies, financial institutions, municipalities and other market participants. 

Paycheck Protection Program 

The Bancorp is a participating lender in PPP, which is a program administered by the SBA to provide forgivable, guaranteed loans to eligible borrowers that have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As of June 30, 2021, the Bancorp held PPP loans with a carrying amount of $3.7 billion under the program. PPP loans are available to a broader range of entities than ordinary SBA loans, require deferral of principal and interest repayment, and may be forgiven if the borrower demonstrates that the loan proceeds were used for qualified payroll costs and certain other expenses. The PPP has been expanded to permit second and third rounds of funding, including for certain borrowers who have already received a PPP loan, subject to certain conditions. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

American Rescue Plan Act 

The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which was signed into law on March 21, 2021, provides additional relief for businesses, states, municipalities and individuals by, among other things, allocating additional funds for the PPP, providing a third round of economic impact payments to individuals, extending supplemental federal unemployment benefits and providing advance payments of an expanded child tax credit. The impacts of the stimulus on the Bancorp&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition are highly uncertain and will depend on future developments, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and its impact on the economy in general. 

Accelerated Share Repurchase Transactions 

During the six months ended June 30, 2021, the Bancorp entered into and settled accelerated share repurchase transactions. As part of the transactions, the Bancorp entered into forward contracts in which the final number of shares delivered at settlement was based generally on a discount to the average daily volume weighted-average price of the Bancorp&#8217;s common stock during the term of the repurchase agreements. Refer to Note 15 and Note 23 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on share repurchase activity. 

The following table presents a summary of the Bancorp&#8217;s accelerated share repurchase transactions that were entered into and settled during the six months ended June 30, 2021: 

TABLE 1: Summary of Accelerated Share Repurchase Transactions Repurchase Date Amount ($ in millions) Shares Repurchased on Repurchase Date Shares Received from Forward Contract Settlement Total Shares Repurchased Final Settlement Date January 26, 2021 $ 180 4,951,456 366,939 5,318,395 March 31, 2021 April 23, 2021 347 7,894,807 675,295 8,570,102 June 11, 2021 

LIBOR Transition 

In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the &#8220;FCA&#8221;), which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA will stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. Since then, central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, have commissioned working groups of market participants and official sector representatives with the goal of finding suitable replacements for LIBOR. The Bancorp has substantial exposure to LIBOR-based products within its commercial lending, commercial deposits, business banking, consumer lending and capital markets lines of business as well as corporate treasury function. On November 30, 2020, the Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC issued a public statement that the administrator of LIBOR announced it will consult on an extension of publication of certain U.S. Dollar (&#8220;USD&#8221;) LIBOR tenors until June 30, 2023, which would allow additional legacy USD LIBOR contracts to mature before the succession of LIBOR. The administrator then announced on March 5, 2021, that it will cease publication of 1-week and 2-month USD LIBOR on December 31, 2021, and that overnight and 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month USD LIBOR will cease to be published on June 30, 2023. Although the full impact of LIBOR reforms and actions remains unclear, the Bancorp continues to prepare to transition from LIBOR to alternative reference rates, and it is expected that a broad transition away from the use of LIBOR to alternative reference rates for new financial contracts will occur by the end of 2021. In the United States, LIBOR-priced transactions and products will transfer to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;), Prime Rate or other similar indices (collectively, &#8220;Alternative Rates&#8221;). There are risks inherent with the transition to any Alternative Rate as the rate may behave differently than LIBOR in reaction to monetary, market and economic events. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s LIBOR transition plan is organized around key work streams, including continued engagement with central banks and industry working groups and regulators, active client engagement, comprehensive review of legacy documentation, internal operational and technological readiness, and risk management, among other things, to facilitate the transition to Alternative Rates. The Bancorp has implemented certain SOFR conventions and is in the process of developing other products and transaction agreements which are based on reference rates other than LIBOR. The Bancorp has also developed a transition plan for existing LIBOR-based financial contracts that are not expected to mature or settle prior to the cessation of LIBOR publication. 

For a further discussion of the various risks the Bancorp faces in connection with the expected replacement of LIBOR on its operations, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Market Risks&#8212;The replacement of LIBOR could adversely affect Fifth Third&#8217;s revenue or expenses and the value of those assets or obligations.&#8221; in Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

Key Performance Indicators 

The Bancorp, as a banking institution, utilizes various key indicators of financial condition and operating results in managing and monitoring the performance of the business. In addition to traditional financial metrics, such as revenue and expense trends, the Bancorp monitors other financial measures that assist in evaluating growth trends, capital strength and operational efficiencies. The Bancorp analyzes these key performance indicators against its past performance, its forecasted performance and with the performance of its peer banking institutions. These indicators may change from time to time as the operating environment and businesses change. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

The following are some of the key indicators used by management to assess the Bancorp&#8217;s business performance, including those which are considered in the Bancorp&#8217;s compensation programs: 

&#8226; CET1 Capital Ratio: CET1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets as defined by the Basel III standardized approach to risk-weighting of assets 

&#8226; Return on Average Tangible Common Equity (non-GAAP): Tangible net income available to common shareholders (annualized) divided by average tangible common equity 

&#8226; Net Interest Margin (non-GAAP): Net interest income on an FTE basis (annualized) divided by average interest-earning assets 

&#8226; Efficiency Ratio (non-GAAP): Noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income 

&#8226; Earnings Per Share, Diluted: Net income allocated to common shareholders divided by average common shares outstanding after the effect of dilutive stock-based awards 

&#8226; Nonperforming Portfolio Assets Ratio: Nonperforming portfolio assets divided by portfolio loans and leases and OREO 

&#8226; Net Charge-off Ratio: Net losses charged-off (annualized) divided by average portfolio loans and leases 

&#8226; Return on Average Assets: Net income (annualized) divided by quarterly average assets 

&#8226; Loan-to-Deposit Ratio: Total loans divided by total deposits 

The list of indicators above is intended to summarize some of the most important metrics utilized by management in evaluating the Bancorp&#8217;s performance and does not represent an all-inclusive list of all performance measures that may be considered relevant or important to management or investors.

The Bancorp&#8217;s net income available to common shareholders for the six months ended June 30, 2021 was $1.3 billion, or $1.87 per diluted share, which was net of $55 million in preferred stock dividends. The Bancorp&#8217;s net income available to common shareholders for the six months ended June 30, 2020 was $193 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, which was net of $50 million in preferred stock dividends. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $1.2 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2021, an increase of $8 million compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income benefited from increases in average residential mortgage loans and average indirect secured consumer loans from the three months ended June 30, 2020. Net interest income was also positively impacted by decreases in rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities and a decrease in average long-term debt for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year. An increase in i nterest income recognized from PPP loans also positively impacted net interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2021. These benefits were partially offset by decreases in average balances in commercial and industrial loans and credit card from the three months ended June 30, 2020 and decreases in yields on average loans and leases due to the portfolio repricing to lower market interest rates. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $2.4 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2021, a decrease of $45 million compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the impact of lower market rates, which decreased the yield on total average loans and leases. In addition to market rate impacts on interest-earning assets, net interest income was also negatively impacted by decreases in average commercial a nd industrial loans, average credit card and average home equity balances from the six months ended June 30, 2020. These negative impacts were partially offset by decreases in rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income also benefited from increases in average residential mortgage loan and average indirect secured consumer loan balances and a decrease in average long-term debt from the six months ended June 30, 2020. An increase in interest income recognized from PPP loans also positively impacted net interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Net interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.63% and 2.62% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to 2.75% and 2.99% for the comparable periods in the prior year. 

The benefit from credit losses was $115 million and $288 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to a provision for credit losses of $485 million and $1.1 billion during the same periods in the prior year. Provision expense decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by factors which caused decreases in the ACL during those periods including improved economic forecasts, improved commercial and consumer credit quality and lower period-end loan and lease balances. Net losses charged off as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases were 0.16% and 0.44% for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and 0.21% and 0.44% for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. At June 30, 2021, nonperforming portfolio assets as a percent of portfolio loans and leases and OREO decreased to 0.61% compared to 0.79% at December 31, 2020. For further discussion on credit quality refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A as well as Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Noninterest income increased $91 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in other noninterest income, service charges on deposits, wealth and asset management revenue, commercial banking revenue and card and processing revenue of $37 million, $27 million, $25 million, $23 million, and $20 million, respectively. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in mortgage banking net revenue of $35 million. 

Noninterest income increased $169 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in other noninterest income, commercial banking revenue, wealth and asset management revenue, card and processing revenue, service charges on deposits and leasing business revenue of $74 million, $52 million, $33 million, $29 million, $22 million and $17 million, respectively. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in mortgage banking net revenue of $70 million. 

Noninterest expense increased $32 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in other noninterest expense and compensation and benefits expense of $29 million and $11 million, respectively. These increases were partially offset by decreases in card and processing expense and net occupancy expense of $9 million and $5 million, respectively. 

Noninterest expense increased $48 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expense of $69 million partially offset by decreases in card and processing expense, net occupancy expense and marketing expense of $10 million, $8 million and $8 million, respectively. 

For more information on net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense refer to the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&#38;A.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 

The following are non-GAAP financial measures which provide useful insight to the reader of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements but should be supplemental to primary U.S. GAAP measures and should not be read in isolation or relied upon as a substitute for the primary U.S. GAAP measures. 

The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and leases and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. 

The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of net interest income on an FTE basis, interest income on an FTE basis, net interest margin, net interest rate spread and the efficiency ratio to U.S. GAAP:

The Bancorp believes return on average tangible common equity is an important measure for comparative purposes with other financial institutions, but is not defined under U.S. GAAP, and therefore is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. This measure is useful for evaluating the performance of a business as it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measure of return on average tangible common equity to U.S. GAAP:

The Bancorp considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including the tangible equity ratio and tangible common equity ratio, in addition to capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies. These calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies for both absolute and comparative purposes. Because U.S. GAAP does not include capital ratio measures, the Bancorp believes there are no comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures to these ratios. These ratios are not formally defined by U.S. GAAP or codified in the federal banking regulations and, therefore, are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures. The Bancorp encourages readers to consider its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. 

The following table reconciles non-GAAP capital ratios to U.S. GAAP:

RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 

Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements provides a discussion of a significant new accounting standard applicable to the Bancorp. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The Bancorp&#8217;s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain accounting policies require management to exercise judgment in determining methodologies, economic assumptions and estimates that may materially affect the Bancorp&#8217;s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Bancorp&#8217;s critical accounting policies include the accounting for the ALLL, reserve for unfunded commitments, valuation of servicing rights, fair value measurements, goodwill and legal contingencies. These accounting policies are discussed in detail in the Critical Accounting Policies section of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. There have been no material changes to the valuation techniques or models during the six months ended June 30, 2021. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

STATEMENTS OF INCOME ANALYSIS 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is the interest earned on loans and leases (including yield-related fees), securities and other short-term investments less the interest incurred on core deposits (includes transaction deposits and other time deposits) and wholesale funding (includes certificates $100,000 and over, other deposits, federal funds purchased, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt). The net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets. Net interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is typically greater than net interest rate spread due to the interest income earned on those assets that are funded by noninterest-bearing liabilities, or free funding, such as demand deposits or shareholders&#8217; equity. 

Tables 6 and 7 present the components of net interest income, net interest margin and net interest rate spread for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, as well as the relative impact of changes in the average balance sheet and changes in interest rates on net interest income. Nonaccrual loans and leases and loans and leases held for sale have been included in the average loan and lease balances. Average outstanding securities balances are based on amortized cost with any unrealized gains or losses included in average other assets. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $1.2 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2021, an increase of $8 million compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income benefited from increases in average residential mortgage loans and average indirect secured consumer loan balances of $4.3 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, from the three months ended June 30, 2020. Net interest income was also positively impacted by decreases in rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities primarily driven by decreases in rates paid on average money market deposits and average interest checking deposits of 27 bps and 18 bps, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income also benefited from a decrease in average long-term debt of $3.1 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year. I nterest income recognized from PPP loans also positively impacted net interest income by $53 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to $23 million in the same period in the prior year. These benefits were partially offset by decreases in average commercial and industrial loan balances and average credit card balances of $10.3 billion and $478 million, respectively, from the three months ended June 30, 2020. Net interest income was also negatively impacted by loan portfolio repricing due to lower market interest rates, including a 63 bps decrease in yields on average indirect secured consumer loans for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $2.4 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2021, a decrease of $45 million compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the impact of lower market rates. Monetary policy actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including lowering the target range of the federal funds rate and the FRB&#8217;s bond purchase programs, have continued to adversely impact market rates since March of 2020. Yields on total average loans and leases decreased by 43 bps for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the prior year driven by decreases in y i elds on average commercial loans and average consumer loans of 40 bps and 58 bps, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year. The Bancorp has significant portfolios of floating interest rate loans (primarily LIBOR- or Prime-based) that were impacted by these decreases in yields. The Bancorp&#8217;s portfolios of fixed interest rate loans also decreased in yield as a result of increased refinance activity and lower reinvestment yields due to lower overall market rates. In addition to market rate impacts on interest-earning assets, net interest income was also negatively impacted by decreases in average commercial a nd industrial loans, average credit card and average home equity of $6.1 billion, $549 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, from the six months ended June 30, 2020. These negative impacts were partially offset by decreases in rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities primarily driven by decreases in rates paid on average interest checking deposits and average money market deposits of 40 bps and 46 bp s, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income also benefited from increases in average residential mortgage loans and average indirect secured consumer loans of $3.4 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, and a decrease in average long-term debt of $2.0 billion from the six months ended June 30, 2020. Interest income recognized from PPP loans also positively impacted net interest income by $106 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to $23 million in the same period in the prior year. 

Net interest rate spread on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.48% and 2.47% during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to 2.55% and 2.75% in the same periods in the prior year. Yields on average interest-earning assets decreased 33 bps and 72 bps for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, partially offset by decreases in rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities of 26 bps and 44 bps for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2020. 

Net interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.63% and 2.62% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to 2.75% and 2.99% for the comparable periods in the prior year. N et interest margin was negatively impacted by increases in low-yielding reserves held at the FRB reported in other short-term investments, which were primarily driven by elevated levels in average demand deposits and average interest-bearing deposits for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in the prior year. Net interest margin results are expected to remain suppressed as a result of sustained excess cash balances, which are expected to remain elevated, driven by the amount of liquidity injected into the banking system as a result of monetary and fiscal stimulus programs implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) from loans and leases decreased $81 million and $288 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 driven by the previously mentioned decreases in yields and average balances of loans and leases. For more information on the Bancorp&#8217;s loan and lease portfolio, refer to the Loans and Leases subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A. Interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) from investment securities and other short-term investments increased $1 million during the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to increases in the average balances of securities exempt from income taxes and other short-term investments, partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of taxable securities. Interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) from investment securities and other short-term investments decreased $17 million during the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to decreases in yields on average investment securities and average other short-term investments, partially offset by an increase in the average balance of other short-term investments. 

Interest expense on core deposits decreased $56 million and $188 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to decreases in the cost of average interest-bearing core deposits to 5 bps and 6 bps for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, from 27 bps and 46 bps for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020. The decreases in the cost of average interest-bearing core deposits were primarily due to the previously mentioned decreases in rates paid on average interest checking deposits and average money market deposits. Refer to the Deposits subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A for additional information on the Bancorp&#8217;s deposits. 

In terest expense on average wholesale funding decreased $32 million and $72 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to decreases in average balances of long-term debt and certificates $100,000 and over and decreases in rates paid on certificates $100,000 and over. Refer to the Borrowings subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A for additional information on the Bancorp&#8217;s borrowings. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, average wholesale funding represented 14% and 15%, respectively, of average interest-bearing liabilities, compared to 19% for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2020. For more information on the Bancorp&#8217;s interest rate risk management, including estimated earnings sensitivity to changes in market interest rates, see the Interest Rate and Price Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A.

Provision for Credit Losses 

The Bancorp provides, as an expense, an amount for expected credit losses within the loan and lease portfolio and the portfolio of unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit that is based on factors previously discussed in the Critical Accounting Policies section of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. The provision is recorded to bring the ALLL and reserve for unfunded commitments to a level deemed appropriate by the Bancorp to cover losses expected in the portfolios. Actual credit losses on loans and leases are charged against the ALLL. The amount of loans and leases actually removed from the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are referred to as charge-offs. Net charge-offs include current period charge-offs less recoveries on previously charged-off loans and leases. 

The benefit from credit losses was $115 million and $288 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to a provision for credit losses of $485 million and $1.1 billion during the same periods in the prior year. Provision expense decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by factors which caused decreases in the ACL during those periods including improved economic forecasts, improved commercial and consumer credit quality and lower period-end loan and lease balances. Provision expense was elevated in 2020 as the Bancorp increased its ACL in response to deterioration and uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, continued pressure on energy prices and the resulting impact of these factors on commercial borrowers as reflected in increased levels of commercial criticized assets. In the first and second quarters of 2021, the Bancorp decreased the ACL, reflecting credit quality and stabilization in the macroeconomic environment, aided by fiscal and monetary stimulus programs as well as the easing of government-imposed restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The ALLL decreased $420 million from December 31, 2020 to $2.0 billion at June 30, 2021. At June 30, 2021, the ALLL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases decreased to 1.89%, compared to 2.25% at December 31, 2020. The reserve for unfunded commitments increased $17 million from December 31, 2020 to $189 million at June 30, 2021. The ACL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases decreased to 2.06% at June 30, 2021, compared to 2.41% at December 31, 2020. 

Refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A as well as Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on the provision for credit losses, including an analysis of loan and lease portfolio composition, nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and other factors considered by the Bancorp in assessing the credit quality of the loan and lease portfolio and determining the level of the ACL. 

Noninterest Income 

Noninterest income increased $91 million and $169 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2020.

Commercial banking revenue 

Commercial banking revenue increased $23 million and $52 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2020. The increase for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily driven by increases in loan syndication fees and business lending fees of $20 million and $10 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in institutional sales of $10 million. The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to increases in loan syndication fees, business lending fees and institutional sales of $29 million, $14 million and $12 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in contract revenue from commercial customer derivatives of $7 million.

Service charges on deposits 

Service charges on deposits increased $27 million and $22 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2020. The increase for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year was due to increases in commercial deposit fees and consumer deposit fees of $17 million and $10 million, respectively. The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to an increase of $22 million in commercial deposit fees. 

Wealth and asset management revenue 

Wealth and asset management revenue increased $25 million and $33 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increases in private client service fees of $19 million and $28 million, respectively, and broker income of $10 million and $14 million, respectively. These increases were partially offset by decreases in institutional fees of $4 million and $7 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2020. The Bancorp&#8217;s trust and registered investment advisory businesses had approximately $483 billion and $405 billion in total assets under care as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and managed $61 billion and $49 billion in assets for individuals, corporations and not-for-profit organizations as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

Card and processing revenue 

Card and processing revenue increased $20 million and $29 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to an increase in debit and credit card interchange, partially offset by increased reward costs, all of which were driven by an increase in consumer and business card spend volume. 

Mortgage banking net revenue 

Mortgage banking net revenue decreased $35 million and $70 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to lower net mortgage servicing revenue. 

The following table presents the components of mortgage banking net revenue: 

TABLE 9: Components of Mortgage Banking Net Revenue For the three months ended June 30, For the six months ended June 30, ($ in millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Origination fees and gains on loan sales $ 81 &#160; 95 170 &#160; 176 Net mortgage servicing revenue: Gross mortgage servicing fees 59 &#160; 63 117 &#160; 130 Net valuation adjustments on MSRs and free-standing derivatives purchased to economically hedge MSRs

Origination fees and gains on loan sales decreased $14 million and $6 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily driven by decreases in gain on sale margins partially offset by gains from sales of loans that were previously repurchased from GNMA. Residential mortgage loan originations increased to $5.0 billion and $9.7 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, from $3.4 billion and $7.4 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively. 

Net mortgage servicing revenue decreased $21 million and $64 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to increases in net negative valuation adjustments of $17 million and $51 million, respectively, as well as decreases in gross mortgage servicing fees of $4 million and $13 million, respectively. Refer to Table 10 for the components of net valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio and the impact of the non-qualifying hedging strategy.

(a) Primarily reflects changes in prepayment speed and OAS assumptions which are updated based on market interest rates. 

(b) Primarily reflects changes due to realized cash flows and the passage of time. 

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, the Bancorp recognized losses of $122 million and $50 million, respectively, in mortgage banking net revenue for valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio. The valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio included a decrease of $49 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and an increase of $103 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 due to changes in market rates and other inputs in the valuation model, including future prepayment speeds and OAS assumptions. For the three months ended June 30, 2021, a decrease in mortgage rates caused modeled prepayment speeds to rise. For the six months ended June 30, 2021, an increase in mortgage rates resulted in a reduction to modeled prepayment speeds, and a tightening of the spread between mortgage rates and swap rates resulted in a decrease in the modeled OAS assumptions. The fair value of the MSR portfolio also decreased $73 million and $153 million as a result of contractual principal payments and actual prepayment activity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. 

Mortgage rates decreased during both the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, which caused modeled prepayment speeds to rise. The fair value of the MSR portfolio decreased $12 million and $343 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively, due to changes to inputs to the valuation model including prepayment speeds and OAS assumptions and decreased $58 million and $105 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively, due to the impact of contractual principal payments and actual prepayment activity. 

Further detail on the valuation of MSRs can be found in Note 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the valuation of the MSR portfolio. Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the free-standing derivatives used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio. 

In addition to the derivative positions used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio, the Bancorp acquires various securities as a component of its non-qualifying hedging strategy. The Bancorp recognized net gains of $1 million and net losses of $1 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to net gains of an immaterial amount and $3 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively, recorded in securities (losses) gains, net &#8211; non-qualifying hedges on mortgage servicing rights in the Bancorp&#8217;s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s total residential mortgage loans serviced as of June 30, 2021 and 2020 were $93.0 billion and $95.4 billion, respectively, with $71.5 billion and $78.8 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage loans serviced for others.

Leasing business revenue increased $4 million and $17 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2020. The increase for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to increases in lease remarketing fees and leasing business solutions revenue of $3 million and $2 million respectively. The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to an increase of $39 million in lease syndication fees, partially offset by a decrease of $22 million in lease remarketing fees.

Compensation and benefits expense increased $11 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in performance-based compensation. Compensation and benefits expense increased $69 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in non-qualified deferred compensation expense and performance-based compensation. Full-time equivalent employees totaled 19,402 at June 30, 2021 compared to 20,340 at June 30, 2020. 

Card and processing expense decreased $9 million and $10 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to contract renegotiations with a third-party vendor. Net occupancy expense decreased $5 million and $8 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to a reduction of leased square footage. Marketing expense decreased $8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a pause or slowdown in numerous marketing campaigns, including running less advertising, as well as the suspension of cash bonuses and other account acquisition programs.

Other noninterest expense increased $29 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in loan and lease expense, losses and adjustments and FDIC insurance and other taxes. Other noninterest expense decreased $3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreases in losses and adjustments and travel expense, partially offset by increases in loan and lease expense, FDIC insurance and other taxes and professional service fees. 

Loan and lease expense increased $15 million and $29 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to an increase in loan servicing expenses associated with the Bancorp&#8217;s purchases of certain government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans in forbearance programs. FDIC insurance and other taxes increased $6 million and $9 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily as a result of an increase in the assessment rate due to a change in asset mix as well as an increase in the assessment base. 

Losses and adjustments increased $6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in legal settlements, partially offset by a decline in credit valuation adjustments on derivatives associated with customer accommodation contracts. Losses and adjustments decreased $41 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decline in credit valuation adjustments on derivatives associated with customer accommodation contracts, partially offset by an increase in legal settlements. 

Travel expense decreased $9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to reduced business travel as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Professional service fees increased $9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by increases in consulting fees and legal fees. 

Applicable Income Taxes 

The Bancorp&#8217;s income before income taxes, applicable income tax expense and effective tax rate are as follows: 

TABLE 14: Applicable Income Taxes For the three months ended June 30, For the six months ended June 30, ($ in millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Income before income taxes $ 911 &#160; 244 1,794 &#160; 304 Applicable income tax expense 202 &#160; 49 391 &#160; 61 Effective tax rate 22.1 &#160; &#160;% 19.9 21.8 &#160; 20.4 

Applicable income tax expense for all periods presented includes the benefit from tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments, and tax credits (and other related tax benefits), partially offset by the effect of proportional amortization of qualifying LIHTC investments and certain nondeductible expenses. The tax credits are primarily associated with the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program established under 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Section 42 of the IRC, the New Markets Tax Credit program established under Section 45D of the IRC, the Rehabilitation Investment Tax Credit program established under Section 47 of the IRC and the Qualified Zone Academy Bond program established under Section 1397E of the IRC. 

The effective tax rate increased to 22.1% and 21.8% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, from 19.9% and 20.4% for the same periods in the prior year primarily related to an increase in forecasted income before income taxes.

(b) Includes $39 as of December 31, 2020 of residential mortgage loans previously sold to GNMA for which the Bancorp was deemed to have regained effective control over under ASC Topic 860, but did not exercise its option to repurchase. Refer to Note 14 for further information. 

Total loans and leases, including loans and leases held for sale, decreased $60 million from December 31, 2020. The decrease from December 31, 2020 was the result of a $2.2 billion, or 3%, decrease in commercial loans and leases, partially offset by a $2.1 billion, or 5%, increase in consumer loans. 

Commercial loans and leases decreased $2.2 billion from December 31, 2020 due to decreases in commercial and industrial loans and commercial mortgage loans, partially offset by increases in commercial leases and commercial construction loans. Commercial and industrial loans decreased $2.3 billion, or 5%, from December 31, 2020 primarily as a result of PPP loan forgiveness and paydowns in excess of loan originations. Commercial mortgage loans decreased $229 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2020 as payoffs exceeded loan originations. Commercial leases increased $284 million, or 10%, from December 31, 2020 primarily as a result of an increase in lease originations. Commercial construction loans increased $58 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2020 as draws on existing commitments exceeded payoffs. 

Consumer loans increased $2.1 billion from December 31, 2020 due to increases in indirect secured consumer loans, residential mortgage loans and other consumer loans, partially offset by decreases in home equity and credit card. Indirect secured consumer loans increased $1.5 billion, or 11%, from December 31, 2020 primarily as a result of loan production exceeding payoffs. Residential mortgage loans increased $1.4 billion, or 7%, from December 31, 2020 primarily due to increases in residential mortgage loans held for sale as the Bancorp purchased government-guaranteed loans in forbearance programs. Other consumer loans increased $38 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2020 primarily as a result of the purchase of a portfolio of point-of-sale loans. Home equity decreased $638 million, or 12%, from December 31, 2020 as payoffs exceeded loan originations. Credit card decreased $214 million, or 11%, from December 31, 2020 primarily due to seasonal paydowns on year-end balances as well as continuing impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, including accelerated paydown activity driven by the amount of fiscal stimulus programs.

Average loans and leases, including average loans and leases held for sale, decreased $5.0 billion, or 4%, for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of a $10.4 billion, or 13%, decrease in average commercial loans and leases, partially offset by a $5.5 billion, or 13%, increase in average consumer loans. 

Average commercial loans and leases decreased $10.4 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year due to decreases in average commercial and industrial loans and average commercial mortgage loans, partially offset by increases in average commercial construction loans and average commercial leases. Average commercial and industrial loans decreased $10.3 billion, or 17%, for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by continued paydowns on revolving lines of credit, partially offset by PPP loans originated since June of 2020. Average commercial mortgage loans decreased $757 million, or 7%, for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year as payoffs exceeded loan originations. Average commercial construction loans increased $495 million, or 9%, for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year as draws on existing commitments exceeded payoffs. Average commercial leases increased $118 million, or 4%, for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of an increase in lease originations. 

Average consumer loans increased $5.5 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year due to increases in average residential mortgage loans, average indirect secured consumer loans and average other consumer loans, partially offset by decreases in average home equity and average credit card. Average residential mortgage loans increased $4.3 billion, or 25%, for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in residential mortgage loans held for sale as the Bancorp purchased government-guaranteed loans in forbearance programs, partially offset by higher runoff due to payoffs exceeding loan originations. Average indirect secured consumer loans increased $2.6 billion, or 21%, for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to loan production exceeding payoffs. Average other consumer loans increased $169 million, or 6%, for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of purchases of portfolios of point-of-sale loans.

Investment Securities 

The Bancorp uses investment securities as a means of managing interest rate risk, providing collateral for pledging purposes and for liquidity risk management. Total investment securities were $39.1 billion and $38.4 billion at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The taxable available-for-sale debt and other investment securities portfolio had an effective duration o f 4.9 at June 30, 2021 compared to 4.4 at December 31, 2020. 

Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale when, in management&#8217;s judgment, they may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, changes in market conditions. Securities that management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost. Debt securities are classified as trading when bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. At June 30, 2021, the Bancorp&#8217;s investment portfolio consisted primarily o f AAA-rated available-for-sale debt and other securities. The Bancorp held an immaterial amount in below-investment grade available-for-sale debt and other securities at both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, the Bancorp recognized $7 million of impairment losses on its available-for-sale debt and 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

other securities, included in securities gains (losses), net, in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. These losses related to certain securities in unrealized loss positions that the Bancorp intended to sell prior to recovery of their amortized cost bases. The Bancorp did not consider these losses to be credit-related. 

At both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Bancorp completed its evaluation of the available-for-sale debt and other securities in an unrealized loss position and did not recognize an allowance for credit losses. The Bancorp did not recognize provision expense related to available-for-sale debt and other securities in an unrealized loss position during both the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020. 

The following table summarizes the end of period components of investment securities: 

TABLE 17: Components of Investment Securities As of ($ in millions) June 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Available-for-sale debt and other securities (amortized cost basis): U.S. Treasury and federal agencies securities $ 105 &#160; 74 Obligations of states and political subdivisions securities 18 &#160; 17 Mortgage-backed securities: Agency residential mortgage-backed securities 10,256 &#160; 11,147 Agency commercial mortgage-backed securities 18,142 &#160; 16,745 Non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities 3,276 &#160; 3,323 Asset-backed securities and other debt securities 3,764 &#160; 3,152 Other securities (a)

(a) Other securities consist of FHLB, FRB and DTCC restricted stock holdings of $33, $485 and $2, respectively, at June 30, 2021 and $40, $482 and $2, respectively, at December 31, 2020, that are carried at cost. 

On an amortized cost basis, available-for-sale debt and other securities increased $1.1 billion from December 31, 2020 primarily due to increases in agency commercial mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities and other debt securities, partially offset by a decrease in agency residential mortgage-backed securities. 

On an amortized cost basis, available-for-sale debt and other securities were 20% and 19% of total interest-earning assets at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The estimated weighted-average life of the debt securities in the available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio was 6.3 years at June 30, 2021 compared to 5.7 years at December 31, 2020. In addition, at June 30, 2021, the debt securities in the available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio had a weighted-average yield of 2.88% compared to 3.05% at December 31, 2020. 

Information presented in Table 18 is on a weighted-average life basis, anticipating future prepayments. Yield information is presented on an FTE basis and is computed using amortized cost balances and reflects the impact of prepayments. Maturity and yield calculations for the total available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio exclude other securities that have no stated yield or maturity. Total net unrealized gains on the available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio were $1.9 billion at June 30, 2021 compared to $2.5 billion at December 31, 2020. The fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. The fair value of investment securities generally increases when interest rates decrease or when credit spreads contract.

Other Short-Term Investments 

Other short-term investments primarily include overnight interest-earning investments, including reserves held at the FRB. The Bancorp uses other short-term investments as part of its liquidity risk management tools. Other short-term investments were $32.4 billion and $33.4 billion at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The decrease of $990 million from December 31, 2020 was primarily due to wholesale funding maturities during the six months ended June 30, 2021. 

Deposits 

The Bancorp&#8217;s deposit balances represent an important source of funding and revenue growth opportunity. The Bancorp continues to focus on core deposit growth in its retail and commercial franchises by improving customer satisfaction, building full relationships and offering competitive rates. Average core deposits represented 78% and 74% of the Bancorp&#8217;s average asset funding base for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

(a) Includes $310 million and $1.3 billion of institutional, retail and wholesale certificates $250,000 and over at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

Core deposits increased $4.4 billion, or 3%, from December 31, 2020 as a result of an increase in transaction deposits, partially offset by a decrease in other time deposits. Transaction deposits increased $5.0 billion, or 3%, from December 31, 2020 primarily due to increases in demand deposits and savings deposits, partially offset by a decrease in interest checking deposits. Demand deposits increased $5.0 billion, or 9%, from December 31, 2020 primarily as a result of customers maintaining increased levels of liquidity driven by the amount of fiscal and monetary stimulus, as well as growth in the number of accounts and migration of balances from interest checking deposits during the six months ended June 30, 2021. Savings deposits increased $2.4 billion, or 13%, from December 31, 2020 primarily as a result of higher balances per customer account due to the amount of fiscal stimulus as well as decreased consumer spending. Interest checking deposits decreased $2.4 billion, or 5%, from December 31, 2020 primarily as a result of lower balances per commercial customer account as well as the aforementioned balance migration into demand deposits during the six months ended June 30, 2021. Other time deposits decreased $615 million, or 20%, from December 31, 2020 primarily due to lower offering rates on certificates less than $100,000. 

Certificates $100,000 and over decreased $1.2 billion, or 58%, from December 31, 2020 primarily due to maturities which were not replaced with new issuances given current market conditions and liquidity levels. 

The following table presents the components of average deposits for the three months ended:

(a) Includes $326 million and $3.2 billion of average institutional, retail and wholesale certificates $250,000 and over for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

On an average basis, core deposits increased $15.0 billion, or 10%, for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year due to an increase of $16.7 billion, or 12%, in average transaction deposits, partially offset by a decrease of $1.7 billion, or 39%, in average other time deposits. The increase in average transaction deposits was driven primarily by increases in average demand deposits, average savings deposits and average money market deposits, partially offset by a decrease in average interest checking deposits. Average demand deposits increased $16.2 billion, or 35%, for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of commercial customers maintaining increased levels of liquidity driven by the amount of fiscal and monetary stimulus, as well as growth in the number of accounts and migration of balances from interest checking deposits. Average savings deposits increased $4.1 billion, or 25%, and average money market deposits increased $822 million, or 3%, for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of higher average balances per customer account due to the amount of 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

fiscal stimulus, uncertainty regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and decreased consumer spending. Average interest checking deposits decreased $4.5 billion, or 9%, for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of the aforementioned balance migration into demand deposits and lower average balances per commercial customer account, partially offset by higher average balances per consumer customer account due to the previously mentioned increased liquidity levels in the current economic environment in the form of excess cash balances driven by the amount of fiscal stimulus. Average other time deposits decreased primarily due to lower offering rates on certificates less than $100,000. 

Average certificates $100,000 and over decreased $2.9 billion, or 72%, for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to maturities which were not replaced with new issuances given current market conditions and liquidity levels. 

Contractual maturities 

The contractual maturities of certificates $100,000 and over as of June 30, 2021 are summarized in the following table:

Borrowings 

The Bancorp accesses a variety of short-term and long-term funding sources. Borrowings with original maturities of one year or less are classified as short-term and include federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings. Total average borrowings as a percent of average interest-bearing liabilities were 13% and 16% for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

The following table summarizes the end of period components of borrowings: 

TABLE 23: Components of Borrowings As of ($ in millions) June 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Federal funds purchased $ 338 &#160; 300 Other short-term borrowings 1,130 &#160; 1,192 Long-term debt 12,364 &#160; 14,973 Total borrowings $ 13,832 &#160; 16,465 

Total borrowings decreased $2.6 billion, or 16%, from December 31, 2020 primarily due to decreases in long-term debt and other short-term borrowings. Long-term debt decreased $2.6 billion from December 31, 2020 driven by the early redemptions under the par call options of $2.3 billion of notes and $244 million of paydowns on long-term debt associated with automobile loan securitizations during the six months ended June 30, 2021. Other short-term borrowings decreased $62 million from December 31, 2020 primarily as a result of decreased short-term funding needs given continued core deposit growth. The level of other short-term borrowings can fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on funding needs and the sources that are used to satisfy those needs. For further information on the components of other short-term borrowings, refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Total average borrowings decreased $4.3 billion, or 22%, for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreases in average long-term debt and average other short-term borrowings. Average long-term debt decreased $3.1 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by maturities of $3.4 billion and $508 million of paydowns on long-term debt associated with automobile loan securitizations since June of 2020. Average other short-term borrowings decreased $1.3 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of decreased short-term funding needs given continued core deposit growth. Information on the average rates paid on borrowings is discussed in the Net Interest Income subsection of the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&#38;A. In addition, refer to the Liquidity Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A for a discussion on the role of borrowings in the Bancorp&#8217;s liquidity management.

BUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW 

The Bancorp reports on four business segments: Commercial Banking, Branch Banking, Consumer Lending and Wealth and Asset Management. Additional information on each business segment is included in Note 22 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of the Bancorp&#8217;s business segments are presented based on its management structure and management accounting practices. The structure and accounting practices are specific to the Bancorp; therefore, the financial results of the Bancorp&#8217;s business segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial institutions. The Bancorp refines its methodologies from time to time as management&#8217;s accounting practices and businesses change. 

The Bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the corporate level. By employing an FTP methodology, the business segments are insulated from most benchmark interest rate volatility, enabling them to focus on serving customers through the origination of loans and acceptance of deposits. The FTP methodology assigns charge and credit rates to classes of assets and liabilities, respectively, based on the estimated amount and timing of cash flows for each transaction. Assigning the FTP rate based on matching the duration of cash flows allocates interest income and interest expense to each business segment so its resulting net interest income is insulated from future changes in benchmark interest rates. The Bancorp&#8217;s FTP methodology also allocates the contribution to net interest income of the asset-generating and deposit-providing businesses on a duration-adjusted basis to better attribute the driver of the performance. As the asset and liability durations are not perfectly matched, the residual impact of the FTP methodology is captured in General Corporate and Other. The charge and credit rates are determined using the FTP rate curve, which is based on an estimate of Fifth Third&#8217;s marginal borrowing cost in the wholesale funding markets. The FTP curve is constructed using the U.S. swap curve, brokered CD pricing and unsecured debt pricing. 

The Bancorp adjusts the FTP charge and credit rates as dictated by changes in interest rates for various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and by the review of behavioral assumptions, such as prepayment rates on interest-earning assets and the estimated durations for indeterminate-lived deposits. Key assumptions, including the credit rates provided for deposit accounts, are reviewed annually. Credit rates for deposit products and charge rates for loan products may be reset more frequently in response to changes in market conditions. In general, the charge rates on assets have declined since December 31, 2020 as they were affected by the prevailing level of interest rates and by the duration and repricing characteristics of the portfolio. The credit rates for deposit products also modestly declined due to lower interest rates and modified assumptions. Thus, net interest income for asset-generating business segments improved while deposit-providing business segments were negatively impacted during the six months ended June 30, 2021. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s methodology for allocating provision for credit losses expense to the business segments includes charges or benefits associated with changes in criticized commercial loan levels in addition to actual net charge-offs experienced by the loans and leases owned by each business segment. Provision for credit losses expense attributable to loan and lease growth and changes in ALLL factors is captured in General Corporate and Other. The financial results of the business segments include allocations for shared services and headquarters expenses. Additionally, the business segments form synergies by taking advantage of relationship depth opportunities and funding operations by accessing the capital markets as a collective unit. 

The following table summarizes net income (loss) by business segment:

(b) Applicable income tax expense for all periods includes the tax benefit from tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments and tax credits partially offset by the effect of certain nondeductible expenses. Refer to the Applicable Income Taxes subsection of the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&#38;A for additional information. 

Net income was $393 million and $704 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to $12 million and $237 million, respectively, for the same periods in the prior year. The increases were primarily driven by decreases in the provision for credit losses as well as increases in noninterest income and decreases in noninterest expense, partially offset by decreases in net interest income on an FTE basis. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis decreased $195 million and $340 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in yields on and average balances of commercial loans and leases as well as decreases in FTP credit rates on interest checking deposits, demand deposits and savings and money market deposits. These negative impacts were partially offset by decreases in FTP charge rates on loans and leases as well as decreases in rates paid on average interest checking deposits and average savings and money market deposits. 

The benefit from credit losses was $151 million and $227 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to a provision for credit losses of $457 million and $502 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively. The decreases for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in the prior year were primarily driven by a decrease in commercial criticized asset levels as well as decreases in net charge-offs on commercial and industrial loans and commercial leases. Net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases decreased to 4 bps and 10 bps for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to 41 bps and 35 bps for the same periods in the prior year, respectively. 

Noninterest income increased $61 million and $135 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year driven by increases in other noninterest income, commercial banking revenue and service charges on deposits. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2021 was also driven by an increase in leasing business revenue. Other noninterest income increased $24 million and $52 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increases in private equity investment income and card and processing revenue. The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2021 was also d riven by the recognition of securities gains, net of $6 million. Commercial banking revenue increased $20 million and $47 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase for the three months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily due to increases in loan syndication fees and business lending fees partially offset by a decrease in institutional sales. The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily due to increases in loan syndication fees, business lending fees and institutional sales partially offset by a decrease in contract revenue from commercial customer derivatives. Service charges on deposits increased $13 million and $19 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, c ompared to the same periods in the prior year driven by increases in commercial deposit fees primarily due to growth in volume-based service revenues, with continued benefit from lower earnings credit rates. Leasing business revenue increased $17 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to an increase in lease syndication fees partially offset by a decrease in lease remarketing fees. 

Noninterest expense decreased $6 million and $65 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year driven by d ecreases in other noninterest expense partially offset by increases in compensation and benefits. Other noninterest expense decreased $13 million and $79 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The decreases for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 reflect decreases in allocated expenses related to cash management services. The decrease for the six months ended June 30, 2021 was also due to a decline in credit valuation adjustments on derivatives associated with customer accommodation contracts. Compensation and benefits increased $7 million and $14 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily as a result of increases in incentive compensation and employee benefits expense driven by strong performance in fees related to business growth and expansion initiatives during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021. 

Average commercial loans and leases decreased $12.2 billion and $9.8 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to decreases in average commercial and industrial loans and average commercial mortgage loans partially offset by increases in average commercial construction loans. Average commercial and industrial loans decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by continued paydowns on revolving lines of credit . Average commercial mortgage loans decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in the prior year as payoffs exceeded loan originations. Average commercial construction loans increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in the prior year as draws on existing commitments exceeded payoffs. 

Average core deposits increased $1.3 billion and $8.9 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to increases in average demand deposits partially offset by decreases in average interest checking deposits. The increase for the three months ended June 30, 2021 was also partially offset by a decrease in average savings and money market deposits. The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2021 also included an increase in average savings and money market deposits. Average demand deposits increased $9.9 billion and $12.1 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily as a result of commercial customers maintaining increased levels of liquidity driven by the amount of fiscal and monetary stimulus, as well as growth in the number of accounts and migration of balances from interest checking deposits. Average interest checking deposits decreased $7.9 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily as a result of the aforementioned balance migration into demand deposits and lower average balances per commercial customer account. Average savings and money market deposits decreased $640 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of a decline in commercial customer accounts. Average savings and money market deposits increased $383 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of new customers as well as higher average balances per commercial customer account due to the amount of fiscal stimulus and economic uncertainty regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.

Net income was $40 million and $16 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to $138 million and $258 million, respectively for the same periods in the prior year. The decreases were primarily driven by decreases in net interest income partially offset by increases in noninterest income and decreases in provision for credit losses. 

Net interest income decreased $212 million and $421 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to decreases in FTP credit rates on core deposits and certificates $100,000 and over as well as decreases in average balances of credit card and home equity and decreases in yields on average other consumer loans. These negative impacts were partially offset by decreases in the rates paid on average interest-bearing deposits and a decrease in FTP charge rates on loans and leases. 

Provision for credit losses decreased $27 million and $48 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to decreases in net charge-offs on credit card, other consumer loans and home equity partially offset by increases in net charge-offs on commercial and industrial loans. The decrease in provision for credit losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in the prior year also included the impact of a decrease in commercial criticized asset levels. Net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases decreased to 102 bps and 106 bps for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to 128 bps and 143 bps, respectively, for the same periods in the prior year. 

Noninterest income increased $57 million and $65 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increases in card and processing revenue, wealth and asset management revenue, other noninterest income and service charges on deposits. Card and processing revenue increased $16 million and $28 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily as a result of an increase in consumer customer spend volume, partially offset by increased reward costs. Wealth and asset management revenue increased $13 million and $18

million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to increases in broker income and private client service fees. Other noninterest income increased $13 million and $15 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increases in cardholder fees, banking center income and decreases in net losses on disposition and impairment of bank premises and equipment. Service charges on deposits increased $15 million and $4 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year driven by increases in both commercial deposit fees and consumer deposit fees. 

Noninterest expense decreased $4 million and $1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in card and processing expense partially offset by increases in net occupancy and equipment expense. Card and processing expense decreased $9 million for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by contract renegotiations with a third-party vendor. Net occupancy and equipment expense increased $4 million and $7 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to increases in allocated occupancy costs. 

Average consumer loans decreased $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in average home equity as payoffs exceeded loan originations as well as decreases in average credit card driven by higher paydowns which were affected by the amount of fiscal stimulus. These decreases were partially offset by increases in average residential mortgage loans of $502 million and $447 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, primarily as a result of increases in loan originations. Average commercial loans increased $695 million and $690 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increases in average commercial mortgage loans and average commercial and industrial loans. 

Average deposits increased $13.4 billion and $14.0 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increases in average demand deposits, average savings and money market deposits and average interest checking deposits partially offset by decreases in average other time deposits and certificates $100,000 and over. Average demand deposits increased $6.4 billion and $7.0 billion, average savings and money market deposits increased $5.8 billion and $5.9 billion and average interest checking deposits increased $3.5 billion and $3.7 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily as a result of higher balances per customer account due to the amount of fiscal stimulus, uncertainty regarding the COVID-19 pandemic as well as decreased consumer spending. Average other time deposits and certificates $100,000 and over decreased $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to maturities on certificates greater than $100,000 as well as lower offering rates on certificates less than $100,000.

Net income was $33 million and $65 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to net income of $48 million and $107 million, respectively, for the same periods in the prior year. The decreases were primarily due to increases in noninterest expense and decreases in noninterest income partially offset by increases in net interest income and decreases in provision for credit losses. 

Net interest income increased $50 million and $88 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in FTP charge rates on loans and leases and increases in average residential mortgage loans and average indirect secured consumer loans. These increases were partially offset by decreases in yields on average residential mortgage loans and average indirect secured consumer loans as well as decreases in FTP credit rates on demand deposits. 

Provision for credit losses decreased $10 million and $15 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in net charge-offs on indirect secured consumer loans and residential mortgage loans. Net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases were an immaterial amount and 7 bps for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to 16 bps and 19 bps for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively. 

Noninterest income decreased $35 million and $77 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in mortgage banking net revenue . Refer to the Noninterest Income subsection of the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&#38;A for additional information on the fluctuations in mortgage banking net revenue. 

Noninterest expense increased $43 million and $80 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year due to increases in other noninterest expense and compensation and benefits. Other noninterest expense increased $35 million and $57 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increases in loan and lease expense, corporate overhead allocations and losses and adjustments. Compensation and benefits increased $8 million and $23 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to increases in base compensation and incentive compensation resulting from the increased mortgage origination activity for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2021. 

Average consumer loans increased $6.3 billion and $5.2 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to increases in average residential mortgage loans and average indirect secured consumer loans.

Net income was $26 million and $45 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to net income of $40 million and $64 million, respectively, for the same periods in the prior year. The decreases were primarily driven by decreases in net interest income partially offset by increases in noninterest income. The decrease for the three months ended June 30, 2021 also included an increase in noninterest expense. 

Net interest income decreased $30 million and $46 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in FTP credit rates on interest-bearing core deposits as well as decreases in yields on average loans and leases. These negative impacts were partially offset by decreases in rates paid on average interest-bearing core deposits as well as decreases in FTP charge rates on loans and leases. 

Noninterest income increased $22 million and $23 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year driven by increases in wealth and asset management revenue partially offset by decreases in other noninterest income. Wealth and asset management revenue increased $23 million and $30 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily as a result of increases in private client service fees and broker income partially offset by decreases in institutional fees. Other noninterest income decreased $1 million and $7 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to decreases in insurance income driven by the sale of the Bancorp&#8217;s property and casualty insurance business in the fourth quarter of 2020. 

Noninterest expense increased $9 million and $1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year driven by increases in other noninterest expense partially offset by decreases in compensation and benefits.

Average loans and leases increased $175 million and $170 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increases in average other consumer loans and average residential mortgage loans as a result of higher loan production partially offset by decreases in average commercial and industrial loans and average home equity as payoffs exceeded new loan production. 

Average core deposits increased $72 million and $619 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily driven by increases in average savings and money market deposits, partially offset by a decrease in average interest checking deposits as a result of fiscal stimulus and migration of balances from interest checking deposits. The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily driven by increases in average savings and money market deposits, interest checking deposits and demand deposits as a result of higher average balances per customer account due to the amount of fiscal stimulus, uncertainty regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and decreased consumer spending. 

General Corporate and Other 

General Corporate and Other includes the unallocated portion of the investment securities portfolio, securities gains and losses, certain non-core deposit funding, unassigned equity, unallocated provision for credit losses expense or a benefit from the reduction of the ACL, the payment of preferred stock dividends and certain support activities and other items not attributed to the business segments. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis increased $394 million and $672 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in FTP credit rates on deposits allocated to the business segments, increases in interest income on loans and leases and decreases in interest expense on long-term debt and deposits. These positive impacts were partially offset by decreases in the benefit related to FTP charge rates on loans and leases allocated to the business segments and a decrease in interest income on investment securities. 

The provision for credit losses was $11 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to a benefit from credit losses of $33 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020. The increase in provision expense for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily driven by the impact of the benefits provided to the business segments driven by lower commercial criticized assets owned by each business segment, partially offset by factors which caused a decrease in the ACL including improved economic forecasts, improved commercial and consumer credit quality and lower period-end loan and lease balances. The benefit from credit losses was $134 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to a provision for credit losses of $486 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. The decrease in provision expense for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily driven by factors which caused a decrease in the ACL including improved economic forecasts, improved commercial and consumer credit quality and lower period-end loan balances.

Noninterest income decreased $3 million and increased $37 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The decrease for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily driven by the recognition of securities gains of $10 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to securities gains of $21 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020 as well as an increase in the loss on the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc.

The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily driven by the recognition of securities gains of $7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to securities losses of $3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 as well as a decrease in net losses on disposition and impairment of bank premises and equipment and an increase in equity method investment income during the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year. 

Noninterest expense increased $1 million and $47 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily driven by an increase in equipment expense, a decrease in corporate overhead allocations from General Corporate and Other to the other business segments as well as an increase in technology and communications expense partially offset by a decrease in net occupancy expense. The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits, a decrease in corporate overhead allocations from General Corporate and Other to the other business segments and an increase in equipment expense partially offset by a decrease in net occupancy expense.

RISK MANAGEMENT &#8211; OVERVIEW 

Effective risk management is critical to the Bancorp&#8217;s ongoing success and ensures that the Bancorp operates in a safe and sound manner, complies with applicable laws and regulations and safeguards the Bancorp&#8217;s brand and reputation. Risks are inherent in the Bancorp&#8217;s business and are influenced by both internal and external factors. The Bancorp is responsible for managing these risks effectively to deliver through-the-cycle value and performance for the Bancorp&#8217;s shareholders, customers, employees and communities. 

Fifth Third&#8217;s Risk Management Framework, which is approved annually by the Capital Committee, ERMC, RCC and the Board of Directors, includes the following key elements: 

&#8226; The Bancorp ensures transparency and escalation of risk through defined risk policies and a governance structure that includes the RCC, ERMC and other management-level risk committees and councils. 

&#8226; The Bancorp establishes a risk appetite in alignment with its strategic, financial and capital plans. The Bancorp&#8217;s risk appetite is defined using quantitative metrics and qualitative measures to ensure prudent risk taking and drive balanced decision making. The Bancorp&#8217;s goal is to ensure that aggregate residual risks do not exceed the Bancorp&#8217;s risk appetite, and that risks taken are supportive of the Bancorp&#8217;s portfolio diversification and profitability objectives. The Board and executive management approve the risk appetite, which is considered in the development of business strategies and forms the basis for enterprise risk management. 

&#8226; The core principles that define the Bancorp&#8217;s risk appetite are as follows: 

&#9702; Act with integrity in all activities. 

&#9702; Understand the risks taken and ensure that they are in alignment with the Bancorp&#8217;s business strategies and risk appetite. 

&#9702; Avoid risks that cannot be understood, managed or monitored. 

&#9702; Provide transparency of risk to the Bancorp&#8217;s management and Board by escalating risks and issues as necessary. 

&#9702; Ensure Fifth Third&#8217;s products and services are aligned to the Bancorp&#8217;s core customer base and are designed, delivered and maintained to provide value and benefit to the Bancorp&#8217;s customers and to Fifth Third. 

&#9702; Only offer products or services that are appropriate or suitable for the Bancorp&#8217;s customers. 

&#9702; Focus on providing operational excellence by providing reliable, accurate and efficient services to meet the Bancorp&#8217;s customers&#8217; needs. 

&#9702; Maintain a strong financial position to ensure the Bancorp meets its strategic objectives through all economic cycles and is able to access the capital markets at all times, even under stressed conditions. 

&#9702; Protect the Bancorp&#8217;s reputation by thoroughly understanding the consequences of business strategies, products and processes. 

&#9702; Conduct the Bancorp&#8217;s business in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and in alignment with internal policies and procedures. 

&#8226; Fifth Third&#8217;s core values and culture provide the foundation for sound risk management practices by establishing expectations for appropriate conduct and accountability across the organization. All employees are expected to conduct themselves in alignment with Fifth Third&#8217;s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which may be found on www.53.com, while carrying out their responsibilities. Fifth Third&#8217;s Corporate Responsibility and Reputation Committee provides oversight of business conduct policies, programs and strategies, and monitors reporting of potential misconduct, trends or themes across the enterprise. Prudent risk management is a responsibility that is expected from all employees and is a foundational element of Fifth Third&#8217;s culture. 

&#8226; The Bancorp manages eight defined risk types to a prescribed appetite. The risk types are credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, price risk, legal and regulatory compliance risk, operational risk, reputational risk and strategic risk. 

&#8226; The Bancorp identifies and monitors existing and potential risks that may impact the company&#8217;s risk profile, including emerging risks that create uncertainties and/or would have broad implications if materialized (e.g. global pandemic, etc.). Enhanced monitoring and action plans are implemented as necessary to proactively mitigate risk. 

&#8226; Fifth Third&#8217;s Risk Management Process provides a consistent and integrated approach for managing risks. The five components of the Risk Management Process are: identify, assess, manage, monitor and report. The Bancorp has also established processes and programs to manage and report concentration risks, to ensure robust talent, compensation and performance management and to aggregate risks across the enterprise. 

Fifth Third drives accountability for managing risk through its Three Lines of Defense structure: 

&#8226; The first line of defense is comprised of front-line units that create risk and are accountable for managing risk. These groups are the Bancorp&#8217;s primary risk takers and are responsible for implementing effective internal controls and maintaining processes for identifying, assessing and managing the risks associated with their activities consistent with established risk appetite and limits. The first line of defense also includes enterprise-wide functions that provide information technology, operations, servicing, processing or other support. 

&#8226; The second line of defense, or Independent Risk Management, consists of Risk Management, Compliance and Credit Review. The second line is responsible for developing frameworks and policies to govern risk-taking activities, overseeing risk-taking of the organization, advising on controlling that risk and providing input on key risk decisions. Risk Management complements the front line&#8217;s management of risk-taking activities through its monitoring and reporting responsibilities, including adherence to the risk appetite. Additionally, Risk Management is responsible for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting on aggregate risks enterprise-wide. 

&#8226; The third line of defense is Internal Audit, which provides oversight of the first and second lines of defense, and independent assurance to the Board on the effectiveness of governance, risk management and internal controls.

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT 

The objective of the Bancorp&#8217;s credit risk management strategy is to quantify and manage credit risk on an aggregate portfolio basis, as well as to limit the risk of loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to honor its financial or contractual obligations to the Bancorp. The Bancorp&#8217;s credit risk management strategy is based on three core principles: conservatism, diversification and monitoring. The Bancorp believes that effective credit risk management begins with conservative lending practices which are described below. These practices include the use of intentional risk-based limits for single name exposures and counterparty selection criteria designed to reduce or eliminate exposure to borrowers who have higher than average default risk and defined weaknesses in financial performance. The Bancorp carefully designed and monitors underwriting, documentation and collection standards. The Bancorp&#8217;s credit risk management strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level as well as ongoing portfolio monitoring and timely management reviews of large credit exposures and credits experiencing deterioration of credit quality. Credit officers with the authority to extend credit are delegated specific authority amounts, the utilization of which is closely monitored. Underwriting activities are centrally managed, and ERM manages the policy and the authority delegation process directly. The Credit Risk Review function provides independent and objective assessments of the quality of underwriting and documentation, the accuracy of risk grades and the charge-off, nonaccrual and reserve analysis process. The Bancorp&#8217;s credit review process and overall assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is based on quarterly assessments of the estimated losses expected in the loan and lease portfolio. The Bancorp uses these assessments to promptly identify potential problem loans or leases within the portfolio, maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses and record any necessary charge-offs. The Bancorp defines potential problem loans and leases as those rated substandard that do not meet the definition of a nonaccrual loan or a restructured loan. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Bancorp&#8217;s credit grade categories, which are derived from standard regulatory rating definitions. In addition, stress testing is performed on various commercial and consumer portfolios utilizing various models. For certain portfolios, such as real estate and leveraged lending, stress testing is performed by Credit department personnel at the individual loan level during credit underwriting. 

The following tables provide a summary of potential problem portfolio loans and leases:

In addition to the individual review of larger commercial loans that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses, the commercial credit review process includes the use of two risk grading systems. The first of these risk grading systems encompasses ten categories, which are based on regulatory guidance for credit risk systems. These ratings are used by the Bancorp to monitor and manage its credit risk. The Bancorp also maintains a dual risk rating system for credit approval and pricing, portfolio monitoring and capital allocation that includes a &#8220;through-the-cycle&#8221; rating philosophy for assessing a borrower&#8217;s creditworthiness. A &#8220;through-the-cycle&#8221; rating philosophy uses a grading scale that assigns ratings based on average default rates through an entire business cycle for borrowers with similar financial performance. The dual risk rating system includes thirteen probabilities of default grade categories and an additional eleven grade categories for estimating losses given an event of default. The probability of default and loss given default evaluations are not separated in the ten-category regulatory risk rating system. 

The Bancorp utilizes internally developed models to estimate expected credit losses for portfolio loans and leases. For loans and leases that are collectively evaluated, the Bancorp utilizes these models to forecast expected credit losses over a reasonable and supportable forecast period based on the probability of a loan or lease defaulting, the expected balance at the estimated date of default and the expected loss percentage given a default. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for additional information about the Bancorp&#8217;s processes for developing these models, 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

estimating credit losses for periods beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period and for estimating credit losses for individually evaluated loans. 

For the commercial portfolio segment, the estimated probabilities of default are primarily based on the probability of default ratings assigned under the through-the-cycle dual risk rating system and historical observations of how those ratings migrate to a default over time in the context of macroeconomic conditions. For loans with available credit, the estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected utilization rates, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. 

For collectively evaluated loans in the consumer and residential mortgage portfolio segments, the Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models primarily utilize the borrower&#8217;s FICO score and delinquency history in combination with macroeconomic conditions when estimating the probability of default. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. The expected balance at the estimated date of default is also especially impactful in the expected credit loss models for portfolio classes which generally have longer terms (such as residential mortgage loans and home equity) and portfolio classes containing a high concentration of loans with revolving privileges (such as credit card and home equity). The estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected prepayment and utilization rates where applicable, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. The Bancorp also utilizes various scoring systems, analytical tools and portfolio performance monitoring processes to assess the credit risk of the consumer and residential mortgage portfolios. 

Overview 

The consensus outlook for economic growth in 2021 continued to improve in the second quarter of 2021 as the reopening of the U.S. economy led to an upswing in demand for consumer goods and services. Although the rise of the Delta variant of COVID-19 and slower progress on vaccinations presents some downside risk to the economic outlook in the second half of 2021, the underlying fundamentals of the economy continue to strengthen as consumers and businesses return to more normal levels of activity. With the economy gaining momentum, nonfarm payrolls increased by 850,000 in June of 2021 while wages were up 3.6% year-over-year. The robust economic growth is leading to more persistent inflationary pressures throughout the economy as supply chain constraints limit production while labor supply remains constrained due to federal economic impact payments to individuals, COVID-19 health concerns and aging demographics. 

In June 2021, the core Consumer Price Index rose 4.5% over the last 12-months, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending November 1991. At the June 2021 FOMC meeting, participants raised their 2021 core Personal Consumption Expenditures (&#8220;PCE&#8221;) inflation forecast to 3.0% from 2.2% and their risk assessment for core PCE inflation was weighted to the upside. Despite the upside risk around inflation, most meeting participants saw the increase as transitory and expected core PCE to drop back to 2% in 2022 and 2023. The FOMC also retired the language around &#8220;not talking about tapering bond purchases&#8221; and discussions have begun on when to begin tapering the monthly purchases of $80 billion of treasury securities and $40 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities. 

COVID-19 Hardship Relief Programs 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bancorp began providing financial hardship relief in March 2020 to borrowers that were negatively impacted by the pandemic and its related economic impacts. For retail borrowers, these relief programs included three-month payment deferrals for non-real estate secured and unsecured portfolios, six-month payment deferrals for home equity loans and lines of credit and six-month forbearances for residential mortgages. The Bancorp also temporarily waived fees for certain products and services, suspended initiating any new repossession actions on vehicles and suspended all residential foreclosure activity. The fee waiver, repossession suspension and payment deferral programs for non-real estate secured and unsecured and home equity loans and lines of credit were discontinued early in the third quarter of 2020. However, new programs to assist consumer customers are now being offered to meet the uniqueness of the current economic environment. These primarily include a short-term hardship program which allows for a reduced payment amount for six months with full payments resuming thereafter or placement into a loan modification program that could include permanent rate reductions or maturity extensions. In most cases, these offers were not classified as TDRs if qualified for the TDR relief provisions provided by the CARES Act. As of June 30, 2021, substantially all of these borrowers have resumed making payments except for certain residential mortgage loans which continue to be in forbearance. 

The Bancorp currently plans to continue to offer a forbearance program for its residential mortgage borrowers in alignment with the forbearances offered for federally-backed mortgage loans under the provisions of the CARES Act and GSE servicing guidance. Under the provisions of the CARES Act, borrowers with federally-backed residential mortgage loans were able to request a six-month forbearance with an option to extend the forbearance period for an additional period of up to six months. The GSEs have also permitted certain forbearances to be extended for an additional six months for a total of up to 18 months. Additionally, the Bancorp will continue to follow the specific GSE guidance for other non-forbearance COVID-19 pandemic relief programs when servicing its residential mortgage portfolio. These programs include traditional loan modifications and/or deferral of past due payments to the maturity of the loan. The Bancorp has continued to suspend residential foreclosure activity in alignment with GSE practices and will also be responsive to any legislative changes related to foreclosure activity. The foreclosure moratorium expired on July 31, 2021 but some foreclosure activity will remain suspended for a longer period in 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

certain circumstances. Also, borrowers that have not taken advantage of a forbearance to date will have until September 30, 2021 to enter into a COVID-19-related forbearance. 

The Bancorp offered a variety of relief options to its commercial borrowers that had been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. While these offers were individually negotiated and tailored to each borrower&#8217;s specific facts and circumstances, the most commonly offered relief measures included temporary covenant waivers and/or deferrals of principal and/or interest payments for up to 90 days. After the deferral program, a customer had the option to resume normal payments, enter into a formal loan modification program or restructure the loan arrangement. These relief options were discontinued in 2021. 

The following table provides a summary of portfolio loans and leases as of June 30, 2021, by class, that have received payment deferrals or forbearances as part of the Bancorp&#8217;s COVID-19 pandemic hardship relief programs:

(a) Includes loans and leases that are still in the initial payment relief period (primarily residential mortgage and home equity loans) and loans that have requested additional relief. 

(b) Excludes $803 of loans previously sold to GNMA that the Bancorp had the option to repurchase as a result of forbearance, all of which were repurchased and are classified as held for sale. 

(c) For loans which are still in an active relief period, past due status is based on the borrower&#8217;s status as of March 1, 2020, as adjusted based on the borrower&#8217;s compliance with modified loan terms. 

(d) Indirect secured consumer loans which are still in an active relief period as of June 30, 2021 are required to make payments but at a reduced amount from original contractual terms. 

As of June 30, 2021, $1.3 billion of the Bancorp&#8217;s residential mortgage loans had been enrolled in a COVID-19 forbearance program (either active or completed). These loans had a weighted-average FICO score of approximately 683 and a weighted-average origination LTV of approximately 81%. Approximately 72% of these borrowers made at least one payment since entering forbearance, and 85% of balances are reported as current as of June 30, 2021. The Bancorp had $322 million of these loans in an active relief period as of June 30, 2021 and these loans had a weighted-average FICO score of approximately 652 and a weighted-average origination LTV of approximately 83%. Approximately one third of borrowers in an active forbearance period have made at least one payment since entering forbearance and approximately 88% of the residential mortgage loans still in an active relief period have completed the initial six-month forbearance period and have requested an extended forbearance. 

Commercial Portfolio 

The Bancorp&#8217;s credit risk management strategy seeks to minimize concentrations of risk through diversification. The Bancorp has commercial loan concentration limits based on industry, lines of business within the commercial segment, geography and credit product type. The risk within the commercial loan and lease portfolio is managed and monitored through an underwriting process utilizing detailed origination policies, continuous loan level reviews, monitoring of industry concentration and product type limits and continuous portfolio risk management reporting. 

The Bancorp provides loans to a variety of customers ranging from large multinational firms to middle market businesses, sole proprietors and high net worth individuals. The origination policies for commercial and industrial loans outline the risks and underwriting requirements for loans to businesses in various industries. Included in the policies are maturity and amortization terms, collateral and leverage requirements, cash flow coverage measures and hold limits. The Bancorp aligns credit and sales teams with specific industry expertise to better monitor and manage different industry segments of the portfolio. 

Certain industries have experienced increased stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These include consumer-driven industries that require gathering or congregation such as leisure and recreation (including casinos, restaurants, sports, fitness, hotels and other industries), non-essential retail and leisure travel (primarily including airlines and cruise lines). Certain segments of the healthcare industry (including skilled

nursing, physician offices and surgery/outpatient centers, among others) have also been impacted by the pandemic given delays and restrictions on in-person visits and elective procedures. 

The following table presents industries impacted the most severely within the Bancorp&#8217;s commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loan portfolios as of June 30, 2021:

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

The origination policies for commercial real estate outline the risks and underwriting requirements for owner and nonowner-occupied and construction lending. Included in the policies are maturity and amortization terms, maximum LTVs, minimum debt service coverage ratios, construction loan monitoring procedures, appraisal requirements, pre-leasing requirements (as applicable), pro forma analysis requirements and interest rate sensitivity. The Bancorp requires a valuation of real estate collateral, which may include third-party appraisals, be performed at the time of origination and renewal in accordance with regulatory requirements and on an as-needed basis when market conditions justify. Although the Bancorp does not back test these collateral value assumptions, the Bancorp maintains an appraisal review department to order and review third-party appraisals in accordance with regulatory requirements. Collateral values on criticized assets with relationships exceeding $1 million are reviewed quarterly to assess the appropriateness of the value ascribed in the assessment of charge-offs and specific reserves. 

The Bancorp assesses all real estate and non-real estate collateral securing a loan and considers all cross-collateralized loans in the calculation of the LTV ratio. The following tables provide detail on the most recent LTV ratios for commercial mortgage loans greater than $1 million, excluding commercial mortgage loans that are individually evaluated. The Bancorp does not typically aggregate the LTV ratios for commercial mortgage loans less than $1 million.

Consumer Portfolio 

Consumer credit risk management utilizes a framework that encompasses consistent processes for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting credit risk. These processes are supported by a credit risk governance structure that includes Board oversight, policies, risk limits and risk committees. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s consumer portfolio is materially comprised of five categories of loans: residential mortgage loans, home equity, indirect secured consumer loans, credit card and other consumer loans. The Bancorp has identified certain credit characteristics within these five categories of loans which it believes represent a higher level of risk compared to the rest of the consumer loan portfolio. The Bancorp does not update LTVs for the consumer portfolio subsequent to origination except as part of the charge-off process for real estate secured loans. Credit risk management continues to closely monitor the indirect secured consumer portfolio performance, which includes automobile loans. The automobile market has exhibited industry-wide gradual loosening of credit standards such as lower FICOs, longer terms and higher LTVs. The Bancorp has adjusted credit standards focused on improving risk-adjusted returns while maintaining credit risk tolerance. The Bancorp actively manages the automobile portfolio through concentration limits, which mitigate credit risk through limiting the exposure to lower FICO scores, higher advance rates and extended term originations. 

The Bancorp enhanced its credit underwriting guidelines across the entire consumer portfolio in response to the economic stress created by the COVID-19 pandemic. As the economic environment stabilizes, the current set of credit guidelines have generally returned to pre-pandemic levels as the Bancorp continues to ensure that underwriting standards reflect forward-looking outlooks on both risks and market opportunities, support strategic objectives, provide value to consumers and ensure adherence to risk appetite. 

Residential mortgage portfolio 

The Bancorp manages credit risk in the residential mortgage portfolio through underwriting guidelines that limit exposure to higher LTVs and lower FICO scores. Additionally, the portfolio is governed by concentration limits that ensure geographic, product and channel diversification. The Bancorp may also package and sell loans in the portfolio. 

The Bancorp does not originate residential mortgage loans that permit customers to defer principal payments or make payments that are less than the accruing interest. The Bancorp originates both fixed-rate and ARM loans. Within the ARM portfolio, approximately $529 million of ARM loans will have rate resets during the next twelve months. Of these resets, 4% are expected to experience an increase in rate, with an average increase of approximately 0.23%. Underlying characteristics of these borrowers are relatively strong with a weighted average origination DTI of 32% and weighted average origination LTV of 71%. 

Certain residential mortgage products have contractual features that may increase credit exposure to the Bancorp in the event of a decline in housing values. These types of mortgage products offered by the Bancorp include loans with high LTVs, multiple loans secured by the same collateral that when combined result in an LTV greater than 80% and interest-only loans. The Bancorp has deemed residential mortgage loans with greater than 80% LTVs and no mortgage insurance as loans that represent a higher level of risk. 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bancorp is following GSE guidance regarding forbearance and foreclosure regulations which currently allow up to 18 months of forbearance. The foreclosure moratorium expired on July 31, 2021 but some foreclosure activity will remain suspended for a longer period in certain circumstances. Also, borrowers that have not taken advantage of a forbearance to date will have until September 30, 2021 to enter into a COVID-19-related forbearance.

Home equity portfolio 

The Bancorp&#8217;s home equity portfolio is primarily comprised of home equity lines of credit. Beginning in the first quarter of 2013, the Bancorp&#8217;s newly originated home equity lines of credit have a 10-year interest-only draw period followed by a 20-year amortization period. The home equity line of credit previously offered by the Bancorp was a revolving facility with a 20-year term, minimum payments of interest-only and a balloon payment of principal at maturity. Peak maturity years for the balloon home equity lines of credit are 2025 to 2028 and approximately 21 % of the balances mature before 2025. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

The ALLL provides coverage for expected losses in the home equity portfolio. The allowance attributable to the portion of the home equity portfolio that has not been restructured in a TDR is determined on a pooled basis using a probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default model framework to generate expected losses. The expected losses for the home equity portfolio are dependent upon loan delinquency, FICO scores, LTV, loan age and their historical correlation with macroeconomic variables including unemployment and the home price index. The expected losses generated from models are adjusted by certain qualitative adjustment factors to reflect risks associated with current conditions and trends. The qualitative factors include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, economic conditions, portfolio mix, lending and risk management personnel, results of internal audit and quality control reviews, collateral values and geographic concentrations. 

The home equity portfolio is managed in two primary groups: loans outstanding with a combined LTV greater than 80% and those loans with an LTV of 80% or less based upon appraisals at origination. For additional information on these loans, refer to Table 43 and Table 44. Of the total $ 4.5 billion of outstanding home equity loans: 

&#9679; 81 % reside within the Bancorp&#8217;s Midwest footprint of Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, Indiana and Illinois as of June 30, 2021; 

&#9679; 40 % are in senior lien positions and 60% are in junior lien positions at June 30, 2021; 

&#9679; 79% of non-delinquent borrowers made at least one payment greater than the minimum payment during the three months ended June 30, 2021; and 

&#9679; The portfolio had a weighted average refreshed FICO score of 748 at June 30, 2021. 

The Bancorp actively manages lines of credit and makes adjustments in lending limits when it believes it is necessary based on FICO score deterioration and property devaluation. The Bancorp does not routinely obtain appraisals on performing loans to update LTVs after origination. However, the Bancorp monitors the local housing markets by reviewing various home price indices and incorporates the impact of the changing market conditions in its ongoing credit monitoring processes. For junior lien home equity loans which become 60 days or more past due, the Bancorp tracks the performance of the senior lien loans in which the Bancorp is the servicer and utilizes consumer credit bureau attributes to monitor the status of the senior lien loans that the Bancorp does not service. If the senior lien loan is found to be 120 days or more past due, the junior lien home equity loan is placed on nonaccrual status unless both loans are well-secured and in the process of collection. Additionally, if the junior lien home equity loan becomes 120 days or more past due and the senior lien loan is also 120 days or more past due, the junior lien home equity loan is assessed for charge-off. Refer to the Analysis of Nonperforming Assets subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A for more information.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)

Indirect secured consumer portfolio 

The indirect secured consumer portfolio is comprised of $14.1 billion of automobile loans and $1.1 billion of indirect motorcycle, powersport, recreational vehicle and marine loans as of June 30, 2021. The concentration of lower FICO (&#8804;659) origination balances remained within targeted credit risk tolerance during the six months ended June 30, 2021. All concentration and guideline changes are monitored monthly to ensure alignment with original credit performance and return projections.

The following table provides an analysis of indirect secured consumer portfolio loans outstanding disaggregated based upon FICO score at origination as of:

As of June 30, 2021, 94% of the indirect secured consumer loan portfolio is comprised of automobile loans, powersport loans and motorcycle loans. It is a common industry practice to advance on these types of loans an amount in excess of the collateral value due to the inclusion of negative equity trade-in, maintenance/warranty products, taxes, title and other fees paid at closing. The Bancorp monitors its exposure to these higher risk loans. The remainder of the indirect secured consumer loan portfolio is comprised of marine and recreational vehicle loans. The Bancorp&#8217;s credit policies limit the maximum advance rate on these to 100% of collateral value.

Other consumer portfolio loans 

Other consumer portfolio loans are comprised of secured and unsecured loans originated through the Bancorp&#8217;s branch network as well as point-of-sale loans originated or purchased in connection with third-party financial technology companies. The Bancorp had $269 million in unfunded commitments associated with loans originated in connection with third-party financial technology companies as of June 30, 2021. The Bancorp closely monitors the credit performance of point-of-sale loans. Loans originated in connection with third-party financial technology companies are impacted by certain credit loss protection coverage provided by those companies.

Analysis of Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and leases for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of the principal and/or interest is uncertain; restructured commercial, credit card and certain consumer loans which have not yet met the requirements to be classified as a performing asset; restructured consumer loans which are 90 days past due based on the restructured terms unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection; and certain other assets, including OREO and other repossessed property. A summary of nonperforming assets is included in Table 51. For further information on the Bancorp&#8217;s policies related to accounting for delinquent and nonperforming loans and leases, refer to the Nonaccrual Loans and Leases section of Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

Nonperforming assets were $697 million at June 30, 2021 compared to $870 million at December 31, 2020. At June 30, 2021, $40 million of nonaccrual loans were held for sale, compared to $6 million at December 31, 2020. 

Nonperforming portfolio assets as a percent of portfolio loans and leases and OREO were 0.61% as of June 30, 2021 compared to 0.79% as of December 31, 2020. Nonaccrual loans and leases secured by real estate were 32% of nonaccrual loans and leases as of June 30, 2021 compared to 36% as of December 31, 2020. 

Portfolio commercial nonaccrual loans and leases were $409 million at June 30, 2021, a decrease of $229 million from December 31, 2020. Portfolio consumer nonaccrual loans were $212 million at June 30, 2021, an increase of $16 million from December 31, 2020. Refer to Table 52 for a rollforward of the portfolio nonaccrual loans and leases. 

OREO and other repossessed property was $36 million and $30 million at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The Bancorp recognized an immaterial amount and $1 million in losses on the transfer, sale or write-down of OREO properties for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $6 million in losses on the transfer, sale or write-down of OREO properties for both the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. 

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, approximately $8 million and $18 million, respectively, of interest income would have been recognized if the nonaccrual and renegotiated loans and leases on nonaccrual status had been current in accordance with their original terms compared to $9 million and $17 million in the same periods in the prior year. Although these values help demonstrate the costs of carrying nonaccrual credits, the Bancorp does not expect to recover the full amount of interest as nonaccrual loans and leases are generally carried below their principal balance.

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

A loan is accounted for as a TDR if the Bancorp, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. TDRs include concessions granted under reorganization, arrangement or other provisions of the Federal Bankruptcy Act. A TDR typically involves a modification of terms such as a reduction of the stated interest rate or remaining principal amount of the loan, a reduction of accrued interest or an extension of the maturity date at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for a new loan with similar risk. 

At the time of modification, the Bancorp maintains certain consumer loan TDRs (including certain residential mortgage loans, home equity loans and other consumer loans) on accrual status, provided there is reasonable assurance of repayment and performance according to the modified terms based upon a current, well-documented credit evaluation. Loans discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower are classified as collateral-dependent TDRs and placed on nonaccrual status regardless of the borrower&#8217;s payment history or capacity to repay in the future. These loans are returned to accrual status provided there is a sustained payment history of twelve months after bankruptcy and collectability is reasonably assured for all remaining contractual payments. Commercial loans modified as part of a TDR are maintained on accrual status provided there is a sustained payment history of six months or greater prior to the modification in accordance with the modified terms and all remaining contractual payments under the modified terms are reasonably assured of collection. TDRs of commercial loans and credit card loans that do not have a sustained payment history of six months or greater in accordance with the modified terms remain on nonaccrual status until a six-month payment history is sustained. Refer to the Regulatory Developments Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic section of Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for additional information on loans that were modified related to the COVID-19 pandemic but not classified as TDRs. 

Consumer restructured loans on accrual status totaled $699 million and $796 million at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. As of June 30, 2021, the percentages of restructured residential mortgage loans, home equity loans and credit card loans that were past due 30 days or more from their modified terms were 28%, 19% and 24%, respectively.

Analysis of Net Loan Charge-offs 

Net charge-offs were 16 bps and 44 bps of average portfolio loans and leases for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and were 21 bps and 44 bps of average portfolio loans and leases for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Table 56 provides a summary of credit loss experience and net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases outstanding by loan category. 

The ratio of commercial loan and lease net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio commercial loans and leases decreased to 10 bps and 14 bps during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to 40 bps and 36 bps during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in net charge-offs on commercial and industrial loans of $52 million and $75 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. Additionally, there were net recoveries on commercial leases of $2 million for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to net charge-offs on commercial leases of $11 million and $16 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively. 

The ratio of consumer loan net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio consumer loans decreased to 26 bps and 34 bps during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to 52 bps and 59 bps during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in net charge-offs on credit card loans of $14 million and $26 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, and decreases in net charge-offs on indirect secured consumer loans of $7 million and $11 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The decrease for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 included the impact of government stimulus programs and the Bancorp&#8217;s hardship programs. Additionally, the Bancorp continued to see increased used car values through the second quarter of 2021 which has directly impacted loss severity.

(a) For the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, the Bancorp recorded $8 and $18, respectively, in both losses charged-off and recoveries of losses previously charged-off related to customer defaults on point-of-sale consumer loans for which the Bancorp obtained recoveries under third-party credit enhancements. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, the Bancorp recorded $9 and $22, respectively, in both losses charged-off and recoveries of losses previously charged-off related to customer defaults on point-of-sale consumer loans for which the Bancorp obtained recoveries under third-party credit enhancements. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses is comprised of the ALLL and the reserve for unfunded commitments. As described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Bancorp maintains the ALLL to absorb the amount of credit losses that are expected to be incurred over the remaining contractual terms of the related loans and leases (as adjusted for prepayments and reasonably expected TDRs). The Bancorp&#8217;s methodology for determining the ALLL includes an estimate of expected credit losses on a collective basis for groups of loans and leases with similar risk characteristics and 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

specific allowances for loans and leases which are individually evaluated. For collectively evaluated loans and leases, the Bancorp uses quantitative models to forecast expected credit losses based on the probability of a loan or lease defaulting, the expected balance at the estimated date of default and the expected loss percentage given a default. The Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models consider historical credit loss experience, current market and economic conditions, and forecasted changes in market and economic conditions if such forecasts are considered reasonable and supportable. 

The Bancorp also considers qualitative factors in determining the ALLL. Qualitative adjustments are used to capture characteristics in the portfolio that impact expected credit losses which are not fully captured within the Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models. These factors include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, lending and risk management personnel and results of internal audit and quality control reviews. In addition, the qualitative adjustment framework can be utilized to address specific idiosyncratic risks such as geopolitical events, natural disasters or changes in current economic conditions that are not reflected in the quantitative credit loss models, and their effects on regional borrowers and changes in product structures. Qualitative factors may also be used to address the impacts of unforeseen events on key inputs and assumptions within the Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models, such as the reasonable and supportable forecast period, changes to historical loss information or changes to the reversion period or methodology. 

In addition to the ALLL, the Bancorp maintains a reserve for unfunded commitments recorded in other liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The methodology used to determine the adequacy of this reserve is similar to the Bancorp&#8217;s methodology for determining the ALLL. The provision for unfunded commitments is included in the provision for credit losses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 

For the commercial portfolio segment, the estimates for probability of default are primarily based on internal ratings assigned to each commercial borrower on a 13-point scale and historical observations of how those ratings migrate to a default over time in the context of macroeconomic conditions. For loans with available credit, the estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected utilization rates, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. 

For collectively evaluated loans in the consumer and residential mortgage portfolio segments, the Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models primarily utilize the borrower&#8217;s FICO score and delinquency history in combination with macroeconomic conditions when estimating the probability of default. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. The expected balance at the estimated date of default is also especially impactful in the expected credit loss models for portfolio classes which generally have longer terms (such as residential mortgage loans and home equity) and portfolio classes containing a high concentration of loans with revolving privileges (such as credit card and home equity). The estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected prepayment and utilization rates where applicable, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. 

Day 1 Adoption Impact 

Upon adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, the Bancorp used three forward-looking economic scenarios during the reasonable and supportable forecast period in its expected credit loss models to address the inherent imprecision in macroeconomic forecasting. Each of the three scenarios was developed by a third party that is subject to the Bancorp&#8217;s Third-Party Risk Management program including oversight by the Bancorp&#8217;s independent model risk management group. The scenarios included a most likely outcome (Baseline) and two less probable scenarios with one being more favorable than the Baseline and the other being less favorable. The more favorable alternative scenario (Upside) depicted a stronger near-term growth outlook while the less favorable outlook (Downside) depicted a moderate recession. The Baseline scenario was assigned a probability weighting of 80% with each of the Upside and Downside scenarios being assigned a 10% weighting. 

The Baseline scenario was developed such that the expectation is that the economy will perform better than the projection 50% of the time and worse than the projection 50% of the time. The Upside scenario was developed such that there is a 10% probability that the economy will perform better than the projection and a 90% probability that it will perform worse. The Downside scenario was developed such that there is a 90% probability that the economy will perform better than the projection and a 10% probability that it will perform worse. 

June 30, 2021 ACL 

The ACL as of June 30, 2021 was impacted by several factors, including improvement in both the economic outlook and credit quality. As a result of these factors, the Bancorp incorporated a combination of quantitative model-based estimates and qualitative adjustments. For the quantitative estimates, the Bancorp incorporated three scenarios developed by the third party in May 2021 that included estimates of the expected impacts of the changes in economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Baseline scenario was assigned a probability weighting of 60%, with a more favorable scenario (Upside) assigned a probability weighting of 20% and a less favorable scenario (Downside) assigned a probability of 20%. The Baseline scenario assumed that a &#8220;Build Back Better&#8221; program will be passed in late 2021, with implementation early next year. In 2021, real GDP is expected to rise 6.8%, while real consumer spending is forecast to increase 10.7% at an annualized rate. The Baseline scenario also assumes an average unemployment rate of 4.5% in the fourth quarter of 2021, decreasing to 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

3.7% in 2022. The Upside scenario assumes a faster than expected boost in consumer sentiment and spending as a result of the government stimulus programs. On an average annual basis, the change in real GDP is 7.3% in 2021 and 6.5% in 2022, and a full-employment rate is expected to be achieved by the third quarter of 2021. The Downside scenario excludes any additional stimulus package beyond the American Rescue Plan passed in March 2021. Real GDP declines through the first quarter of 2022, and the unemployment rate peaks at 9.2% in the third quarter of 2022 with full-employment not reached until the third quarter of 2026. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s quantitative credit loss models are sensitive to changes in economic forecast assumptions over the reasonable and supportable forecast period. Applying a 100% probability weighting to the Downside scenario rather than using the probability-weighted three scenario approach would result in an increase in the quantitative ACL of approximately $763 million. This sensitivity calculation only reflects the impact of changing the probability weighting of the scenarios in the quantitative credit loss models and excludes any additional considerations associated with the qualitative component of the ACL that might be warranted if probability weights were adjusted. 

At June 30, 2021, the qualitative component of the ACL included consideration of certain factors that represent emerging risks specifically associated with the current economic environment and the COVID-19 pandemic. These considerations resulted in qualitative adjustments to increase the ACL, primarily related to volatility in short-term unemployment rates, commercial borrowers experiencing prolonged distress, commercial borrowers in certain industries which have been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and consumer borrowers that deferred contractual payments under COVID-19 forbearance or hardship programs.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

INTEREST RATE AND PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT 

Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from movement of interest rates. This risk primarily impacts the Bancorp&#8217;s income categories through changes in interest income on earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, and through fee items that are related to interest sensitive activities such as mortgage origination and servicing income and through earnings credits earned on commercial deposits that offset commercial deposit fees. Price risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from changes in the value of financial instruments and portfolios due to movements in interest rates, volatilities, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices. Management considers interest rate risk a prominent market risk in terms of its potential impact on earnings. Interest rate risk may occur for any one or more of the following reasons: 

&#8226; Assets and liabilities mature or reprice at different times; 

&#8226; Short-term and long-term market interest rates change by different amounts; or 

&#8226; The expected maturities of various assets or liabilities shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. 

In addition to the direct impact of interest rate changes on NII and interest-sensitive fees, interest rates can impact earnings through their effect on loan and deposit demand, credit losses, mortgage origination volumes, the value of servicing rights and other sources of the Bancorp&#8217;s earnings. Changes in interest rates and other market factors can impact earnings through changes in the value of portfolios, if not appropriately hedged. Stability of the Bancorp&#8217;s net income is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk and to a lesser extent price risk. Management continually reviews the Bancorp&#8217;s on- and off-balance sheet composition, earnings flows, and hedging strategies and models interest rate risk and price risk exposures, and possible actions to manage these risks, given numerous possible future interest rate and market factor scenarios. A series of Policy Limits and Key Risk Indicators are employed to ensure that risks are managed within the Bancorp&#8217;s risk tolerance for interest rate risk and price risk. 

In addition to the traditional forms of interest rate risk discussed in this section, the Bancorp is exposed to interest rate risk associated with the retirement and replacement of LIBOR. For more information on the LIBOR transition, refer to the Overview section of MD&#38;A. 

The Commercial and Wealth and Asset Management lines of business manage price risk for capital markets sales and trading activities related to their respective businesses. The Mortgage line of business manages price risk for the origination and sale of conforming residential mortgage loans to government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises. The Bancorp&#8217;s Treasury department manages interest rate risk and price risk for all other activities. Independent oversight is provided by ERM, and key risk indicators and Board-approved policy limits are used to ensure risks are managed within the Bancorp&#8217;s risk tolerance. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s Market Risk Management Committee, which includes senior management representatives, is accountable to the ERMC, provides oversight and monitors price risk for the capital markets sales and trading activities. The Bancorp&#8217;s ALCO, which includes senior management representatives and is accountable to the ERMC, provides oversight and monitors interest rate and price risks for Mortgage and Treasury activities. 

Net Interest Income Sensitivity 

The Bancorp employs a variety of measurement techniques to identify and manage its interest rate risk, including the use of an NII simulation model to analyze the sensitivity of NII to changes in interest rates. The model is based on contractual and estimated cash flows and repricing characteristics for all of the Bancorp&#8217;s assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet exposures and incorporates market-based assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and attrition rates of certain liabilities. The model also includes senior management&#8217;s projections of the future volume and pricing of each of the product lines offered by the Bancorp as well as other pertinent assumptions. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, deviations from projected assumptions as well as from changes in market conditions and management strategies. 

As of June 30, 2021, the Bancorp&#8217;s interest rate risk exposure is governed by a risk framework that utilizes the change in NII over 12-month and 24-month horizons assuming a 200 bps parallel ramped increase in interest rates. Given the unlikely probability associated with a potential negative rate environment, the Bancorp does not have a policy limit for scenarios that include negative rates. Therefore, the Bancorp has no policy limit for a scenario with a decrease in interest rates currently in effect as the Federal Funds target range is currently between zero and 25 basis points. However, the Bancorp routinely analyzes various potential and extreme scenarios, including parallel ramps and shocks as well as steepening and other non-parallel shifts in rates, including negative rate scenarios, to assess where risks to net interest income persist or develop as changes in the balance sheet and market rates evolve. Additionally, the Bancorp routinely evaluates its exposures to changes in the bases between interest rates. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant changes to interest rates, volatilities and the composition of the Bancorp&#8217;s balance sheet, including significant increases in deposit funding related to stimulus programs, which has resulted in an excess liquidity position. The excess liquidity is likely to continue negatively impacting net interest margin if short-term interest rates hold steady or move lower but may be partially offset by the amortization of fees related to PPP loans and investment opportunities should the yield curve steepen. 

In order to recognize the risk of noninterest-bearing demand deposit balance run-off in a rising interest rate environment, the Bancorp&#8217;s NII sensitivity modeling assumes that approximately $5 billion of additional demand deposit balances run-off over 24 months above what is 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

included in senior management&#8217;s baseline projections for each 100 bps increase in short-term market interest rates. Similarly, the Bancorp&#8217;s NII sensitivity modeling incorporates approximately $5 billion of incremental growth in noninterest-bearing deposit balances over 24 months above senior management&#8217;s baseline projections for each 100 bps decrease in short-term market interest rates. The incremental balance run-off and growth are modeled to flow into and out of funding products that reprice in conjunction with short-term market rate changes and reflect the Bank&#8217;s excess liquidity position. 

Another important deposit modeling assumption is the amount by which interest-bearing deposit rates will increase or decrease when market interest rates increase or decrease. This deposit repricing sensitivity is known as the beta, and it represents the expected amount by which Bancorp deposit rates will change for a given change in short-term market rates. At June 30, 2021, the modeling assumed a weighted-average rising-rate interest-bearing deposit beta of 37%, which is aligned with the portfolio&#8217;s experience in the last rate hike cycle. In the event of further rate cuts by the FRB into negative territory, the Bancorp&#8217;s NII sensitivity modeling assumes a weighted-average falling-rate interest-bearing deposit beta of 32% at June 30, 2021, while maintaining that deposit rates themselves will not become negative. In addition, the modeling assumes there is no lag between the timing of changes in market rates and the timing of deposit repricing despite such timing lags having occurred in prior rate cycles. 

The Bancorp continually evaluates the sensitivity of its interest rate risk measures to these important deposit modeling assumptions. The Bancorp also regularly monitors the sensitivity of other important modeling assumptions, such as loan and security prepayments and early withdrawals on fixed-rate customer liabilities. 

The following table shows the Bancorp&#8217;s estimated NII sensitivity profile and ALCO policy limits as of: 

TABLE 59: Estimated NII Sensitivity Profile and ALCO Policy Limits June 30, 2021 June 30, 2020 % Change in NII (FTE) ALCO Policy Limit % Change in NII (FTE) ALCO Policy Limit Change in Interest Rates (bps) 12 Months 13-24 Months 12 Months 13-24 Months 12 Months 13-24 Months 12 Months 13-24 Months +200 Ramp over 12 months 10.79 &#160; &#160;% 22.38 &#160; (4.00) (6.00) 1.98 7.26 (4.00) (6.00) +100 Ramp over 12 months 5.64 &#160; 12.37 &#160; N/A N/A 1.02 3.88 N/A N/A 

-25 Ramp over 3 months (2.06) (3.15) N/A N/A (1.64) (2.53) N/A N/A 

At June 30, 2021, the Bancorp&#8217;s NII would benefit significantly in both year one and year two under the parallel rate ramp increases. The Bancorp maintains an asymmetric NII sensitivity profile, which is attributable to the level of floating-rate assets, including the predominantly floating-rate commercial loan portfolio, exceeding the level of floating-rate liabilities due to the increased amount of deposit rates near zero in this low interest rate environment and other fixed-rate borrowings. Reductions in the yield of the commercial loan portfolio would be expected to be only partially offset by a decline in the cost of interest-bearing deposits in a falling-rate scenario. However, proactive management of the securities and derivatives portfolios has reduced the ongoing near-term risk to declining market rates and provided significant protection from the decline in rates experienced as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded. The changes in the estimated NII sensitivity profile compared to June 30, 2020 were primarily attributable to the revision of the deposit beta assumptions in the first quarter of 2021 and the significant increase in noninterest-bearing and low-cost interest-bearing deposits. The falling-rate scenario was also impacted by the higher composition of low-cost deposits hitting their floor rates more quickly in the current-year scenario due to the low-rate environment. 

Tables 60 and 61 provide the sensitivity of the Bancorp&#8217;s estimated NII profile at June 30, 2021 to changes to certain deposit balance and deposit repricing sensitivity (betas) assumptions. 

The following table includes the Bancorp&#8217;s estimated NII sensitivity profile at June 30, 2021 with an immediate $5 billion decrease and an immediate $5 billion increase in demand deposit balances: 

TABLE 60: Estimated NII Sensitivity Profile at June 30, 2021 with a $5 Billion Change in Demand Deposit Assumption % Change in NII (FTE) Immediate $5 Billion Balance Decrease Immediate $5 Billion Balance Increase Change in Interest Rates (bps) 12 Months 13-24 Months 12 Months 13-24 Months +200 Ramp over 12 months 9.72 &#160;% 20.22 11.86 24.53 +100 Ramp over 12 months 5.11 11.29 6.18 13.45 -25 Ramp over 3 months (2.31) (3.42) (1.82) (2.88) 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

The following table includes the Bancorp&#8217;s estimated NII sensitivity profile with a 25% increase and a 25% decrease to the corresponding deposit beta assumptions as of June 30, 2021:

(a) Includes weighted-average rising-rate and falling-rate interest-bearing deposit betas of 46% and 40%, respectively. 

(b) Includes weighted-average rising-rate and falling-rate interest-bearing deposit betas of 28% and 24%, respectively. 

Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity 

The Bancorp also uses EVE as a measurement tool in managing interest rate risk. Whereas the NII sensitivity analysis highlights the impact on forecasted NII on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) over one- and two-year time horizons, EVE is a point-in-time analysis of the economic sensitivity of current positions that incorporates all cash flows over their estimated remaining lives. The EVE of the balance sheet is defined as the discounted present value of all asset and net derivative cash flows less the discounted value of all liability cash flows. Due to this longer horizon, the sensitivity of EVE to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of longer-term interest rate risk. EVE values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the balance growth assumptions used in the NII sensitivity analysis. As with the NII simulation model, assumptions about the timing and variability of existing balance sheet cash flows are critical in the EVE analysis. Particularly important are assumptions driving loan and security prepayments and the expected balance attrition and pricing of indeterminate-lived deposits. 

The following table shows the Bancorp&#8217;s estimated EVE sensitivity profile as of: 

TABLE 62: Estimated EVE Sensitivity Profile June 30, 2021 June 30, 2020 Change in Interest Rates (bps) % Change in EVE ALCO Policy Limit % Change in EVE ALCO Policy Limit +200 Shock 6.25 &#160; % (12.00) (2.86) (12.00) +100 Shock 3.63 &#160; N/A (0.82) N/A -25 Shock (1.18) N/A N/A N/A 

The EVE sensitivity is significantly positive in a +200 bps rising-rate scenario at June 30, 2021. The changes in the estimated EVE sensitivity profile from June 30, 2020 were primarily related to the revision of the deposit beta assumptions in the first quarter of 2021, growth in noninterest-bearing and low-cost interest-bearing deposits and the shorter expected lives of prepayable, fixed-rate assets due to the decrease in market interest rates. These items were partially offset by continued repositioning of the investment portfolio into securities with less principal cash flows in the near term. 

While an instantaneous shift in interest rates is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure, the Bancorp believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (e.g., the current fiscal year). Further, EVE does not account for factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships and changing product spreads that could mitigate or exacerbate the impact of changes in interest rates. The NII simulations and EVE analyses do not necessarily include certain actions that management may undertake to manage risk in response to actual changes in interest rates. 

The Bancorp regularly evaluates its exposures to a static balance sheet forecast, LIBOR, Prime Rate and other basis risks, yield curve twist risks and embedded options risks. In addition, the impacts on NII on an FTE basis and EVE of extreme changes in interest rates are modeled, wherein the Bancorp employs the use of yield curve shocks and environment-specific scenarios. 

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate Risk 

An integral component of the Bancorp&#8217;s interest rate risk management strategy is its use of derivative instruments to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in market interest rates. Examples of derivative instruments that the Bancorp may use as part of its interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps, interest rate floors, interest rate caps, forward contracts, forward starting interest rate swaps, options, swaptions and TBA securities. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Tables 63 and 64 show all swap and floor positions that are utilized for purposes of managing the Bancorp&#8217;s exposures to the variability of interest rates. These positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed-upon amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index or to hedge forecasted transactions for the variability in cash flows attributable to the contractually specified interest rate. The volume, maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as the Bancorp adjusts its broader interest rate risk management objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. For further information, including the notional amount and fair values of these derivatives, refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The following tables present additional information about the interest rate swaps and floors used in Fifth Third&#8217;s asset and liability management activities:

Additionally, as part of its overall risk management strategy relative to its residential mortgage banking activities, the Bancorp enters into forward contracts accounted for as free-standing derivatives to economically hedge IRLCs that are also considered free-standing derivatives. The Bancorp economically hedges its exposure to residential mortgage loans held for sale through the use of forward contracts and mortgage options as well. See the Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights and Price Risk section for the discussion of the use of derivatives to economically hedge this exposure. 

The Bancorp also enters into derivative contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge market risks assumed in interest rate derivative contracts with commercial customers. Generally, these contracts have similar terms in order to protect the Bancorp from market volatility. Credit risk arises from the possible inability of the counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts, which the Bancorp minimizes through collateral arrangements, approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. The Bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not being taken in providing this service to customers. These controls include an independent determination of interest rate volatility and credit equivalent exposure on these contracts and counterparty credit approvals performed by independent risk management. For further information, including the notional amount and fair values of these derivatives, refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights and Price Risk 

The fair value of the residential MSR portfolio was $818 million and $656 million at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The value of servicing rights can fluctuate sharply depending on changes in interest rates and other factors. Generally, as interest rates decline and loans are prepaid to take advantage of refinancing, the total value of existing servicing rights declines because no further servicing fees are collected on repaid loans. The Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy relative to its mortgage banking activity in order to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the value of its MSR portfolio as a result of changing interest rates. 

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, the Bancorp recognized losses of $122 million and $50 million, respectively, in mortgage banking net revenue for valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio. The valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio included a decrease of $49 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and an increase of $103 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 due to changes to inputs in the valuation model, including future prepayment speeds and OAS assumptions. Assumptions were updated as a result of market rate changes during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021. For the three months ended June 30, 2021, a decrease in mortgage rates caused modeled prepayment speeds to rise. For the six months ended June 30, 2021, an increase in mortgage rates resulted in a reduction to modeled prepayment speeds, and a tightening of the spread between mortgage rates and swap rates resulted in a decrease in the modeled OAS assumptions. The fair value of the MSR portfolio also decreased $73 million and $153 million as a result of contractual principal payments and actual prepayment activity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Mortgage rates decreased during both the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, which caused modeled prepayment speeds to rise. The fair value of the MSR portfolio decreased $12 million and $343 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively, due to changes to inputs to the valuation model including prepayment speeds and OAS assumptions and decreased $58 million and $105 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively, due to the impact of contractual principal payments and actual prepayment activity. 

The Bancorp recognized net gains of $47 million and net losses of $89 million on its non-qualifying hedging strategy for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to net gains of $11 million and $364 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively. These amounts included net gains of $1 million and net losses of $1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to net gains of an immaterial amount and $3 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively, on securities related to the Bancorp&#8217;s non-qualifying hedging strategy. The Bancorp may adjust its hedging strategy to reflect its assessment of the composition of its MSR portfolio, the cost of hedging and the anticipated effectiveness of the hedges given the economic environment. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on servicing rights and the instruments used to hedge price risk on MSRs. 

Foreign Currency Risk 

The Bancorp may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to economically hedge certain foreign denominated loans. The derivatives are classified as free-standing instruments with the revaluation gain or loss being recorded in other noninterest income in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The balance of the Bancorp&#8217;s foreign denominated loans at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was $841 million and $655 million, respectively. The Bancorp also enters into foreign exchange contracts for the benefit of commercial customers to hedge their exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Similar to the hedging of price risk from interest rate derivative contracts entered into with commercial customers, the Bancorp also enters into foreign exchange contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge a substantial portion of the exposure from client-driven foreign exchange activity. The Bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not being taken in providing this service to customers. These controls include an independent determination of currency volatility and credit equivalent exposure on these contracts, counterparty credit approvals and country limits performed by independent risk management. 

Commodity Risk 

The Bancorp also enters into commodity contracts for the benefit of commercial customers to hedge their exposure to commodity price fluctuations. Similar to the hedging of foreign exchange and price risk from interest rate derivative contracts, the Bancorp also enters into commodity contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge a substantial portion of the exposure from client-driven commodity activity. The Bancorp may also offset this risk with exchange-traded commodity contracts. The Bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not taken in providing this service to customers. These controls include an independent determination of commodity volatility and credit equivalent exposure on these contracts and counterparty credit approvals performed by independent risk management. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT 

The goal of liquidity management is to provide adequate funds to meet changes in loan and lease demand, unexpected levels of deposit withdrawals and other contractual obligations. Mitigating liquidity risk is accomplished by maintaining liquid assets in the form of cash and investment securities, maintaining sufficient unused borrowing capacity in the debt markets and delivering consistent growth in core deposits. A summary of certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts is included in Note 16 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s Treasury department manages funding and liquidity based on point-in-time metrics as well as forward-looking projections, which incorporate different sources and uses of funds under base and stress scenarios. Liquidity risk is monitored and managed by the Treasury department with independent oversight provided by ERM, and a series of Policy Limits and Key Risk Indicators are established to ensure risks are managed within the Bancorp&#8217;s risk tolerance. The Bancorp maintains a contingency funding plan that provides for liquidity stress testing, which assesses the liquidity needs under varying market conditions, time horizons, asset growth rates and other events. The contingency plan provides for ongoing monitoring of unused borrowing capacity and available sources of contingent liquidity to prepare for unexpected liquidity needs and to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity. The contingency plan also outlines the Bancorp&#8217;s response to various levels of liquidity stress and actions that should be taken during various scenarios. 

Liquidity risk is monitored and managed for both Fifth Third Bancorp and its subsidiaries. The Bancorp receives substantially all of its liquidity from dividends from its subsidiaries, primarily Fifth Third Bank, National Association. Subsidiary dividends are supplemented with term debt to enable the Bancorp to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet its cash obligations, including debt service and scheduled maturities, common and preferred dividends, unfunded commitments to subsidiaries and other planned capital actions in the form of share repurchases. Liquidity resources are more limited at the Bancorp, making its liquidity position more susceptible to market disruptions. Bancorp liquidity is assessed using a cash coverage horizon, ensuring the entity maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a period of sustained market disruption while meeting its anticipated obligations over an extended stressed horizon. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s ALCO, which includes senior management representatives and is accountable to the ERMC, monitors and manages liquidity and funding risk within Board-approved policy limits. In addition to the risk management activities of ALCO, the Bancorp has a liquidity risk management function as part of ERM that provides independent oversight of liquidity risk management. 

Sources of Funds 

The Bancorp&#8217;s primary sources of funds relate to cash flows from loan and lease repayments, payments from securities related to sales and maturities, the sale or securitization of loans and leases and funds generated by core deposits, in addition to the use of public and private debt offerings. 

Refer to the Interest Rate and Price Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A included in the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for information about the expected cash flows from loan and lease repayments. Of the $38.0 billion of securities in the Bancorp&#8217;s available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio at June 30, 2021, $4.7 billion in principal and interest is expected to be received in the next 12 months and an additional $4.2 billion is expected to be received in the next 13 to 24 months. For further information on the Bancorp&#8217;s securities portfolio, refer to the Investment Securities subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A. 

Asset-driven liquidity is provided by the Bancorp&#8217;s ability to sell or securitize loans and leases. In order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations and to manage liquidity, the Bancorp has developed securitization and sale procedures for several types of interest-sensitive assets. A majority of the long-term, fixed-rate single-family residential mortgage loans underwritten according to FHLMC or FNMA guidelines are sold for cash upon origination. Additional assets such as certain other residential mortgage loans, certain commercial loans and leases, home equity loans, automobile loans and other consumer loans are also capable of being securitized or sold. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, the Bancorp sold or securitized loans and leases totaling $4.5 billion and $8.1 billion, respectively, compared to $3.1 billion and $6.2 billion during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively. For further information, refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Core deposits have historically provided the Bancorp with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. The Bancorp&#8217;s average core deposits and average shareholders&#8217; equity funded 89% of its average total assets for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, compared to 85% for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2020. In addition to core deposit funding, the Bancorp also accesses a variety of other short-term and long-term funding sources, which include the use of the FHLB system. Certificates $100,000 and over and certain deposits in the Bancorp&#8217;s foreign branch located in the Cayman Islands are wholesale funding tools utilized to fund asset growth. Management does not rely on any one source of liquidity and manages availability in response to changing balance sheet needs. 

As of June 30, 2021, $4.7 billion of debt or other securities were available for issuance under the current Bancorp&#8217;s Board of Directors&#8217; authorizations and the Bancorp is authorized to file any necessary registration statements with the SEC to permit ready access to the public securities markets; however, access to these markets may depend on market conditions. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

As of June 30, 2021, the Bank&#8217;s global bank note program had a borrowing capacity of $25.0 billion, of which $21.1 billion was available for issuance. Additionally, at June 30, 2021, the Bank had approximately $47.3 billion of borrowing capacity available through secured borrowing sources, including the FRB and FHLB. 

Current Liquidity Position 

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the economic environment, although financial markets, initially supported by Federal Reserve programs, have been stable and well-functioning following the onset of the crisis, aided by significant monetary and fiscal response. The Bancorp maintains a strong liquidity profile driven by strong core deposit funding and over $100 billion in current available liquidity. The Bancorp is managing liquidity prudently in the current environment and maintains a liquidity profile focused on core deposit and stable long-term funding sources which allows for the effective management of concentration and rollover risk. 

As of June 30, 2021, the Bancorp has sufficient liquidity to meet contractual obligations and all preferred and common dividends without accessing the capital markets or receiving upstream dividends from the Bank subsidiary for 30 months. 

Credit Ratings 

The cost and availability of financing to the Bancorp and Bank are impacted by its credit ratings. A downgrade to the Bancorp&#8217;s or Bank&#8217;s credit ratings could affect its ability to access the credit markets and increase its borrowing costs, thereby adversely impacting the Bancorp&#8217;s or Bank&#8217;s financial condition and liquidity. Key factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong credit quality, strong capital ratios and diverse funding sources, in addition to disciplined liquidity monitoring procedures. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s and Bank&#8217;s credit ratings are summarized in Table 65. The ratings reflect the ratings agency&#8217;s view on the Bancorp&#8217;s and Bank&#8217;s capacity to meet financial commitments.* 

* As an investor, you should be aware that a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, that it may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Additional information on the credit rating ranking within the overall classification system is located on the website of each credit rating agency.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT 

Operational risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human errors or misconduct or adverse external events that are neither market- nor credit-related. Operational risk is inherent in the Bancorp&#8217;s activities and can manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts, business interruptions, inappropriate behavior of employees, unintentional failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, poor design or delivery of products and services, cyber-security or physical security incidents and privacy breaches or failure of third parties to perform in accordance with their arrangements. These events could result in financial losses, litigation and regulatory fines, as well as other damage to the Bancorp. The Bancorp&#8217;s risk management goal is to keep operational risk at appropriate levels consistent with the Bancorp&#8217;s risk appetite, financial strength, the characteristics of its businesses, the markets in which it operates and the competitive and regulatory environment to which it is subject. 

To control, monitor and govern operational risk, the Bancorp maintains an overall Risk Management Framework which comprises governance oversight, risk assessment, capital measurement, monitoring and reporting as well as a formal three lines of defense approach. ERM is responsible for prescribing the framework to the lines of business and corporate functions and providing independent oversight of its implementation (second line of defense). Business Controls groups are in place in each of the lines of business to ensure consistent implementation and execution of managing day-to-day operational risk (first line of defense). 

The Bancorp&#8217;s risk management framework consists of five integrated components, including identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and independent governance reporting of risk. The corporate Operational Risk Management function within Enterprise Risk is responsible for developing and overseeing the implementation of the Bancorp&#8217;s approach to managing operational risk. This includes providing governance, awareness and training, tools, guidance and oversight to support implementation of key risk programs and systems as they relate to operational risk management, such as risk and control self-assessments, product delivery risk assessment, scenario analysis, new product/initiative risk reviews, key risk indicators, Third-Party Risk Management, cyber-security risk management and review of operational losses. The function is also responsible for developing reports that support the proactive management of operational risk across the enterprise. The lines of business and corporate functions are responsible for managing the operational risks associated with their areas in accordance with the risk management framework. The framework is intended to enable the Bancorp to function with a sound and well-controlled operational environment. These processes support the Bancorp&#8217;s goals to minimize future operational losses and strengthen the Bancorp&#8217;s performance by maintaining sufficient capital to absorb operational losses that are incurred. 

The Bancorp also maintains a robust information security program to support the management of cyber-security risk within the organization with a focus on prevention, detection and recovery processes. Fifth Third utilizes a wide array of techniques to secure its operations and proprietary information such as Board-approved policies and programs, network monitoring and testing, access controls and dedicated security personnel. Fifth Third has adopted the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework for the management and deployment of cyber-security controls and is an active participant in the financial sector information sharing organization structure, known as the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center. To ensure resiliency of key Bancorp functions, Fifth Third also employs redundancy protocols that include a robust business continuity function that works to mitigate any potential impacts to Fifth Third customers and its systems. 

Fifth Third also focuses on the reporting and escalation of operational control issues to senior management and the Board of Directors. The Operational Risk Committee is the key committee that oversees and supports Fifth Third in the management of operational risk across the enterprise. The Information Security Governance Committee and Model Risk Committee report to the Operational Risk Committee and are responsible for governance of information security and model risks. The Operational Risk Committee reports to the ERMC, which reports to the Risk and Compliance Joint Committee of the Board of Directors of Fifth Third Bancorp and Fifth Third Bank, National Association. 

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to put pressure on operational risk including cyber, fraud and third-party risks driven by factors such as remote work strategies, relief programs and outsourced service providers. Additionally, increased external threats have elevated fraud and cyber-security risks. These risks continue to be carefully managed and monitored to ensure effective controls are in place, with appropriate oversight and governance by the second line of defense. Fifth Third has a defined pandemic plan and a robust business continuity management process, which have been leveraged to support the continuity of processes across the Bank. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

LEGAL AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT 

Legal and regulatory compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss or damage to reputation as a result of noncompliance with (i) applicable laws, regulations, rules and other regulatory requirements (including but not limited to the risk of consumers experiencing economic loss or other legal harm as a result of noncompliance with consumer protection laws, regulations and requirements); (ii) internal policies and procedures, standards of best practice or codes of conduct; and (iii) principles of integrity and fair dealing applicable to Fifth Third&#8217;s activities and functions. Legal risks include the risk of actions against the institution that result in unenforceable contracts, lawsuits, legal sanctions, or adverse judgments, which disrupt or otherwise negatively affect the operations or condition of the institution. Failure to effectively manage such risks can elevate the risk level or manifest itself as other types of key risks, including reputational or operational risk. Fifth Third focuses on managing legal and regulatory compliance risk in accordance with the Bancorp&#8217;s integrated risk management framework, which ensures consistent processes for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting risks. The Bancorp&#8217;s risk management goal is to keep compliance risk at appropriate levels, consistent with the Bancorp&#8217;s risk appetite. 

To mitigate such risks, Compliance Risk Management provides independent oversight to foster consistency and sufficiency in the execution of the program, and ensures that lines of business and support functions are adequately identifying, assessing and monitoring legal and regulatory compliance risks and adopting proper mitigation strategies. Moreover, such strategies are modified from time to time to respond to new or emerging risks in the environment. Compliance Risk Management and the Legal Division provide guidance to the lines of business and enterprise functions, which are ultimately responsible for managing such risks associated with their areas. The Chief Compliance Officer and Director of Financial Crimes is responsible for formulating and directing the strategy, development, implementation, communication and maintenance of the Compliance Risk Management program, which implements key compliance processes, including but not limited to, executive- and board-level governance and reporting routines, compliance-related policies, risk assessments, key risk indicators, issues tracking, regulatory change management and regulatory compliance testing and monitoring. As part of Compliance Risk Management, the Financial Crimes Division conducts and oversees anti-money laundering and economic sanctions processes. Compliance Risk Management partners with the Community and Economic Development team to oversee the Bancorp&#8217;s compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. 

Fifth Third also reports and escalates legal and regulatory compliance issues to senior management and the Board of Directors. The Management Compliance Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Compliance Officer and Director of Financial Crimes, is the key committee that oversees and supports Fifth Third in the management of compliance risk across the enterprise. The Management Compliance Committee oversees Bancorp-wide compliance issues, industry best practices, legislative developments, regulatory concerns and other leading indicators of legal and regulatory compliance risk. The Management Compliance Committee reports to the ERMC, which reports to the RCC of the Board of Directors of Fifth Third Bancorp and Fifth Third Bank, National Association.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 

Management regularly reviews the Bancorp&#8217;s capital levels to help ensure it is appropriately positioned under various operating environments. The Bancorp has established a Capital Committee which is responsible for making capital plan recommendations to management. These recommendations are reviewed by the ERMC and the annual capital plan is approved by the Board of Directors. The Capital Committee is responsible for execution and oversight of the capital actions of the capital plan. 

Regulatory Capital Ratios 

The Basel III Final Rule sets minimum regulatory capital ratios as well as defines the measure of &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; for insured depository institutions.

The Bancorp is subject to the stress capital buffer requirement, which replaced the capital conservation buffer on October 1, 2020. Institutions subject to the stress capital buffer requirement must maintain capital ratios above their respective buffered minimum (regulatory minimum plus stress capital buffer) in order to avoid certain limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses to executive officers. The FRB uses the supervisory stress test to determine the Bancorp&#8217;s stress capital buffer, subject to a floor of 2.5%. The Bancorp&#8217;s stress capital buffer requirement has been 2.5% since the introduction of this framework and was most recently affirmed on June 24, 2021. The Bancorp&#8217;s capital ratios have exceeded the stress capital buffer requirement for all periods presented. 

In April 2018, the federal banking regulators proposed transitional arrangements to permit banking organizations to phase in the day-one impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13, referred to as CECL, on regulatory capital over a period of three years. The proposed rule was adopted as final effective July 1, 2019. The phase-in provisions of the final rule are optional for a banking organization that experiences a reduction in retained earnings due to CECL adoption as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the banking organization adopts CECL. A banking organization that elects the phase-in provisions of the final rule for regulatory capital purposes must phase in 25% of the transitional amounts impacting regulatory capital in the first year of adoption of CECL, 50% in the second year, 75% in the third year, with full impact beginning in the fourth year. 

In March 2020, the banking agencies issued an interim final rule for additional transitional relief to regulatory capital related to the impact of the adoption of CECL given the disruption in economic activity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The interim final rule provides banking organizations that adopt CECL in the 2020 calendar year with the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by the aforementioned three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of benefit during the initial two-year delay for a total five-year transition. The estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital (modified CECL transitional amount) is calculated as the sum of the day-one impact on retained earnings upon adoption of CECL (CECL transitional amount) and the calculated change in the ACL relative to the day-one ACL upon adoption of CECL multiplied by a scaling factor of 25%. The scaling factor is used to approximate the difference in the ACL under CECL relative to the incurred loss methodology. The modified CECL transitional amount will be calculated each quarter for the first two years of the five-year transition. The amount of the modified CECL transition amount will be fixed as of December 31, 2021 and that amount will be subject to the three-year phase out. 

The Bancorp adopted ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020 and elected the five-year transition phase-in option for the impact of CECL on regulatory capital with its regulatory filings as of March 31, 2020. The impact of the modified CECL transition amount on the Bancorp&#8217;s regulatory capital at June 30, 2021 was an increase in capital of approximately $535 million. On a fully phased-in basis, the Bancorp&#8217;s CET1 ratio would be reduced by 34 basis points as of June 30, 2021. The CECL transition amount will begin to phase in during the fiscal year starting January 1, 2022 and will be fully phased in by January 1, 2025.

Capital Planning 

In 2011, the FRB adopted the capital plan rule, which requires BHCs with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more to submit annual capital plans to the FRB for review. Under the rule, these capital plans must include detailed descriptions of the following: the BHC&#8217;s internal processes for assessing capital adequacy; the policies governing capital actions such as common stock issuances, dividends and share repurchases; and all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon. Furthermore, each BHC must report to the FRB the results of stress tests conducted by the BHC under a number of scenarios that assess the sources and uses of capital under baseline and stressed economic conditions. 

On October 10, 2019, the Federal Reserve Board adopted final rules to tailor certain prudential standards for large domestic and foreign banking organizations. As a result of the EPS Tailoring Rule, the Bancorp is subject to Category IV standards, under which the Bancorp is no longer required to file semi-annual, company-run stress tests with the FRB and publicly disclose the results. However, the Bancorp is required to develop and maintain a capital plan approved by the Board of Directors on an annual basis. As an institution subject to Category IV standards, the Bancorp is subject to the FRB&#8217;s supervisory stress tests every two years, the Board capital plan rule and certain FR Y-14 reporting requirements. The supervisory stress tests are forward-looking quantitative evaluations of the impact of stressful economic and financial market conditions on the Bancorp&#8217;s capital. The Bancorp became subject to Category IV standards on December 31, 2019, and the requirements outlined above apply to the stress test cycle that started on January 1, 2020. The Bancorp is not subject to the 2021 supervisory stress test conducted by the FRB but has submitted its Board-approved capital plan as required. 

In June 2020, the FRB took several actions in connection with its announcement of stress test results in light of the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, for the third quarter of 2020, the FRB required large banking organizations, including the Bancorp, to suspend share repurchases, cap dividend payments to the amount paid during the second quarter of 2020, and further limit dividends according to a formula based on recent income. These restrictions were extended, quarterly, with certain modifications, throughout the remainder of 2020. 

The FRB extended these restrictions into the first and second quarters of 2021, with certain modifications to permit a limited amount of share repurchases. During the first and second quarters of 2021, the Bancorp was authorized to pay dividends and execute share repurchases according to a formula based on recent income provided the Bancorp did not increase the amount of its common dividend. 

In June 2021, the FRB lifted the COVID-19 pandemic induced capital distribution limitations, which prohibited increases to the common dividend and placed limitations on share repurchases, and authorized the Bancorp, beginning July 1, 2021, to make capital distributions that are consistent with the requirements in the Board&#8217;s capital plan rule, inclusive of the Bancorp&#8217;s stress capital buffer requirement. The Bancorp maintains a comprehensive process for managing capital and expects the stress capital buffer framework to provide greater flexibility for the Bancorp to assess and deploy capital.

Dividend Policy and Stock Repurchase Program 

The Bancorp&#8217;s common stock dividend policy and stock repurchase program reflect its earnings outlook, desired payout ratios, the need to maintain adequate capital levels, the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends and the need to comply with safe and sound banking practices as well as meet regulatory requirements and expectations. The Bancorp declared dividends per common share of $0.27 for both the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, and $0.54 for both the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. Pursuant to the Bancorp&#8217;s Board-approved capital plan, during the second quarter of 2021, the Bancorp entered into and settled an accelerated share repurchase transaction in the amount of $347 million. Refer to Note 15 and Note 23 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on share repurchase activity. 

The following table summarizes the monthly share repurchase activity for the three months ended June 30, 2021:

The Bancorp&#8217;s management also conducted an evaluation of internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Bancorp&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. Based on this evaluation there has been no such change during the period covered by this report.
