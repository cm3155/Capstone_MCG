Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 2) 

The following is Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of certain significant factors that have affected Fifth Third Bancorp&#8217;s (the &#8220;Bancorp&#8221; or &#8220;Fifth Third&#8221;) financial condition and results of operations during the periods included in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which are a part of this filing. Reference to the Bancorp incorporates the parent holding company and all consolidated subsidiaries. The Bancorp&#8217;s banking subsidiary is referred to as the Bank. 

OVERVIEW 

Fifth Third Bancorp is a diversified financial services company headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio. At March 31, 2022, the Bancorp had $211 billion in assets and operated 1,079 full-service banking centers and 2,201 Fifth Third branded ATMs in eleven states throughout the Midwestern and Southeastern regions of the U.S. The Bancorp reports on four business segments: Commercial Banking, Branch Banking, Consumer Lending and Wealth and Asset Management. 

This overview of MD&#38;A highlights selected information in the financial results of the Bancorp and may not contain all of the information that is important to you. For a more complete understanding of trends, events, commitments, uncertainties, liquidity, capital resources and critical accounting policies and estimates, you should carefully read this entire document as well as the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Each of these items could have an impact on the Bancorp&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, refer to the Glossary of Abbreviations and Acronyms in this report for a list of terms included as a tool for the reader of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The abbreviations and acronyms identified therein are used throughout this MD&#38;A, as well as the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Net interest income, net interest margin, net interest rate spread and the efficiency ratio are presented in MD&#38;A on an FTE basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and leases and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. The FTE basis for presenting net interest income is a non-GAAP measure. For further information, refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of MD&#38;A. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s revenues are dependent on both net interest income and noninterest income. For the three months ended March 31, 2022, net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income provided 64% and 36% of total revenue, respectively. The Bancorp derives the majority of its revenues within the U.S. from customers domiciled in the U.S. Revenue from foreign countries and external customers domiciled in foreign countries was immaterial to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three months ended March 31, 2022. Changes in interest rates, credit quality, economic trends and the capital markets are primary factors that drive the performance of the Bancorp. As discussed later in the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A, risk identification, measurement, monitoring, control and reporting are important to the management of risk and to the financial performance and capital strength of the Bancorp. 

Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on assets such as loans, leases and securities, and interest expense incurred on liabilities such as deposits, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Net interest income is affected by the general level of interest rates, the relative level of short-term and long-term interest rates, changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Generally, the rates of interest the Bancorp earns on its assets and pays on its liabilities are established for a period of time. The change in market interest rates over time exposes the Bancorp to interest rate risk through potential adverse changes to net interest income and financial position. The Bancorp manages this risk by continually analyzing and adjusting the composition of its assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates, the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, the Bancorp enters into certain derivative transactions as part of its overall strategy to manage its interest rate and prepayment risks. The Bancorp is also exposed to the risk of loss on its loan and lease portfolio, as a result of changing expected cash flows caused by borrower credit events, such as loan defaults and inadequate collateral. 

Noninterest income is derived from service charges on deposits, wealth and asset management revenue, commercial banking revenue, card and processing revenue, leasing business revenue, mortgage banking net revenue, other noninterest income and net securities gains or losses. Noninterest expense includes compensation and benefits, technology and communications, net occupancy expense, equipment expense, leasing business expense, marketing expense, card and processing expense and other noninterest expense. 

COVID-19 Global Pandemic 

The COVID-19 pandemic created significant economic uncertainty and financial disruptions during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, and this uncertainty has continued into 2022. Government and public responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, including temporary closures of businesses and the implementation of social distancing protocols, caused reductions and instability in economic activity that resulted in increased unemployment levels in certain industries and volatility in the financial markets. Markets continue to remain volatile as a result of the pandemic and its evolving impacts, including inflationary concerns as well as stresses in labor markets and supply chains. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, low interest rates, reduced economic activity and market volatility had the most immediate negative impacts on the Bancorp&#8217;s performance. The Bancorp is unable to estimate the extent of the impact that these factors have had on its operating results since the pandemic began and these factors may adversely impact its future operating results. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Although the increased availability of COVID-19 vaccinations began to mitigate the public health effects of the pandemic, there has been a rise of certain variants of COVID-19 and slowing progress on vaccination rates. The recovery from the related economic crisis disproportionately affected certain industries, geographies and demographics more than others, and when combined with the unprecedented nature of the government response to the pandemic, it becomes difficult to predict the extent to which the pandemic will continue to adversely impact the Bancorp and its customers. Furthermore, resurgence risk remains as new virus variants are identified. The Bancorp continues to closely monitor the pandemic and its effects on customers, employees, communities and markets. For further discussion on current economic conditions, refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A. 

LIBOR Transition 

In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the &#8220;FCA&#8221;), which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA will stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. Since then, central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, have commissioned working groups of market participants and official sector representatives with the goal of finding suitable replacements for LIBOR. 

On March 5, 2021, the FCA and ICE Benchmark Administration, Limited announced that the publication of the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR maturities and non-USD LIBOR maturities would cease immediately after December 31, 2021, with the remaining USD LIBOR maturities ceasing immediately after June 30, 2023. In the United States, the Alternative Rates Reference Committee (the &#8220;ARRC&#8221;), a group of market participants convened in 2014 to help ensure a successful transition away from USD LIBOR, identified SOFR as its preferred alternative rate. SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. The composition and characteristics of SOFR are not the same as those of LIBOR, and SOFR is fundamentally different from LIBOR for two key reasons: (1) SOFR is a secured rate, while LIBOR is an unsecured rate, and (2) SOFR is an overnight rate, while LIBOR is a forward-looking rate that represents interbank funding over different maturities. As a result, there can be no assurance that SOFR, however calculated, will perform the same way as LIBOR would have at any time, including, as a result of changes in interest and yield rates in the market, market volatility, or global or regional economic, financial, political, regulatory, judicial or other events. 

On March 15, 2022, President Biden signed the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the &#8220;LIBOR Act&#8221;) into law. The LIBOR Act offers a federal solution for transitioning legacy instruments that lack sufficient provisions addressing LIBOR&#8217;s cessation by outlining a uniform process to govern the transition from LIBOR to a replacement rate. The LIBOR Act also establishes a safe harbor for lenders, shielding lenders from litigation as a result of their choice of a replacement rate (such as SOFR) per Federal Reserve Board recommendations. The Federal Reserve Board is required to promulgate regulations carrying out the terms of the LIBOR Act not later than 180 days following its enactment. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s LIBOR transition plan is organized around key work streams, including continued engagement with central banks and industry working groups and regulators, active client engagement, comprehensive review of legacy documentation, internal operational and technological readiness, and risk management, among other things, to facilitate the transition to alternative reference rates. 

Although the full impact of LIBOR reforms and actions remains unclear, the Bancorp has discontinued entering into new LIBOR-based contracts in accordance with regulatory guidance, except for permissible limited use as part of hedging and risk management programs. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Bancorp expanded its offering of alternative reference rate products, including SOFR. In addition, the Bancorp is continuing its transition of existing LIBOR-based exposures to an appropriate alternative reference rate on or before June 30, 2023. As of March 31, 2022, the Bancorp had substantial exposure to LIBOR-based products throughout several of its lines of business. These exposures included derivative contracts with a total notional value of approximately $103 billion, loans outstanding of approximately $47 billion, preferred stock of approximately $1.4 billion and long-term debt of approximately $237 million. The Bancorp currently estimates that approximately 20% of the existing exposures will mature before June 30, 2023. For the contracts that will not mature prior to June 30, 2023, an additional portion of these contracts is subject to contractual terms specifying alternative reference rates (&#8220;fallback provisions&#8221;) that would become effective upon cessation of LIBOR&#8217;s publication. Existing exposures without fallback provisions are expected to be amended prior to June 30, 2023 to include such terms or transition to an alternative reference rate. 

For a further discussion of the various risks the Bancorp faces in connection with the replacement of LIBOR on its operations, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Market Risks&#8212;The replacement of LIBOR could adversely affect Fifth Third&#8217;s revenue or expenses and the value of those assets or obligations.&#8221; in Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Key Performance Indicators 

The Bancorp, as a banking institution, utilizes various key indicators of financial condition and operating results in managing and monitoring the performance of the business. In addition to traditional financial metrics, such as revenue and expense trends, the Bancorp monitors other financial measures that assist in evaluating growth trends, capital strength and operational efficiencies. The Bancorp analyzes these key performance indicators against its past performance, its forecasted performance and with the performance of its peer banking institutions. These indicators may change from time to time as the operating environment and businesses change. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

The following are some of the key indicators used by management to assess the Bancorp&#8217;s business performance, including those which are considered in the Bancorp&#8217;s compensation programs: 

&#8226; CET1 Capital Ratio: CET1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets as defined by the Basel III standardized approach to risk-weighting of assets 

&#8226; Return on Average Tangible Common Equity (non-GAAP): Tangible net income available to common shareholders divided by average tangible common equity 

&#8226; Net Interest Margin (non-GAAP): Net interest income on an FTE basis divided by average interest-earning assets 

&#8226; Efficiency Ratio (non-GAAP): Noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income 

&#8226; Earnings Per Share, Diluted: Net income allocated to common shareholders divided by average common shares outstanding after the effect of dilutive stock-based awards 

&#8226; Nonperforming Portfolio Assets Ratio: Nonperforming portfolio assets divided by portfolio loans and leases and OREO 

&#8226; Net Charge-off Ratio: Net losses charged-off divided by average portfolio loans and leases 

&#8226; Return on Average Assets: Net income divided by average assets 

&#8226; Loan-to-Deposit Ratio: Total loans divided by total deposits 

&#8226; Household Growth: Change in the number of consumer households with retail relationship-based checking accounts 

The list of indicators above is intended to summarize some of the most important metrics utilized by management in evaluating the Bancorp&#8217;s performance and does not represent an all-inclusive list of all performance measures that may be considered relevant or important to management or investors.

Earnings Summary 

The Bancorp&#8217;s net income available to common shareholders for the first quarter of 2022 was $474 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, which was net of $20 million in preferred stock dividends. The Bancorp&#8217;s net income available to common shareholders for the first quarter of 2021 was $674 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, which was net of $20 million in preferred stock dividends. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $1.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022, an increase of $19 million compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income benefited from an increase in average interest-earning assets, primarily due to increases in average taxable securities, average indirect secured consumer loans and average commercial and industrial loans for the three months ended March 31, 2022. Net interest income also benefited from a decrease in average long-term debt for the three months ended 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of lower market rates, resulting in a decrease in yields on average loans and leases primarily driven by decreases in yields on average commercial and industrial loans, average indirect secured consumer loans and average residential mortgage loans. Interest income recognized from PPP loans decreased to $20 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to $53 million for the same period in the prior year. Net interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.59% for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to 2.62% for the comparable period in the prior year. 

The provision for credit losses was $45 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to a benefit from credit losses of $173 million during the same period in the prior year. The increase in provision expense for the three months ended March 31, 2022 was primarily driven by factors that caused an increase in the ACL from December 31, 2021 including higher end-of-period commercial and consumer loan balances, partially offset by improvements in commercial credit quality. Net losses charged off as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases were 0.12% and 0.27% for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. At March 31, 2022, nonperforming portfolio assets as a percent of portfolio loans and leases and OREO increased to 0.49% compared to 0.47% at December 31, 2021. For further discussion on credit quality refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A as well as Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Noninterest income decreased $65 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreases in mortgage banking net revenue, leasing business revenue and commercial banking revenue, partially offset by increases in other noninterest income, service charges on deposits and wealth and asset management revenue. 

Noninterest expense increased $7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in technology and communications expense, other noninterest expense and compensation and benefits, partially offset by a decrease in card and processing expense. 

For more information on net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense refer to the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&#38;A. 

Capital Summary 

The Bancorp calculated its regulatory capital ratios under the Basel III standardized approach to risk-weighting of assets and pursuant to the five-year transition provision option to phase in the effects of CECL on regulatory capital as of March 31, 2022. As of March 31, 2022, the Bancorp&#8217;s capital ratios, as defined by the U.S. banking agencies, were: 

&#8226; CET1 capital ratio: 9.31%; 

&#8226; Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio: 10.63%; 

&#8226; Total risk-based capital ratio: 12.93%; 

&#8226; Leverage ratio: 8.32%. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 

The following are non-GAAP financial measures which provide useful insight to the reader of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements but should be supplemental to primary U.S. GAAP measures and should not be read in isolation or relied upon as a substitute for the primary U.S. GAAP measures. The Bancorp encourages readers to consider its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. 

The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and leases and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. 

The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of net interest income on an FTE basis, interest income on an FTE basis, net interest margin, net interest rate spread and the efficiency ratio to U.S. GAAP:

The Bancorp believes return on average tangible common equity is an important measure for comparative purposes with other financial institutions, but is not defined under U.S. GAAP, and therefore is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. This measure is useful for evaluating the performance of a business as it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measure of return on average tangible common equity to U.S. GAAP:

The Bancorp considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including the tangible equity ratio and tangible common equity ratio, in addition to capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies. These calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies for both absolute and comparative purposes. As U.S. GAAP does not include capital ratio measures, the Bancorp believes there are no comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures to these ratios. These ratios are not formally defined by U.S. GAAP or codified in the federal banking regulations and, therefore, are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures. 

The following table reconciles non-GAAP capital ratios to U.S. GAAP:

RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 

Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements provides a discussion of the significant new accounting standard applicable to the Bancorp and the expected impact of significant accounting standards issued, but not yet required to be adopted. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The Bancorp&#8217;s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain accounting policies require management to exercise judgment in determining methodologies, economic assumptions and estimates that may materially affect the Bancorp&#8217;s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Bancorp&#8217;s critical accounting policies include the accounting for the ALLL, reserve for unfunded commitments, valuation of servicing rights, fair value measurements, goodwill and legal contingencies. These accounting policies are discussed in detail in the Critical Accounting Policies section of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. There have been no material changes to the valuation techniques or models during the three months ended March 31, 2022.

STATEMENTS OF INCOME ANALYSIS 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is the interest earned on loans and leases (including yield-related fees), securities and other short-term investments less the interest incurred on core deposits (including transaction deposits and CDs $250,000 or less) and wholesale funding (including CDs over $250,000, other deposits, federal funds purchased, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt). The net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets. Net interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is typically greater than net interest rate spread due to the interest income earned on those assets that are funded by noninterest-bearing liabilities, or free funding, such as demand deposits or shareholders&#8217; equity. 

Table 5 presents the components of net interest income, net interest margin and net interest rate spread for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, as well as the relative impact of changes in the average balance sheet and changes in interest rates on net interest income. Nonaccrual loans and leases and loans and leases held for sale have been included in the average loan and lease balances. Average outstanding securities balances are based on amortized cost with any unrealized gains or losses included in average other assets. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $1.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022, an increase of $19 million compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income benefited from an increase in average interest-earning assets, primarily due to increases in average taxable securities, average indirect secured consumer loans and average commercial and industrial loans of $5.6 billion, $3.2 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income also benefited from a decrease in average long-term debt of $3.7 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of lower market rates as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021 . Yields on total average loans and leases decreased 27 bps from the three months ended March 31, 2021 primarily as a result of decreases in yields on average commercial and industrial loans, average indirect secured consumer loans and average residential mortgage loans of 31 bps, 50 bps and 19 bps, respectively. Interest income recognized from PPP loans decreased to $20 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to $53 million for the same period in the prior year. 

Net interest rate spread on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.46% during both the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. Yields on average interest-earning assets decreased 11 bps, offset by a decrease in rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities of 11 bps for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021. 

Net interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.59% for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to 2.62% for the comparable period in the prior year. N et interest margin for the three months ended March 31, 2022 was negatively impacted by the aforementioned impacts of lower market rates on loans and leases, partially offset by an increase in the rate earned on excess reserves included in other short-term investments for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest margin results are expected to increase as rates rise and short-term investments continue to be reallocated into assets with longer durations. 

Interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) from loans and leases decreased $47 million during the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021 primarily driven by lower income from PPP loans and the previously mentioned impacts of lower market rates, partially offset by the previously mentioned increases in average indirect secured consumer loans and average commercial and industrial loans. For more information on the Bancorp&#8217;s loan and lease portfolio, refer to the Loans and Leases subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A. Interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) from investment securities and other short-term investments increased $34 million during the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021 primarily due to the previously mentioned increase in average taxable securities, partially offset by a decrease in yields on taxable securities. 

Interest expense on core deposits decreased $7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021 primarily due to a decrease in the cost of average interest-bearing core deposits to 4 bps for the three months ended March 31, 2022 from 7 bps for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Refer to the Deposits subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A for additional information on the Bancorp&#8217;s deposits. 

In terest expense on average wholesale funding decreased $25 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021 primarily due to a decrease in the average balance of long-term debt partially offset by an increase in the rates paid on average long-term debt. Refer to the Borrowings subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A for additional information on the Bancorp&#8217;s borrowings. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, average wholesale funding represented 11% of average interest-bearing liabilities, compared to 15% for the three months ended March 31, 2021. For more information on the Bancorp&#8217;s interest rate risk management, including estimated earnings sensitivity to changes in market interest rates, see the Interest Rate and Price Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The Bancorp provides, as an expense, an amount for expected credit losses within the loan and lease portfolio and the portfolio of unfunded commitments and letters of credit that is based on factors previously discussed in the Critical Accounting Policies section of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. The provision is recorded to bring the ALLL and reserve for unfunded commitments to a level deemed appropriate by the Bancorp to cover losses expected in the portfolios. Actual credit losses on loans and leases are charged against the ALLL. The amount of loans and leases actually removed from the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are referred to as charge-offs. Net charge-offs include current period charge-offs less recoveries on previously charged-off loans and leases. 

The provision for credit losses was $45 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to a benefit from credit losses of $173 million during the same period in the prior year. The increase in provision expense for the three months ended March 31, 2022 was primarily driven by factors that caused an increase in the ACL from December 31, 2021 including higher end-of-period commercial and consumer loan balances, partially offset by improvements in commercial credit quality. The benefit from credit losses in the three months ended March 31, 2021 was driven by decreases in the ACL in response to improved economic forecasts, improved credit quality and changes in product mix. 

The ALLL was $1.9 billion at both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. At March 31, 2022, the ALLL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases decreased to 1.65%, compared to 1.69% at December 31, 2021. The reserve for unfunded commitments decreased $5 million from December 31, 2021 to $177 million at March 31, 2022. The ACL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases decreased to 1.80% at March 31, 2022, compared to 1.85% at December 31, 2021. The decrease in the ACL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases was primarily attributable to improvements in commercial credit quality, partially offset by deterioration in economic forecasts, primarily reflecting the impacts from escalating geopolitical tensions, higher inflation and rising interest rates. 

Refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A as well as Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on the provision for credit losses, including an analysis of loan and lease portfolio composition, nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and other factors considered by the Bancorp in assessing the credit quality of the loan and lease portfolio and determining the level of the ACL. 

Noninterest Income 

Noninterest income decreased $65 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021. 

The following table presents the components of noninterest income:

Service charges on deposits 

Service charges on deposits increased $8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021 primarily due to an increase in commercial treasury management fees. 

Wealth and asset management revenue 

Wealth and asset management revenue increased $6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021 primarily driven by increases in private client service fees and broker income, partially offset by a decrease in institutional fees. The Bancorp&#8217;s trust and registered investment advisory businesses had approximately $549 billion and $464 billion in total assets under care as of March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and managed $61 billion and $58 billion in assets for individuals, corporations and not-for-profit organizations as of March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Commercial banking revenue 

Commercial banking revenue decreased $18 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021 primarily driven by decreases in debt capital markets revenue, partially offset by an increase in contract revenue from commercial customer derivatives. 

Card and processing revenue 

Card and processing revenue increased $3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021 primarily due to an increase in credit card interchange, partially offset by increased reward costs. The increases in credit card interchange and reward costs were driven by an increase in consumer and business card spend volumes. 

Leasing business revenue 

Leasing business revenue decreased $25 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021 primarily due to a decrease in lease syndication fees, partially offset by an increase in lease remarketing fees. 

Mortgage banking net revenue 

Mortgage banking net revenue decreased $33 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021. 

The following table presents the components of mortgage banking net revenue: 

TABLE 7: Components of Mortgage Banking Net Revenue For the three months ended March 31, ($ in millions) 2022 2021 Origination fees and gains on loan sales $ 25 &#160; 89 Net mortgage servicing revenue: Gross mortgage servicing fees 71 &#160; 59 Net valuation adjustments on MSRs and free-standing derivatives purchased to economically hedge MSRs 

(44) (63) Net mortgage servicing revenue 27 &#160; (4) Total mortgage banking net revenue $ 52 &#160; 85 

Origination fees and gains on loan sales decreased $64 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021 primarily driven by decreases in gain on sale margins and lower volume. Residential mortgage loan originations decreased to $3.5 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022 from $4.7 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021. 

Net mortgage servicing revenue increased $31 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021 primarily due to a decrease in net negative valuation adjustments and an increase in gross mortgage servicing fees. Refer to Table 8 for the components of net valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio and the impact of the non-qualifying hedging strategy.

(a) Primarily reflects changes in prepayment speed and OAS assumptions which are updated based on market interest rates. 

(b) Primarily reflects changes due to realized cash flows and the passage of time. 

For the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, the Bancorp recognized income of $137 million and $71 million, respectively, in mortgage banking net revenue for valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio. The valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio included increases of $190 million and $152 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, due to changes in market rates and other inputs in the valuation model, including future prepayment speeds and OAS assumptions . Mortgage rates increased during the three months ended March 31, 2022, which resulted in a reduction to modeled prepayment speeds and a widening of the spread between mortgage rates and swap rates. There was also an increase in the modeled OAS assumptions for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The fair value of the MSR portfolio decreased $53 million and $81 million as a result of contractual principal payments and actual prepayment activity for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Further detail on the valuation of MSRs can be found in Note 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the valuation of the MSR portfolio. Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the free-standing derivatives used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio. 

In addition to the derivative positions used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio, the Bancorp acquires various securities as a component of its non-qualifying hedging strategy. The Bancorp recognized net losses of $1 million and $2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, recorded in securities losses, net &#8211; non-qualifying hedges on mortgage servicing rights in the Bancorp&#8217;s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s total residential mortgage loans serviced as of March 31, 2022 and 2021 were $114.5 billion and $86.7 billion, respectively, with $97.7 billion and $65.9 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage loans serviced for others.

Compensation and benefits expense increased $5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by the impact of a special broad-based compensation bonus granted in the first quarter of 2022, partially offset by a decrease in non-qualified deferred compensation expense. Full-time equivalent employees totaled 19,247 at March 31, 2022 compared to 19,819 at March 31, 2021. 

Technology and communications expense increased $8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by increased investment in strategic initiatives and technology. Card and processing expense decreased $11

million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to contract renegotiations with a third-party vendor. 

The following table presents the components of other noninterest expense:

Other noninterest expense increased $7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in travel expense and losses and adjustments, partially offset by a decrease in loan and lease expense. 

Travel expense increased $9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year due to the gradual cessation of travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Losses and adjustments increased $7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a smaller net benefit from changes in credit valuation adjustments on customer accommodation derivatives, partially offset by a decrease in legal settlements. Loan and lease expense decreased $4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by lower collection costs. 

Applicable Income Taxes 

The Bancorp&#8217;s income before income taxes, applicable income tax expense and effective tax rate are as follows: 

TABLE 12: Applicable Income Taxes For the three months ended March 31, ($ in millions) 2022 2021 Income before income taxes $ 612 &#160; 883 Applicable income tax expense 118 &#160; 189 Effective tax rate 19.2 &#160; &#160;% 21.4 

Applicable income tax expense for all periods includes the benefit from tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments, and tax credits (and other related tax benefits), partially offset by the effect of proportional amortization of qualifying LIHTC investments and certain nondeductible expenses. The tax credits are primarily associated with the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program established under Section 42 of the IRC, the New Markets Tax Credit program established under Section 45D of the IRC, the Rehabilitation Investment Tax Credit program established under Section 47 of the IRC and the Qualified Zone Academy Bond program established under Section 1397E of the IRC. 

The effective tax rate decreased to 19.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to 21.4% for the same period in the prior year primarily related to an increase in excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation.

Loans and Leases 

The Bancorp classifies its commercial loans and leases based upon primary purpose and consumer loans based upon product or collateral. Table 13 summarizes end of period loans and leases, including loans and leases held for sale, and Table 14 summarizes average total loans and leases, including average loans and leases held for sale. &#160;

(a) Includes $737 million and $1.3 billion as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, related to the SBA&#8217;s Paycheck Protection Program. 

Total loans and leases, including loans and leases held for sale, increased $2.0 billion from December 31, 2021. The increase from December 31, 2021 was the result of a $2.7 billion, or 4%, increase in commercial loans and leases, partially offset by a $656 million, or 1%, decrease in consumer loans. 

Commercial loans and leases increased $2.7 billion from December 31, 2021 due to increases in commercial and industrial loans, commercial mortgage loans and commercial construction loans, partially offset by a decrease in commercial leases. Commercial and industrial loans increased $2.3 billion, or 4%, from December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of increased revolving line of credit utilization and stronger production, partially offset by PPP loan forgiveness and paydowns. Commercial mortgage loans increased $365 million, or 4%, from December 31, 2021 as loan originations exceeded payoffs. Commercial construction loans increased $179 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2021 as draws on existing commitments and loan originations exceeded payoffs. Commercial leases decreased $137 million, or 4%, from December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of seasonally lower production in the first quarter and a planned reduction in indirect non-relationship-based lease originations. 

Consumer loans decreased $656 million from December 31, 2021 primarily due to decreases in residential mortgage loans, home equity and credit card, partially offset by an increase in indirect secured consumer loans. Residential mortgage loans decreased $1.1 billion, or 5%, from December 31, 2021 primarily due to decreases in residential mortgage loans held for sale as the Bancorp sold government-guaranteed loans that were previously in forbearance programs. Home equity decreased $168 million, or 4%, from December 31, 2021 as payoffs exceeded loan originations. Credit card decreased $76 million, or 4%, from December 31, 2021 primarily due to seasonal paydowns on year-end balances. Indirect secured consumer loans increased $641 million, or 4%, from December 31, 2021 primarily driven by strong loan production. Indirect secured consumer production is expected to be lower in 2022 compared to 2021 (particularly indirect automobile lending), reflecting the Bancorp&#8217;s decision to improve returns on capital in light of current market dynamics.

Average loans and leases, including average loans and leases held for sale, increased $3.5 billion, or 3%, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of a $2.0 billion, or 3%, increase in average commercial loans and leases and a $1.5 billion, or 3%, increase in average consumer loans. 

Average commercial loans and leases increased $2.0 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in average commercial and industrial loans, partially offset by decreases in average commercial construction loans and average commercial leases. Average commercial and industrial loans increased $2.8 billion, or 6%, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by increased revolving line of credit utilization and stronger production, partially offset by PPP loan forgiveness and paydowns. Average commercial construction loans decreased $668 million, or 11%, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year as payoffs exceeded draws on existing commitments and loan originations. Average commercial leases decreased $187 million, or 6%, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of a planned reduction in indirect non-relationship-based lease originations. 

Average consumer loans increased $1.5 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year due to an increase in average indirect secured consumer loans, partially offset by decreases in average home equity, average residential mortgage loans, average other consumer loans and average credit card. Average indirect secured consumer loans increased $3.2 billion, or 23%, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by higher demand and other favorable market conditions, which contributed to increased loan production. Average home equity decreased $999 million, or 20%, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year as payoffs exceeded loan originations. Average residential mortgage loans decreased $265 million, or 1%, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreases in residential mortgage loans held for sale driven by a decline in mortgage originations. Average other consumer loans decreased $255 million, or 9%, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of payoffs exceeding loan originations. Average credit card decreased $188 million, or 10%, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in average balances per active account. 

Investment Securities 

The Bancorp uses investment securities as a means of managing interest rate risk, providing collateral for pledging purposes and for liquidity risk management. Total investment securities were $49.5 billion a nd $39.0 billion at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The taxable available-for-sale debt and other investment securities portfolio had an effective duration o f 5.4 at March 31, 2022 compared to 4.8 at December 31, 2021. 

Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale when, in management&#8217;s judgment, they may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, changes in market conditions. Securities that management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost. Debt securities are classified as trading when bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the ne ar term. At March 31, 2022, the B ancorp&#8217;s investment portfolio consisted primarily o f AAA-rated available-for-sale debt and other securities. The Bancorp held an immaterial amount of below-investment grade available-for-sale debt and other securities at bot h March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Bancorp recognized $7 million of impairment losses on its available-for-sale debt and other securities, included in securities (losses) gains, net, in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. These losses related to certain securities in unrealized loss positions that the Bancorp intended to sell prior to recovery of their amortized cost bases. The Bancorp did not consider these losses to be credit-related. 

At both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Bancorp completed its evaluation of the available-for-sale debt and other securities in an unrealized loss position and did not recognize an allowance for credit losses. The Bancorp did not recognize provision expense related to available-for-sale debt and other securities in an unrealized loss position during the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. 

The following table summarizes the end of period components of investment securities:

(a) Other securities consist of FHLB, FRB and DTCC restricted stock hold ings that are carried at cost. 

On an amortized cost basis, available-for-sale debt and other securities in creased $13.2 billion from December 31, 2021 as a result of the deployment of excess short-term investments into longer duration assets in the investment portfolio in the first quarter of 2022. 

On an amortized cost basis, available-for-sale debt and other securities were 26% and 20% of total interest-earning assets at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The estimated weighted-average life of the debt securities in the available-for-sale debt and other securities port folio was 7.2 years at March 31, 2022 compared to 6.6 years at December 31, 2021. In addition, at March 31, 2022, the debt securities in the available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio had a weighted-average yield of 2.64% compared to 2.77% at December 31, 2021. 

Information presented in Table 16 is on a weighted-average life basis, anticipating future prepayments. Yield information is presented on an FTE basis and is computed using amortized cost balances and reflects the impact of prepayments. Maturity and yield calculations for the total available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio exclude other securities that have no stated yield or maturity. Total net unrealized losses on the available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio were $1.3 billion at March 31, 2022 compared to net unrealized gains of $1.2 billion at December 31, 2021. The fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. The fair value of the Bancorp&#8217;s investment securities portfolio generally increases when interest rates decrease or when credit spreads contract.

Other Short-Term Investments 

Other short-term investments primarily include overnight interest-earning investments, including reserves held at the FRB and federal funds sold. The Bancorp uses other short-term investments as part of its liquidity risk management tools. Other short-term investments wer e $20.5 billion and $34.6 billion at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The decrease of $14.1 billion from December 31, 2021 was primarily attributable to purchases of investment securities, loan growth and early redemptions under the par call options of long-term debt during the three months ended March 31, 2022. 

Deposits 

The Bancorp&#8217;s deposit balances represent an important source of funding and revenue growth opportunity. The Bancorp continues to focus on core deposit growth in its retail and commercial franchises by improving customer satisfaction, building full relationships and offering competitive rates. Average core deposits represented 81% and 77% of the Bancorp&#8217;s average asset funding base for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Core deposits increased $1.3 billion, or 1%, from December 31, 2021 primarily due to increases in savings deposits and demand deposits, partially offset by decreases in money market deposits and CDs $250,000 or less. Savings deposits increased $1.4 billion, or 6%, from December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of consumer balance growth. Demand deposits increased $502 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of consumer balance growth, partially offset by lower balances per commercial customer account. Money market deposits decreased $316 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of lower balances per commercial customer account, partially offset by higher balances per consumer customer account. CDs $250,000 or less decreased $219 million, or 9%, from December 31, 2021 primarily due to lower offering rates.

On an average basis, core deposits increased $10.7 billion, or 7%, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by increases in average demand deposits, average savings deposits and average interest checking deposits, partially offset by decreases in average CDs $250,000 or less and average money market deposits. Average demand deposits increased $5.6 billion, or 10%, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of higher average balances per customer account as well as growth in the number of accounts. Average savings deposits increased $3.8 billion, or 20%, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of higher average balances per customer account. Average interest checking deposits increased $3.1 billion, or 7%, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of higher average balances per customer account. Average CDs $250,000 or less decreased $1.5 billion, or 38% primarily due to lower offering rates. Average money market deposits decreased $338 million, or 1%, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of lower average balances per commercial account, partially offset by higher average balances per consumer customer account. 

Average CDs over $250,000 decreased $972 million, or 79%, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to maturities which were not replaced with new issuances given current market conditions and liquidity levels.

Next 12 months $ 2,013 13-24 months 284 25-36 months 96 37-48 months 66 49-60 months 38 After 60 months 4 Total CDs $ 2,501 

(a) Includes CDs $250,000 or less and CDs over $250,000. 

Deposit insurance 

The FDIC generally provides a standard amount of insurance of $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category defined by the FDIC. Depositors may qualify for coverage of accounts over $250,000 if they have funds in different ownership categories and all FDIC requirements are met. All deposits that an account holder has in the same ownership category at the same bank are added together and insured up to the standard insurance amount. As of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, approximately $79.7 billion and $80.2 billion, respectively, of the Bancorp&#8217;s domestic deposits were uninsured, including $491 million and $468 million, respectively, of time deposits. Where information is not readily available to determine the amount of insured deposits, the amount of uninsured deposits is estimated, consistent with the methodologies and assumptions utilized in providing information to the Bank&#8217;s regulators. 

Borrowings 

The Bancorp accesses a variety of short-term and long-term funding sources. Borrowings with original maturities of one year or less are classified as short-term and include federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings. Total average borrowings as a percent of average interest-bearing liabilities we re 11% a nd 14% for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

The following table summarizes the end of period components of borrowings: 

TABLE 20: Components of Borrowings As of ($ in millions) March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Federal funds purchased $ 250 &#160; 281 Other short-term borrowings 872 &#160; 980 Long-term debt 10,815 &#160; 11,821 Total borrowings $ 11,937 &#160; 13,082 

Total borr owings decreased $1.1 billion, or 9%, fro m December 31, 2021 primarily due to decreases in long-term debt and other short-term borrowings. Long-term d ebt decreased $1.0 billion from December 31, 2021 primarily driven by the early redemptions under the par call options of $800 million of notes, $152 million of fair value adjustments associated with interest rate swaps hedging long-term debt and $52 million of paydo wns on long-term debt associated with automobile loan securitizations during the three months ended March 31, 2022. For further information on a subsequent event related to long-term debt, refer to Note 22 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Other short-term borrowings decreased $108 million from December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of a decrease in derivative collateral driven by market fluctuations as well as a decrease in securities sold under repurchase agreements driven by a decrease in commercial customer activity. T he level of other short-term borrowings can fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on funding needs and the sources that are used to satisfy those needs. For further information on the components of other short-term borrowings, ref er to Note 14 of th e Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The following table summarizes components of average borrowings for the three months ended:

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Total average borrowin gs decreased $4.1 billion, or 25%, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreases in average long-term debt and average other short-term borrowings. Average long-term deb t decreased $3.7 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same peri od in the prior year primarily driven by the early redemptions under the par call options of $4.0 billion of notes, $144 million of fair value adjustments associated with interest rate swaps hedging long-term debt and $315 million of paydowns on long-term debt associated with automobile loan securitizations since March 31, 2021. These decreases were partially offset by the issuance of $500 million of senior fixed-rate/floating-rate notes in November of 2021. Average other short-term borrowings decreased $319 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of a decrease in derivative collateral driven by market fluctuations as well as a decrease in securities sold under repurchase agreements driven by a decrease in commercial customer activity . Information on the average rates paid on borrowings is discussed in the Net Interest Income subsection of the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&#38;A. In addition, refer to the Liquidity Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A for a discussion on the role of borrowings in the Bancorp&#8217;s liquidity management. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

BUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW 

The Bancorp reports on four business segments: Commercial Banking, Branch Banking, Consumer Lending and Wealth and Asset Management. Additional information on each business segment is included in Note 21 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of the Bancorp&#8217;s business segments are presented based on its management structure and management accounting practices. The structure and accounting practices are specific to the Bancorp; therefore, the financial results of the Bancorp&#8217;s business segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial institutions. The Bancorp refines its methodologies from time to time as management&#8217;s accounting practices and businesses change. 

The Bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the corporate level. By employing an FTP methodology, the business segments are insulated from most benchmark interest rate volatility, enabling them to focus on serving customers through the origination of loans and acceptance of deposits. The FTP methodology assigns charge and credit rates to classes of assets and liabilities, respectively, based on the estimated amount and timing of cash flows for each transaction. Assigning the FTP rate based on matching the duration of cash flows allocates interest income and interest expense to each business segment so its resulting net interest income is insulated from future changes in benchmark interest rates. The Bancorp&#8217;s FTP methodology also allocates the contribution to net interest income of the asset-generating and deposit-providing businesses on a duration-adjusted basis to better attribute the driver of the performance. As the asset and liability durations are not perfectly matched, the residual impact of the FTP methodology is captured in General Corporate and Other. The charge and credit rates are determined using the FTP rate curve, which is based on an estimate of Fifth Third&#8217;s marginal borrowing cost in the wholesale funding markets. The FTP curve is constructed using the U.S. swap curve, brokered CD pricing and unsecured debt pricing. 

The Bancorp adjusts the FTP charge and credit rates as dictated by changes in interest rates for various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and by the review of behavioral assumptions, such as prepayment rates on interest-earning assets and the estimated durations for indeterminate-lived deposits. Key assumptions, including the credit rates provided for deposit accounts, are reviewed annually. Credit rates for deposit products and charge rates for loan products may be reset more frequently in response to changes in market conditions. In general, the charge rates on assets decreased throughout 2021, but have increased since December 31, 2021 as they were affected by the prevailing level of interest rates and by the duration and repricing characteristics of the portfolio. The credit rates for deposit products also increased since December 31, 2021, due to higher interest rates and modified assumptions. Thus, net interest income for asset-generating business segments was negatively impacted by the rates charged on assets while deposit-providing business segments were positively impacted during the three months ended March 31, 2022. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s methodology for allocating provision for credit losses to the business segments includes charges or benefits associated with changes in criticized commercial loan levels in addition to actual net charge-offs experienced by the loans and leases owned by each business segment. Provision for credit losses attributable to loan and lease growth and changes in ALLL factors is captured in General Corporate and Other. The financial results of the business segments include allocations for shared services and headquarters expenses. Additionally, the business segments form synergies by taking advantage of relationship depth opportunities and funding operations by accessing the capital markets as a collective unit. 

The following table summarizes net income (loss) by business segment:
