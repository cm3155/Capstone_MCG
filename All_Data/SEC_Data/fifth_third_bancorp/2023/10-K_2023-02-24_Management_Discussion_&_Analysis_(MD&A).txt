 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following is Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of certain significant factors that have affected Fifth Third Bancorp&#8217;s (the &#8220;Bancorp&#8221; or &#8220;Fifth Third&#8221;) financial condition and results of operations during the periods included in the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are a part of this filing. Reference to the Bancorp incorporates the parent holding company and all consolidated subsidiaries. The Bancorp&#8217;s banking subsidiary is referred to as the Bank. 

OVERVIEW 

This overview of MD&#38;A highlights selected information in the financial results of the Bancorp and may not contain all of the information that is important to you. For a more complete understanding of trends, events, commitments, uncertainties, liquidity, capital resources and critical accounting policies and estimates, you should carefully read this entire document. Each of these items could have an impact on the Bancorp&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, refer to the Glossary of Abbreviations and Acronyms in this report for a list of terms included as a tool for the reader of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The abbreviations and acronyms identified therein are used throughout this MD&#38;A, as well as the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Net interest income, net interest margin, net interest rate spread and the efficiency ratio are presented in MD&#38;A on an FTE basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and leases and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. The FTE basis for presenting net interest income is a non-GAAP measure. For further information, refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of MD&#38;A. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s revenues are dependent on both net interest income and noninterest income. For the year ended December 31, 2022, net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income provided 67% and 33% of total revenue, respectively. The Bancorp derives the majority of its revenues within the U.S. from customers domiciled in the U.S. Revenue from foreign countries and external customers domiciled in foreign countries was immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2022. Changes in interest rates, credit quality, economic trends and the capital markets are primary factors that drive the performance of the Bancorp. As discussed later in the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A, risk identification, measurement, monitoring, control and reporting are important to the management of risk and to the financial performance and capital strength of the Bancorp. 

Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on assets such as loans, leases and securities, and interest expense incurred on liabilities such as deposits, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Net interest income is affected by the general level of interest rates, the relative level of short-term and long-term interest rates, changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Generally, the rates of interest the Bancorp earns on its assets and pays on its liabilities are established for a period of time. The change in market interest rates over time exposes the Bancorp to interest rate risk through potential adverse changes to net interest income and financial position. The Bancorp manages this risk by continually analyzing and adjusting the composition of its assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates, the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, the Bancorp enters into certain derivative transactions as part of its overall strategy to manage its interest rate and prepayment risks. The Bancorp is also exposed to the risk of loss on its loan and lease portfolio as a result of changing expected cash flows caused by borrower credit events, such as loan defaults and inadequate collateral. 

Noninterest income is derived from service charges on deposits, wealth and asset management revenue, commercial banking revenue, card and processing revenue, leasing business revenue, mortgage banking net revenue, other noninterest income and net securities gains or losses. Noninterest expense includes compensation and benefits, technology and communications, net occupancy expense, equipment expense, leasing business expense, marketing expense, card and processing expense and other noninterest expense. 

Current Economic Conditions 

Robust demand, labor shortages and supply chain constraints have led to persistent inflationary pressures throughout the economy. In response to these inflationary pressures, the FRB raised benchmark interest rates and may continue to raise interest rates in response to economic conditions, particularly a continued high rate of inflation. Amidst these uncertainties, some financial markets continued to experience volatility. 

Changes in interest rates can affect numerous aspects of the Bancorp&#8217;s business and may impact the Bancorp&#8217;s future performance. If financial markets remain volatile, this may impact the future performance of various segments of the Bancorp&#8217;s business, including the value of the Bancorp&#8217;s investment securities portfolio. The Bancorp continues to closely monitor the pace of inflation and the impacts of inflation on the larger market, including labor and supply chain impacts. 

For further discussion on current economic conditions, refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A. Additionally, refer to the Interest Rate and Price Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A for additional information about the Bancorp&#8217;s interest rate risk management activities.

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Accelerated Share Repurchase Transactions 

The Bancorp entered into and settled a number of accelerated share repurchase transactions during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. As part of these transactions, the Bancorp entered into forward contracts in which the final number of shares delivered at settlement was based generally on a discount to the average daily volume-weighted average price of the Bancorp&#8217;s common stock during the term of these repurchase agreements. Refer to Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on share repurchase activity. For further information on a subsequent event related to capital actions, refer to Note 32 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Senior Notes Offerings 

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Bancorp (including both the parent company and its banking subsidiary) issued and sold fixed-rate/floating-rate senior notes in a number of debt offerings. These transactions included: 

&#8226; A Bancorp issuance on April 25, 2022 of $1 billion of fixed-rate/floating-rate senior notes which included $400 million of notes maturing on April 25, 2028 and $600 million of notes maturing on April 25, 2033. 

&#8226; A Bancorp issuance o n July 28, 2022 of $1 billion of fixed-rate/floating-rate senior notes maturing on July 28, 2030. 

&#8226; A Bancorp issuance on October 27, 2022 of $1 billion of fixed-rate/floating-rate senior notes maturing on October 27, 2028. 

&#8226; A Bank issuance on October 27, 2022 of $1 billion of fixed-rate/floating-rate senior notes maturing on October 27, 2025. 

In each of these transactions, the parent company and banking subsidiary entered into interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges to convert the fixed-rate period of the notes to a floating rate of interest. For more information, refer to Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Business Combination 

During the second quarter of 2022, the Bancorp completed the acquisition of a national point-of-sale consumer lender specializing in home improvement and solar energy installation loans originated through a network of contractors and installers. The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting which generally requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recorded at their estimated fair values at acquisition date. These fair value estimates are considered preliminary as of December 31, 2022 and are subject to change for up to one year after the acquisition date as additional information becomes available. For more information on the acquisition, refer to Notes 10 and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

LIBOR Transition 

In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the &#8220;FCA&#8221;), which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA would stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. Since then, central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, have commissioned working groups of market participants and official sector representatives with the goal of finding suitable replacements for LIBOR. 

On March 5, 2021, the FCA and ICE Benchmark Administration, Limited announced that the publication of the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR maturities and non-USD LIBOR maturities would cease immediately after December 31, 2021, with the remaining USD LIBOR maturities ceasing immediately after June 30, 2023. In the United States, the Alternative Rates Reference Committee (the &#8220;ARRC&#8221;), a group of market participants convened in 2014 to help ensure a successful transition away from USD LIBOR, identified SOFR as its preferred alternative rate. SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. The composition and characteristics of SOFR are not the same as those of LIBOR, and SOFR is fundamentally different from LIBOR for two key reasons: (1) SOFR is a secured rate, while LIBOR is an unsecured rate, and (2) SOFR is an overnight rate, while LIBOR is a forward-looking rate that represents interbank funding over different maturities. As a result, there can be no assurance that SOFR, however calculated, will perform the same way as LIBOR would have at any time, including, as a result of changes in interest and yield rates in the market, market volatility, or global or regional economic, financial, political, regulatory, judicial or other events. 

On March 15, 2022, President Biden signed the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the &#8220;LIBOR Act&#8221;) into law. The LIBOR Act offers a federal solution for transitioning legacy instruments that lack sufficient provisions addressing LIBOR&#8217;s cessation by outlining a uniform process to govern the transition from LIBOR to a replacement rate. The LIBOR Act also establishes a safe harbor for lenders, shielding lenders from litigation as a result of their choice of a replacement rate (such as SOFR) per FRB recommendations. On December 16, 2022, the FRB issued its final regulations which carry out the terms of the LIBOR Act. These regulations: (i) address the applicability of the LIBOR Act to various LIBOR contracts, (ii) identify the FRB-selected benchmark replacements for various types of LIBOR contracts, (iii) include certain benchmark replacement conforming changes, (iv) address the issue of preemption and (v) provide other clarifications, definitions and information. The regulations will become effective on February 27, 2023, which is thirty (30) days after the regulations were published in the Federal Register. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s LIBOR transition plan is organized around key work streams, including continued engagement with central banks and industry working groups and regulators, active client engagement, comprehensive review of legacy documentation, internal operational and technological readiness, and risk management, among other things, to facilitate the transition to alternative reference rates. 

55 Fifth Third Bancorp 

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Although the full impact of LIBOR reforms and actions remains unclear, the Bancorp has discontinued entering into new LIBOR-based contracts in accordance with regulatory guidance, except for permissible limited use, such as part of hedging and risk management programs. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Bancorp expanded its offering of alternative reference rate products, including SOFR. In addition, the Bancorp is continuing its transition of existing LIBOR-based exposures to an appropriate alternative reference rate on or before June 30, 2023. As of December 31, 2022, the Bancorp had substantial exposure to LIBOR-based products throughout several of its lines of business. These exposures included derivative contracts with a total notional value of approximately $96 billion, loans outstanding of approximately $24 billion, preferred stock of approximately $1.4 billion and long-term debt of approximately $237 million. The Bancorp currently estimates that approximately 8% of the existing exposures will mature before June 30, 2023. For the contracts that will not mature prior to June 30, 2023, an additional portion of these contracts is subject to contractual terms specifying alternative reference rates (&#8220;fallback provisions&#8221;) that would become effective upon cessation of LIBOR&#8217;s publication. Existing exposures without fallback provisions are expected to either be amended prior to June 30, 2023 to include such provisions or to transition to an alternative reference rate pursuant to the terms of the LIBOR Act and its related regulations. 

For a further discussion of the various risks the Bancorp faces in connection with the replacement of LIBOR on its operations, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Market Risks&#8212;The replacement of LIBOR could adversely affect Fifth Third&#8217;s revenue or expenses and the value of those assets or obligations.&#8221; in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Key Performance Indicators 

The Bancorp, as a banking institution, utilizes various key indicators of financial condition and operating results in managing and monitoring the performance of the business. In addition to traditional financial metrics, such as revenue and expense trends, the Bancorp monitors other financial measures that assist in evaluating growth trends, capital strength and operational efficiencies. The Bancorp analyzes these key performance indicators against its past performance, its forecasted performance and with the performance of its peer banking institutions. These indicators may change from time to time as the operating environment and businesses change. 

The following are some of the key indicators used by management to assess the Bancorp&#8217;s business performance, including those which are considered in the Bancorp&#8217;s compensation programs: 

&#8226; CET1 Capital Ratio: CET1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets as defined by the Basel III standardized approach to risk-weighting of assets 

&#8226; Return on Average Tangible Common Equity (non-GAAP): Tangible net income available to common shareholders divided by average tangible common equity 

&#8226; Return on Average Common Equity, Excluding AOCI (non-GAAP): Net income available to common shareholders divided by total equity, excluding AOCI and preferred stock 

&#8226; Net Interest Margin (non-GAAP): Net interest income on an FTE basis divided by average interest-earning assets 

&#8226; Efficiency Ratio (non-GAAP): Noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income 

&#8226; Earnings Per Share, Diluted: Net income allocated to common shareholders divided by average common shares outstanding after the effect of dilutive stock-based awards 

&#8226; Nonperforming Portfolio Assets Ratio: Nonperforming portfolio assets divided by portfolio loans and leases and OREO 

&#8226; Net Charge-off Ratio: Net losses charged-off divided by average portfolio loans and leases 

&#8226; Return on Average Assets: Net income divided by average assets 

&#8226; Loan-to-Deposit Ratio: Total loans divided by total deposits 

&#8226; Household Growth: Change in the number of consumer households with retail relationship-based checking accounts 

The list of indicators above is intended to summarize some of the most important metrics utilized by management in evaluating the Bancorp&#8217;s performance and does not represent an all-inclusive list of all performance measures that may be considered relevant or important to management or investors.

Earnings Summary 

The Bancorp&#8217;s net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $2.3 billion, or $3.35 per diluted share, which was net of $116 million in preferred stock dividends. The Bancorp&#8217;s net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $2.7 billion, or $3.73 per diluted share, which was net of $111 million in preferred stock dividends. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $5.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $843 million compared to the prior year. Net interest income benefited from increases in market interest rates, resulting in increases in yields on average loans and leases and average other short-term investments for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year. Net interest income also benefited from increases in average taxable securities and average commercial and industrial loans for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year. These positive impacts were partially offset by an increase in rates paid on average interest-bearing core deposits, an increase in the average balance of FHLB advances and an increase in rates paid on average long-term debt as well as a decrease in interest income recognized from PPP loans for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year. Net interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 3.02% for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2.59% for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

The provision for credit losses was $563 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to a benefit from credit losses of $377 million in the prior year. Provision expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year primarily driven by factors which caused increases in the ACL during the year ended December 31, 2022 including deterioration in forecasted macroeconomic conditions and higher period-end loan and lease balances, primarily driven by commercial and industrial loan growth, originations of point-of-sale solar energy installation loans in the second half of 2022 and loans acquired in a business acquisition completed in the second quarter of 2022. Net losses charged off as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases were 0.19% and 0.16% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. At December 31, 2022, nonperforming portfolio assets as a percent of portfolio loans and leases and OREO decreased to 0.44% compared to 0.47% at December 31, 2021. For further discussion on credit quality, refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A as well as Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Noninterest income decreased $352 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to an increase in securities losses as well as decreases in commercial banking revenue, other noninterest income, leasing business revenue and mortgage banking net revenue. 

Noninterest expense decreased $29 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to decreases in compensation and benefits expense and card and processing expense, partially offset by increases in technology and communications, other noninterest expense and marketing expense. 

For more information on net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense, refer to the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&#38;A.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 

The following are non-GAAP financial measures which provide useful insight to the reader of the Consolidated Financial Statements but should be supplemental to primary U.S. GAAP measures and should not be read in isolation or relied upon as a substitute for the primary U.S. GAAP measures. The Bancorp encourages readers to consider its Consolidated Financial Statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. 

The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and leases and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. 

The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of net interest income on an FTE basis, interest income on an FTE basis, net interest margin, net interest rate spread and the efficiency ratio to U.S. GAAP:

Pre-provision net revenue is net interest income plus noninterest income minus noninterest expense. The Bancorp believes this measure is important because it provides a ready view of the Bancorp&#8217;s pre-tax earnings before the impact of provision expense.

The Bancorp believes return on average tangible common equity is an important measure for comparative purposes with other financial institutions, but is not defined under U.S. GAAP, and therefore is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. This measure is useful for evaluating the performance of a business as it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization.

The Bancorp considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including the tangible equity ratio and tangible common equity ratio, in addition to capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies. These calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies for both absolute and comparative purposes. As U.S. GAAP does not include capital ratio measures, the Bancorp believes there are no comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures to these ratios. These ratios are not formally defined by U.S. GAAP or codified in the federal banking regulations and, therefore, are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures.

RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 

Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides a discussion of the significant new accounting standard applicable to the Bancorp during 2022 and the expected impact of significant accounting standards issued, but not yet required to be adopted. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The Bancorp&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain accounting policies require management to exercise judgment in determining methodologies, economic assumptions and estimates that may materially affect the Bancorp&#8217;s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Bancorp&#8217;s critical accounting policies include the accounting for the ALLL, reserve for unfunded commitments, valuation of servicing rights, fair value measurements, goodwill and legal contingencies. There have been no material changes to the valuation techniques or models described below during the year ended December 31, 2022. 

ALLL 

The Bancorp disaggregates its portfolio loans and leases into portfolio segments for purposes of determining the ALLL. The Bancorp&#8217;s portfolio segments include commercial, residential mortgage and consumer. The Bancorp further disaggregates its portfolio segments into classes for purposes of monitoring and assessing credit quality based on certain risk characteristics. For an analysis of the Bancorp&#8217;s ALLL by portfolio segment and credit quality information by class, refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Bancorp maintains the ALLL to absorb the amount of credit losses that are expected to be incurred over the remaining contractual terms of the related loans and leases. Contractual terms are adjusted for expected prepayments but are not extended for expected extensions, renewals or modifications except in circumstances where the Bancorp reasonably expects to execute a TDR with the borrower or where certain extension or renewal options are embedded in the original contract and not unconditionally cancellable by the Bancorp. Accrued interest receivable on loans is presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements as a component of other assets. When accrued interest is deemed to be uncollectible (typically when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status), interest income is reversed. The Bancorp follows established policies for placing loans on nonaccrual status, so uncollectible accrued interest receivable is reversed in a timely manner. As a result, the Bancorp has elected not to measure a reserve for accrued interest receivable as part of its ALLL. However, the Bancorp does record a reserve for the portion of accrued interest receivable that it expects to be uncollectible. For additional information on the Bancorp&#8217;s accounting policies related to nonaccrual loans and leases, refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Credit losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the ALLL. The ALLL is maintained at a level the Bancorp considers to be adequate and is based on ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations of the collectability of loans and leases, including historical credit loss experience, current and forecasted market and economic conditions and consideration of various qualitative factors that, in management&#8217;s judgment, deserve consideration in estimating expected credit losses. Provisions for credit losses are recorded for the amounts necessary to adjust the ALLL to the Bancorp&#8217;s current estimate of expected credit losses on portfolio loans and leases. The Bancorp&#8217;s strategy for credit risk management includes a combination of conservative exposure limits significantly below legal lending limits and conservative underwriting, documentation and collections standards. The strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level, regular credit examinations and quarterly management reviews of large credit exposures and loans experiencing deterioration of credit quality. Refer to the Credit Risk Management section of MD&#38;A for additional information. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s methodology for determining the ALLL requires significant management judgment and includes an estimate of expected credit losses on a collective basis for groups of loans and leases with similar risk characteristics and specific allowances for loans and leases which are individually evaluated. 

Larger commercial loans and leases included within aggregate borrower relationship balances exceeding $1 million that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses, as well as loans that have been modified in a TDR, are individually evaluated for an ALLL. The Bancorp considers the current value of collateral, credit quality of any guarantees, the guarantor&#8217;s liquidity and willingness to cooperate, the loan or lease structure and other factors when determining the amount of the ALLL. Other factors may include the borrower&#8217;s susceptibility to risks presented by the forecasted macroeconomic environment, the industry and geographic region of the borrower, size and financial condition of the borrower, cash flow and leverage of the borrower and the Bancorp&#8217;s evaluation of the borrower&#8217;s management. Significant management judgment is required when evaluating which of these factors are most relevant in individual circumstances, and when estimating the amount of expected credit losses based on those factors. When loans and leases are individually evaluated, allowances are determined based on management&#8217;s estimate of the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay the loan or lease given the availability of collateral and other sources of cash flow, as well as an evaluation of legal options available to the Bancorp. Allowances for individually evaluated loans and leases that are collateral-dependent are measured based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, less expected costs to sell where applicable. Individually evaluated loans and leases that are not collateral-dependent are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan&#8217;s effective interest rate. The Bancorp evaluates the collectability of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual. Specific allowances on individually evaluated commercial loans and leases, including TDRs, are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower and/or collateral conditions and actual collection and charge-off experience. 

Consumer and residential mortgage loans that have been modified in a TDR are individually evaluated for an ALLL. Allowances for individually evaluated loans that are collateral-dependent are typically measured based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, less expected costs to sell where applicable. Individually evaluated loans that are not collateral-dependent are measured based on the present value 

61 Fifth Third Bancorp 

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan&#8217;s effective interest rate and a modeled expected credit loss amount. The Bancorp evaluates the collectability of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual. Specific allowances on individually evaluated consumer and residential mortgage loans are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower and/or collateral conditions and actual collection and charge-off experience. 

Expected credit losses are estimated on a collective basis for loans and leases that are not individually evaluated. These include commercial loans and leases that do not meet the criteria for individual evaluation as well as homogeneous loans in the residential mortgage and consumer portfolio segments. For collectively evaluated loans and leases, the Bancorp uses models to forecast expected credit losses based on the probability of a loan or lease defaulting, the expected balance at the estimated date of default and the expected loss percentage given a default. The estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers prepayments and, for loans with available credit, expected utilization rates. The Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models were developed based on historical credit loss experience and observations of migration patterns for various credit risk characteristics (such as internal credit risk grades, external credit ratings or scores, delinquency status, loan-to-value trends, etc.) over time, with those observations evaluated in the context of concurrent macroeconomic conditions. The Bancorp developed its models from historical observations capturing a full economic cycle when possible. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models consider historical credit loss experience, current market and economic conditions, and forecasted changes in market and economic conditions if such forecasts are considered reasonable and supportable. Generally, the Bancorp considers its forecasts to be reasonable and supportable for a period of up to three years from the estimation date. For periods beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period, expected credit losses are estimated by reverting to historical loss information without adjustment for changes in economic conditions. This reversion is phased in over a two-year period. The Bancorp evaluates the length of its reasonable and supportable forecast period, its reversion period and reversion methodology at least annually, or more often if warranted by economic conditions or other circumstances. 

The Bancorp also considers qualitative factors in determining the ALLL. These considerations inherently require significant management judgment to determine the appropriate factors to be considered and the extent of their impact on the ALLL estimate. Qualitative factors are used to capture characteristics in the portfolio that impact expected credit losses but that are not fully captured within the Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models. These include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, lending and risk management personnel and results of internal audit and quality control reviews. These may also include adjustments, when deemed necessary, for specific idiosyncratic risks such as geopolitical events, natural disasters and their effects on regional borrowers and changes in product structures. Qualitative factors may also be used to address the impacts of unforeseen events on key inputs and assumptions within the Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models, such as the reasonable and supportable forecast period, changes to historical loss information or changes to the reversion period or methodology. When evaluating the adequacy of allowances, consideration is also given to regional geographic concentrations and the closely associated effect that changing economic conditions may have on the Bancorp&#8217;s customers. 

Overall, the collective evaluation process requires significant management judgment when determining the estimation methodology and inputs into the models, as well as in evaluating the reasonableness of the modeled results and the appropriateness of qualitative adjustments. The Bancorp&#8217;s forecasts of market and economic conditions and the internal risk grades assigned to loans and leases in the commercial portfolio segment are examples of inputs to the expected credit loss models that require significant management judgment. These inputs have the potential to drive significant variability in the resulting ALLL. 

Refer to the Allowance for Credit Losses subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A for a discussion on the Bancorp&#8217;s ALLL sensitivity analysis. 

Reserve for Unfunded Commitments 

The reserve for unfunded commitments is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated expected credit losses related to unfunded credit facilities and is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The determination of the adequacy of the reserve is based upon expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life of the commitments, taking into consideration the current funded balance and estimated exposure over the reasonable and supportable forecast period. This process takes into consideration the same risk elements that are analyzed in the determination of the adequacy of the Bancorp&#8217;s ALLL, as previously discussed. Net adjustments to the reserve for unfunded commitments are included in the provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Valuation of Servicing Rights 

When the Bancorp sells loans through either securitizations or individual loan sales in accordance with its investment policies, it often obtains servicing rights. The Bancorp may also purchase servicing rights. The Bancorp has elected to measure all existing classes of its residential mortgage servicing rights at fair value at each reporting date with changes in the fair value of servicing rights reported in earnings in the period in which the changes occur. Servicing rights are valued using internal OAS models. Significant management judgment is necessary to identify key economic assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the servicing rights including the prepayment speeds of the underlying loans, the weighted-average life, the OAS and the weighted-average coupon rate, as applicable. The primary risk of material changes to the value of the servicing rights resides in the potential volatility in the economic assumptions used, particularly the prepayment speeds. In order to assist in the assessment of the fair value of servicing rights, the Bancorp obtains external valuations of the servicing rights portfolio from 

62 Fifth Third Bancorp 

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

third parties and participates in peer surveys that provide additional confirmation of the reasonableness of the key assumptions utilized in the internal OAS model. For additional information on servicing rights, refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Fair Value Measurements 

The Bancorp measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Bancorp employs various valuation approaches to measure fair value including the market, income and cost approaches. The market approach uses prices or relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach involves discounting future amounts to a single present amount and is based on current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of the asset. 

U.S. GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). A financial instrument&#8217;s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the instrument&#8217;s fair value measurement. For additional information on the fair value hierarchy and fair value measurements, refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s fair value measurements involve various valuation techniques and models, which involve inputs that are observable, when available. Valuation techniques and parameters used for measuring assets and liabilities are reviewed and validated by the Bancorp on a quarterly basis. Additionally, the Bancorp monitors the fair values of significant assets and liabilities using a variety of methods including the evaluation of pricing runs and exception reports based on certain analytical criteria, comparison to previous trades and overall review and assessments for reasonableness. The level of management judgment necessary to determine fair value varies based upon the methods used in the determination of fair value. Financial instruments that are measured at fair value using quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) require minimal judgment. The valuation of financial instruments when quoted market prices are not available (Levels 2 and 3) may require significant management judgment to assess whether quoted prices for similar instruments exist, the impact of changing market conditions including reducing liquidity in the capital markets and the use of estimates surrounding significant unobservable inputs. Table 6 provides a summary of the fair value of financial instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis and the amounts of financial instruments valued using Level 3 inputs. 

##TABLE_START TABLE 6: Fair Value Summary As of ($ in millions) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Balance Level 3 Balance Level 3 Assets carried at fair value $ 57,002 &#160; 1,876 &#160; 43,685 1,287 As a percent of total assets 27 &#160; % 1 &#160; 21 1 Liabilities carried at fair value $ 4,130 &#160; 203 &#160; 2,310 222 As a percent of total liabilities 2 &#160; % &#8212; &#160; 1 &#8212; ##TABLE_END

Refer to Note 28 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on fair value measurements including a description of the valuation methodologies used for significant financial instruments. 

Goodwill 

Business combinations entered into by the Bancorp typically include the recognition of goodwill. U.S. GAAP requires goodwill to be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis, which the Bancorp performs as of September 30 each year, and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. 

Impairment exists when a reporting unit&#8217;s carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. In testing goodwill for impairment, U.S. GAAP permits the Bancorp to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. In this qualitative assessment, the Bancorp evaluates events and circumstances which may include, but are not limited to, the general economic environment, banking industry and market conditions, the overall financial performance of the Bancorp, the performance of the Bancorp&#8217;s common stock, the key financial performance metrics of the Bancorp&#8217;s reporting units and events affecting the reporting units to determine if it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the quantitative impairment test is required or the decision to bypass the qualitative assessment is elected, the Bancorp performs the goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. A recognized impairment loss cannot be reversed in future periods even if the fair value of the reporting unit subsequently recovers. 

The fair value of a reporting unit is the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As none of the Bancorp&#8217;s reporting units are publicly traded, individual reporting unit fair value determinations cannot be directly correlated to the Bancorp&#8217;s stock price. The determination of the fair value of a reporting unit is a 

63 Fifth Third Bancorp 

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments, particularly related to cash flows, the appropriate discount rates and an applicable control premium. The determination of the fair value of the Bancorp&#8217;s reporting units includes both an income-based approach and a market-based approach. The income-based approach utilizes the reporting unit&#8217;s forecasted cash flows (including a terminal value approach to estimate cash flows beyond the final year of the forecast) and the reporting unit&#8217;s estimated cost of equity as the discount rate. Significant management judgment is necessary in the preparation of each reporting unit&#8217;s forecasted cash flows surrounding expectations for earnings projections, growth and credit loss expectations and actual results may differ from forecasted results. Additionally, the Bancorp determines its market capitalization based on the average of the closing price of the Bancorp&#8217;s stock during the month including the measurement date, incorporating an additional control premium, and compares this market-based fair value measurement to the aggregate fair value of the Bancorp&#8217;s reporting units in order to corroborate the results of the income approach. Refer to Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Bancorp&#8217;s goodwill. 

Legal Contingencies 

The Bancorp and its subsidiaries are parties to numerous claims and lawsuits as well as threatened or potential actions or claims concerning matters arising from the conduct of its business activities. The outcome of claims or litigation and the timing of ultimate resolution are inherently difficult to predict and significant judgment may be required in the determination of both the probability of loss and whether the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. The Bancorp&#8217;s estimates are subjective and are based on the status of legal and regulatory proceedings, the merit of the Bancorp&#8217;s defenses and consultation with internal and external legal counsel. An accrual for a potential litigation loss is established when information related to the loss contingency indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Refer to Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Bancorp&#8217;s legal proceedings.

STATEMENTS OF INCOME ANALYSIS 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is the interest earned on loans and leases (including yield-related fees), securities and other short-term investments less the interest incurred on core deposits and wholesale funding. The net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets. Net interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is typically greater than net interest rate spread due to the interest income earned on those assets that are funded by noninterest-bearing liabilities, or free funding, such as demand deposits or shareholders&#8217; equity. 

Tables 7 and 8 present the components of net interest income, net interest margin and net interest rate spread for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, as well as the relative impact of changes in the average balance sheet and changes in interest rates on net interest income. Nonaccrual loans and leases and loans and leases held for sale have been included in the average loan and lease balances. Average outstanding securities balances are based on amortized cost with any unrealized gains or losses included in average other assets. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $5.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $843 million compared to the prior year. Net interest income benefited from increases in market interest rates, resulting in increases in yields of 54 bps on average loans and leases and 81 bps on average other short-term investments for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year. Net interest income also benefited from increases in average taxable securities and average commercial and industrial loans of $16.1 billion and $6.7 billion, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year. These positive impacts were partially offset by an increase in rates paid on average interest-bearing core deposits of 35 bps, an increase in the average balance of FHLB advances of $3.7 billion and an increase in rates paid on average long-term debt of 61 bps for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year. Interest income recognized from PPP loans decreased to $43 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $189 million for the prior year. 

Net interest rate spread on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.72% during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2.45% during the year ended December 31, 2021. Yields on average interest-earning assets increased 71 bps, partially offset by a 44 bps increase in rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Net interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 3.02% for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2.59% for the year ended December 31, 2021. Net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2022 was positively impacted by the previously mentioned increase in the net interest rate spread. Net interest margin results are expected to continue increasing, albeit at a slower pace, driven by the continued repricing of the Bancorp&#8217;s fixed-rate assets portfolios into higher rates and the benefits of expected continued growth of the Bancorp&#8217;s other consumer loan portfolio, partially offset by the impact of rising rates on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. 

Interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) from loans and leases increased $876 million from the year ended December 31, 2021 driven by the previously mentioned increases in market interest rates and average commercial and industrial loans, partially offset by lower income from PPP loans. For more information on the Bancorp&#8217;s loan and lease portfolio, refer to the Loans and Leases subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A. Interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) from investment securities and other short-term investments increased $504 million from the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to the previously mentioned increases in average taxable securities and yields on average other short-term investments. 

Interest expense on average core deposits increased $354 million from the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to an increase in the cost of average interest-bearing core deposits to 40 bps for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 5 bps for the year ended December 31, 2021, as a result of increasing short-term interest rates. Refer to the Deposits subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A for additional information on the Bancorp&#8217;s deposits. 

Interest expense on average wholesale funding increased $183 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to the previously mentioned increase in the average balance of FHLB advances and increase in rates paid on average long-term debt, partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of long-term debt of $1.2 billion from the prior year. Refer to the Borrowings subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A for additional information on the Bancorp&#8217;s borrowings. During the year ended December 31, 2022, average wholesale funding represented 15% of average interest-bearing liabilities compared to 13% for the year ended December 31, 2021. For more information on the Bancorp&#8217;s interest rate risk management, including estimated earnings sensitivity to changes in market interest rates, see the Interest Rate and Price Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A.

Provision for Credit Losses 

The Bancorp provides, as an expense, an amount for expected credit losses within the loan and lease portfolio and the portfolio of unfunded commitments and letters of credit that is based on factors previously discussed in the Critical Accounting Policies section of MD&#38;A. The provision is recorded to bring the ALLL and reserve for unfunded commitments to a level deemed appropriate by the Bancorp to cover losses expected in the portfolios. Actual credit losses on loans and leases are charged against the ALLL. The amount of loans and leases actually removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets are referred to as charge-offs. Net charge-offs include current period charge-offs less recoveries on previously charged-off loans and leases. 

The provision for credit losses was $563 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to a benefit from credit losses of $377 million in the prior year. Provision expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year primarily driven by factors which caused increases in the ACL during the year ended December 31, 2022 including deterioration in forecasted macroeconomic conditions and higher period-end loan and lease balances. The increase in period-end loan and lease balances was primarily driven by commercial and industrial loan growth, originations of point-of-sale solar energy installation loans in the second half of 2022 and loans acquired in a business acquisition completed in the second quarter of 2022. The economic forecasts used to estimate the ACL at December 31, 2022 were generally less favorable than those used at December 31, 2021, reflecting an inflationary environment, rising 

67 Fifth Third Bancorp 

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

interest rates and higher oil prices. The benefit from credit losses for year ended December 31, 2021 was driven by decreases in the ACL in response to improved economic forecasts and improved commercial and consumer credit quality. 

The ALLL increased $302 million from December 31, 2021 to $2.2 billion at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, the ALLL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases increased to 1.81%, compared to 1.69% at December 31, 2021. The reserve for unfunded commitments increased $34 million from December 31, 2021 to $216 million at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, the ACL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases increased to 1.98%, compared to 1.85% at December 31, 2021. 

Refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A as well as Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on the provision for credit losses, including an analysis of loan and lease portfolio composition, nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and other factors considered by the Bancorp in assessing the credit quality of the loan and lease portfolio and determining the level of the ACL. 

Noninterest Income 

Noninterest income decreased $352 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The following table presents the components of noninterest income:

Service charges on deposits 

Service charges on deposits decreased $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 due to a decrease in service charges on both commercial and consumer deposits. Service charges on commercial deposits were $434 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $3 million from the prior year primarily due to higher treasury management earnings credits driven by market interest rates, partially offset by an increase in commercial treasury management fees. Service charges on consumer deposits were $155 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $8 million from the prior year primarily due to a decrease in consumer deposit fees driven by the elimination of non-sufficient funds fees during 2022. 

Wealth and asset management revenue 

Wealth and asset management revenue decreased $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to decreases in private client service fees and securities income. The Bancorp&#8217;s trust and registered investment advisory businesses had approximately $510 billion and $554 billion in total assets under care as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and managed $55 billion and $65 billion in assets for individuals, corporations and not-for-profit organizations as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Commercial banking revenue 

Commercial banking revenue decreased $72 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to decreases in corporate bond fees, loan syndication fees, merger and acquisition fees and equity capital markets fees, partially offset by an increase in contract revenue from commercial customer derivatives as well as an increase in foreign exchange fees. 

Card and processing revenue 

Card and processing revenue increased $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to an increase in credit card interchange, partially offset by increased reward costs as well as a decrease in other electronic funds transfer income. The increases in credit card interchange and reward costs were primarily driven by an increase in consumer and business card spend volumes.

Leasing business revenue 

Leasing business revenue decreased $63 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily driven by decreases in lease syndication fees and leasing business solutions revenue, partially offset by an increase in lease remarketing fees. The decrease in leasing business solutions revenue was related to the disposition of LaSalle Solutions during the second quarter of 2022. 

Mortgage banking net revenue 

Mortgage banking net revenue decreased $55 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. 

The following table presents the components of mortgage banking net revenue: 

##TABLE_START TABLE 10: Components of Mortgage Banking Net Revenue For the years ended December 31 ($ in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Origination fees and gains on loan sales $ 91 &#160; 285 315 Net mortgage servicing revenue: Gross mortgage servicing fees 310 &#160; 247 263 Net valuation adjustments on MSRs and free-standing derivatives purchased to economically hedge MSRs 

(186) (262) (258) Net mortgage servicing revenue 124 &#160; (15) 5 Total mortgage banking net revenue $ 215 &#160; 270 320 ##TABLE_END

Origination fees and gains on loan sales decreased $194 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily driven by decreases in gain on sale margins and lower volumes of residential mortgage loan originations and sales as well as the impact of gains recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021 from sales of government-guaranteed loans that were previously in forbearance programs. Residential mortgage loan originations decreased to $14.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 from $19.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021 due primarily to the impact of higher market interest rates on refinance activity. 

The following table presents the components of net valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio and the impact of the non-qualifying hedging strategy.

For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Bancorp recognized income of $177 million and losses of $139 million, respectively, in mortgage banking net revenue for valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio. The valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio included increases of $355 million and $142 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, due to changes in market rates and other inputs in the valuation model, including future prepayment speeds and OAS assumptions. Mortgage rates increased during the year ended December 31, 2022 which caused a reduction in modeled prepayment speeds. There was also an increase in the modeled OAS assumptions for the year ended December 31, 2022. The fair value of the MSR portfolio also decreased $178 million and $281 million as a result of contractual principal payments and actual prepayment activity for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Further detail on the valuation of MSRs can be found in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the valuation of the MSR portfolio. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the free-standing derivatives used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio. 

In addition to the derivative positions used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio, the Bancorp acquires various securities as a component of its non-qualifying hedging strategy. The Bancorp recognized net losses of $2 million during both the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 recorded in securities (losses) gains, net - non-qualifying hedges on mortgage servicing rights in the Bancorp&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Income.

Other noninterest income decreased $67 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to decreases in gains on contract sales and private equity investment income. 

Gains on contract sales decreased $59 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021 as the prior year included the recognition of a $60 million gain on the sale of the Bancorp&#8217;s HSA deposit portfolio which was completed in the third quarter of 2021. Private equity investment income decreased $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year primarily driven by losses recognized on certain private equity investments.

Compensation and benefits expense decreased $72 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily driven by decreases in non-qualified deferred compensation expense and performance-based compensation, partially offset by the impact of a special broad-based compensation bonus granted in the first quarter of 2022, the additional personnel costs of an acquired business and the impact of raising the Bancorp&#8217;s minimum wage in the third quarter of 2022. Full-time equivalent employees totaled 19,319 at December 31, 2022 compared to 19,112 at December 31, 2021. 

Technology and communications expense increased $28 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily driven by increased investment in strategic initiatives and technology. 

Marketing expense increased $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to an increase in account acquisition programs.

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Card and processing expense decreased $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to contract renegotiations with a third-party vendor, partially offset by increased association network charges as a result of increased credit card spend.

Other noninterest expense increased $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to increases in travel expense, losses and adjustments and FDIC insurance and other taxes, partially offset by a decrease in loan and lease expense. 

Travel expense increased $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 due to an increase in travel as a result of the gradual cessation of travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Losses and adjustments increased $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to a reduction in the net benefit from changes in credit valuation adjustments on customer accommodation derivatives and an increase in operational losses. FDIC insurance and other taxes increased $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of an increase in the FDIC insurance assessment rate. Loan and lease expense decreased $50 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily driven by a decrease in loan servicing expenses related to the Bancorp&#8217;s sales of certain government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans that were previously in forbearance programs and serviced by a third party. 

Applicable Income Taxes 

Applicable income tax expense for all periods presented includes the benefit from tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments, certain gains on sales of leveraged leases that are exempt from federal taxation and tax credits (and other related tax benefits), partially offset by the effect of proportional amortization of qualifying LIHTC investments and certain nondeductible expenses. The tax credits are primarily associated with the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program established under Section 42 of the IRC, the New Markets Tax Credit program established under Section 45D of the IRC, the Rehabilitation Investment Tax Credit program established under Section 47 of the IRC and the Qualified Zone Academy Bond program established under Section 1397E of the IRC. 

The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were primarily impacted by $219 million and $193 million, respectively, of low-income housing tax credits and other tax benefits and $26 million and $23 million, respectively, of tax benefits from tax exempt income and were partially offset by $189 million and $163 million, respectively, of proportional amortization related to qualifying LIHTC investments.

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

BUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW 

During the third quarter of 2022, the Bancorp reorganized its management reporting structure and now reports on three business segments: Commercial Banking, Consumer and Small Business Banking and Wealth and Asset Management. Additional information on each business segment is included in Note 31 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior period results have been adjusted to conform to the new segment presentation. Results of the Bancorp&#8217;s business segments are presented based on its management structure and management accounting practices. The structure and accounting practices are specific to the Bancorp; therefore, the financial results of the Bancorp&#8217;s business segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial institutions. The Bancorp refines its methodologies from time to time as management&#8217;s accounting practices and businesses change. 

The Bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the corporate level. By employing an FTP methodology, the business segments are insulated from most benchmark interest rate volatility, enabling them to focus on serving customers through the origination of loans and acceptance of deposits. The FTP methodology assigns charge and credit rates to classes of assets and liabilities, respectively, based on the estimated amount and timing of cash flows for each transaction. Assigning the FTP rate based on matching the duration of cash flows allocates interest income and interest expense to each business segment so its resulting net interest income is insulated from future changes in benchmark interest rates. The Bancorp&#8217;s FTP methodology also allocates the contribution to net interest income of the asset-generating and deposit-providing businesses on a duration-adjusted basis to better attribute the driver of the performance. As the asset and liability durations are not perfectly matched, the residual impact of the FTP methodology is captured in General Corporate and Other. The charge and credit rates are determined using the FTP rate curve, which is based on an estimate of Fifth Third&#8217;s marginal borrowing cost in the wholesale funding markets. The FTP curve is constructed using the U.S. swap curve, brokered CD pricing and unsecured debt pricing. The Bancorp&#8217;s FTP methodology was not adjusted during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. 

The Bancorp adjusts the FTP charge and credit rates as dictated by changes in interest rates for various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and by the review of behavioral assumptions, such as prepayment rates on interest-earning assets and the estimated durations for indeterminate-lived deposits. Key assumptions, including the credit rates provided for deposit accounts, are reviewed annually. Credit rates for deposit products and charge rates for loan products may be reset more frequently in response to changes in market conditions. In general, the charge rates on assets have increased since December 31, 2021 as they were affected by the prevailing level of interest rates and by the duration and repricing characteristics of the portfolio. The credit rates for deposit products also increased since December 31, 2021, due to higher interest rates and modified assumptions. Thus, net interest income for asset-generating business segments was negatively impacted by the rates charged on assets while deposit-providing business segments were positively impacted during the year ended December 31, 2022. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s methodology for allocating provision for credit losses to the business segments includes charges or benefits associated with changes in criticized commercial loan levels in addition to actual net charge-offs experienced by the loans and leases owned by each business segment. Provision for credit losses attributable to loan and lease growth and changes in ALLL factors is captured in General Corporate and Other. The financial results of the business segments include allocations for shared services and headquarters expenses. Additionally, the business segments form synergies by taking advantage of relationship depth opportunities and funding operations by accessing the capital markets as a collective unit.

The provision for credit losses increased $290 million from the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily driven by factors which caused increases in the ACL during the year ended December 31, 2022 including deterioration in forecasted macroeconomic conditions and higher period-end loan and lease balances, partially offset by the impact of allocations to the business segments. 

Noninterest income decreased $119 million from the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily driven by a $60 million gain on the sale of the Bancorp&#8217;s HSA deposit portfolio in the third quarter of 2021, a decrease in private equity investment income and an increase in net securities losses. 

Noninterest expense decreased $92 million from the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily driven by a decrease in compensation and benefits due to a decrease in non-qualified deferred compensation expense. The decrease also included the impact of an increase in corporate overhead allocations from General Corporate and Other to the other business segments partially offset by increases in technology and communications expense and travel expense. 

Comparison of the year ended 2021 with 2020 

Net interest income on an FTE basis increased $709 million from the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily driven by decreases in FTP credit rates on deposits allocated to the business segments, an increase in interest income on PPP loans and decreases in interest expense on long-term debt and deposits. These positive impacts were partially offset by a decrease in the benefit related to FTP charge rates on loans and leases allocated to the business segments and a decrease in interest income on investment securities. 

The provision for credit losses was $101 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to a benefit from credit losses of $221 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily driven by an increase in the benefits provided to the business segments associated with the decline in the level of commercial criticized assets owned by the business segments. 

79 Fifth Third Bancorp 

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Noninterest income increased $38 million from the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily driven by the recognition of a gain on the sale of the Bancorp&#8217;s HSA deposit portfolio in the third quarter of 2021, an increase in private equity investment income, a decrease in the loss on the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B shares and a decrease in net losses on disposition and impairment of bank premises and equipment. These impacts were partially offset by the recognition of securities losses of $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to securities gains of $62 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

Noninterest expense decreased $10 million from the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily driven by a decrease in net occupancy expense, partially offset by a decrease in corporate overhead allocations from General Corporate and Other to the other business segments and increases in technology and communications expense and equipment expense.

Total loans and leases, including loans and leases held for sale, increased $6.0 billion, or 5%, from December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of a $6.2 billion, or 9%, increase in commercial loans and leases. 

Commercial loans and leases increased $6.2 billion from December 31, 2021 due to increases in commercial and industrial loans, commercial mortgage loans and commercial construction loans, partially offset by a decrease in commercial leases. Commercial and industrial loans increased $5.6 billion, or 11%, from December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of increased revolving line of credit utilization and stronger production, partially offset by PPP loan forgiveness and paydowns. Commercial mortgage loans increased $691 million, or 7%, from December 31, 2021 as loan originations exceeded payoffs. Commercial construction loans increased $192 million, or 4%, from December 31, 2021 as draws on existing commitments and loan originations exceeded payoffs. Commercial leases decreased $349 million, or 11%, from December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of a planned reduction in indirect non-relationship-based lease originations. 

Consumer loans decreased $151 million from December 31, 2021 primarily due to decreases in residential mortgage loans and indirect secured consumer loans, partially offset by increases in other consumer loans and credit card. Residential mortgage loans decreased $2.2 billion, or 11%, from December 31, 2021 primarily due to decreases in residential mortgage loans held for sale as the Bancorp sold government-guaranteed loans that were previously in forbearance programs. Indirect secured consumer loans decreased $231 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2021 primarily driven by indirect automobile payoffs exceeding loan production, partially offset by increased loan production in non-automobile indirect loans. Other consumer loans increased $2.2 billion, or 82%, from December 31, 2021 primarily driven by originations of point-of-sale solar energy installation loans in the second half of 2022, in addition to loans acquired in a business acquisition completed in the second quarter of 2022. Credit card increased $108 million, or 6%, from December 31, 2021 primarily due to increases in balance-active customers and average balances per active account.

Average loans and leases, including average loans and leases held for sale, increased $6.4 billion, or 6%, from December 31, 2021 primarily as result of a $6.4 billion, or 9%, increase in average commercial loans and leases. 

Average commercial loans and leases increased $6.4 billion from December 31, 2021 due to increases in average commercial and industrial loans and average commercial mortgage loans, partially offset by decreases in average commercial construction loans and average commercial leases. Average commercial and industrial loans increased $6.7 billion, or 14%, from December 31, 2021 primarily driven by increased revolving line of credit utilization and increased production, partially offset by PPP loan forgiveness and paydowns.

Average commercial construction loans decreased $325 million, or 6%, from December 31, 2021 as payoffs exceeded draws on existing commitments and loan originations. Average commercial leases decreased $302 million, or 10%, from December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of a planned reduction in indirect non-relationship-based lease originations. 

Average consumer loans increased $92 million from December 31, 2021 primarily due to increases in average indirect secured consumer loans and average other consumer loans, partially offset by decreases in average residential mortgage loans and average home equity. Average indirect secured consumer loans increased $1.8 billion, or 12%, from December 31, 2021 primarily driven by higher demand and other favorable market conditions as well as lower indirect automobile prepayments and increased loan production in non-automobile indirect loans. Average other consumer loans increased $602 million, or 20%, from December 31, 2021 primarily driven by originations of point-of-sale solar energy installation loans in the second half of 2022, in addition to loans acquired in a business acquisition completed in the second quarter of 2022. Average residential mortgage loans decreased $1.6 billion, or 8%, from December 31, 2021 primarily due to decreases in residential mortgage loans held for sale as the Bancorp sold government-guaranteed loans that were previously in forbearance programs. Average home equity decreased $594 million, or 13%, from December 31, 2021 as payoffs exceeded loan originations and new advances. 

Investment Securities 

The Bancorp uses investment securities as a means of managing interest rate risk, providing collateral for pledging purposes and for liquidity risk management. Total investment securities we re $52.2 billion an d $39.0 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The taxable available-for-sale debt and other investment securities portfolio had an effective duration of 5.4 at December 31, 2022 compared to 4.8 at December 31, 2021. 

Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale when, in management&#8217;s judgment, they may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, changes in market conditions. Securities that management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost. Debt securities are classified as trading when bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. At December 31, 2022, the Bancorp&#8217;s investment portfolio consisted primarily of AAA-rated available-for-sale debt and other securities. The Bancorp held an immaterial amount of below-investment grade available-for-sale debt and other securities at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Bancorp recognized $1 million and $19, respectively, of impairment losses on available-for-sale debt and other securities, included in securities (losses) gains, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. These losses related to certain securities in unrealized loss positions that the Bancorp intended to sell prior to recovery of their amortized cost bases. The Bancorp did not consider these losses to be credit-related.

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

At both December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Bancorp completed its evaluation of the available-for-sale debt and other securities in an unrealized loss position and did not recognize an allowance for credit losses. The Bancorp did not recognize provision expense for both the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 related to available-for-sale debt and other securities in an unrealized loss position. 

The following table summarizes the end of period components of investment securities:

(a) Other securities consist of FHLB, FRB and DTCC restricted stock holdings that are carried at cost. 

On an amortized cost basis, available-for-sale debt and other securities in creased $20.6 billion from December 31, 2021 as a result of the deployment of excess short-term investments into longer duration assets in the investment portfolio. 

On an amortized cost basis, available-for-sale debt and other securities were 30% and 20% of total interest-earning assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The estimated weighted-average life of the debt securities in the available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio wa s 6.8 years and 6.6 years at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In addition, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, the debt securities in the available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio had a weighted-average yield o f 2.97% and 2.77%, respectively. 

Information presented in Table 23 is on a weighted-average life basis, anticipating future prepayments. Yield information is presented on an FTE basis and is computed using amortized cost balances and reflects the impact of prepayments. Maturity and yield calculations for the total available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio exclude other securities that have no stated yield or maturity. Total net unrealized losses on the available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio were $6.0 billion at December 31, 2022 compared to net unrealized gains of $1.2 billion at December 31, 2021. The fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. The fair value of the Bancorp&#8217;s investment securities portfolio generally decreases when interest rates increase or when credit spreads widen.

Other Short-Term Investments 

Other short-term investments primarily include overnight interest-earning investments, including reserves held at the FRB. The Bancorp uses other short-term investments as part of its liquidity risk management tools. Other short-term investments were $8.4 billion and $34.6 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease of $26.2 billion from December 31, 2021 was primarily attributable to purchases of investment securities, a decline in core deposit balances and loan growth during the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Deposits 

The Bancorp&#8217;s deposit balances represent an important source of funding and revenue growth opportunity. The Bancorp continues to focus on core deposit growth in its retail and commercial franchises by improving customer satisfaction, building full relationships and offering competitive rates. Average core deposits represented 78% and 79% of average total assets for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Core deposits decreased $8.6 billion, or 5%, from December 31, 2021, driven by a decrease in transaction deposits, partially offset by an increase in CDs $250,000 or less. Transaction deposits decreased $9.9 billion, or 6%, from December 31, 2021 primarily due to decreases in demand deposits and money market deposits, partially offset by increases in interest checking deposits and savings deposits. Demand deposits decreased $12.0 billion, or 18%, from December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of lower balances per commercial customer account and balance migration into interest checking deposits, partially offset by consumer balance growth. Money market deposits decreased $2.0 billion, or 7%, from December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of lower balances per commercial customer account, balance migration into interest checking deposits and lower balances per consumer customer account due to inflationary pressures. Interest checking deposits increased $2.8 billion, or 6%, from December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of balance migration from demand deposits and money market deposits, partially offset by lower balances per customer account. Lower commercial customer account balances in demand deposits, money market deposits and interest checking deposits included the impact of deliberate runoff during the second quarter of 2022 of certain higher cost commercial deposits. Savings deposits increased $1.2 billion, or 6%, from December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of consumer balance growth and balance migration from interest checking deposits. CDs $250,000 or less increased $1.3 billion, or 53%, from December 31, 2021 primarily due to higher offering rates. 

CDs over $250,000 increased $3.0 billion from December 31, 2021 primarily due to an increase in retail brokered certificates of deposit issued.

On an average basis, core deposits decreased $1.1 billion, or 1%, from December 31, 2021 due to a decrease in average CDs $250,000 or less and a decrease in average transaction deposits. Average CDs $250,000 or less decreased $872 million, or 27%, primarily due to lower offering rates during the first three quarters of 2022, partially offset by higher offering rates during the fourth quarter of 2022. Average transaction deposits decreased $243 million from December 31, 2021, primarily driven by decreases in average demand deposits and average money market deposits, partially offset by an increase in average savings deposits.

Deposit insurance 

The FDIC generally provides a standard amount of insurance of $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category defined by the FDIC. Depositors may qualify for coverage of accounts over $250,000 if they have funds in different ownership categories and all FDIC requirements are met. All deposits that an account holder has in the same ownership category at the same bank are added together and insured up to the standard insurance amount. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, approximately $69.4 billion and $80.2 billion, respectively, of the Bancorp&#8217;s domestic deposits were uninsured. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, approximately $727 million and $468 million, respectively, of the Bancorp&#8217;s time deposits were not fully insured. The estimated uninsured portions of those time deposits were $306 million and $236 million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Where information is not readily available to determine the amount of insured deposits, the amount of uninsured deposits is estimated, consistent with the methodologies and assumptions utilized in providing information to the Bank&#8217;s regulators. 

Borrowings 

The Bancorp accesses a variety of short-term and long-term funding sources. Borrowings with original maturities of one year or less are classified as short-term and include federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings. Total average borrowings as a percent of average interest-bearing liabilities were 14% at December 31, 2022 compared to 13% at December 31, 2021.

Total borrowings increased $5.7 billion, or 43%, from December 31, 2021 primarily due to increases in other short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Other short-term borrowings increased $3.9 billion from December 31, 2021 primarily due to increased funding needs resulting from an increase in investment securities, loan growth and a decline in core deposit balances. The level of other short-term borrowings can fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on funding needs and the sources that are used to satisfy those needs. For further information on the components of other short-term borrowings, refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Long-term debt increased $1.9 billion from December 31, 2021 primarily driven by the issuances of senior fixed-rate/floating-rate notes in April, July and October of 2022 totaling $4.0 billion. These increases were partially offset by the early redemptions under the par call options of $1.5 billion of notes, $460 million of fair value adjustments associated with interest rate swaps hedging long-term debt and $182 million of paydowns on long-term debt associated with loan securitizations during the year ended December 31, 2022.

Total average borrowings increased $2.3 billion, or 16%, compared to December 31, 2021 primarily due to an increase in average other short-term borrowings, partially offset by a decrease in average long-term debt. Average other short-term borrowings increased $3.4 billion compared to December 31, 2021 primarily due to increased funding needs resulting from an increase in investment securities, loan growth and a decline in core deposit balances. Average long-term debt decreased $1.2 billion compared to December 31, 2021 primarily driven by the early redemptions under the par call options of $1.5 billion of notes, $460 million of fair value adjustments associated with interest rate swaps hedging long-term debt and $182 million of paydowns on long-term debt associated with loan securitizations during the year ended December 31, 2022, partially offset by the issuances of senior fixed-rate/floating-rate notes in April, July and October of 2022 totaling $4.0 billion.

RISK MANAGEMENT &#8211; OVERVIEW 

Effective risk management is critical to the Bancorp&#8217;s ongoing success and ensures that the Bancorp operates in a safe and sound manner, complies with applicable laws and regulations and safeguards the Bancorp&#8217;s brand and reputation. Risks are inherent in the Bancorp&#8217;s business and are influenced by both internal and external factors. The Bancorp is responsible for managing these risks effectively to deliver through-the-cycle value and performance for the Bancorp&#8217;s shareholders, customers, employees and communities. 

Fifth Third&#8217;s Enterprise Risk Management Framework, which is approved annually by the Capital Committee, ERMC, RCC and the Board of Directors, includes the following key elements: 

&#8226; The Bancorp ensures transparency and escalation of risk through defined risk policies and a governance structure that includes the RCC, ERMC and other management-level risk committees and councils. 

&#8226; The Bancorp establishes a risk appetite in alignment with its strategic, financial and capital plans. The Bancorp&#8217;s risk appetite is defined using quantitative metrics and qualitative measures to ensure prudent risk taking and drive balanced decision making. The Bancorp&#8217;s goal is to ensure that aggregate residual risks do not exceed the Bancorp&#8217;s risk appetite, and that risks taken are supportive of the Bancorp&#8217;s portfolio diversification and profitability objectives. The Board and executive management approve the risk appetite, which is considered in the development of business strategies and forms the basis for enterprise risk management. 

&#8226; The core principles that define the Bancorp&#8217;s risk appetite are as follows: 

&#9702; Act with integrity in all activities. 

&#9702; Understand the risks taken and ensure that they are in alignment with the Bancorp&#8217;s business strategies and risk appetite. 

&#9702; Avoid risks that cannot be understood, managed or monitored. 

&#9702; Provide transparency of risk to the Bancorp&#8217;s management and Board by escalating risks and issues as necessary. 

&#9702; Ensure Fifth Third&#8217;s products and services are aligned to the Bancorp&#8217;s core customer base and are designed, delivered and maintained to provide value and benefit to the Bancorp&#8217;s customers and to Fifth Third. 

&#9702; Only offer products or services that are appropriate or suitable for the Bancorp&#8217;s customers. 

&#9702; Focus on providing operational excellence by providing reliable, accurate and efficient services to meet the Bancorp&#8217;s customers&#8217; needs. 

&#9702; Maintain a strong financial position to ensure the Bancorp meets its strategic objectives through all economic cycles and is able to access the capital markets at all times, even under stressed conditions. 

&#9702; Protect the Bancorp&#8217;s reputation by thoroughly understanding the consequences of business strategies, products and processes. 

&#9702; Conduct the Bancorp&#8217;s business in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and in alignment with internal policies and procedures. 

&#8226; Fifth Third&#8217;s core values and culture provide the foundation for sound risk management practices by establishing expectations for appropriate conduct and accountability across the organization. All employees are expected to conduct themselves in alignment with Fifth Third&#8217;s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which may be found on www.53.com, while carrying out their responsibilities. Fifth Third&#8217;s Corporate Reputation Risk Committee provides oversight of business conduct policies, programs and strategies, and monitors reporting of potential misconduct, trends or themes across the enterprise. Prudent risk management is a responsibility that is expected from all employees and is a foundational element of Fifth Third&#8217;s culture. 

&#8226; The Bancorp manages eight defined risk types to a prescribed appetite. The risk types are credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, price risk, legal and regulatory compliance risk, operational risk, reputation risk and strategic risk. 

&#8226; The Bancorp identifies and monitors existing and potential risks that may impact the company&#8217;s risk profile, including emerging risks that create uncertainties and/or would have broad implications if materialized (e.g. global pandemics, climate change, etc.). Enhanced monitoring and action plans are implemented as necessary to proactively mitigate risk. 

&#8226; Fifth Third&#8217;s Risk Management Process provides a consistent and integrated approach for managing risks. The five components of the Risk Management Process are: identify, assess, manage, monitor and report. The Bancorp has also established processes and programs to manage and report concentration risks, to ensure robust talent, performance and compensation management, and to aggregate risks across the enterprise. 

Fifth Third drives accountability for managing risk through its Three Lines of Defense structure: 

&#8226; The first line of defense is comprised of front-line units (and enterprise-wide functions that support front-line units) that create risk or are involved in risk-taking activities and are accountable for managing risk. These groups are the Bancorp&#8217;s primary risk takers and are responsible for implementing effective internal controls and maintaining processes for identifying, assessing, and managing the risks associated with their activities consistent with established risk appetite and limits. 

&#8226; The second line of defense, or Independent Risk Management, consists of Risk Management, Compliance and Credit Risk Review. The second line is responsible for developing enterprise frameworks and policies to govern risk-taking activities, overseeing risk-taking of the organization, advising on controlling that risk, assessing risks and issues independent of the first line of defense, and providing input on key risk decisions. Risk Management complements the front line&#8217;s management of risk-taking activities through its monitoring and reporting responsibilities, including adherence to the Bancorp Risk Appetite. Additionally, the second line of defense is responsible for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting on aggregate risks enterprise-wide. 

&#8226; The third line of defense is Internal Audit, which provides oversight of the first and second lines of defense, and independent assurance to the Board on the effectiveness of governance, risk management and internal controls.

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT 

The objective of the Bancorp&#8217;s credit risk management strategy is to quantify and manage credit risk on an aggregate portfolio basis, as well as to limit the risk of loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to honor its financial or contractual obligations to the Bancorp. The Bancorp&#8217;s credit risk management strategy is based on three core principles: conservatism, diversification and monitoring. The Bancorp believes that effective credit risk management begins with conservative lending practices which are described below. These practices include the use of intentional risk-based limits for single name exposures and counterparty selection criteria designed to reduce or eliminate exposure to borrowers who have higher than average default risk and defined weaknesses in financial performance. The Bancorp carefully designs and monitors underwriting, documentation and collection standards. The Bancorp&#8217;s credit risk management strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level as well as ongoing portfolio monitoring and timely management reviews of large credit exposures and credits experiencing deterioration of credit quality. Credit officers with the authority to extend credit are delegated specific authority amounts based on risk and exposure amount, the use of which is closely monitored. Underwriting activities are centrally managed, and Credit Risk Management manages the policy and the authority delegation process directly. The Credit Risk Review function provides independent and objective assessments of the quality of underwriting and documentation, the accuracy of risk grades and the charge-off, nonaccrual and reserve analysis process. The Bancorp&#8217;s credit review process and overall assessment of the adequacy of the ACL is based on quarterly assessments of the estimated losses expected in the loan and lease portfolio. The Bancorp uses these assessments to maintain an adequate ACL and record any necessary charge-offs. Additional loans and leases with probable or observed credit weaknesses receive enhanced monitoring and undergo a periodic review. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Bancorp&#8217;s credit grade categories, which are derived from standard regulatory rating definitions. In addition, stress testing is performed on various commercial and consumer portfolios utilizing various models. For certain portfolios, such as real estate and leveraged lending, stress testing is performed at the individual loan level during credit underwriting. 

In addition to the individual review of larger commercial loans that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses, the commercial credit review process includes the use of two risk grading systems. The first of these risk grading systems is based on regulatory guidance for credit risk systems. These ratings are used by the Bancorp to monitor and manage its credit risk. The Bancorp also separately maintains a dual risk rating system for credit approval and pricing, portfolio monitoring and capital allocation that includes a &#8220;through-the-cycle&#8221; rating philosophy for assessing a borrower&#8217;s creditworthiness. This &#8220;through-the-cycle&#8221; rating philosophy uses a grading scale that assigns ratings based on average default rates through an entire business cycle for borrowers with similar financial performance. The dual risk rating system includes thirteen grade categories for estimating probabilities of default and an additional eleven grade categories for estimating losses given an event of default. The probability of default and loss given default evaluations are not separated in the regulatory risk rating system. 

The Bancorp utilizes internally developed models to estimate expected credit losses for portfolio loans and leases. For loans and leases that are collectively evaluated, the Bancorp utilizes these models to forecast expected credit losses over a reasonable and supportable forecast period based on the probability of a loan or lease defaulting, the expected balance at the estimated date of default and the expected loss percentage given a default. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the Bancorp&#8217;s processes for developing these models, estimating credit losses for periods beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period and for estimating credit losses for individually evaluated loans. 

For the commercial portfolio segment, the estimated probabilities of default are primarily based on the probability of default ratings assigned under the through-the-cycle dual risk rating system and historical observations of how those ratings migrate to a default over time in the context of macroeconomic conditions. For loans with available credit, the estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected utilization rates, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. 

For collectively evaluated loans in the consumer and residential mortgage portfolio segments, the Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models primarily utilize the borrower&#8217;s FICO score and delinquency history in combination with macroeconomic conditions when estimating the probability of default. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. The expected balance at the estimated date of default is also especially impactful in the expected credit loss models for portfolio classes which generally have longer terms (such as residential mortgage loans and home equity) and portfolio classes containing a high concentration of loans with revolving privileges (such as home equity). The estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected prepayment and utilization rates where applicable, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. The Bancorp also utilizes various scoring systems, analytical tools and portfolio performance monitoring processes to assess the credit risk of the consumer and residential mortgage portfolios. 

Overview 

With nominal growth significantly above trend and inflationary pressures building in 2022, the Federal Reserve engaged in the most aggressive monetary tightening cycle since the early 1980&#8217;s. The target federal funds rate increased 425 bps compared to market expectations entering the year of only 75 bps in rate hikes. At the same time the Federal Reserve began the process of reducing their holdings of Treasury 

89 Fifth Third Bancorp 

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

and Agency MBS securities at a pace of $95 billion per month. Financial markets experienced one of their worst years on record as the tightening in monetary policy resulted in negative returns for both equities and bonds. 

Financial market volatility remained high throughout the fourth quarter of 2022 as investors assessed the impact of the FOMC&#8217;s aggressive rate hikes on the macroeconomic outlook. As the Federal Reserve continues to tighten monetary policy, investors have become more concerned about a recession and its impact on economic growth and corporate earnings in 2023. Although employment data has remained resilient, other economic reports for consumer spending and business investment along with sentiment surveys have reflected a slowing economy. 

With the FOMC moving monetary policy into a restrictive setting, the increase in real yields along with the inversion of the yield curve are signaling increasing risks of a recession. At the December 2022 FOMC meeting, FRB officials indicated monetary policy would need to remain restrictive throughout 2023 to achieve a better balance of supply and demand in the labor market. FRB officials have indicated a positive real federal funds rate will be necessary to return personal consumption expenditures inflation to their long-term target of 2%. The real federal funds rate has been negative since 2007. This adjustment to a positive real federal funds rate may be disruptive to economic activity in 2023. 

Commercial Portfolio 

The Bancorp&#8217;s credit risk management strategy seeks to minimize concentrations of risk through diversification. The Bancorp has commercial loan concentration limits based on industry, lines of business within the commercial segment, geography and credit product type. The risk within the commercial loan and lease portfolio is managed and monitored through an underwriting process utilizing detailed origination policies, continuous loan level reviews, monitoring of industry concentration and product type limits and continuous portfolio risk management reporting. 

The Bancorp is closely monitoring various economic conditions and their impacts on commercial borrowers, including the pace of inflation, rising interest rates, labor and supply chain issues, and changes in consumer discretionary spending patterns, among others. The Bancorp maintains focus on disciplined client selection, adherence to underwriting policy and attention to borrower and industry concentrations. 

The Bancorp provides loans to a variety of customers ranging from large multinational firms to middle market businesses, sole proprietors and high net worth individuals. The origination policies for commercial and industrial loans outline the risks and underwriting requirements for loans to businesses in various industries. Included in the policies are maturity and amortization terms, collateral and leverage requirements, cash flow coverage measures and hold limits. The Bancorp aligns credit and sales teams with specific industry expertise to better monitor and manage different industry segments of the portfolio.

Included in the policies are maturity and amortization terms, maximum LTVs, minimum debt service coverage ratios, construction loan monitoring procedures, appraisal requirements, pre-leasing requirements (as applicable), pro forma analysis requirements and interest rate sensitivity. The Bancorp requires a valuation of real estate collateral, which may include third-party appraisals, be performed at the time of origination and renewal in accordance with regulatory requirements and on an as-needed basis when market conditions justify. The Bancorp maintains an appraisal review department to order and review third-party appraisals in accordance with regulatory requirements.

Consumer Portfolio 

Consumer credit risk management utilizes a framework that encompasses consistent processes for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting credit risk. These processes are supported by a credit risk governance structure that includes Board oversight, policies, risk limits and risk committees. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s consumer portfolio is materially comprised of five categories of loans: residential mortgage loans, home equity, indirect secured consumer loans, credit card and other consumer loans. The Bancorp has identified certain credit characteristics within these five categories of loans which it believes represent a higher level of risk compared to the rest of the consumer loan portfolio. The Bancorp does not update LTVs for the consumer portfolio subsequent to origination except as part of the charge-off process for real estate secured loans. The Bancorp actively manages the consumer portfolio through concentration limits, which mitigate credit risk through limiting the exposure to lower FICO scores, higher LTVs and specific geographic concentration risks. 

The Bancorp continues to ensure that underwriting standards and guidelines adequately account for the broader economic conditions that the consumer portfolio faces in a rising-rate environment. Guidelines are designed to ensure that the various consumer products fall within the Bancorp&#8217;s risk appetite. These guidelines will be monitored and adjusted as deemed appropriate in response to the prevailing economic conditions while remaining within the Bancorp&#8217;s risk tolerance limits. 

The payment structures for certain variable rate products (such as residential mortgage loans, home equity and credit card) are susceptible to changes in benchmark interest rates. With continued increases in interest rates, minimum payments on these products also increase, raising the potential for the environment to be disruptive to some borrowers. The Bancorp actively monitors the portion of its consumer portfolio that is susceptible to increases in minimum payments and continues to assess the impact on the overall risk appetite and soundness of the portfolio. 

Residential mortgage portfolio 

The Bancorp manages credit risk in the residential mortgage portfolio through underwriting guidelines that limit exposure to higher LTVs and lower FICO scores. Additionally, the portfolio is governed by concentration limits that ensure geographic, product and channel diversification. The Bancorp may also package and sell loans in the portfolio. 

The Bancorp does not originate residential mortgage loans that permit customers to defer principal payments or make payments that are less than the accruing interest. The Bancorp originates both fixed-rate and ARM loans. Within the ARM portfolio, approximately $514 million of ARM loans will have rate resets during the next twelve months. Of these resets, substantially all are expected to experience an increase in rate, with an average increase of approximately 1.97%. Underlying characteristics of these borrowers are relatively strong with a weighted-average origination DTI of 35% and weighted-average origination LTV of 72%. 

Certain residential mortgage products have characteristics that may increase the Bancorp&#8217;s credit loss rates in the event of a decline in housing values. These types of mortgage products offered by the Bancorp include loans with high LTVs, multiple loans secured by the same collateral that when combined result in an LTV greater than 80% and interest-only loans. The Bancorp has deemed residential mortgage loans with greater than 80% LTVs and no mortgage insurance as loans that represent a higher level of risk.

Home equity portfolio 

The Bancorp&#8217;s home equity portfolio is primarily comprised of home equity lines of credit. Beginning in the first quarter of 2013, the Bancorp&#8217;s newly originated home equity lines of credit have a 10-year interest-only draw period followed by a 20-year amortization period. The home equity line of credit previously offered by the Bancorp was a revolving facility with a 20-year term, minimum payments of interest-only and a balloon payment of principal at maturity. Approximately 37% of the outstanding balances of the Bancorp&#8217;s portfolio of home equity lines of credit have a balloon structure at maturity. Peak maturity years for the balloon home equity lines of credit are 2025 to 2028 and approximately 15% of the balances mature before 2025. 

The ALLL provides coverage for expected losses in the home equity portfolio. The allowance attributable to the portion of the home equity portfolio that has not been restructured in a TDR is determined on a pooled basis using a probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default model framework to generate expected losses. The expected losses for the home equity portfolio are dependent upon loan delinquency, FICO scores, LTV, loan age and their historical correlation with macroeconomic variables including unemployment and the home price index. The expected losses generated from models are adjusted by certain qualitative adjustment factors to reflect risks associated 

94 Fifth Third Bancorp 

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

with current conditions and trends. The qualitative factors include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, economic conditions, portfolio mix, lending and risk management personnel, results of internal audit and quality control reviews, collateral values and geographic concentrations. 

The home equity portfolio is managed in two primary groups: loans outstanding with a combined LTV greater than 80% and those loans with an LTV of 80% or less based upon appraisals at origination. For additional information on these loans, refer to Table 38 and Table 39. Of the total $4.0 billion of outstanding home equity loans: 

&#8226; 78% reside within the Bancorp&#8217;s Midwest footprint of Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky as of December 31, 2022; 

&#8226; 39% are in senior lien positions and 61% are in junior lien positions at December 31, 2022; 

&#8226; 78% of non-delinquent borrowers made at least one payment greater than the minimum payment during the year ended December 31, 2022; and 

&#8226; The portfolio had a weighted-average refreshed FICO score of 751 at December 31, 2022. 

The Bancorp actively manages lines of credit and makes adjustments in lending limits when it believes it is necessary based on FICO score deterioration and property devaluation. The Bancorp does not routinely obtain appraisals on performing loans to update LTVs after origination. However, the Bancorp monitors the local housing markets by reviewing various home price indices and incorporates the impact of the changing market conditions in its ongoing credit monitoring processes. For junior lien home equity loans which become 60 days or more past due, the Bancorp tracks the performance of the senior lien loans in which the Bancorp is the servicer and utilizes consumer credit bureau attributes to monitor the status of the senior lien loans that the Bancorp does not service. If the senior lien loan is found to be 120 days or more past due, the junior lien home equity loan is placed on nonaccrual status unless both loans are well-secured and in the process of collection. Additionally, if the junior lien home equity loan becomes 120 days or more past due and the senior lien loan is also 120 days or more past due, the junior lien home equity loan is assessed for charge-off. Refer to the Analysis of Nonperforming Assets subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A and Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

It is a common industry practice to advance on these types of loans an amount in excess of the collateral value due to the inclusion of negative equity trade-in, maintenance/warranty products, taxes, title and other fees paid at closing.

Analysis of Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and leases for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of the principal and/or interest is uncertain; restructured commercial, credit card and consumer loans which do not meet the requirements to be classified as a performing asset; and certain other assets, including OREO and other repossessed property. A summary of nonperforming assets is included in Table 46. For further information on the Bancorp&#8217;s policies related to accounting for delinquent and nonperforming loans and leases, refer to the Nonaccrual Loans and Leases section of Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Nonperforming assets were $539 million at December 31, 2022 compared to $542 million at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2022, an immaterial amount of nonaccrual loans were held for sale, compared to $15 million at December 31, 2021. 

Nonperforming portfolio assets as a percent of portfolio loans and leases and OREO were 0.44% and 0.47% at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Nonaccrual loans and leases secured by real estate were 42% of nonaccrual loans and leases as of December 31, 2022 compared to 33% as of December 31, 2021. 

Portfolio commercial nonaccrual loans and leases were $263 million at December 31, 2022, a decrease of $74 million from December 31, 2021. Portfolio consumer nonaccrual loans were $252 million at December 31, 2022, an increase of $91 million from December 31, 2021. Refer to Table 47 for a rollforward of the portfolio nonaccrual loans and leases. 

OREO and other repossessed property was $24 million and $29 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Bancorp recognized an immaterial amount and $6 million in losses on the transfer, sale or write-down of OREO properties during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately $34 million and $33 million, respectively, of interest income would have been recognized if the nonaccrual and restructured loans and leases on nonaccrual status had been current in accordance with their contractual terms. Although these values help demonstrate the costs of carrying nonaccrual credits, the Bancorp does not expect to recover the full amount of interest as nonaccrual loans and leases are generally carried below their principal balance.

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

A loan is accounted for as a TDR if the Bancorp, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. TDRs include concessions granted under reorganization, arrangement or other provisions of the Federal Bankruptcy Act. A TDR typically involves a modification of terms such as a reduction of the stated interest rate or remaining principal amount of the loan, a reduction of accrued interest or an extension of the maturity date at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for a new loan with similar risk. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Bancorp&#8217;s accounting for TDRs. 

Consumer restructured loans on accrual status totaled $725 million and $675 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the percentages of restructured residential mortgage loans, home equity and credit card that were past due 30 days or more from their modified terms were 29%, 19% and 33%, respectively.

Analysis of Net Loan Charge-offs 

Net charge-offs were 19 bps and 16 bps of average portfolio loans and leases for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Table 51 provides a summary of credit loss experience and net charge-offs as a percentage of average portfolio loans and leases outstanding by loan category. 

The ratio of commercial loan and lease net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio commercial loans and leases increased to 13 bps during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 10 bps during the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in net charge-offs on commercial and industrial loans of $36 million, partially offset by a decrease in net charge-offs on commercial mortgage loans of $9 million. 

The ratio of consumer loan net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio consumer loans increased to 29 bps during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 26 bps during the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in net charge-offs on indirect secured consumer loans and other consumer loans of $22 million and $11 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in net charge-offs on credit card of $18 million.

(a) For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Bancorp recorded $32, $33 and $42, respectively, in both losses charged off and recoveries of losses previously charged off related to customer defaults on point-of-sale consumer loans for which the Bancorp obtained recoveries under third-party credit enhancements. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses is comprised of the ALLL and the reserve for unfunded commitments. As described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Bancorp maintains the ALLL to absorb the amount of credit losses that are expected to be incurred over the remaining contractual terms of the related loans and leases (as adjusted for prepayments and reasonably expected TDRs). The Bancorp&#8217;s methodology for determining the ALLL includes an estimate of expected credit losses on a collective basis for groups of loans and 

102 Fifth Third Bancorp 

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

leases with similar risk characteristics and specific allowances for loans and leases which are individually evaluated. For collectively evaluated loans and leases, the Bancorp uses quantitative models to forecast expected credit losses based on the probability of a loan or lease defaulting, the expected balance at the estimated date of default and the expected loss percentage given a default. The Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models consider historical credit loss experience, current market and economic conditions, and forecasted changes in market and economic conditions if such forecasts are considered reasonable and supportable. 

The Bancorp also considers qualitative factors in determining the ALLL. Qualitative adjustments are used to capture characteristics in the portfolio that impact expected credit losses which are not fully captured within the Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models. These factors include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, lending and risk management personnel and results of internal audit and quality control reviews. In addition, the qualitative adjustment framework can be utilized to address specific idiosyncratic risks such as geopolitical events, natural disasters or changes in current economic conditions that are not reflected in the quantitative credit loss models, and their effects on regional borrowers and changes in product structures. Qualitative factors may also be used to address the impacts of unforeseen events on key inputs and assumptions within the Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models, such as the reasonable and supportable forecast period, changes to historical loss information or changes to the reversion period or methodology. 

In addition to the ALLL, the Bancorp maintains a reserve for unfunded commitments recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The methodology used to determine the adequacy of this reserve is similar to the Bancorp&#8217;s methodology for determining the ALLL. The provision for unfunded commitments is included in the provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

For the commercial portfolio segment, the estimates for probability of default are primarily based on internal ratings assigned to each commercial borrower on a 13-point scale and historical observations of how those ratings migrate to a default over time in the context of macroeconomic conditions. For loans with available credit, the estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected utilization rates, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. 

For collectively evaluated loans in the consumer and residential mortgage portfolio segments, the Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models primarily utilize the borrower&#8217;s FICO score and delinquency history in combination with macroeconomic conditions when estimating the probability of default. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. The expected balance at the estimated date of default is also especially impactful in the expected credit loss models for portfolio classes which generally have longer terms (such as residential mortgage loans and home equity) and portfolio classes containing a high concentration of loans with revolving privileges (such as home equity). The estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected prepayment and utilization rates where applicable, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. 

At both December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Bancorp used three forward-looking economic scenarios during the reasonable and supportable forecast period in its expected credit loss models to address the inherent imprecision in macroeconomic forecasting. Each of the three scenarios was developed by a third party that is subject to the Bancorp&#8217;s Third-Party Risk Management program including oversight by the Bancorp&#8217;s independent model risk management group. The scenarios included a most likely outcome (Baseline) and two less probable scenarios with one being more favorable than the Baseline and the other being less favorable. The more favorable alternative scenario (Upside) depicted a stronger near-term growth outlook while the less favorable outlook (Downside) depicted a moderate recession. 

The Baseline scenario was developed such that the expectation is that the economy will perform better than the projection 50% of the time and worse than the projection 50% of the time. The Upside scenario was developed such that there is a 10% probability that the economy will perform better than the projection and a 90% probability that it will perform worse. The Downside scenario was developed such that there is a 90% probability that the economy will perform better than the projection and a 10% probability that it will perform worse. 

December 31, 2022 ACL 

The ACL as of December 31, 2022 was impacted by several factors, including growth in portfolio loan and lease balances, primarily concentrated in the commercial and industrial loan and other consumer loan portfolios and deterioration in the forecasted macroeconomic conditions in each of the three forecast scenarios. As a result of these factors, the Bancorp incorporated a combination of quantitative model-based estimates and qualitative adjustments. As of December 31, 2022, the Bancorp&#8217;s economic scenarios included estimates of the expected impacts of the changes in economic conditions caused by inflationary and rising interest rate pressures and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. At December 31, 2022, the Bancorp assigned an 80% probability weighting to the Baseline scenario and 10% to each the Upside and Downside scenarios. 

The Baseline scenario assumed real GDP growth for the year ended 2022 at 1.8% with the forecast decreasing to 0.7% in 2023, and then increasing to 2.1% in 2024 and 2.7% in 2025. The Baseline scenario also assumed an average unemployment rate of 3.7% for the year ended 2022, increasing to an average of 4.0% in the forecast for both 2023 and 2024, modestly decreasing to an average of 3.8% in 2025. Lastly, the Baseline scenario assumed continued increases to the target federal funds rate, peaking at an average of 4.6% in 2023, and decreasing to an average of 3.9% and 3.0% in 2024 and 2025, respectively. The Upside scenario assumed a faster than anticipated resolution to the Russia- 

103 Fifth Third Bancorp 

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Ukraine conflict with related improvement to economic measures. The Upside scenario assumed that on an average annual basis, the change in real GDP is 3.4% in 2023, decreasing to 2.9% and 2.0% in 2024 and 2025, respectively. The Upside scenario also assumed an unemployment rate at an annual average of 3.4% in both 2023 and 2024, slightly declining to 3.3% in 2025. In the Upside scenario, the forecast for the federal funds rate was consistent with the Baseline scenario but with slightly lower increases resulting from an improving inflation outlook. The Downside scenario included significant worsening of the Russia-Ukraine conflict resulting in continued inflation, causing the U.S. economy to fall into a recession in the first quarter of 2023. The Downside scenario assumed that real GDP will decline throughout 2023, at an average of (1.5%), recovering to an average growth rate of 0.2% and 3.2% in 2024 and 2025, respectively. The Downside scenario unemployment rate peaks at 7.8% in the first quarter of 2024 and decreases to an average of 5.9% in 2025. In the Downside scenario, the forecast for the federal funds rate included higher increases than the Baseline scenario through the fourth quarter of 2023, followed by rapid decreases through 2025. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s quantitative credit loss models are sensitive to changes in economic forecast assumptions over the reasonable and supportable forecast period. Applying a 100% probability weighting to the Downside scenario rather than using the probability-weighted three scenario approach would result in an increase in the quantitative ACL of approximately $2.2 billion. This sensitivity calculation only reflects the impact of changing the probability weighting of the scenarios in the quantitative credit loss models and excludes any additional considerations associated with the qualitative component of the ACL that might be warranted if probability weights were adjusted.

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

INTEREST RATE AND PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT 

Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from movement of interest rates. This risk primarily impacts the Bancorp&#8217;s income categories through changes in interest income on earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, and through fee items that are related to interest sensitive activities such as mortgage origination and servicing income and through earnings credits earned on commercial deposits that offset commercial deposit fees. Price risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from changes in the value of financial instruments and portfolios due to movements in interest rates, volatilities, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices. Management considers interest rate risk a prominent market risk in terms of its potential impact on earnings. Interest rate risk may occur for any one or more of the following reasons: 

&#8226; Assets and liabilities mature or reprice at different times; 

&#8226; Short-term and long-term market interest rates change by different amounts; or 

&#8226; The expected maturities of various assets or liabilities shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. 

In addition to the direct impact of interest rate changes on NII and interest-sensitive fees, interest rates can impact earnings through their effect on loan and deposit demand, credit losses, mortgage origination volumes, the value of servicing rights and other sources of the Bancorp&#8217;s earnings. Changes in interest rates and other market factors can impact earnings through changes in the value of portfolios, if not appropriately hedged. Stability of the Bancorp&#8217;s net income is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk and to a lesser extent price risk. Management continually reviews the Bancorp&#8217;s on- and off-balance sheet composition, earnings flows, and hedging strategies and models interest rate risk and price risk exposures, and possible actions to manage these risks, given numerous possible future interest rate and market factor scenarios. A series of policy limits and key risk indicators are employed to ensure that risks are managed within the Bancorp&#8217;s risk tolerance for interest rate risk and price risk. 

In addition to the traditional forms of interest rate risk discussed in this section, the Bancorp is exposed to interest rate risk associated with the retirement and replacement of LIBOR. For more information on the LIBOR transition, refer to the Overview section of MD&#38;A. 

The Commercial Banking and Wealth and Asset Management lines of business manage price risk for capital markets sales and trading activities related to their respective businesses. The Consumer and Small Business Banking line of business manages price risk for the origination and sale of conforming residential mortgage loans to government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises. The Bancorp&#8217;s Treasury department manages interest rate risk and price risk for all other activities. Independent oversight is provided by ERM, and key risk indicators and Board-approved policy limits are used to ensure risks are managed within the Bancorp&#8217;s risk tolerance. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s Market Risk Management Committee, which includes senior management representatives and reports to the Corporate Credit Committee (accountable to the ERMC), provides oversight and monitors price risk for the capital markets sales and trading activities. The Bancorp&#8217;s ALCO, which includes senior management representatives and is accountable to the ERMC, provides oversight and monitors interest rate and price risks for Mortgage and Treasury activities. 

Net Interest Income Sensitivity 

The Bancorp employs a variety of measurement techniques to identify and manage its interest rate risk, including the use of an NII simulation model to analyze the sensitivity of NII to changes in interest rates. The model is based on contractual and estimated cash flows and repricing characteristics for all of the Bancorp&#8217;s assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet exposures and incorporates market-based assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and attrition rates of certain liabilities. The model also includes senior management&#8217;s projections of the future volume and pricing of each of the product lines offered by the Bancorp as well as other pertinent assumptions. The NII simulation model does not represent a forecast of the Bancorp&#8217;s net interest income but is a tool utilized to assess the risk of the impact of changing market interest rates across a range of market interest rate environments. As a result, actual results will differ from simulated results for multiple reasons, which may include actual balance sheet composition differences, timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, deviations from projected customer behavioral assumptions as well as from changes in market conditions and management strategies. 

As of December 31, 2022, the Bancorp&#8217;s interest rate risk exposure is governed by a risk framework that utilizes the change in NII over 12-month and 24-month horizons under parallel ramped increases and decreases in interest rates. Policy limits are utilized for scenarios assuming a 200 bps increase and a 200 bps decrease in interest rates over twelve months. The Bancorp routinely analyzes various potential and extreme scenarios, including parallel ramps and shocks as well as steepening and other non-parallel shifts in rates, to assess where risks to net interest income persist or develop as changes in the balance sheet and market rates evolve. Additionally, the Bancorp routinely evaluates its exposures to changes in the bases between interest rates. 

In order to recognize the risk of noninterest-bearing demand deposit balance run-off in a rising interest rate environment, the Bancorp&#8217;s NII sensitivity modeling assumes that approximately $1 billion of additional demand deposit balances run-off over 24 months for each 100 bps increase in short-term market interest rates. Similarly, the Bancorp&#8217;s NII sensitivity modeling incorporates approximately $1 billion of incremental growth in noninterest-bearing deposit balances over 24 months for each 100 bps decrease in short-term market interest rates. The incremental balance run-off and growth are modeled to flow into and out of funding products that reprice in conjunction with short-term market rate changes. 

106 Fifth Third Bancorp 

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Another important deposit modeling assumption is the amount by which interest-bearing deposit rates will increase or decrease when market interest rates increase or decrease. This deposit repricing sensitivity is known as the beta, and it represents the expected amount by which the Bancorp&#8217;s interest-bearing deposit rates will change for a given change in short-term market rates. The Bancorp utilizes dynamic deposit beta models to adjust assumed repricing sensitivity depending on market rate levels. The dynamic beta models were developed utilizing the Bancorp&#8217;s performance during prior interest rate cycles. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Bancorp&#8217;s actual deposit repricing has been slower than what was experienced in prior interest rate cycles, and as a result, the Bancorp has outperformed previous NII simulation expectations. Using the dynamic beta models, the Bancorp&#8217;s NII sensitivity modeling assumes weighted-average rising-rate interest-bearing deposit betas at the end of the ramped parallel scenarios of 68% and 70%, for a 100 bps and 200 bps increase in rates, respectively. In the event of rate cuts, this approach assumes a weighted-average falling-rate interest-bearing deposit beta at the end of the ramped 200 bps decrease in rates of 60% at December 31, 2022, while also maintaining that deposit rates themselves will not become negative. The modeling assumes no lag between the timing of changes in market rates and the timing of deposit repricing despite such timing lags having occurred in prior rate cycles. In addition, assumed deposit migration from low-beta deposit products to more rate-sensitive deposit products contribute additional beta of 5%-10% across the rising-rate ramps, resulting in an effective beta of approximately 75-80% in our baseline NII sensitivity profile. Given the performance during the year ended December 31, 2022, the Bancorp may continue to exceed the NII simulation expectations. However, the actual performance will be dependent on market conditions, the level of competition for deposits and the magnitude of continued interest rate increases. The Bancorp provides sensitivity analysis in Tables 55 and 56 for key assumptions related to its deposit modeling, including beta and DDA balance performance. 

The Bancorp continually evaluates the sensitivity of its interest rate risk measures to these important deposit modeling assumptions. The Bancorp also regularly monitors the sensitivity of other important modeling assumptions, such as loan and security prepayments and early withdrawals on fixed-rate customer liabilities. 

The following table shows the Bancorp&#8217;s estimated NII sensitivity profile and ALCO policy limits as of December 31: 

##TABLE_START TABLE 54: Estimated NII Sensitivity Profile and ALCO Policy Limits 2022 2021 &#160;% Change in NII (FTE) ALCO Policy Limit % Change in NII (FTE) ALCO Policy Limit Change in Interest Rates (bps) 12 Months 13-24 Months 12 Months 13-24 Months 12 Months 13-24 Months 12 Months 13-24 Months +200 Ramp over 12 months (2.93) % (3.17) (4.00) (6.00) 10.68 % 20.60 (4.00) (6.00) +100 Ramp over 12 months (1.31) (1.14) N/A N/A 6.13 12.66 N/A N/A -25 Ramp over 3 months N/A N/A N/A N/A (2.12) (2.99) N/A N/A -200 Ramp over 12 months (0.68) (4.69) (8.00) (12.00) N/A N/A N/A N/A ##TABLE_END

At December 31, 2022, the Bancorp&#8217;s NII sensitivity is liability sensitive in years one and two due to the previously discussed deposit dynamic beta and balance migration assumptions. The Bancorp&#8217;s NII simulation projects a decrease in both year one and year two NII under the parallel 200 bps ramp decrease in interest rates. Reductions in the yield of the commercial loan portfolio would be expected to be only partially offset by a decline in the cost of interest-bearing deposits in certain falling-rate scenarios. However, continued re-positioning into securities with less near-term principal cash flows and the execution of additional receive-fixed hedges have added significant protection from declining rates. The changes in the estimated NII sensitivity profile compared to December 31, 2021 were primarily attributable to significant deployment of cash and other short-term investments into long-term fixed-rate securities and higher market interest rates driving higher expected betas.

Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity 

The Bancorp also uses EVE as a measurement tool in managing interest rate risk. Whereas the NII sensitivity analysis highlights the impact on forecasted NII on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) over one- and two-year time horizons, EVE is a point-in-time analysis of the economic sensitivity of current positions that incorporates all cash flows over their estimated remaining lives. The EVE of the balance sheet is defined as the discounted present value of all asset and net derivative cash flows less the discounted value of all liability cash flows. Due to this longer horizon, the sensitivity of EVE to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of longer-term interest rate risk. EVE values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the balance growth assumptions used in the NII sensitivity analysis. As with the NII simulation model, assumptions about the timing and variability of existing balance sheet cash flows are critical in the EVE analysis. Particularly important are assumptions driving loan and security prepayments and the expected balance attrition and pricing of indeterminate-lived deposits. 

The following table shows the Bancorp&#8217;s estimated EVE sensitivity profile as of December 31: 

##TABLE_START TABLE 57: Estimated EVE Sensitivity Profile 2022 2021 Change in Interest Rates (bps) % Change in EVE ALCO Policy Limit % Change in EVE ALCO Policy Limit +200 Shock (7.53) % (12.00) 4.51 (12.00) +100 Shock (2.72) N/A 3.16 N/A -25 Shock N/A N/A (1.24) N/A -200 Shock 1.24 &#160; (12.00) N/A N/A ##TABLE_END

The EVE sensitivity is negative in a +200 bps rising-rate scenario and positive in a -200 bps falling-rate scenario at December 31, 2022. The changes in the estimated EVE sensitivity profile from December 31, 2021 were primarily related to the significant deployment of cash and other short-term investments into long-term fixed-rate securities, the execution of new forward-starting receive-fixed hedging transactions and increased deposit repricing betas. 

While an instantaneous shift in spot interest rates followed by forward projections is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure, the Bancorp believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (e.g., the current fiscal year). Further, EVE does not account for factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships and changing product spreads that could mitigate or exacerbate the impact of changes in interest rates. The NII simulations and EVE analyses do not necessarily include certain actions that management may undertake to manage risk in response to actual changes in interest rates. 

The Bancorp regularly evaluates its exposures to a static balance sheet forecast, LIBOR, SOFR, Prime Rate and other basis risks, yield curve twist risks and embedded options risks. In addition, the impacts on NII on an FTE basis and EVE of extreme changes in interest rates are modeled, wherein the Bancorp employs the use of yield curve shocks and environment-specific scenarios. 

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate Risk 

An integral component of the Bancorp&#8217;s interest rate risk management strategy is its use of derivative instruments to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in market interest rates. Examples of derivative instruments that the Bancorp may use as part of its interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps, interest rate floors, interest rate caps, forward contracts, forward starting interest rate swaps, options, swaptions and TBA securities. 

Tables 58 and 59 show all swap and floor positions that are utilized for purposes of managing the Bancorp&#8217;s exposures to the variability of interest rates. These positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed-upon amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index, to hedge the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognized asset attributable to changes in

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

the benchmark interest rate or to hedge forecasted transactions for the variability in cash flows attributable to the contractually specified interest rate. The volume, maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as the Bancorp adjusts its broader interest rate risk management objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. For further information, refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The following tables present additional information about the interest rate swaps and floors used in Fifth Third&#8217;s asset and liability management activities:

Additionally, as part of its overall risk management strategy relative to its residential mortgage banking activities, the Bancorp enters into forward contracts accounted for as free-standing derivatives to economically hedge IRLCs that are also considered free-standing derivatives. The Bancorp economically hedges its exposure to residential mortgage loans held for sale through the use of forward contracts and mortgage options as well. See the Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights and Price Risk section for the discussion of the use of derivatives to economically hedge this exposure. 

The Bancorp also enters into derivative contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge market risks assumed in interest rate derivative contracts with commercial customers. Generally, these contracts have similar terms in order to protect the Bancorp from market volatility. Credit risk arises from the possible inability of the counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts, which the Bancorp minimizes through collateral arrangements, approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. The Bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not being taken in providing this service to customers. These controls include an independent determination of interest rate volatility and potential future exposure on these contracts and counterparty credit approvals performed by independent risk management. For further information, including the notional amount and fair values of these derivatives, refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Portfolio Loans and Leases and Interest Rate Risk 

Although the Bancorp&#8217;s portfolio loans and leases contain both fixed and floating/adjustable-rate products, the rates of interest earned by the Bancorp on the outstanding balances are generally established for a period of time. The interest rate sensitivity of loans and leases is directly related to the length of time the rate earned is established.

Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights and Price Risk 

The fair value of the residential MSR portfolio was $1.7 billion and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The value of servicing rights can fluctuate sharply depending on changes in interest rates and other factors. Generally, as interest rates decline and loans are prepaid to take advantage of refinancing, the total value of existing servicing rights declines because no further servicing fees are collected on repaid loans. For further information on the significant drivers and components of the valuation adjustments on MSRs, refer to the Noninterest Income subsection of the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&#38;A. The Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy relative to its mortgage banking activity in order to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the value of its MSR portfolio as a result of changing interest rates. The Bancorp may adjust its hedging strategy to reflect its assessment of the composition of its MSR portfolio, the cost of hedging and the anticipated effectiveness of the hedges given the economic environment. Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on servicing rights and the instruments used to hedge price risk on MSRs. 

Foreign Currency Risk 

The Bancorp may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to economically hedge certain foreign denominated loans. The derivatives are classified as free-standing instruments with the revaluation gain or loss being recorded in other noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The balance of the Bancorp&#8217;s foreign denominated loans at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $1.0 billion and $995 million, respectively. The Bancorp also enters into foreign exchange contracts for the benefit of commercial customers to hedge their exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Similar to the hedging of price risk from interest rate derivative contracts entered into with commercial customers, the Bancorp also enters into foreign exchange contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge a substantial portion of the exposure from client driven foreign exchange activity. The Bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not being taken in providing this service to customers. These controls include an independent determination of currency volatility and potential future exposure on these contracts, counterparty credit approvals and country limits performed by independent risk management.

Commodity Risk 

The Bancorp also enters into commodity contracts for the benefit of commercial customers to hedge their exposure to commodity price fluctuations. Similar to the hedging of foreign exchange and price risk from interest rate derivative contracts, the Bancorp also enters into commodity contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge a substantial portion of the exposure from client driven commodity activity. The Bancorp may also offset this risk with exchange-traded commodity contracts. The Bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not taken in providing this service to customers. These controls include an independent determination of commodity volatility and potential future exposure on these contracts and counterparty credit approvals performed by independent risk management.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT 

The goal of liquidity management is to provide adequate funds to meet changes in loan and lease demand, unexpected levels of deposit withdrawals and other contractual obligations. Mitigating liquidity risk is accomplished by maintaining liquid assets in the form of cash and investment securities, maintaining sufficient unused borrowing capacity in the debt markets and delivering consistent growth in core deposits. A summary of certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts is included in Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s Treasury department manages funding and liquidity based on point-in-time metrics as well as forward-looking projections, which incorporate different sources and uses of funds under base and stress scenarios. Liquidity risk is monitored and managed by the Treasury department with independent oversight provided by ERM, and a series of Policy Limits and Key Risk Indicators are established to ensure risks are managed within the Bancorp&#8217;s risk tolerance. The Bancorp maintains a contingency funding plan that provides for liquidity stress testing, which assesses the liquidity needs under varying market conditions, time horizons, asset growth rates and other events. The contingency plan provides for ongoing monitoring of unused borrowing capacity and available sources of contingent liquidity to prepare for unexpected liquidity needs and to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity. The contingency plan also outlines the Bancorp&#8217;s response to various levels of liquidity stress and actions that should be taken during various scenarios. 

Liquidity risk is monitored and managed for both Fifth Third Bancorp and its subsidiaries. The Bancorp receives substantially all of its liquidity from dividends from its subsidiaries, primarily Fifth Third Bank, National Association. Subsidiary dividends are supplemented with term debt to enable the Bancorp to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet its cash obligations, including debt service and scheduled maturities, common and preferred dividends, unfunded commitments to subsidiaries and other planned capital actions in the form of share repurchases. Liquidity resources are more limited at the Bancorp, making its liquidity position more susceptible to market disruptions. Bancorp liquidity is assessed using a cash coverage horizon, ensuring the entity maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a period of sustained market disruption while meeting its anticipated obligations over an extended stressed horizon. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s ALCO, which includes senior management representatives and is accountable to the ERMC, monitors and manages liquidity and funding risk within Board-approved policy limits. In addition to the risk management activities of ALCO, the Bancorp has a liquidity risk management function as part of ERM that provides independent oversight of liquidity risk management. 

Sources of Funds 

The Bancorp&#8217;s primary sources of funds relate to cash flows from loan and lease repayments, payments from securities related to sales and maturities, the sale or securitization of loans and leases and funds generated by core deposits, in addition to the use of public and private debt offerings. 

Table 60 of the Interest Rate and Price Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A presents information about the timing of cash flows from loan and lease repayments. Of the $51.5 billion of securities in the Bancorp&#8217;s available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio at December 31, 2022, $4.6 billion in p rincipal and interest is expected to be received in the next 12 months and an additional $4.9 billion is expected to be received in the next 13 to 24 months. For further information on the Bancorp&#8217;s securities portfolio, refer to the Investment Securities subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A. 

Asset-driven liquidity is provided by the Bancorp&#8217;s ability to sell or securitize loans and leases. In order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations and to manage liquidity, the Bancorp has developed securitization and sale procedures for several types of interest-sensitive assets. A majority of the long-term, fixed-rate single-family residential mortgage loans underwritten according to FHLMC or FNMA guidelines are sold for cash upon origination. Additional assets such as certain other residential mortgage loans, certain commercial loans and leases, home equity loans, automobile loans and other consumer loans are also capable of being securitized or sold. The Bancorp sold loans and leases totaling $13.5 billion during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $17.5 billion during the year ended December 31, 2021. For further information, refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Core deposits have historically provided the Bancorp with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. The Bancorp&#8217;s average core deposits and average shareholders&#8217; equity funded 87 % and 90% of its average total assets for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In addition to core deposit funding, the Bancorp also accesses a variety of other short-term and long-term funding sources, which include the use of the FHLB system. Management does not rely on any one source of liquidity and manages availability in response to changing balance sheet needs. 

In June of 2022, the Board of Directors authorized $5.0 billion of debt or other securities for issuance, of which $3.0 billion of debt or other securities were available for issuance a s of December 31, 2022 . The Bancorp is authorized to file any necessary registration statements with the SEC to permit ready access to the public securities markets; however, access to these markets may depend on market conditions. The Bancorp issued and sold fixed-rate/floating-rate senior notes of $1 billion in April of 2022, $1 billion in July of 2022 and $1 billion in October of 2022 as further discussed in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

As of December 31, 2022, the Bank&#8217;s global bank note program had a borrowing capacity of $25.0 billion , of which $20.3 billion was available for issuance. The Bank issued and sold fixed-rate/floating-rate senior notes of $1 billion in October of 2022 as further discussed in 

112 Fifth Third Bancorp 

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, at December 31, 2022, the Bank had approximately $51.0 billion of borrowing capacity available through secured borrowing sources, including the FRB and FHLB. 

Current Liquidity Position 

The Bancorp maintains a strong liquidity profile driven by strong core deposit funding and over $100 billion in current available liquidity. The Bancorp is managing liquidity prudently in the current environment and maintains a liquidity profile focused on core deposit and stable long-term funding sources, while supplementing with a variety of secured and unsecured wholesale funding sources across the maturity spectrum, which allows for the effective management of concentration and rollover risk. A significant portion of the Bancorp&#8217;s excess cash and other short-term investments have been invested in long-term fixed-rate securities since the start of 2022. The Bancorp&#8217;s investment portfolio remains highly concentrated in liquid and readily marketable instruments and is a significant source of secured borrowing capacity. 

As of December 31, 2022, the Bancorp (parent company) has sufficient liquidity to meet contractual obligations and all preferred and common dividends without accessing the capital markets or receiving upstream dividends from the Bank subsidiary for 24 months. 

The Bancorp and its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, have certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under various types of contracts. In addition to commitments to extend credit and letters of credit (which are further discussed in Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), these include deposits, lease obligations, partnership investment commitments, derivative contracts, borrowings, and pension benefit payments. Refer to the Deposits subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A and Notes 9, 12, 14, 16, 17 and 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these contractual obligations. 

Credit Ratings 

The cost and availability of financing to the Bancorp and Bank are impacted by its credit ratings. A downgrade to the Bancorp&#8217;s or Bank&#8217;s credit ratings could affect its ability to access the credit markets and increase its borrowing costs, thereby adversely impacting the Bancorp&#8217;s or Bank&#8217;s financial condition and liquidity. Key factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong credit quality, strong capital ratios and diverse funding sources, in addition to disciplined liquidity monitoring procedures. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s and Bank&#8217;s credit ratings are summarized in Table 62. The ratings reflect the ratings agency&#8217;s view on the Bancorp&#8217;s and Bank&#8217;s capacity to meet financial commitments.* 

*As an investor, you should be aware that a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, that it may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Additional information on the credit rating ranking within the overall classification system is located on the website of each credit rating agency.

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT 

Operational risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human errors or misconduct or adverse external events that are neither market- nor credit-related. Operational risk is inherent in the Bancorp&#8217;s activities and can manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts, business interruptions, inappropriate behavior of employees, unintentional failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, poor design or delivery of products and services, cyber-security or physical security incidents and privacy breaches or failure of third parties to perform in accordance with their arrangements. These events could result in financial losses, litigation and regulatory fines, as well as other damage to the Bancorp. The Bancorp&#8217;s risk management goal is to keep operational risk at appropriate levels consistent with the Bancorp&#8217;s risk appetite, financial strength, the characteristics of its businesses, the markets in which it operates and the competitive and regulatory environment to which it is subject. 

To control, monitor and govern operational risk, the Bancorp maintains an overall Enterprise Risk Management Framework which comprises governance oversight, risk assessment, capital measurement, monitoring and reporting as well as a formal three lines of defense approach. ERM is responsible for prescribing the framework to the lines of business and corporate functions and providing independent oversight of its implementation (second line of defense). Business Controls groups are in place in each of the lines of business to ensure consistent implementation and execution of managing day-to-day operational risk (first line of defense). 

The Bancorp&#8217;s enterprise risk management framework consists of five integrated components, including identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and independent governance reporting of risk. The corporate Operational Risk Management function within Enterprise Risk is responsible for developing and overseeing the implementation of the Bancorp&#8217;s approach to managing operational risk. This includes providing governance, awareness and training, tools, guidance and oversight to support implementation of key risk programs and systems as they relate to operational risk management. These include programs, such as risk and control self-assessments, product delivery risk assessments, scenario analysis, new product/initiative risk reviews, key risk indicators, Third-Party Risk Management, cyber-security risk management, review of operational losses and monitoring of significant organizational or process changes. The function is also responsible for developing reports that support the proactive management of operational risk across the enterprise. The lines of business and corporate functions are responsible for managing the operational risks associated with their areas in accordance with the enterprise risk management framework. The framework is intended to enable the Bancorp to function with a sound and well-controlled operational environment. These processes support the Bancorp&#8217;s goals to minimize future operational losses and strengthen the Bancorp&#8217;s performance by maintaining sufficient capital to absorb operational losses that are incurred. 

The Bancorp also maintains a robust information security program to support the management of cyber-security risk within the organization with a focus on prevention, detection and recovery processes. Fifth Third utilizes a wide array of techniques to secure its operations and proprietary information such as Board-approved policies and programs, network monitoring and testing, access controls and dedicated security personnel. Fifth Third has adopted the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework for the management and deployment of cyber-security controls and is an active participant in the financial sector information sharing organization structure, known as the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center. To ensure resiliency of key Bancorp functions, Fifth Third also employs redundancy protocols that include a robust business continuity function that works to mitigate any potential impacts to Fifth Third customers and its systems. 

Fifth Third also focuses on the reporting and escalation of operational control issues to senior management and the Board of Directors. The Operational Risk Committee is the key committee that oversees and supports Fifth Third in the management of operational risk across the enterprise. The Information Security Governance Committee and Model Risk Committee report to the Operational Risk Committee and are responsible for governance of information security and model risks. The Operational Risk Committee reports to the ERMC, which reports to the RCC of the Board of Directors of Fifth Third Bancorp and Fifth Third Bank, National Association. 

Increased external threats have elevated fraud and cyber-security risks. The Bancorp&#8217;s strategic initiatives also have the potential to increase operational risk as changes to process and technology are implemented. Additionally, to the extent utilized in executing these changes, other factors such as increased reliance on third parties and increased use of emerging and cloud-based technologies may also introduce additional operational risk considerations. These risks continue to be carefully managed and monitored to ensure effective controls are in place, with appropriate oversight and governance by the second line of defense. 

The Bancorp is aware of and actively monitoring climate-related risks. Climate-related risks could impact the Bancorp in the form of physical risks due to acute or chronic weather related events that could disrupt the operations of the Bancorp, or could impair the ability of clients to meet financial obligations. The Bancorp also faces transition risk resulting from economic transition towards a lower-carbon future which may negatively impact some clients or present credit, strategic or reputational risks to the Bancorp. 

Climate risk is a priority for management and accordingly the Board oversees both the RCC and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The RCC is responsible for overseeing the development and implementation of Fifth Third&#8217;s Enterprise Risk Management Framework including climate risks. In the course of business, the Bancorp&#8217;s Environmental Risk Group works with partners to manage or mitigate environmental risks including climate-related risks. As part of its larger environmental, social and governance responsibilities the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for overseeing climate strategy and climate-related issues in the context of stakeholder concerns.

LEGAL AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT 

Legal and regulatory compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss or damage to reputation as a result of noncompliance with (i) applicable laws, regulations, rules and other regulatory requirements (including but not limited to the risk of consumers experiencing economic loss or other legal harm as a result of noncompliance with consumer protection laws, regulations and requirements); (ii) internal policies and procedures, standards of best practice or codes of conduct; and (iii) principles of integrity and fair dealing applicable to Fifth Third&#8217;s activities and functions. Legal risks include the risk of actions against the institution that result in unenforceable contracts, lawsuits, legal sanctions, or adverse judgments, which disrupt or otherwise negatively affect the operations or condition of the institution. Failure to effectively manage such risks can elevate the risk level or manifest itself as other types of key risks, including reputational or operational risk. Fifth Third focuses on managing legal and regulatory compliance risk in accordance with the Bancorp&#8217;s integrated enterprise risk management framework, which ensures consistent processes for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting risks. The Bancorp&#8217;s risk management goal is to keep compliance risk at appropriate levels, consistent with the Bancorp&#8217;s risk appetite. 

To mitigate such risks, Compliance Risk Management provides independent oversight to foster consistency and sufficiency in the execution of the program, and ensures that lines of business and support functions are adequately identifying, assessing and monitoring legal and regulatory compliance risks and adopting proper mitigation strategies. Moreover, such strategies are modified from time to time to respond to new or emerging risks in the environment. Compliance Risk Management and the Legal Division provide guidance to the lines of business and enterprise functions, which are ultimately responsible for managing such risks associated with their areas. The Chief Compliance Officer is responsible for formulating and directing the strategy, development, implementation, communication and maintenance of the Compliance Risk Management program, which implements key compliance processes, including but not limited to, executive- and board-level governance and reporting routines, compliance-related policies, risk assessments, key risk indicators, issues tracking, regulatory change management and regulatory compliance testing and monitoring. As part of Compliance Risk Management, the Financial Crimes Division conducts and oversees anti-money laundering and economic sanctions processes. Compliance Risk Management partners with the Community and Economic Development team to oversee the Bancorp&#8217;s compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. 

Fifth Third also reports and escalates legal and regulatory compliance issues to senior management and the Board of Directors. The Management Compliance Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Compliance Officer, is the key committee that oversees and supports Fifth Third in the management of compliance risk across the enterprise. The Management Compliance Committee oversees Bancorp-wide compliance issues, industry best practices, legislative developments, regulatory concerns and other leading indicators of legal and regulatory compliance risk. The Management Compliance Committee reports to the ERMC, which reports to the RCC of the Board of Directors of Fifth Third Bancorp and Fifth Third Bank, National Association.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 

Management regularly reviews the Bancorp&#8217;s capital levels to help ensure it is appropriately positioned under various operating environments. The Bancorp has established a Capital Committee which is responsible for making capital plan recommendations to management. These recommendations are reviewed by the ERMC and the annual capital plan is approved by the Board of Directors. The Capital Committee is responsible for execution and oversight of the capital actions of the capital plan. 

Regulatory Capital Ratios 

The Basel III Final Rule sets minimum regulatory capital ratios as well as defines the measure of &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; for insured depository institutions. For additional information regarding the prescribed capital ratios, refer to Note 29 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Bancorp is subject to the stress capital buffer requirement and must maintain capital ratios above its buffered minimum (regulatory minimum plus stress capital buffer) in order to avoid certain limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses to executive officers. The FRB uses the supervisory stress test to determine the Bancorp&#8217;s stress capital buffer, subject to a floor of 2.5%. The Bancorp&#8217;s stress capital buffer requirement has been 2.5% since the introduction of this framework and was most recently affirmed as part of the FRB&#8217;s 2022 supervisory stress test with an effective date of October 1, 2022. The Bancorp&#8217;s capital ratios have exceeded the stress capital buffer requirement for all periods presented. 

The Bancorp adopted ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020 and elected the five-year transition phase-in option for the impact of CECL on regulatory capital with its regulatory filings as of March 31, 2020. The Bancorp&#8217;s modified CECL transition amount became subject to the phase-out provisions of the final rule on January 1, 2022, and will be fully phased-out by January 1, 2025. The impact of the modified CECL transition amount on the Bancorp&#8217;s regulatory capital at December 31, 2022 was an increase in capital of approximately $373 million. On a fully phased-in basis, the Bancorp&#8217;s CET1 ratio would be reduced by 21 bps as of December 31, 2022. 

The following table summarizes the Bancorp&#8217;s capital ratios as of December 31:

Capital Planning 

In 2011, the FRB adopted the capital plan rule, which requires BHCs with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more to submit annual capital plans to the FRB for review. Under the rule, these capital plans must include detailed descriptions of the following: the BHC&#8217;s internal processes for assessing capital adequacy; the policies governing capital actions such as common stock issuances, dividends and share repurchases; and all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon. Furthermore, each BHC must report to the FRB the results of stress tests conducted by the BHC under a number of scenarios that assess the sources and uses of capital under baseline and stressed economic conditions. 

Under the Enhanced Prudential Standards tailoring rules, the Bancorp is subject to Category IV standards, under which the Bancorp is no longer required to file semi-annual, company-run stress tests with the FRB and publicly disclose the results. However, the Bancorp is required to develop and maintain a capital plan approved by the Board of Directors on an annual basis. As an institution subject to Category IV standards, the Bancorp is subject to the FRB&#8217;s supervisory stress tests every two years, the Board capital plan rule and certain FR Y-14 reporting requirements. The supervisory stress tests are forward-looking quantitative evaluations of the impact of stressful economic and financial market conditions on the Bancorp&#8217;s capital. The Bancorp became subject to Category IV standards on December 31, 2019, and the requirements outlined above apply to the stress test cycle that started on January 1, 2020. The Bancorp was subject to the 2022 supervisory

stress test conducted by the FRB and submitted the Board-approved capital plan and information contained in Schedule C - Regulatory Capital Instruments as required. 

Dividend Policy and Stock Repurchase Program 

The Bancorp&#8217;s common stock dividend policy and stock repurchase program reflect its earnings outlook, desired payout ratios, the need to maintain adequate capital levels, the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends and the need to comply with safe and sound banking practices as well as meet regulatory requirements and expectations. The Bancorp declared dividends per common share of $1.26 and $1.14 during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

In June of 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the Bancorp to repurchase up to 100 million common shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and to utilize any derivative or similar instrument to effect share repurchase transactions. Under this authorization, t he Bancorp entered into and settled one accelerated share repurchase transaction during the year ended December 31, 2022.
