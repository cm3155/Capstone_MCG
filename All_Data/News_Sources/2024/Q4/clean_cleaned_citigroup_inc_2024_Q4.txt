United Parcel Service and Citigroup said they have cut thousands of supervisor jobs since last year.

Among them, James Riggle, 46 years old, said it is tough to get his resume noticed by job applicant-tracking algorithms.
"The recruiters aren't even having conversations with me," said Riggle, who was laid off earlier this year after
15 years at Citi, most of them as a manager in operations such as mortgages, settlement services and
foreclosures.                                                           

Citi, which announced its restructuring in September 2023, trimmed its management
layers to eight from 13 by March.                                       
"That [means] much, much faster decision-making," Citi Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason told investors in
the spring.
