The optimism is already evident in surging stock prices for some companies, like Discover Financial Services,
that are pursuing combinations. It is part of an optimism across Wall Street about potentially lucrative
opportunities under a second Trump term.                                
Trump-related euphoria quickly fed into the shares of Capital One Financial and Discover Financial Services,
which soared on renewed bets their $35 billion merger will pass regulatory muster.

The market is assigning an 80% probability the deal closes, up from 70% before the election, according to
MKP Advisors, which specializes in mergers-and-acquisitions transactions.
