Looking in from the outside are major banks like Goldman and JPMorgan Chase, whose executives now
worry they are ceding their lucrative franchises of big-ticket financing to these less regulated rivals.
At a closed-door Goldman management committee meeting this summer, the top brass debated a hard truth:
The investment bank was increasingly falling behind in private credit, namely in arranging big-ticket loans for
corporations, part of its bread-and-butter financing work, because the newcomers were willing to give out the
money at easier terms -- for example, by accepting less protection against defaults.
''The more risk you take, the better you look,'' Marc Nachmann, Goldman's global head of asset and wealth
management, advised the group. Still, the partners decided that they couldn't ignore the frenzy; Goldman
would continue to organize, for a fee, investment funds in which its clients can lend money alongside and in
competition with private credit firms.
