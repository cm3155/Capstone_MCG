Carlyle Group and KKR underlined the trend in July, when they bought a $10.1 billion portfolio of private
student loans at auction from Discover Financial Services, a digital banking and payment services company,
with the purchase price expected to reach about $10.8 billion once the deal closes later this year. Half of the
loans carry fixed rates and the rest have floating rates, according to the asset managers.
Discover sold privately issued loans, a category that represents less than 10% of the overall total of $1.75
trillion in student debt outstanding. That relative scarcity makes private student loans attractive to secondary
investors, and the Discover auction was competitive, according to Akhil Bansal, Carlyle's head of credit
strategic solutions.
