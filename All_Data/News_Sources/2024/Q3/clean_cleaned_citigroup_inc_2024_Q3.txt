JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo reported last week jumps in investment-banking revenue. More
favorable economic conditions and booming markets gave corporate executives the confidence to pursue
mergers, refinance debt and issue stock.                                
Both JPMorgan and Wells Fargo posted 6% revenue increases in their asset- and wealth-management businesses, while Citi's
wealth-unit revenue was up 2%. All four banks reported higher trading revenue.
JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo reported increases in investment-banking revenue of 46%, 60% and
38%, respectively, in the second quarter from a year earlier.           
Goldman's investment-banking revenue increased 21%, though it was down from the bank's first quarter this
year, as were Citi's and Wells Fargo's. This marks the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth
in Goldman's investment-banking fees following two years of mostly declines. Solomon said the firm's
investment-banking backlog increased significantly.
