          Chase, American Express and Capital One tout their travel-booking tools for cardholders as a way to
          maximize rewards and make dream vacations a reality. But are those sites a good deal?
          Premium credit cards such as the Chase Sapphire and American Express Platinum are geared to the jet-set
          crowd, and the portals are critical to their appeal. Many of these cards offer cardholders hundreds of dollars in
          travel credits that can be used only in their dedicated portals. They also entice people to spend their own
          money, versus their rewards, by offering significantly more points or miles for booking with them.
          Credit-card companies don't set prices for hotel rooms or plane tickets. Most don't even operate the
          travel-booking features connected to their cards -- major online travel agencies do. Hopper manages Capital
          One's website, and Expedia powers American Express's consumer-travel site.
