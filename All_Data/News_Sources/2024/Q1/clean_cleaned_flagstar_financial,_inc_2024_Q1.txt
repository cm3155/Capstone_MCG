NYCB's stock went on a wild ride Wednesday. The Wall Street Journal reported that the troubled regional
lender was seeking to raise equity capital in a bid to shore up confidence, sending shares down more than
40% during the session. Amid several trading halts, NYCB said it raised more than $1 billion from a group of
investors including former U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The company also disclosed a sweeping
overhaul of its management. NYCB shares recovered once trading resumed, ending 7.5% higher
Wednesday, followed by a 5.8% gain Thursday after NYCB cut its quarterly dividend.

NYCB +6.7%                                                              
Regional lender NYCB on Wednesday named Alessandro DiNello as executive chairman. The move comes
after NYCB reported a fourth-quarter loss and slashed its dividend to build capital after acquiring Flagstar
Bank and the failed Signature Bank. DiNello is the former head of Flagstar Bank. Since the report, NYCB
stock has dropped, reigniting fears of regional bank failures. NYCB executives raced to say the bank is
sound. NYCB shares gained 6.7% Wednesday.
