Discover Financial Services will soon give U.S. merchants the option to accept payments from shoppers' bank accounts -- no card needed.                                        
The card company is joining with fintech firm Buy It Mobility Networks Inc., whose technology allows consumers to pay directly from their checking accounts using merchants' apps. The companies are expected to announce the partnership this week.                                  
Discover's network is plugged into some 11.8 million U.S. merchant locations, according to 2020 data from the Nilson Report, removing a barrier to acceptance that has thwarted others attempting to break into the business.                                                               
Though its cards are widely accepted, Discover lags behind its bigger competitors -- Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and American Express Co. It accounted for just 2% of card transactions on major U.S. networks in 2020, according to the Nilson Report. Visa had 65%.                           
"It'll give us at Discover another arrow in the quiver," said Jason Hanson, senior vice president of global business development at Discover.                                       
BIM approached Discover, which is an investor in the company, and conversations about a partnership picked up during the last six months.
