The woman convicted of pulling off one of the largest bank-data heists in history was sentenced Tuesday to
five years of probation and time served by a federal judge in Seattle.  
Paige Adele Thompson was found guilty by a jury in June of wire fraud, unauthorized access to a protected
computer and damaging a computer, but was acquitted of other charges, including aggravated identity theft.
Ms. Thompson, a former Seattle-area tech worker, was arrested in July 2019 after stealing records from
Capital One Financial Corp. involving more than 100 million customers and credit-card applicants.
Personal data from Capital One credit-card applications from 2005 through 2019 was accessed, including
credit scores, payment history and contact information, the bank said at the time. The incident resulted in a
$190 million settlement between Capital One and affected individuals, and an $80 million fine from the
Treasury Department. Federal prosecutors pushed for a sentence of seven years. U.S. District Judge Robert
Lasnik said in the sentencing hearing that prison would be particularly difficult for Ms. Thompson, who is
transgender, owing to her status and mental health.                     
"While we understand the mitigating factors, we are very disappointed with the court's sentencing decision.
This is not what justice looks like," said U.S. Attorney Nick Brown. Representatives for Capital One didn't
respond to a request for comment.                                       
"Although we disagree that Paige committed any crimes, we are pleased the judge sentenced her to no
prison time," said Brian Klein, a lawyer for Ms. Thompson and a partner at Waymaker LLP.
