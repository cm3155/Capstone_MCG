Truist Financial Corp., operator of one of the nation's largest commercial banks, has made an investment in
game technology, acquiring Long Game Savings Inc., maker of a mobile app that rewards users for saving
money.                                                                  
The deal, led by Truist Ventures, the Charlotte, N.C.-based bank's venture-capital arm, includes Long Game's
team of engineers and designers. Truist said it plans to operate Long Game as a stand-alone app for now in
an effort to convert the app's users to customers. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.
"The business benefit of Long Game is acquiring new households [and] deepening relationships with existing
households," said Truist Chief Information Officer Scott Case.          
San Francisco-based Long Game had 12 bank and credit-union customers prior to the Truist acquisition, said
co-founder and CEO Lindsay Holden, with users spending around 13 minutes per session and saving an
average of around $60 a month, she said. Long Game has attracted "hundreds of thousands" of users since
the company's 2015 launch, Ms. Holden said. She will continue to lead the 12-person Long Game team,
which will report to Mr. Case.                                          
At Truist, the Long Game team will initially focus on the game app, but their duties could expand to improve
user experiences on the banking app, Mr. Case said.                     
Long Game users earn in-app coins by meeting savings goals and answering financial literacy quizzes. The
coins unlock eligibility to play games, which can yield cash rewards. Truist accounts will underpin the Long
Game app, since users gain in-app coins by increasing account balances. 
In 2019, BB&T Corp. completed its $28.2 billion acquisition of SunTrust Banks Inc. to create Truist, the
seventh largest U.S. commercial bank, according to the company.
