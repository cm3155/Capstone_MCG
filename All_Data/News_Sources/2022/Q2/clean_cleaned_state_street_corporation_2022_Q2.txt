Mr. Gottstein dismissed a report on a Swiss finance blog on Wednesday about a deal with State Street. "My
father once gave me advice: For really stupid questions, you better don't comment at all," he told investors at
a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. conference Thursday.                         
On Thursday, State Street also denied the news report. "State Street is not pursuing an acquisition of, or any
other business combination with, Credit Suisse," a spokesman said. "There is no basis to the continuing
market rumors."                                                         

Credit Suisse stock slid as much as 7%. It later recovered and was up for the day after a Swiss website,
Inside Paradeplatz, reported that State Street Corp. was considering a bid for Credit Suisse.
A Credit Suisse spokesman declined to comment on the report. A State Street spokesperson said the firm
wouldn't comment on the report and that it is focused on its pending acquisition of Brown Brothers Harriman's
Investors Services business.
