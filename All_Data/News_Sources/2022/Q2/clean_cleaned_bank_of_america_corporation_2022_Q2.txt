Bank of America Settles Garnishment Case                                
Bank of America is paying $10 million to settle a regulator's claim that it illegally helped some creditors strip
funds out of its customers' accounts, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said Wednesday.

The bureau, which brought the case against the bank, said Bank of America had forced the customers to
agree to contracts that limited their ability to fight the creditors' actions. In 3,700 cases, the bureau said, Bank
of America also made customers pay a total of just under $600,000 in ''garnishment fees'' for processing their
creditors' fund-extraction requests.                                    
''Bank of America imposed unlawful garnishment fees and injured its customers by inserting unenforceable
clauses into contracts in an attempt to strip legal rights from families,'' said Rohit Chopra, the bureau's
director.                                                               
A Bank of America spokesman said the bank was refunding the customers in the 3,700 cases.
