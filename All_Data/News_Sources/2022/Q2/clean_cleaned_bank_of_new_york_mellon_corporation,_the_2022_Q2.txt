The Securities and Exchange Commission fined the investment management arm of Bank of New York Mellon Corp. $1.5 million for misleading claims it made about funds that use environmental and social criteria to pick stocks.                                                         
The SEC said Monday that BNY Mellon Investment Adviser Inc. agreed to pay the fine after regulators found that some U.S. mutual funds it managed didn't go through a quality review of environmental, social or governance factors from July 2018 to September 2021.                    
BNY Investment Adviserneither admitted nor denied the claims.           
BNY said in a statement that none of the six funds in question were part of its specific sustainable fund offerings. The firm has updated its investor communication materials to be more precise and complete, it said.
