Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, all reporting quarterly earnings, said they had set aside
billions of dollars in preparation for loan defaults.                   
''This isn't a financial crisis,'' Citigroup's chief executive, Michael Corbat, said Wednesday. ''It's a public health
crisis with severe economic ramifications.''                            
To prepare for the fallout, Citigroup and other banks are adding to their reserves -- which is pinching their
profits. Citi said Wednesday that it had earned $2.5 billion for the quarter, a 46 percent drop from a year
earlier. It added $7 billion to its reserves, bringing its pool to nearly $21 billion.
''While we've built significant loan loss reserves,'' Mr. Corbat said. ''No one knows what the severity or
longevity of the virus' impact on the global economy will be.''         
Mr. Corbat praised his employees for their efforts to help clients in their time of need, and said the bank was
using its largely empty corporate cafeteria to make meals for food banks.
''We know many consumers are facing real struggles, and we're doing our best to support them,'' he said.
