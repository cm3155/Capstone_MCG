Caught in a Crisis, Big Banks Prepare for Rough Days Ahead................................................................................ 4
In a Scramble, Businesses Vie For U.S. Loans ....................................................................................................... 5

Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, all reporting quarterly earnings, said they had set aside
billions of dollars in preparation for loan defaults.                   

Bank of America also announced its quarterly results Wednesday, reporting a profit of $4 billion in the first
three months of 2020, down from $7.3 billion a year earlier. The difference came mostly from a $3.6 billion
increase in the amount of money the bank set aside for bad loans; the total reserved by the bank during this
quarter reached $4.8 billion.                                           
But as bad as the coronavirus has been for most businesses, at Bank of America it triggered a 34 percent
surge in revenue from the sales and trading of stocks, bonds and other financial products. That gain was
generated during a period when some employees say they have been under pressure to go to the office
despite the health risks. Bank of America said in a statement last week that it was ''sparing no expense or
consideration taking care of our people.''                              

Bank of America was the first big bank to begin taking applications, and it had around 10,000 by early Friday,
Brian Moynihan, the bank's chief executive, said on CNBC. By evening, its loan requests totaled $22 billion, a
spokesman said.                                                         
But many Bank of America customers were dismayed to find that the lender would not work with them
because they had only accounts, and not loans, with the bank. The bank said it was accepting applications
only from customers who had both ''a pre-existing business lending and business deposit relationship'' as of
Feb. 15.                                                                

That eliminated Tamara Alexander and her business in Houston, which provides behavioral therapy for
children with autism. With 13 employees, Ms. Alexander is struggling to stay afloat with just a trickle of clients
who can connect over video chat.                                        
She went to her Bank of America branch Friday morning with high hopes. But although her banker had
assured her the day before that she could get a loan, she was told that only those with an existing loan or
credit card would be eligible.                                          
''We kind of bootstrapped our way to our business -- thankfully we haven't needed to acquire any debt,'' Ms.
Alexander said. ''The one bit of help we need, we can't get. And coming from our own bank, it's just so
stressful.''                                                            
Dean Athanasia, the head of Bank of America's consumer and small business group, sent a memo to
employees on Friday pledging to ''enhance'' the program soon ''to accommodate more and more of our
small-business clients.''
