At Goldman Sachs, profits fell 46 percent to $1.2 billion, reflecting a set-aside of an additional $937 million for
potential credit losses, losses in its asset-management division and a rise in technology costs.
But the bank's revenue was essentially flat, helped in part by a 28 percent upswing in trading revenue and a
25 percent rise in investment-banking fees related primarily to direct lending to corporations and help when
they raised public money through the bond and stock markets.
