Companies across the investment landscape, from titans such as Charles Schwab Corp. to newcomers like
Webull Financial LLC, said they had technical glitches as morning trading kicked off. Several of the platforms
attributed the problems to extreme trading volumes and activity as investors rushed to buy and sell shares.
Among the companies that received reports of log-in issues or slowness were Vanguard Group, Charles
Schwab, TD Ameritrade Holding Corp., Fidelity Investments and Webull. 
Charles Schwab said some applications experienced technical issues, preventing some clients from being
able to log in. Vanguard said some clients "may have experienced difficulty accessing their accounts." TD
Ameritrade said users were experiencing slowness and encountered trouble accessing its mobile app and
platforms "due to heavy volumes of activity."
