Traders bid up shares in several companies that reported quarterly results that were better than analysts
expected, including Procter & Gamble, Regions Financial, Albertsons and Travelers. Others didn't fare as
well. Netflix shares fell in after-hours trading after the streaming service reported third-quarter earnings and a
tally of new subscribers that fell short of analysts' expectations.     

Regions Financial gained 4.9% as traders cheered the bank's latest quarterly results, which included solid fee
income from mortgages.
