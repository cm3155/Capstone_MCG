wells_fargo_&_company_2020_Q3


          Banks around the world are being squeezed by the pandemic. In the U.S., Wells Fargo & Co., for example, is
          slashing costs and cutting staff to try to ride out the crisis, moves that could hold clues for how other large
          U.S. banks may respond. Wells came into the crisis in worse shape than some U.S. rivals but in better shape
          than many European lenders, which have toiled for years as margins were squeezed by low interest rates in
          the wake of the last financial crisis.
