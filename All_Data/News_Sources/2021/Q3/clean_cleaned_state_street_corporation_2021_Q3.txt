Invesco Ltd. is in talks to merge with State Street Corp.'s asset-management business, people familiar with
the matter said.                                                        
A deal isn't imminent, and the discussions might not result in an agreement, the people said. It isn't clear what
the terms of a potential deal would look like, but it would be one of the industry's biggest in recent memory,
given State Street's asset-management unit manages nearly $4 trillion in assets.
State Street is one of the world's largest custody banks, providing accounting and administrative services to
other investment managers. The firm's own investing unit, State Street Global Advisors, remains a leading
seller of exchange-traded funds, the low-cost investing structure the firm pioneered.
Invesco oversees $1.5 trillion in assets and manages a large ETF business. It has a market value of about
$11 billion, compared with roughly $32 billion for State Street.        
                                                                  
Investors' appetite for lower-cost funds have thinned profit margins across the asset-management industry.
While the stock-market rally has helped mask some of these challenges, companies continue to feel pressure
to lower expenses and cut investment- management fees, which can be accomplished by combining forces.
                                                                  
Consolidation in the industry has picked up in recent years, and Invesco and State Street have been active
deal makers. Invesco snapped up several other asset managers, including OppenheimerFund Inc. and
Guggenheim Partners's ETF business. State Street expanded its asset-servicing arm, adding financial-data
firm Charles River Systems Inc. Earlier this month, the Boston-based bank agreed to acquire Brown Brothers
Harriman & Co.'s investor-services unit for $3.5 billion.
