The return of those employees to their offices has been halting and difficult. Last fall, Fifth Third Bank began
bringing back workers, but soon reversed course. LendingTree, which is moving from the suburbs to the city,
is waiting for the end of the school year. Wells Fargo has delayed its return to the office several times, telling
its employees recently that they will continue to work remotely through at least May 1. And Duke Energy will
bring some employees back in June, and most of the 6,000 people at its headquarters in September, when
children should be able to go back to schools.
