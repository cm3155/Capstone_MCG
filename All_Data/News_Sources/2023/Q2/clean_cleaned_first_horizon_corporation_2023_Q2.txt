The smaller banks that serve a swath of America's consumers and businesses are starting to pay up to keep their deposits.  

Main Street banks such as Citizens Financial Group Inc. and First Horizon Corp. said in recent first-quarter earnings reports they are having a tougher time hanging onto customer money in a world where the Federal Reserve has aggressively raised interest rates. To keep those depositors around, some lenders are paying more on savings accounts and turning to products like certificates of deposit.

Though profits rose at many banks in the first quarter, the deposit declines signal a fundamental change in their business. Deposits were plentiful in the era of superlow rates because customers had little incentive to move their money elsewhere. Banks grew to rely on them as a cheap source of funding that they could use to make loans or buy bonds and other securities.  

Based in Memphis, Tenn., First Horizon said noninterest-bearing deposits were also down 10% from the prior quarter, while interest-bearing deposits were up 1%.
