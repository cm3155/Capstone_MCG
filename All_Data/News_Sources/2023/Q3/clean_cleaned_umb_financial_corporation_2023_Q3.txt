"The market seemed to be a bit ahead of itself in these last couple of months. It was due for a slowdown,"
said Eric Kelley, interim chief investment officer at UMB Financial, a Kansas City bank. "It's still been an
incredible year, even with the week we've had."                         
Bond yields, on the other hand, may have room yet to rise, he said, reasoning that they tend to peak just
before the Federal Reserve reaches the end of rate-hike cycles. "The Fed is sending a very clear signal that
we can't assume that they're done," Kelley said.                        
Kelley said UMB analysts have concluded that 10-year Treasury yields greater than 4.75% pose a threat to
stocks.
