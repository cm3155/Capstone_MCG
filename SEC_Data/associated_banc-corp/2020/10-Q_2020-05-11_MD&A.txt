Overview 

The following discussion and analysis is presented to assist in the understanding and evaluation of the Corporation&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations. It is intended to complement the unaudited consolidated financial statements, footnotes, and supplemental financial data appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and should be read in conjunction therewith. Management continually evaluates strategic acquisition opportunities and various other strategic alternatives that could involve the sale or acquisition of branches or other assets, or the consolidation or creation of subsidiaries. Within the tables presented, certain columns and rows may not sum due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. 

On March 13, 2020, the President of the United States declared a national emergency in response to the global pandemic caused by COVID-19 which has led to stay-at-home orders around the country, including the three state footprint the Corporation does business. On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted to provide economic stimulus to impacted areas of the country. In response to this unprecedented declaration, the Corporation took the following actions to protect and support its customers, colleagues and communities: 

Customers: 

&#8226; The Corporation utilized the PPP to originate SBA loans designated to help businesses maintain their workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

&#8226; For consumers, the Corporation suspended certain transaction and late fees, initiated consumer and mortgage loan payment deferral and credit card payment relief programs, and suspended foreclosures and repossessions. 

&#8226; For small businesses, the Corporation initiated loan payment deferral and credit card payment relief programs and suspended certain loan late fees. 

Colleagues: 

&#8226; Associated was one of the first banks to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic by transitioning to primarily online, mobile, and drive-thru service, with its lobbies available by appointment only, and suspending operations at 29 branches without drive-thrus. 

&#8226; About 3,200 colleagues (68% of the Corporation's workforce) are working from home. 

&#8226; Associated is continuing to pay colleagues whose work is affected by changes to its services and is offering disaster relief payments to non-exempt employees whose work requires them to be in the Corporation's facilities. 

&#8226; The Corporation has also expanded its leave policies to accommodate personal or family health circumstances caused by COVID-19. 

Communities: 

&#8226; The Corporation donated $150,000 to local United Way chapters in Wisconsin, Illinois and Minnesota to fund community-based programs. 

&#8226; The Corporation made a commitment of $50,000 each to the Give to MKE Responds Fund, the Chicago Community COVID-19 Response Fund and the Minnesota Disaster Recovery Fund (MDRF) to assist with housing and small business relief efforts. 

See Recent Developments for an update on the current status of the Corporation's COVID-19 Relief Program efforts. 

Performance Summary 

&#8226; Average loans of $23.3 billion increased $205 million, or 1%, compared to the first three months of 2019. Average deposits of $24.3 billion decreased $264 million, or 1%, from the first three months of 2019. For 2020, the Corporation expects to maintain a loan to deposit ratio under 100%, excluding PPP loans. 

&#8226; Net interest income of $203 million decreased $13 million, or 6%, from the first three months of 2019. 

&#8226; Net interest margin was 2.84% compared to 2.90% for the first three months of 2019. 

&#8226; Provision for credit losses was $53 million, compared to provision of $6 million for the first three months of 2019. 

&#8226; Noninterest income of $98 million was up $7 million, or 8%, from the first three months of 2019. For 2020, the Corporation expects mortgage banking to remain solid due to elevated refinancing. The Corporation also anticipates lower service charges and other fee-based revenue due to the Corporation's COVID-19 Relief Program and expects lower wealth management fees resulting from weak market conditions for assets under management. 

&#8226; Noninterest expense of $192 million was up $1 million from the first three months of 2019. For 2020, the Corporation anticipates the noninterest expense run rate to be flat from the first quarter of 2020 through the remainder of 2020. 

&#8226; On January 1, 2020, the Corporation adopted ASU 2016-13 using the modified retrospective approach which resulted in an increase to the allowance for loan losses of $112 million and an increase to the allowance for unfunded commitments of $19 million for a total increase to the ACLL of $131 million. A corresponding after tax decrease to common equity of $98 million was recorded along with a deferred tax asset of $33 million, included in accrued expenses and other liabilities.

(b) Nonaccrual loans and loans held for sale have been included in the average balances. 

(c) Interest income includes amortization of net deferred loan origination costs and net accreted purchase loan discount. 

(d) During the third quarter of 2019, the Corporation made a change in accounting policy to offset derivative assets and liabilities and cash collateral with the same counterparty where it has a legally enforceable master netting agreement in place. Adoption of this change was voluntary and has been adopted retrospectively with March 31, 2019 restated. 

Notable Contributions to the Change in Net Interest Income 

&#8226; Net interest income on the consolidated statements of income (which excludes the fully tax-equivalent adjustment) was $203 million for the first three months of 2020 compared to $216 million for the first three months of 2019. Fully tax-equivalent net interest income of $207 million for the first three months of 2020 was $12 million, or 6%, lower than the first three months of 2019. The net interest margin for the first three months of 2020 was 2.84% compared to 2.90% for the first three months of 2019. The decreases were attributable to a lower interest rate environment. See sections Interest Rate Risk and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for a discussion of interest rate risk and market risk. 

&#8226; Average earning assets of $29.2 billion for the first three months of 2020 were $1.2 billion, or 4%, lower than the first three months of 2019. Average loans of $23.3 billion for the first three months of 2020 increased $205 million, or 1%, from the first three months of 2019, primarily due to a $212 million, or 4%, increase in commercial real estate loans, while taxable investment securities decreased $1.5 billion, or 30%, as the Corporation used its investment portfolio as a source of funds in 2019 to reposition the balance sheet for a declining rate environment. 

&#8226; Average interest-bearing liabilities of $22.8 billion for the first three months of 2020 were down $1.4 billion, or 6%, versus the first three months of 2019. On average, interest-bearing deposits decreased $789 million, or 4%, primarily driven by decreases in higher cost deposits such as network, time and money market accounts. Long-term funding decreased $246 million or 31%, primarily due to the redemption of $250 million of senior notes in October 2019. 

&#8226; The cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 1.06% for the first three months of 2020, which was 45 bp lower than the first three months of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a 51 bp decrease in the cost of average interest-bearing deposits to 0.79%, primarily due to the federal funds rate decreases that occurred since the first quarter of 2019. 

&#8226; The Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds target interest rate twice in March 2020, totaling 150 bp, to a range of 0.00% to 0.25%, compared to a range of 2.25% to 2.50% at the end of the first quarter of 2019. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses is predominantly a function of the Corporation&#8217;s reserving methodology and judgments as to other qualitative and quantitative factors used to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded commitments, which focuses on changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio, changes in levels of individually evaluated and other nonaccrual loans, historical losses and delinquencies in each portfolio category, the level of loans sold or transferred to held for sale, the risk inherent in specific loans, concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries, existing economic conditions and economic forecasts, the fair value of underlying collateral, and other factors which could affect potential credit losses. The forecast the Corporation used for March 31, 2020 was the Moody's baseline scenario from March 27, 2020 over a 1 year reasonable and supportable period with immediate reversion to historical losses. See additional discussion under the sections titled, Loans, Credit Risk, Nonperforming Assets, and Allowance for Credit Losses.

Notable Contributions to the Change in Noninterest Income 

&#8226; Capital markets, net was up $5 million from the first three months of 2019, driven by interest rate swap fees. 

&#8226; Mortgage banking, net was up $1 million, or 30%, from the first three months of 2019. During the quarter, the Corporation recognized a $3 million fair value adjustment on $200 million of portfolio loans transferred to held for sale and an $8 million increase in gains and fair value adjustments on loans held for sale, the latter due to higher refinance activity, partially offset by an increase of $9 million in MSRs impairment driven by rates. 

&#8226; Investment securities gains (losses), net was up $4 million from the first three months of 2019, as the Corporation sold prepayment sensitive mortgage-related securities for a gain of $6 million during the quarter.

Notable Contributions to the Change in Noninterest Expense 

&#8226; Personnel expense decreased $6 million, or 5%, from the first three months of 2019, primarily driven by a decrease in funding for the management incentive plan. 

&#8226; Technology expense increased $2 million, or 9%, from the first three months of 2019, reflecting the Corporation's continuous investment in new technology. 

&#8226; The Corporation's FDIC assessment increased $2 million, or 47%, from the first three months of 2019, due to expected increases resulting from asset growth. 

Income Taxes 

The Corporation recognized income tax expense of $10 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, compared to income tax expense of $22 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. The Corporation's effective tax rate was 18.23% for the first three months of 2020, compared to an effective tax rate of 20.53% for the first three months of 2019. The lower effective tax rate and income tax expense during the first three months of 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in income before taxes. 

Income tax expense recorded on the consolidated statements of income involves the interpretation and application of certain accounting pronouncements and federal and state tax laws and regulations, and is, therefore, considered a critical accounting policy. The Corporation is subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Examination by taxing authorities may impact the amount of tax expense and / or reserve for uncertainty in income taxes if their interpretations differ from those of management, based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations. See section Critical Accounting Policies, in the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on income taxes.

(a) During the first quarter of 2020, the Corporation transferred $200 million of portfolio residential mortgages to residential loans held for sale, which are not included in total loans. 

The Corporation has long-term guidelines relative to the proportion of Commercial and Business, Commercial Real Estate, and Consumer loans within the overall loan portfolio, with each targeted to represent 30-40% of the overall loan portfolio. The targeted long-term guidelines were unchanged during 2019 and the first three months of 2020. Furthermore, certain sub-asset classes within the respective portfolios are further defined and dollar limitations are placed on these sub-portfolios. These guidelines and limits are reviewed quarterly and approved annually by the Enterprise Risk Committee of the Corporation&#8217;s Board of Directors. These guidelines and limits are designed to create balance and diversification within the loan portfolios. 

The Corporation&#8217;s loan distribution and interest rate sensitivity as of March 31, 2020 are summarized in the following table.

Credit Risk 

An active credit risk management process is used for commercial loans to ensure that sound and consistent credit decisions are made. Credit risk is controlled by detailed underwriting procedures, comprehensive loan administration, and periodic review of borrowers&#8217; outstanding loans and commitments. Borrower relationships are formally reviewed and graded on an ongoing basis for early identification of potential problems. Further analysis by customer, industry, and geographic location are performed to monitor trends, financial performance, and concentrations. See Note 7 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information on managing overall credit quality. 

The loan portfolio is widely diversified by types of borrowers, industry groups, and market areas within the Corporation's branch footprint. Significant loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to numerous borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. At March 31, 2020, no significant concentrations existed in the Corporation&#8217;s portfolio in excess of 10% of total loans. 

Commercial and business lending: The commercial and business lending classification primarily includes commercial loans to large corporations, middle market companies, small businesses, and lease financing.

March 31, 2020 % of Total Loans % of Total Commercial and Business Lending Manufacturing and Wholesale Trade 8 % 19 % Power and Utilities 7 % 17 % Real Estate 6 % 15 % Finance and Insurance 6 % 15 % 

The remaining commercial and business lending portfolio is spread over a diverse range of industries, none of which exceed 2% of total loans. 

The credit risk related to commercial loans is largely influenced by general economic conditions and the resulting impact on a borrower&#8217;s operations or on the value of underlying collateral, if any. Currently, a higher risk segment of the commercial and business lending portfolio is loans to borrowers supporting oil and gas exploration and production, which are further discussed under oil and gas lending below. 

Oil and gas lending: The Corporation provides reserve based loans to oil and gas exploration and production firms. At March 31, 2020, the oil and gas portfolio was comprised of 35 credits, totaling $466 million of outstanding balances, which represents less than 2% of the Corporation's total loans. The decrease in balances from March 31, 2019 continue to be driven by a purposeful reduction in exposure to the Corporation's higher-leveraged borrowers. 

The Corporation's oil and gas lending team is based in Houston and focuses on serving the funding needs of small and mid-sized companies in the upstream oil and gas business. The oil and gas loans are first lien, reserve-based, and borrowing base dependent lines of credit. The portfolio is diversified across all major U.S. geographic basins and is diversified by product line with approximately 62% in oil and 38% in gas at March 31, 2020. Borrowing base re-determinations for the portfolio are generally completed twice a year and are based on detailed engineering reports and discounted cash flow analysis. 

The following table summarizes information about the Corporation's oil and gas loan portfolio.

&#8226; The ACLL attributable to oil and gas related credits (included within the commercial and industrial ACLL) was $78 million at March 31, 2020, compared to $13 million at December 31, 2019 and $12 million at March 31, 2019. The increase is primarily the result of the adoption of ASU 2016-13, which leverages the price of oil and gas in the determination of both the ACLL and the allowance associated with probable TDRs. 

The adoption impact of ASU 2016-13 for oil and gas loans was included within the commercial and industrial line item of the adoption table in Note 3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The following table provides a summary of the changes in the ACLL in the Corporation's oil and gas loan portfolio as a result of adopting ASU 2016-13.

Commercial real estate - investor: Commercial real estate-investor is comprised of loans secured by various non-owner occupied or investor income producing property types.

Credit risk is managed in a similar manner to commercial and business lending by employing sound underwriting guidelines, lending primarily to borrowers in local markets and businesses, periodically evaluating the underlying collateral, and formally reviewing the borrower&#8217;s financial soundness and relationship on an ongoing basis. 

Real estate construction: Real estate construction loans are primarily short-term or interim loans that provide financing for the acquisition or development of commercial income properties, multi-family projects or residential development, both single family and condominium. Real estate construction loans are made to developers and project managers who are generally well known to the Corporation and have prior successful project experience. The credit risk associated with real estate construction loans is generally confined to specific geographic areas but is also influenced by general economic conditions. The Corporation controls the credit risk on these types of loans by making loans in familiar markets to developers, reviewing the merits of individual projects, controlling loan structure, and monitoring project progress and construction advances.

The remaining real estate construction portfolio is spread over various other property types, none of which exceed 2% of total loans. 

The Corporation&#8217;s current lending standards for commercial real estate and real estate construction lending are determined by property type and specifically address many criteria, including: maximum loan amounts, maximum LTV, requirements for pre-leasing and / or presales, minimum borrower equity, and maximum loan-to-cost. Currently, the maximum standard for LTV is 80%, with lower limits established for certain higher risk types, such as raw land that has a 50% LTV maximum. The Corporation&#8217;s LTV guidelines are in compliance with regulatory supervisory limits. In most cases, for real estate construction loans, the loan amounts include interest reserves, which are built into the loans and sized to fund loan payments through construction and lease up and / or sell out. 

Residential mortgages: Residential mortgage loans are primarily first lien home mortgages with a maximum loan-to-collateral value without credit enhancement (e.g. private mortgage insurance) of 80%. The residential mortgage portfolio is focused primarily in the Corporation's three-state branch footprint, with approximately 87% of the outstanding loan balances in the Corporation's branch footprint at March 31, 2020. The majority of the on balance sheet residential mortgage portfolio consists of hybrid, adjustable rate mortgage loans with initial fixed rate terms of 3, 5, 7, or 10 years. 

The Corporation generally retains certain fixed-rate residential real estate mortgages in its loan portfolio, including retail and private banking jumbo mortgages and CRA-related mortgages. As part of management&#8217;s historical practice of originating and servicing residential mortgage loans, generally the Corporation&#8217;s 30 year, agency conforming, fixed-rate residential real estate mortgage loans have been sold in the secondary market with servicing rights retained. Subject to management&#8217;s analysis of the current interest rate environment, among other market factors, the Corporation may choose to retain 30 year mortgage loan production on its balance sheet. During the first quarter of 2020, the Corporation transferred $200 million of portfolio residential mortgages to residential loans held for sale related to a portfolio loan sale that settled in April 2020, in order to reduce the Corporation's exposure to prepayment risk in the current low risk environment. See section Loans for additional information on loans. 

The Corporation&#8217;s underwriting and risk-based pricing guidelines for residential mortgage loans include minimum borrower FICO and maximum LTV of the property securing the loan. Residential mortgage products generally are underwritten using FHLMC and FNMA secondary marketing guidelines. 

Home equity: Home equity consists of both home equity lines of credit and closed-end home equity loans. The Corporation&#8217;s credit risk monitoring guidelines for home equity is based on an ongoing review of loan delinquency status, as well as a quarterly review of FICO score deterioration and property devaluation. The Corporation does not routinely obtain appraisals on performing loans to update LTV ratios after origination; however, the Corporation monitors the local housing markets by reviewing the various home price indices and incorporates the impact of the changing market conditions in its ongoing credit monitoring process. For junior lien home equity loans, the Corporation is unable to track the performance of the first lien loan if it does not own or service the first lien loan. However, the Corporation obtains a refreshed FICO score on a quarterly basis and monitors this as part of its assessment of the home equity portfolio. 

The Corporation&#8217;s underwriting and risk-based pricing guidelines for home equity lines and loans consist of a combination of both borrower FICO and the original cumulative LTV against the property securing the loan. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, in the volatile economic environment, the Corporation reduced its exposure by reducing its maximum LTV on home equity lines of credit from 90% to 80%, among other changes, while maintaining the minimum acceptable FICO at 670. The Corporation's current home equity line of credit offering is priced based on floating rate indices and generally allows 10 years of interest-only payments followed by a 20-year amortization of the outstanding balance. The Corporation has significantly curtailed its offerings of fixed-rate, closed-end home equity loans. The loans in the Corporation's portfolio generally have an original term of 20 years with principal and interest payments required. See section Loans for additional information on loans. 

Other consumer: Other consumer consists of student loans, short-term and other personal installment loans and credit cards. The Corporation had $130 million and $136 million of student loans at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, the majority of which are government guaranteed. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the passage of the CARES Act, government guaranteed student loans have been placed on an administrative forbearance through September 30, 2020. Credit risk for non-government guaranteed student loans, short-term, personal installment loans, and credit cards is influenced by general economic conditions, the characteristics of individual borrowers, and the nature of the loan collateral. Risks of loss are generally on smaller average balances per loan spread over many borrowers. Once charged off, there is usually less opportunity for recovery of these smaller consumer loans. Credit risk is primarily controlled by reviewing the creditworthiness of the borrowers, monitoring payment histories, and taking appropriate collateral and guarantee positions. The student loan portfolio is in run-off and no new student loans are being originated.

Management is committed to a proactive nonaccrual and problem loan identification philosophy. This philosophy is implemented through the ongoing monitoring and review of all pools of risk in the loan portfolio to ensure that problem loans are identified quickly and the risk of loss is minimized. Table 14 provides detailed information regarding NPAs, which include nonaccrual loans, OREO, and other NPAs:

Nonaccrual loans: Nonaccrual loans are considered to be one indicator of potential future loan losses. See Note 7 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional nonaccrual loan disclosures. See also Allowance for Credit Losses. 

Accruing loans past due 90 days or more: Loans past due 90 days or more but still accruing interest are classified as such where the underlying loans are both well secured (the collateral value is sufficient to cover principal and accrued interest) and are in the process of collection. 

Restructured loans: Loans are considered restructured loans if concessions have been granted to borrowers that are experiencing financial difficulty. See also Note 7 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional restructured loans disclosures. 

Potential problem loans: The level of potential problem loans is another predominant factor in determining the relative level of risk in the loan portfolio and in determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. Potential problem loans are generally defined by management to include loans rated as substandard by management but that are not individually evaluated (i.e., nonaccrual loans and accruing TDRs); however, there are circumstances present to create doubt as to the ability of the borrower to comply with present repayment terms. The decision of management to include performing loans in potential problem loans does not necessarily mean that the Corporation expects losses to occur, but that management recognizes a higher degree of risk associated with these loans. 

OREO: Management actively seeks to ensure OREO properties held are monitored to minimize the Corporation&#8217;s risk of loss. OREO properties increased $1 million, or 7%, from December 31, 2019, primarily driven by the pending disposition of recently consolidated First Staunton branches, and increased $10 million, or 83%, from March 31, 2019, primarily driven by the pending disposition of consolidated Huntington and First Staunton branches. 

Other nonperforming assets: The asset balance as of March 31, 2020 represents the Bank's units of ownership interest in an oil and gas limited liability company as a result of a partial settlement of a debt. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans 

Credit risks within the loan portfolio are inherently different for each loan type. Credit risk is controlled and monitored through the use of lending standards, a thorough review of potential borrowers, and ongoing review of loan payment performance. Active asset quality administration, including early problem loan identification and timely resolution of problems, aids in the management of credit risk and the minimization of loan losses. Credit risk management for each loan type is discussed in the section entitled Credit Risk. See Note 7 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures on the ACLL. 

To assess the appropriateness of the ACLL, an allocation methodology is applied by the Corporation which focuses on evaluation of many factors, including but not limited to: evaluation of facts and issues related to specific loans, management&#8217;s ongoing review and grading of the loan portfolio, credit report refreshes, consideration of historical loan loss and delinquency experience on each portfolio category, trends in past due and nonaccrual loans, the level of potential problem loans, the risk characteristics of the various classifications of loan segments, changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio, concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries, existing economic conditions and economic forecasts, the fair value of underlying collateral, funding assumptions on lines and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses. The Corporation utilized the Moody's baseline forecast, updated at the end of March, in the allowance model. The forecast is applied over a 1 year reasonable and supportable period with immediate reversion to historical long run losses. Assessing these factors involves significant judgment. Because each of the criteria used is subject to change, the ACLL is not necessarily indicative of the trend of future credit losses on loans in any particular segment. Therefore, management considers the ACLL a critical accounting policy, see section Critical Accounting Policies for additional information on the ACLL. See section Nonperforming Assets for a detailed discussion on asset quality. See also Note 7 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional ACLL disclosures. Table 5 provides information on loan growth and period end loan composition, Table 14 provides additional information regarding NPAs, and Table 15 and Table 16 provide additional information regarding activity in the ACLL. 

The methodology used for the allocation of the ACLL at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 was generally comparable. The allocation methodology consists of the following components: First, a valuation allowance estimate is established for specifically identified commercial and consumer loans determined by the Corporation to be individually evaluated, using discounted cash flows, estimated fair value of underlying collateral, and / or other data available. Second, management allocates the ACLL with loss factors by loan segment. Loans are segmented for criticized loan pools by loan type as well as for non-criticized loan pools by loan type, primarily based on historical loss rates after considering loan type, historical loss and delinquency experience, credit quality, and industry classifications. Loans that have been criticized are considered to have a higher risk of default than non-criticized loans, as circumstances were present to support the lower loan grade, warranting higher loss factors. The loss factors applied in the methodology are periodically re-evaluated and adjusted to reflect changes in historical loss levels or other risks. Additionally, management allocates ACLL to absorb losses that may not be provided for by the other components due to qualitative factors evaluated by management, such as limitations within the credit risk grading process, known current economic or business conditions that may not yet show in trends, industry or other concentrations with current issues that impose higher inherent risks than are reflected in the loss factors, and other relevant considerations. The total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the loan portfolio.

Notable Contributions to the Change in the Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans 

&#8226; Total loans increased $1.5 billion, or 7%, from December 31, 2019 and increased $1.2 billion, or 5%, from March 31, 2019. During the first quarter of 2020, commercial loans were up as customers drew on lines of credit. In addition, the Corporation added $370 million in loans from the First Staunton acquisition during the first quarter of 2020. See section Loans for additional information on the changes in the loan portfolio and see section Credit Risk for discussion about credit risk management for each loan type. 

&#8226; Potential problem loans increased $73 million, or 45%, from December 31, 2019 primarily due to increases in potential problem commercial and industrial and commercial real estate - investor loans. See Table 14 for additional information on the changes in potential problem loans. 

&#8226; Total nonaccrual loans increased $18 million, or 15%, from December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in nonaccrual commercial and industrial and residential mortgage loans, but decreased $19 million, or 12%, from March 31, 2019, primarily due to a decrease in commercial and industrial loans. See Note 7 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements and Table 14 for additional disclosures on the changes in asset quality. 

&#8226; Year-to-date net charge offs increased $10 million from March 31, 2019, primarily driven by an increase in commercial and industrial charge offs. See Table 15 and Table 16 for additional information regarding the activity in the ACLL. 

Management believes the level of ACLL to be appropriate at March 31, 2020.

&#8226; Total deposits increased $1.9 billion, or 8%, from December 31, 2019 and increased $129 million, or 1%, from March 31, 2019. On February 14, 2020, the Corporation assumed $439 million in deposits from the acquisition of First Staunton. Additionally in March 2020, the Corporation saw deposit inflows from customers likely building cash in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

&#8226; Savings accounts increased $298 million, or 11%, from December 31, 2019 and increased $817 million, or 37%, from March 31, 2019, primarily due to the addition of a premium savings deposit product. 

&#8226; Money market deposits increased $77 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2019, but decreased $1.3 billion, or 14%, from March 31, 2019. The change from March 31, 2019 was primarily due to the reduction in higher cost network deposits as well as a migration of certain customers to a premium savings product . 

&#8226; Non-maturity deposit accounts comprised of savings, money market, and demand (both interest and noninterest-bearing) accounts comprised 90% of the Corporation's total deposits at March 31, 2020. 

&#8226; Included in the above amounts were $1.7 billion of network deposits, primarily sourced from other financial institutions and intermediaries. These represented 7% of the Corporation's total deposits at March 31, 2020. Network deposits increased $396 million, or 30%, from December 31, 2019, but decreased $472 million, or 21%, from March 31, 2019. 

Liquidity 

The objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that the Corporation has the ability to generate sufficient cash or cash equivalents in a timely and cost effective manner to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers and to meet its other commitments as they become due. The Corporation&#8217;s liquidity risk management process is designed to identify, measure, and manage the Corporation&#8217;s funding and liquidity risk to meet its daily funding needs in the ordinary course of business, as well as to address expected and unexpected changes in its funding requirements. The Corporation engages in 

various activities to manage its liquidity risk, including diversifying its funding sources, stress testing, and holding readily-marketable assets which can be used as a source of liquidity, if needed. 

The Corporation performs dynamic scenario analysis in accordance with industry best practices. Measures have been established to ensure the Corporation has sufficient high quality short-term liquidity to meet cash flow requirements under stressed scenarios. In addition, the Corporation also reviews static measures such as deposit funding as a percentage of total assets and liquid asset levels. Strong capital ratios, credit quality, and core earnings are also essential to maintaining cost effective access to wholesale funding markets. At March 31, 2020, the Corporation was in compliance with its internal liquidity objectives and has sufficient asset-based liquidity to meet its obligations under a stressed scenario. 

The Corporation maintains diverse and readily available liquidity sources, including: 

&#8226; Investment securities, which are an important tool to the Corporation&#8217;s liquidity objective and can be pledged or sold to enhance liquidity, if necessary. See Note 6 Investment Securities of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Corporation's investment securities portfolio, including pledged investment securities. 

&#8226; Pledgeable loan collateral, which is eligible collateral with both the Federal Reserve Bank and the FHLB under established lines of credit. Based on the amount of collateral pledged, the FHLB established a collateral value from which the Bank may draw advances against the collateral. The collateral is also used to enable the FHLB to issue letters of credit in favor of public fund depositors of the Bank. As of March 31, 2020, the Bank had $3.6 billion available for future advances. The Federal Reserve Bank also establishes a collateral value of assets to support borrowings from the discount window. As of March 31, 2020, the Bank had $1.3 billion available for discount window borrowings. 

&#8226; A $200 million Parent Company commercial paper program, of which $34 million was outstanding as of March 31, 2020. 

&#8226; Dividends and service fees from subsidiaries, as well as the proceeds from issuance of capital, which are also funding sources for the Parent Company. 

&#8226; Equity issuances by The Parent Company; the Corporation has filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC under which the Parent Company may, from time to time, offer shares of the Corporation&#8217;s common stock in connection with acquisitions of businesses, assets, or securities of other companies. 

&#8226; Other issuances by the Parent Company; the Corporation also has filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC, under which the Parent Company may offer the following securities, either separately or in units: debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, and warrants. 

&#8226; Bank issuances; the Bank may also issue institutional CDs, network transaction deposits, and brokered CDs. 

&#8226; Global Bank Note Program issuances; the Bank has implemented the program pursuant to which it may from time to time offer up to $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of its unsecured senior and subordinated notes. In August 2018, the Bank issued $300 million of senior notes, due August 2021, and callable July 2021. 

Credit ratings relate to the Corporation&#8217;s ability to issue debt securities and the cost to borrow money, and should not be viewed as an indication of future stock performance or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities. Adverse changes in these factors could result in a negative change in credit ratings and impact not only the ability to raise funds in the capital markets but also the cost of these funds. The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Bank at March 31, 2020 are displayed below:

For the three months ended March 31, 2020, net cash used in operating activities and investing activities was $20 million and $928 million, respectively, while net cash provided by financing activities was $1.0 billion for a net increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $90 million since year-end 2019. At March 31, 2020, assets of $33.9 billion increased $1.5 billion, or 5%, from year-end 2019, primarily driven by a $1.4 billion, or 6%, increase in loans, net. On February 14, 2020, the Corporation added $370 million in loans from the First Staunton acquisition. On the funding side, deposits of $25.7 billion increased $1.9 billion, or 8%, from year-end. On February 14, 2020, the Corporation assumed $439 million of deposits from the 

First Staunton acquisition. Additionally in March 2020, the Corporation saw deposit inflows from customers likely building cash in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

For the three months ended March 31, 2019, net cash used in operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities was $14 million, $163 million, and $54 million, respectively, for a net decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $230 million since year-end 2018. At March 31, 2019, assets of $33.7 billion increased $66 million, or less than 1%, from year-end 2018. On the funding side, deposits of $25.5 billion increased $636 million, or 3%, from year-end 2018. 

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Market risk and interest rate risk are managed centrally. Market risk is the potential for loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of fixed income securities, equity securities, other earning assets and derivative financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates or other factors. Interest rate risk is the potential for reduced net interest income resulting from adverse changes in the level of interest rates. As a financial institution that engages in transactions involving an array of financial products, the Corporation is exposed to both market risk and interest rate risk. In addition to market risk, interest rate risk is measured and managed through a number of methods. The Corporation uses financial modeling simulation techniques that measure the sensitivity of future earnings due to changing rate environments to measure interest rate risk. 

Policies established by the Corporation&#8217;s ALCO and approved by the Board of Directors are intended to limit these risks. The Board has delegated day-to-day responsibility for managing market and interest rate risk to ALCO. The primary objectives of market risk management is to minimize any adverse effect that changes in market risk factors may have on net interest income and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets recorded at fair value. 

Interest Rate Risk 

The primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk within policy limits approved by the Board of Directors. These limits and guidelines reflect the Corporation's risk appetite for interest rate risk over both short-term and long-term horizons. No interest rate limit breaches occurred during the first three months of 2020. 

The major sources of the Corporation's non-trading interest rate risk are timing differences in the maturity and re-pricing characteristics of assets and liabilities, changes in the shape of the yield curve, and the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options. We measure these risks and their impact by identifying and quantifying exposures through the use of sophisticated simulation and valuation models which are employed by management to understand NII at risk, interest rate sensitive EAR, and MVE at risk. The Corporation&#8217;s interest rate risk profile is such that a higher or steeper yield curve adds to income while a flatter yield curve is relatively neutral, and a lower or inverted yield curve generally has a negative impact on earnings. The Corporation's EAR profile is asset sensitive at March 31, 2020. 

For further discussion of the Corporation's interest rate risk and corresponding key assumptions, see the Interest Rate Risk section of Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The sensitivity analysis included below is measured as a percentage change in NII and EAR due to gradual moves in benchmark interest rates from a baseline scenario over 12 months. We evaluate the sensitivity using: 1) a dynamic forecast incorporating expected growth in the balance sheet, and 2) a static forecast where the current balance sheet is held constant. 

While a gradual shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under a probable scenario, an instantaneous shift in interest rates would have a much more significant impact. 

Table 20 Estimated % Change in Rate Sensitive Earnings at Risk Over 12 Months 

&#160; Dynamic Forecast March 31, 2020 Static Forecast March 31, 2020 Dynamic Forecast December 31, 2019 Static Forecast December 31, 2019 Gradual Rate Change 100 bp increase in interest rates 6.9 % 6.1 % 4.0 % 3.7 % 200 bp increase in interest rates 12.9 % 11.2 % 7.4 % 6.7 % 

At March 31, 2020, the MVE profile indicates an increase in net balance sheet value due to instantaneous upward changes in rates. 

Table 21 Market Value of Equity Sensitivity 

March 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Instantaneous Rate Change 100 bp increase in interest rates 3.6 % (0.5) % 200 bp increase in interest rates 4.9 % (2.2) % 

Since MVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments The change in MVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current year). Further, MVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changes in product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. 

The above NII, EAR, and MVE measures do not include all actions that management may undertake to manage this risk in response to anticipated changes in interest rates.

Capital 

Management actively reviews capital strategies for the Corporation and each of its subsidiaries in light of perceived business risks, future growth opportunities, industry standards, and compliance with regulatory requirements. The assessment of overall capital adequacy depends on a variety of factors, including asset quality, liquidity, stability of earnings, changing competitive forces, economic condition in markets served, and strength of management. At March 31, 2020, the capital ratios of the Corporation and its banking subsidiaries were in excess of regulatory minimum requirements. The Corporation&#8217;s capital ratios are summarized in the following table.

(a) The Federal Reserve establishes regulatory capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards for the Corporation. The Corporation follows Basel III, subject to certain transition provisions. These regulatory capital measurements are used by management, regulators, investors, and analysts to assess, monitor and compare the quality and composition of the Corporation's capital with the capital of other financial services companies. 

(b) Ratio is based upon basic earnings per common share. 

See Part II, Item 2, Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds, for information on the shares repurchased during the first quarter of 2020. 

In February 2019, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule (the "2019 CECL Rule") that revised certain capital regulations to account for changes to credit loss accounting under GAAP. The rule included a transition option that allows banking organizations to phase in, over a three-year period, the day-one impact of CECL adoption on regulatory capital ratios. In March 2020, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that maintains the three-year transition option of the 2019 CECL Rule and also provides an option to delay for two years an estimate of the effect of CECL on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology's effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three- year transition period. The Corporation has elected to utilize the CECL Transition Provision granted by the banking regulators. Under these provisions, the Day 1 capital impact relating to the adoption of ASU 2016-13 and 25% of the difference between the period end ACL and the Day 1 ACL will be 100% deferred for 2 years, and then phased in over the next 3 years. At March 31, 2020, the Corporation had a modified CECL transitional amount of $108 million.

(a) The ratio tangible common equity to tangible assets excludes goodwill and other intangible assets, net, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. This financial measure has been included as it is considered to be a critical metric with which to analyze and evaluate financial condition and capital strength. 

(b) The Federal Reserve establishes regulatory capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards for the Corporation. The Corporation follows Basel III, subject to certain transition provisions. These regulatory capital measurements are used by management, regulators, investors, and analysts to assess, monitor and compare the quality and composition of the Corporation's capital with the capital of other financial services companies. 

(c) This is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes these measures are meaningful because they reflect adjustments commonly made by management, investors, regulators, and analysts to evaluate the adequacy of earnings per common share and provide greater understanding of ongoing operations and enhanced comparability of results with prior periods. 

(d) The efficiency ratio as defined by the Federal Reserve guidance is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments) divided by the sum of net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains / losses, net. The fully tax-equivalent efficiency ratio is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments), excluding other intangible amortization, divided by the sum of fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains / losses, net. The adjusted efficiency ratio is noninterest expense, which excludes the provision for unfunded commitments, other intangible amortization, and acquisition related costs, divided by the sum of fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains / losses, net and acquisition related costs. Management believes the adjusted efficiency ratio is a meaningful measure as it enhances the comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources and provides a better measure as to how the Corporation is managing its expenses by adjusting for acquisition related costs and provision for unfunded commitments. 

(e) The quarter ended March 31, 2020 includes First Staunton acquisition related costs, while 2019 periods include Huntington branch and First Staunton acquisition related costs. 

Sequential Quarter Results 

The Corporation reported net income of $46 million for the first quarter of 2020, compared to net income of $72 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. Net income available to common equity was $42 million for the first quarter of 2020, or $0.27 for both basic and diluted earnings per common share. Comparatively, net income available to common equity for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $68 million, or $0.43 for both basic and diluted earnings per common share (see Table 1). 

Fully tax-equivalent net interest income for the first quarter of 2020 was $207 million, $3 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2019. The net interest margin in the first quarter of 2020 was up 1 bp to 2.84%. Average earning assets increased $434 million to $29.2 billion in the first quarter of 2020. On the funding side, average interest-bearing deposits were up $152 million, or 1% and FHLB advances increased $323 million, or 11% (see Table 2). The favorable results in the first quarter of 2020 were primarily driven by higher loan volumes, LIBOR - fed funds expansion, and interest-bearing deposit cost reductions. 

Average total deposits for the first quarter of 2020 increased $189 million, or 1%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. On February 14, 2020, the Corporation assumed $439 million in deposits from the First Staunton acquisition. 

The provision for credit losses was $53 million for the first quarter of 2020, compared to zero in the fourth quarter of 2019 (see Table 15). The increase was a result of inflows in probable TDRs and the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic within the economic models used in the new expected credit loss methodology. See discussion under sections: Provision for Credit Losses, Nonperforming Assets, and Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans. 

Noninterest income for the first quarter of 2020 increased $5 million, or 6%, to $98 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, pr imarily due to a $6 million gain on investment securities sales as the Corporation sold prepayment sensitive mortgage-related securities (see Table 3). 

Noninterest expense decreased $11 million, or 6%, to $192 million, primarily driven by a decrease in funding for the management incentive plan (see Table 4). 

For the first quarter of 2020, the Corporation recognized income tax expense of $10 million, compared to income tax expense of $17 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. The effective tax rate was 18.23% and 19.41% for the first quarter of 2020 and the fourth quarter of 2019, respectively. The lower tax expense in the first quarter of 2020 was primarily driven by the decrease in income before tax. See Income Taxes section for a detailed discussion on income taxes. 

Segment Review 

As discussed in Note 15 Segment Reporting of the notes to consolidated financial statements, the Corporation&#8217;s reportable segments have been determined based upon its internal profitability reporting system, which is organized by strategic business unit. Certain strategic business units have been combined for segment information reporting purposes where the nature of the products and services, the type of customer, and the distribution of those products and services are similar. The reportable segments are Corporate and Commercial Specialty; Community, Consumer and Business; and Risk Management and Shared Services.

Notable Changes in Segment Financial Data 

The Corporate and Commercial Specialty segment consists of lending and deposit solutions to larger businesses, developers, not-for-profits, municipalities, and financial institutions, and the support to deliver, fund, and manage such banking solutions. In addition, this segment provides a variety of investment and fiduciary products and services to individuals and small to mid-sized businesses. 

&#8226; Revenue increased $4 million, or 3%, from the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in capital market fees of $7 million partially offset by decreased segment net interest income of $3 million. 

&#8226; Noninterest expenses decreased $4 million, or 7%, from the three months ended March 31, 2019 due to a $4 million decrease in personnel expense primarily driven by a decrease in funding for the management incentive plan . 

&#8226; Average deposits were down $627 million, or 6%, from the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to a decrease in money market and time deposit accounts. 

The Community, Consumer, and Business segment consists of lending, deposit solutions, and ancillary financial services, primarily insurance and risk consulting, to individuals and small to mid-sized businesses. 

&#8226; Revenue decreased $7 million, or 5%, from the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to a decrease in segment net interest income of $7 million. 

&#8226; Noninterest expense were up $4 million, or 3%, from the three months ended March 31, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by higher technology, legal, and card issuance expenses. 

&#8226; Average deposits were up $1.4 billion, or 11%, from the three months ended March 31, 2019, driven by increases in savings and demand (interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing) deposits. 

The Risk Management and Shared Services segment includes key shared Corporate functions, Parent Company activity, intersegment eliminations, and residual revenues and expenses. 

&#8226; Revenues decreased $2 million, or 14%, from the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily driven by a decrease in segment net interest income of $3 million. 

&#8226; Credit provision increased $47 million from the three months ended March 31, 2019 as a result of inflows in probable TDRs and the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic within the economic models used in the new expected credit loss methodology . 

&#8226; Average deposits were down $1.0 billion, or 40%, from the three months ended March 31, 2019, due to decreases in network transaction deposits and time deposit accounts. 

&#8226; Average earning assets were down $1.4 billion, or 18%, from the three months ended March 31, 2019, driven by the Corporation's investment securities portfolio restructuring and deleveraging strategy in 2019. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and revenues and expenses for the period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the determination of the ACLL, goodwill impairment assessment, MSRs valuation, and income taxes. A discussion of these policies can be found in the Critical Accounting Policies section in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There has been one change in the Corporation's application of critical accounting policies since December 31, 2019 driven by the adoption of ASU 2016-13. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans: Management&#8217;s evaluation process used to determine the appropriateness of the ACLL is subject to the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments. The evaluation process combines many factors: management&#8217;s ongoing review and grading of the loan portfolio using a dual risk rating system leveraging probability of default and loss given default, consideration of historical loan loss and delinquency experience, trends in past due and nonaccrual loans, risk characteristics of the various classifications of loans, concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries, existing economic conditions and forecasts, the fair value of underlying collateral, and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect future credit losses. Because current economic conditions and forecasts can change and future events are inherently difficult to predict, the anticipated amount of estimated credit losses on loans, and therefore the appropriateness of the ACLL, could change significantly. The Corporation uses Moody's baseline economic forecast within its model. As an integral part of their examination process, various regulatory agencies also review the ACLL. Such agencies may require additions to the ACLL or may require that certain loan balances be charged off or downgraded into criticized loan categories when their credit evaluations differ from those of management, based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. The Corporation believes the level of the ACLL is appropriate. See Note 3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 7 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements as well as the Allowance for Credit Losses section. 

Recent Developments 

On May 4, 2020, the Corporation announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Associated Benefits &#38; Risk Consulting business to USI Insurance Services LLC (USI). Under the terms of the agreement, the purchase price is $265.755 million in cash, subject to adjustments for, among other things, transaction expenses and working capital changes. Subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, the transaction is expected to close late in the second quarter or early in the third quarter of 2020. 

On April 28, 2020, the Corporation&#8217;s Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per common share, payable on June 15, 2020 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 1, 2020.

COVID-19 Update: 

Beginning on April 3, 2020, the Corporation began originating SBA loans under the PPP, which are included in commercial and industrial loans, to help businesses keep their workforce employed and cover other working capital needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. All complete eligible applications for the PPP have been processed in the order in which they have been received, and nearly all loans approved through May 1, 2020 have been closed and funded. The Corporation has fully funded the PPP loans as of May 6, 2020 by drawing from the PPP Lending Facility, established under the CARES Act, and anticipates that most of these loans will be forgiven by the SBA by September 30, 2020. 

The following table summarizes the balance segmentation of the PPP loans through May 6, 2020.
