&#160;

During the first quarter of 2020, we successfully executed on our BCP strategy amid the COVID-19

pandemic, providing clients with advice, execution and liquidity. As for our financial performance, we generated net earnings of $1.21 billion for the first quarter of 2020, a decrease of 46%, compared with $2.25 billion for the first quarter of 2019. Diluted earnings per common share was $3.11 for the first quarter of 2020, a decrease of 46%, compared with $5.71 for the first quarter of 2019. Annualized return on average common shareholders&#8217; equity (ROE) was 5.7% for the first quarter of 2020, compared with 11.1% for the first quarter of 2019. Book value per common share was $228.21 as of March 2020, 4.4% higher compared with December 2019.

Net revenues were $8.74 billion for the first quarter of 2020, essentially unchanged compared with the first quarter of 2019. Net revenues in Asset Management were significantly lower, due to significant net losses in Lending and debt investments and net losses in Equity investments, reflecting the impact of macroeconomic uncertainty and the challenging operating environment on asset prices. However, fees earned from our institutional and third-party distribution asset management clients were higher compared with the first quarter of 2019. The decrease in Asset Management revenues was largely offset by significantly higher net revenues in both Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) and Equities within Global Markets, driven by strong activity as we extended balance sheet and liquidity to clients during volatile market conditions. In addition, net revenues were significantly higher in Investment Banking, reflecting gains on hedges related to our relationship lending activities, and in Consumer &#38; Wealth Management, reflecting strength in both Consumer banking and Wealth management as we continued to advise our clients and accelerated growth in consumer deposits. 

Provision for credit losses was $937 million for the first quarter of 2020, compared with $224 million for the first quarter of 2019, reflecting the challenging economic environment, loan growth and the impact of accounting for credit losses under the Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) standard. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about ASU No. 2016-13,

&#8220;Financial Instruments &#8212; Credit Losses (Topic 326) &#8212; Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.&#8221;

Operating expenses were $6.46 billion for the first quarter of 2020, 10% higher than the first quarter of 2019, primarily due to significantly higher brokerage, clearing, exchange and distribution fees, net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings, and expenses related to consolidated investments. Our efficiency ratio (total operating expenses divided by total net revenues) for the first quarter of 2020 was 73.9%, compared with 66.6% for the first quarter of 2019. 

We returned $2.38 billion of capital to common shareholders during the first quarter of 2020, including $1.93 billion of common share repurchases and $449 million of common stock dividends. As of March 2020, our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio as calculated in accordance with the Advanced Capital Rules was 12.3% and as calculated in accordance with the Standardized Capital Rules was 12.5%. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our capital ratios.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Business Environment 

The beginning of the first quarter of 2020 was characterized by favorable market conditions, reflecting continued economic growth and strong consumer sentiment. However, in March, the spread of COVID-19 

across the globe and the dramatic measures taken to contain it, including the temporary closures of non-essential 

businesses and stay-at-home

requirements, caused a sharp contraction in global economic activity, high levels of volatility across most financial assets and global markets, an unprecedented decline in global equity prices, and a significant widening of credit spreads. Global central banks responded quickly with accommodative monetary policy by reducing policy interest rates and increasing large scale asset purchases, and the establishment of a number of facilities to support the functioning of markets and to provide liquidity to the market. In addition, governments globally intervened with fiscal policy to mitigate the impact, including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act in the U.S., which aimed to provide economic relief to businesses and individuals.

The beginning of the second quarter of 2020 continued to be impacted by the COVID-19

pandemic, reflecting continued declines in recent economic indicators, particularly in advanced economies, and a historic increase in initial jobless claims in the U.S. To alleviate the economic impact, global central banks continued their quantitative easing, while signaling that they would do more if needed, and the U.S. government approved additional fiscal measures to support small businesses and individuals. This intervention helped equity prices recover and credit spreads tighten moderately compared

with the end of the first quarter of 2020. However, the pace of industry-wide announced mergers and acquisitions activity has slowed, volatility in the equity markets, although declining, has remained elevated, and commodities markets experienced significant turmoil, as oil prices declined significantly due to an unprecedented surplus in net supply. See &#8220;Results of Operations &#8212; Segment Operating Results&#8221; for further information about the operating environment for each of our business segments.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Fair Value 

Fair Value Hierarchy.

Trading assets and liabilities, certain investments and loans, and certain other financial assets and liabilities, are included in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value (i.e., marked-to-market),

with related gains or losses generally recognized in our consolidated statements of earnings. The use of fair value to measure financial instruments is fundamental to our risk management practices and is our most critical accounting policy.

The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We measure certain financial assets and liabilities as a portfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to market and/or credit risks). In determining fair value, the hierarchy under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) gives (i) the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities (level 1 inputs), (ii) the next priority to inputs other than level 1 inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly (level 2 inputs), and (iii) the lowest priority to inputs that cannot be observed in market activity (level 3 inputs). In evaluating the significance of a valuation input, we consider, among other factors, a portfolio&#8217;s net risk exposure to that input. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to their fair value measurement. 

The fair values for substantially all of our financial assets and liabilities are based on observable prices and inputs and are classified in levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain level 2 and level 3 financial assets and liabilities may require appropriate valuation adjustments that a market participant would require to arrive at fair value for factors, such as counterparty and our credit quality, funding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity and bid/offer spreads. 

Instruments classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are those which require one or more significant inputs that are not observable. Level 3 financial assets represented 2.8% as of March 2020 and 2.3% as of December 2019, of our total assets. See Notes 4 through 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about level 3 financial assets, including changes in level 3 financial assets and related fair value measurements. Absent evidence to the contrary, instruments classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are initially valued at transaction price, which is considered to be the best initial estimate of fair value. Subsequent to the transaction date, we use other methodologies to determine fair value, which vary based on the type of instrument. Estimating the fair value of level 3 financial instruments requires judgments to be made. These judgments include: 

&#160;

&#8226;

Determining the appropriate valuation methodology and/or model for each type of level 3 financial instrument; &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

Determining model inputs based on an evaluation of all relevant empirical market data, including prices evidenced by market transactions, interest rates, credit spreads, volatilities and correlations; and &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

Determining appropriate valuation adjustments, including those related to illiquidity or counterparty credit quality. &#160;

&#160;

Regardless of the methodology, valuation inputs and assumptions are only changed when corroborated by substantive evidence.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Controls Over Valuation of Financial Instruments.

Market makers and investment professionals in our revenue-producing units are responsible for pricing our financial instruments. Our control infrastructure is independent of the revenue-producing units and is fundamental to ensuring that all of our financial instruments are appropriately valued at market-clearing levels. In the event that there is a difference of opinion in situations where estimating the fair value of financial instruments requires judgment (e.g., calibration to market comparables or trade comparison, as described below), the final valuation decision is made by senior managers in independent risk oversight and control functions. This independent price verification is critical to ensuring that our financial instruments are properly valued.

Price Verification.

All financial instruments at fair value classified in levels 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy are subject to our independent price verification process. The objective of price verification is to have an informed and independent opinion with regard to the valuation of financial instruments under review. Instruments that have one or more significant inputs which cannot be corroborated by external market data are classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Price verification strategies utilized by our independent risk oversight and control functions include:

&#160;

&#8226;

Trade Comparison.

Analysis of trade data (both internal and external, where available) is used to determine the most relevant pricing inputs and valuations. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

External Price Comparison.

Valuations and prices are compared to pricing data obtained from third parties (e.g., brokers or dealers, IHS Markit, Bloomberg, IDC, TRACE). Data obtained from various sources is compared to ensure consistency and validity. When broker or dealer quotations or third-party pricing vendors are used for valuation or price verification, greater priority is generally given to executable quotations. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

Calibration to Market Comparables.

Market-based transactions are used to corroborate the valuation of positions with similar characteristics, risks and components. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

Relative Value Analyses.

Market-based transactions are analyzed to determine the similarity, measured in terms of risk, liquidity and return, of one instrument relative to another or, for a given instrument, of one maturity relative to another. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

Collateral Analyses.

Margin calls on derivatives are analyzed to determine implied values, which are used to corroborate our valuations. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

Execution of Trades.

Where appropriate, market-making desks are instructed to execute trades in order to provide evidence of market-clearing levels. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

Backtesting.

Valuations are corroborated by comparison to values realized upon sales. &#160;

&#160;

See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about fair value measurements. 

Review of Net Revenues.

Independent risk oversight and control functions ensure adherence to our pricing policy through a combination of daily procedures, including the explanation and attribution of net revenues based on the underlying factors. Through this process, we independently validate net revenues, identify and resolve potential fair value or trade booking issues on a timely basis and seek to ensure that risks are being properly categorized and quantified.

Review of Valuation Models.

Our independent model risk management group (Model Risk), consisting of quantitative professionals who are separate from model developers, performs an independent model review and validation process of our valuation models. New or changed models are reviewed and approved prior to implementation. Models are reviewed annually to assess the impact of any changes in the product or market and any market developments in pricing theories. See &#8220;Risk Management &#8212; 

Model Risk Management&#8221; for further information about the review and validation of our valuation models.

Allowance for Credit Losses 

We estimate and record an allowance for credit losses related to our loans held for investment and accounted for at amortized cost. We adopted ASU No. 2016-13

in January 2020, which replaced the probable incurred credit loss model for recognizing credit losses with the current expected credit losses (CECL) model. As a result, our allowance for credit losses effective January 2020, reflects our estimate of credit losses over the remaining expected life of such loans and also takes into account forecasts of future economic conditions. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about adoption of ASU No. 2016-13.

To determine the allowance for credit losses, we classify our loans into wholesale and retail portfolios. These portfolios represent the level at which we have developed and documented our methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis for loans that exhibit similar risk characteristics using a modeled approach and asset-specific basis for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics. The determination of allowance for credit losses entails significant judgment on various risk factors, including industry default and loss data, current macroeconomic indicators, borrower&#8217;s capacity to meet its financial obligations, borrower&#8217;s country of risk, loan seniority and collateral type. In addition, for loans backed by real estate, risk factors include loan-to-value

ratio, debt service ratio and home price index. Risk factors for installment and credit card loans include Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores and delinquency status.

&#160;

&#160;

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Our estimate of credit losses entails judgment about collectability at the reporting dates, and there are uncertainties inherent in those judgments. While we use the best information available to determine this estimate, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on, among other things, changes in the economic environment or variances between actual results and the original assumptions used. Loans are charged off against the allowance for loan losses when deemed to be uncollectible. 

We also record an allowance for losses on lending commitments which are held for investment and accounted for at amortized cost. Such allowance is determined using the same methodology as the allowance for loan losses, while also taking into consideration the probability of drawdowns or funding, and is included in other liabilities. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the allowance for credit losses. 

Use of Estimates 

U.S. GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions. In addition to the estimates we make in connection with fair value measurements and the allowance for credit losses on loans and lending commitments held for investment and accounted for at amortized cost, the use of estimates and assumptions is also important in determining discretionary compensation accruals, the accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, provisions for losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings (including governmental investigations), and provisions for losses that may arise from tax audits. 

A substantial portion of our compensation and benefits represents discretionary compensation, which is finalized at year-end.

We believe the most appropriate way to allocate estimated year-end

discretionary compensation among interim periods is in proportion to the net revenues earned in such periods. In addition to the level of net revenues, our overall compensation expense in any given year is also influenced by, among other factors, overall financial performance, prevailing labor markets, business mix, the structure of our share-based compensation programs and the external environment.

Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may exist. When assessing goodwill for impairment, first, a qualitative assessment can be made to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its estimated carrying value. If the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is performed. Alternatively, a quantitative goodwill test can be performed without performing a qualitative assessment. 

Estimating the fair value of our reporting units requires judgment. Critical inputs to the fair value estimates include projected earnings and allocated equity. There is inherent uncertainty in the projected earnings. The estimated carrying value of each reporting unit reflects an allocation of total shareholders&#8217; equity and represents the estimated amount of total shareholders&#8217; equity required to support the activities of the reporting unit under currently applicable regulatory capital requirements. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about goodwill. If we experience a prolonged or severe period of weakness in the business environment, financial markets, our performance or our common stock price, or additional increases in capital requirements, our goodwill could be impaired in the future. 

Identifiable intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset&#8217;s or asset group&#8217;s carrying value may not be fully recoverable. Judgment is required to evaluate whether indications of potential impairment have occurred, and to test intangible assets for impairment, if required. An impairment is recognized if the total of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about identifiable intangible assets. 

We also estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we estimate the upper end of the range of reasonably possible aggregate loss in excess of the related reserves for litigation and regulatory proceedings where we believe the risk of loss is more than slight. See Notes 18 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements for information about certain judicial, litigation and regulatory proceedings. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different. Our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case-by-case

basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case, proceeding or investigation, our experience and the experience of others in similar cases, proceedings or investigations, and the opinions and views of legal counsel.

In accounting for income taxes, we recognize tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. See Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about income taxes.

Results of Operations 

The composition of our net revenues has varied over time as financial markets and the scope of our operations have changed. The composition of net revenues can also vary over the shorter term due to fluctuations in U.S. and global economic and market conditions.

&#8226;

Net earnings to common represents net earnings applicable to common shareholders, which is calculated as net earnings less preferred stock dividends. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

Average equity to average assets is calculated by dividing average total shareholders&#8217; equity by average total assets. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

Dividend payout ratio is calculated by dividing dividends declared per common share by diluted earnings per common share. &#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

Annualized ROE is calculated by dividing annualized net earnings to common by average monthly common shareholders&#8217; equity. Tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity is calculated as total shareholders&#8217; equity less preferred stock, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. Annualized return on average tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity (ROTE) is calculated by dividing annualized net earnings to common by average monthly tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity. We believe that tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity is meaningful because it is a measure that we and investors use to assess capital adequacy and that ROTE is meaningful because it measures the performance of businesses consistently, whether they were acquired or developed internally. Tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity and ROTE are non-GAAP

measures and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP

measures used by other companies. Annualized return on average total shareholders&#8217; equity is calculated by dividing annualized net earnings by average monthly total shareholders&#8217; equity. &#160;

Operating Environment.

The beginning of the first quarter of 2020 was characterized by favorable market conditions, reflecting continued economic growth and strong consumer sentiment. However, in March, the spread of COVID-19 

across the globe caused a sharp contraction in global economic activity, high levels of volatility across most financial assets and global markets, an unprecedented decline in global equity prices, and a significant widening of credit spreads. Market-making activities operated in an environment characterized by strong client activity and higher levels of volatility compared with the fourth quarter of 2019, as clients reacted to the significant decline in near-term global economic activity and the accommodative monetary policies set by global central banks. Investment banking activities reflected decreases in industry-wide announced and completed mergers and acquisitions activity and industry-wide equity underwriting transactions, while industry-wide investment-grade activity increased. Credit spreads widened during the first quarter of 2020 and global equity markets were lower compared with the end of the fourth quarter of 2019.

If the COVID-19 pandemic persists, it may lead to a decline in market-making activity levels, continued declines in investment banking transaction levels, global equity markets and assets under supervision, and the further widening of credit spreads. As a result, net revenues and the provision for credit losses would likely be negatively impacted. See &#8220;Segment Operating Results&#8221; for information about the operating environment and material trends and uncertainties that may impact our results of operations. 

Three Months Ended March 2020 versus March 2019 

Net revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $8.74 billion for the first quarter of 2020, essentially unchanged compared with the first quarter of 2019, reflecting significant net losses in other principal transactions, largely offset by significantly higher market marking revenues, investment management revenues and commissions and fees, and higher investment banking revenues and net interest income. 

Non-Interest Revenues.

Investment banking revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $1.74 billion for the first quarter of 2020, 8% higher than the first quarter of 2019. Revenues in underwriting were significantly higher, due to significantly higher revenues in equity underwriting, primarily from initial public offerings and convertible offerings, and in debt underwriting, driven by asset-backed and leveraged finance activity. This increase was partially offset by lower revenues in financial advisory, reflecting a decrease in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions transactions.

Investment management revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $1.77 billion for the first quarter of 2020, 23% higher than the first quarter of 2019, due to significantly higher incentive fees, driven by harvesting, and higher management and other fees (including the impact of the consolidation of United Capital Financial Partners, Inc. (United Capital)), reflecting the impact of higher average assets under supervision, partially offset by a lower average effective fee due to shifts in the mix of client assets and strategies. 

Commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of earnings were $1.02 billion for the first quarter of 2020, 37% higher than the first quarter of 2019, reflecting an increase in our listed cash equity, options and futures volumes, generally consistent with market volumes. 

Market making revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $3.68 billion for the first quarter of 2020, 35% higher than the first quarter of 2019, primarily due to significantly higher revenues in interest rate products, equity products and currencies, and higher revenues in commodities and credit products, partially offset by significantly lower results in mortgages. 

Other principal transactions revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $(782) million for the first quarter of 2020, compared with $1.07 billion for the first quarter of 2019, reflecting significant net losses across debt securities, as well as significant mark-to-market

net losses from investments in public equities and significantly lower net gains from investments in private equities. These decreases were partially offset by significantly higher revenues related to relationship lending activities, reflecting the impact of changes in credit spreads on hedges.

Net Interest Income.

Net interest income in the consolidated statements of earnings was $1.31 billion for the first quarter of 2020, 8% higher than the first quarter of 2019, reflecting a decrease in interest expense primarily related to other interest-bearing liabilities, long-term borrowings, collateralized financing and deposits as a result of lower interest rates, partially offset by the impact of higher average balances for deposits. The decrease in interest expense is partially offset by a decrease in interest income primarily related to collateralized agreements, deposits with banks and other interest-earning assets reflecting the impact of lower interest rates, partially offset by trading assets reflecting an impact of higher average balances. See &#8220;Statistical Disclosures &#8212; Distribution of Assets, Liabilities and Shareholders&#8217; Equity&#8221; for further information about our sources of net interest income.

Provision for Credit Losses 

Provision for credit losses consists of provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments held for investment and accounted for at amortized cost. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the provision for credit losses. 

The table below presents our provision for credit losses.

Three Months Ended March 2020 versus March 2019.

Provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of earnings was $937 million for the first quarter of 2020, compared with $224 million for the first quarter of 2019, primarily due to significantly higher provisions related to corporate loans reflecting continued pressure in the energy sector and the impact of the COVID-19

pandemic on the broader economic environment. In addition, the first quarter of 2020 included provisions related to growth in corporate loans and credit card loans, and the impact of accounting for credit losses under the CECL standard. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about ASU No. 2016-13. 

Operating Expenses 

Our operating expenses are primarily influenced by compensation, headcount and levels of business activity. Compensation and benefits includes salaries, estimated year-end

discretionary compensation, amortization of equity awards and other items such as benefits. Discretionary compensation is significantly impacted by, among other factors, the level of net revenues, overall financial performance, prevailing labor markets, business mix, the structure of our share-based compensation programs and the external environment.

Three Months Ended March 2020 versus March 2019.

Operating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings were $6.46 billion for the first quarter of 2020, 10% higher than the first quarter of 2019. Our efficiency ratio (total operating expenses divided by total net revenues) for the first quarter of 2020 was 73.9%, compared with 66.6% for the first quarter of 2019.

The increase in operating expenses compared with the first quarter of 2019 was primarily due to significantly higher brokerage, clearing, exchange and distribution fees (reflecting an increase in activity levels), net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings, and expenses related to consolidated investments, including impairments (increase was primarily in depreciation and amortization, occupancy and other expenses). In addition, technology expenses and professional fees were higher. The first quarter of 2020 also included higher expenses related to our credit card activities (increases were primarily in professional fees and other expenses) and the impact of the consolidation of United Capital. Compensation and benefits expenses were essentially unchanged, while market development expenses were lower. 

Net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings for the first quarter of 2020 were $184 million compared with $37 million for the first quarter of 2019. 

As of March 2020, headcount was essentially unchanged compared with the end of 2019.

Provision for Taxes 

The effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 was 10.0%, down from the full year tax rate of 20.0% for 2019, primarily due to tax benefits on the settlement of employee share-based awards and the impact of lower pre-tax

earnings on permanent tax benefits in the first quarter of 2020.

The CARES Act was enacted on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act includes retroactive and prospective provisions enacted to provide income tax relief and liquidity to businesses affected by the COVID-19

pandemic. The legislation includes corporate income tax provisions that temporarily allow for the carryback of net operating losses and remove limitations on the use of loss carryforwards, increase interest expense deduction limitations and allow accelerated depreciation deductions on certain asset improvements. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020.

The U.S. Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Department of the Treasury have released final and proposed regulations relating to the implementation of Global Intangible Low Taxed Income and Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax. These final and proposed regulations did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020. 

On March 19, 2020, the U.K. government published Finance Bill 2019-21

(Finance Bill). The Finance Bill includes a repeal of a previously enacted two percentage point decrease in the corporate income tax rate that was scheduled to become effective April 1, 2020. Following Royal Assent, the Finance Bill will be enacted as Finance Act 2020. The impact of this legislation on our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities will be recognized upon enactment. We do not expect this legislation to have a material impact on our effective tax rate for 2020.

Based on the first quarter of 2020, we expect our 2020 tax rate to be below 20%, excluding the impact of any non-deductible

litigation.

The allocation process for segment assets is based on the activities of these segments. The allocation of assets includes allocation of global core liquid assets (GCLA) (which consists of unencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash), which is generally included within cash and cash equivalents, collateralized agreements and trading assets on our balance sheet. Due to the integrated nature of these segments, estimates and judgments are made in allocating these assets.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Net revenues in our segments include allocations of interest income and expense to specific positions in relation to the cash generated by, or funding requirements of, such positions. See Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our business segments. 

The allocation of common shareholders&#8217; equity and preferred stock dividends to each segment is based on the estimated amount of equity required to support the activities of the segment under relevant regulatory capital requirements. Net earnings for each segment is calculated by applying the firmwide tax rate to each segment&#8217;s pre-tax 

earnings.

Compensation and benefits expenses within our segments reflect, among other factors, our overall performance, as well as the performance of individual businesses. Consequently, pre-tax

margins in one segment of our business may be significantly affected by the performance of our other business segments. A description of segment operating results follows.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Operating Environment.

During the first quarter of 2020, investment banking activity was negatively impacted by the economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19

pandemic. Industry-wide announced and completed mergers and acquisitions activity decreased compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. In underwriting, industry-wide equity underwriting transactions decreased, reflecting a decline in initial public offerings, and industry-wide debt underwriting activity reflected a decrease in acquisition-related financing, but a significant increase in investment-grade activity, all compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. In credit markets, spreads widened, particularly towards the end of the quarter, and corporate clients borrowed under revolving lines of credit to address liquidity needs. In the future, if industry-wide mergers and acquisitions transactions, equity underwriting transactions or debt underwriting transactions continue to decline, or credit spreads tighten, net revenues in Investment Banking would likely be negatively impacted. In addition, a continued deterioration in the creditworthiness of borrowers would negatively impact the provision for credit losses.

Three Months Ended March 2020 versus March

2019.

Net revenues in Investment Banking were $2.18 billion for the first quarter of 2020, 25% higher than the first quarter of 2019, reflecting significantly higher net revenues in Corporate lending and Underwriting, partially offset by lower net revenues in Financial advisory.

The increase in Corporate lending net revenues was due to significantly higher net revenues related to relationship lending activities, reflecting the impact of changes in credit spreads on hedges. The first quarter of 2020 included approximately $375 million of net gains related to these hedges. The increase in Underwriting net revenues was due to significantly higher net revenues in Equity underwriting, primarily from initial public offerings and convertible offerings, and in Debt underwriting, driven by asset-backed and leveraged finance activity. The decrease in Financial advisory net revenues reflected a decrease in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions transactions. 

Provision for credit losses was $622 million for the first quarter of 2020, compared with $86 million for the first quarter of 2019, primarily due to draws on committed corporate lines, continued pressure in the energy sector, and the impact of the COVID-19

pandemic on the broader economic environment. In addition, the first quarter of 2020 included the impact of accounting for credit losses under the CECL standard. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about ASU No. 2016-13. 

Operating expenses were $1.17 billion for the first quarter of 2020, 16% higher than the first quarter of 2019, primarily due to higher net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings. Pre-tax

earnings were $393 million for the first quarter of 2020, 40% lower than the first quarter of 2019.

As of March 2020, our investment banking transaction backlog decreased compared with December 2019, due to lower estimated net revenues from potential advisory transactions and potential debt underwriting transactions, particularly from acquisition-related financing. These decreases were partially offset by higher estimated net revenues from potential equity underwriting transactions, primarily from secondary and initial public offerings. 

Our investment banking transaction backlog represents an estimate of our future net revenues from investment banking transactions where we believe that future revenue realization is more likely than not. We believe changes in our investment banking transaction backlog may be a useful indicator of client activity levels which, over the long term, impact our net revenues. However, the time frame for completion and corresponding revenue recognition of transactions in our backlog varies based on the nature of the assignment, as certain transactions may remain in our backlog for longer periods of time, which we expect to occur in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mergers and acquisitions. In addition, our transaction backlog is subject to certain limitations, such as assumptions about the likelihood that individual client transactions will occur in the future. Transactions may be cancelled or modified, and transactions not included in the estimate may also occur.

For further information about market-making activities, see &#8220;Market-Making Activities&#8221; below. &#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

Equities financing.

Includes prime brokerage and other equities financing activities, including securities lending, margin lending and swaps. We earn fees by providing clearing, settlement and custody services globally. We provide services that principally involve borrowing and lending securities to cover institutional clients&#8217; short sales and borrowing securities to cover our short sales and otherwise to make deliveries into the market. In addition, we are an active participant in broker-to-broker

securities lending and third-party agency lending activities. We provide financing to our clients for their securities trading activities through margin loans that are collateralized by securities, cash or other acceptable collateral. In addition, we execute swap transactions to provide our clients with exposure to securities and indices. &#160;

Market-Making Activities 

As a market maker, we facilitate transactions in both liquid and less liquid markets, primarily for institutional clients, such as corporations, financial institutions, investment funds and governments, to assist clients in meeting their investment objectives and in managing their risks. In this role, we seek to earn the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing to sell an instrument to us and the price at which another market participant is willing to buy it from us, and vice versa (i.e., bid/offer spread). In addition, we maintain (i) market-making positions, typically for a short period of time, in response to, or in anticipation of, client demand, and (ii) positions to actively manage our risk exposures that arise from these market-making activities (collectively, inventory). Our inventory is recorded in trading assets (long positions) or trading liabilities (short positions) in our consolidated balance sheets. 

Our results are influenced by a combination of interconnected drivers, including (i) client activity levels and transactional bid/offer spreads (collectively, client activity), and (ii) changes in the fair value of our inventory and interest income and interest expense related to the holding, hedging and funding of our inventory (collectively, market-making inventory changes). Due to the integrated nature of our market-making activities, disaggregation of net revenues into client activity and market-making inventory changes is judgmental and has inherent complexities and limitations. 

The amount and composition of our net revenues vary over time as these drivers are impacted by multiple interrelated factors affecting economic and market conditions, including volatility and liquidity in the market, changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, credit spreads, equity prices and commodity prices, investor confidence, and other macroeconomic concerns and uncertainties. 

In general, assuming all other market-making conditions remain constant, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads tend to result in increases in net revenues, and decreases tend to have the opposite effect. However, changes in market-making conditions can materially impact client activity levels and bid/offer spreads, as well as the fair value of our inventory. For example, a decrease in liquidity in the market could have the impact of (i) increasing our bid/offer spread, (ii) decreasing investor confidence and thereby decreasing client activity levels, and (iii) widening of credit spreads on our inventory positions.

&#160;

&#8226;

The primary driver of net revenues for FICC intermediation was client activity. &#160;

Operating Environment.

During the first quarter of 2020, Global Markets operated in an environment characterized by strong client activity and higher levels of volatility compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. The average daily VIX for the first quarter of 2020 increased to 30 (and peaked at 83 in March), compared with 14 for the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase in client activity and volatility was due to the risks from the COVID-19

pandemic as clients reacted to the significant decline in near-term global economic activity and the accommodative monetary policies set by global central banks. Global equity markets decreased during the first quarter of 2020 (with the MSCI World Index down 22%) and credit spreads widened (with U.S. investment-grade wider by approximately 150 basis points and high-yield credit spreads wider by approximately 375 basis points), both particularly towards the end of the quarter. If macroeconomic concerns lead to a decline in activity levels or volatility, net revenues in Global Markets would likely be negatively impacted.

Three Months Ended March 2020 versus March

2019.

Net revenues in Global Markets were $5.16 billion for the first quarter of 2020, 28% higher than the first quarter of 2019.

Net revenues in FICC were $2.97 billion, 33% higher than the first quarter of 2019, due to significantly higher net revenues in FICC intermediation, reflecting significantly higher client activity, partially offset by the impact of challenging market-making conditions on our inventory, and higher net revenues in FICC financing, driven by repurchase agreements. 

The following provides information about our FICC intermediation net revenues by business, compared with results in the first quarter of 2019: 

&#160;

&#8226;

Net revenues in currencies were significantly higher, driven by higher client activity. &#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

Net revenues in credit products were significantly higher and commodities were higher, reflecting higher client activity, partially offset by the impact of challenging market-making conditions on our inventory. &#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

Net revenues in interest rate products were slightly higher, reflecting higher client activity, largely offset by the impact of challenging market-making conditions on our inventory. &#160;

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

&#8226;

Net revenues in mortgages were significantly lower, driven by the impact of challenging market-making conditions on our inventory. &#160;

Net revenues in Equities were $2.19 billion, 22% higher than the first quarter of 2019, due to significantly higher net revenues in Equities intermediation, driven by derivatives, and slightly higher net revenues in Equities financing, reflecting higher average customer balances. 

Provision for credit losses was $68 million for the first quarter of 2020, compared with $3 million for the first quarter of 2019, reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 

pandemic on the broader economic environment.

Operating expenses were $2.85 billion for the first quarter of 2020, 4% higher than the first quarter of 2019, due to significantly higher brokerage, clearing, exchange and distribution fees and higher net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings, partially offset by decreased compensation and benefits expenses. Pre-tax

earnings were $2.25 billion for the first quarter of 2020, 74% higher than the first quarter of 2019.

Asset Management 

We manage client assets across a broad range of investment strategies and asset classes for a diverse set of institutional clients and a network of third-party distributors around the world, including equity, fixed income and alternative investments. We provide investment solutions including those managed on a fiduciary basis by our portfolio managers, as well as those managed by a variety of third-party managers. We offer our investment solutions in a variety of structures, including separately managed accounts, mutual funds, private partnerships and other comingled vehicles. These solutions begin with identifying clients&#8217; objectives and continue through portfolio construction, ongoing asset allocation and risk management and investment realization. 

In addition to managing client assets, we invest in alternative investments across a range of asset classes that seek to deliver long-term accretive risk-adjusted returns. Our investing activities, which are typically longer term, include investments in corporate equity, credit, real estate and infrastructure assets. 

Asset Management generates revenues from the following: 

&#160;

&#8226;

Management and other fees.

The majority of revenues in management and other fees consists of asset-based fees on client assets that we manage. For further information about assets under supervision (AUS), see &#8220;Assets Under Supervision&#8221; below. The fees that we charge vary by asset class, distribution channel and the types of services provided, and are affected by investment performance, as well as asset inflows and redemptions. &#160;

&#8226;

Incentive fees.

In certain circumstances, we also receive incentive fees based on a percentage of a fund&#8217;s or a separately managed account&#8217;s return, or when the return exceeds a specified benchmark or other performance targets. Such fees include overrides, which consist of the increased share of the income and gains derived primarily from our private equity and credit funds when the return on a fund&#8217;s investments over the life of the fund exceeds certain threshold returns. Incentive fees are recognized when it is probable that a significant reversal of such fees will not occur. &#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

Equity investments.

Our alternative investing activities relate to public and private equity investments in corporate, real estate and infrastructure assets. We also make investments through consolidated investment entities (CIEs), substantially all of which are engaged in real estate investment activities. &#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

Lending and debt investments.

We invest in corporate debt and provide financing for real estate and other assets. These activities include investments in mezzanine debt, senior debt and distressed debt securities. &#160;

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Operating Environment.

During the first quarter of 2020, macroeconomic concerns from the COVID-19

pandemic led to lower global equity prices and wider credit spreads, particularly in March, compared to the end of the fourth quarter of 2019, as well as uncertainty in the economic outlook. If the COVID-19 pandemic persists, asset prices may continue to decline, credit spreads may continue to widen, investors may continue to favor asset classes that typically generate lower fees and investors may withdraw their assets. As a result, net revenues in Asset Management would likely continue to be negatively impacted.

Three Months Ended March 2020 versus March

2019.

Net revenues in Asset Management were $(96) million for the first quarter of 2020, compared with $1.79 billion for the first quarter of 2019, reflecting significant net losses in Lending and debt investments and net losses in Equity investments. These decreases were partially offset by significantly higher Incentive fees and higher Management and other fees from our institutional and third-party distribution asset management clients.

As a result of the challenging operating environment, Lending and debt investments reflected significant net losses across debt securities, particularly within our private credit group and multi-strategy investing portfolios. Equity investments reflected $484 million in mark- to-market

net losses from investments in public equities partially offset by $462 million of net gains from investments in private equities. The results from investments in private equities included approximately $775 million of net gains from pending and completed sales and approximately $200 million of operating net revenues from CIEs, partially offset by approximately $500 million of mark-downs. Net revenues in Equity investments for the first quarter of 2020 included net losses of $573 million from corporate investments, which were largely offset by net gains of $551 million from real estate investments.

The increase in Incentive fees was driven by harvesting and the increase in Management and other fees reflected the impact of higher average assets under supervision, partially offset by a lower average effective fee due to shifts in the mix of client assets and strategies. 

Provision for credit losses was $79 million for the first quarter of 2020, compared with $13 million for the first quarter of 2019, reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 

pandemic on the broader economic environment.

Operating expenses were $1.20 billion for the first quarter of 2020, 9% higher than the first quarter of 2019, due to higher expenses related to consolidated investments, including impairments. Pre-tax

loss was $1.37 billion for the first quarter of 2020, compared with pre-tax

earnings of $677 million for the first quarter of 2019.

Consumer Banking.

Our Consumer banking business issues unsecured loans, through Marcus 

and credit cards to finance the purchases of goods or services. We also accept deposits through Marcus, primarily through Goldman Sachs Bank USA (GS Bank USA) and Goldman Sachs International Bank (GSIB), that are used as a source of funding. These deposits include savings and time deposits which provide us with a diversified source of funding that reduces our reliance on wholesale funding.

Consumer banking revenues consist of net interest income earned on unsecured loans issued to consumers through Marcus and credit card lending activities, and net interest income allocated to consumer deposits.

Operating Environment.

During the first quarter of 2020, macroeconomic concerns from the COVID-19

pandemic led to lower global equity prices, particularly in March, compared to the end of the fourth quarter of 2019, which affected the market levels of our long-term assets under supervision. Our consumer banking activities reflected continued increases in deposits, while loan balances remained stable. If the COVID-19 pandemic persists, asset prices may continue to decline, investors may continue to favor asset classes that typically generate lower fees, investors may withdraw their assets and consumers may withdraw their deposits or consumer credit may deteriorate. As a result, net revenues and the provision for credit losses in Consumer &#38; Wealth Management would likely continue to be negatively impacted.

Three Months Ended March 2020 and March

2019.

Net revenues in Consumer &#38; Wealth Management were $1.49 billion for the first quarter of 2020, 21% higher than the first quarter of 2019.

Net revenues in Wealth management were $1.21 billion, 18% higher than the first quarter of 2019, due to significantly higher Management and other fees (including the impact of the consolidation of United Capital), primarily reflecting higher average assets under supervision and higher transaction volumes, and higher Incentive fees. Net revenues in Private banking and lending were lower compared with the first quarter of 2019. 

Net revenues in Consumer banking were $282 million, 39% higher than the first quarter of 2019, driven by higher net interest income, primarily reflecting an increase in deposit balances and the addition of credit card loans. 

Provision for credit losses was $168 million for the first quarter of 2020, 38% higher than the first quarter of 2019, as the first quarter of 2020 included provisions related to credit card loans. 

Operating expenses were $1.24 billion for the first quarter of 2020, 23% higher than the first quarter of 2019, primarily due to the impact of the consolidation of United Capital and higher expenses related to our credit card activities. Pre-tax

earnings were $80 million for the first quarter of 2020, 18% lower than the first quarter of 2019.

Asset classes, such as alternative investment and equity assets, typically generate higher fees relative to fixed income and liquidity product assets. The average effective management fee (which excludes non-asset-based

fees) we earned on our firmwide assets under supervision was 31 basis points for the three months ended March 2020 and 33 basis points for the three months ended March 2019. This decrease primarily reflected shifts in the mix of client assets and strategies.

&#160;

We earn management fees on client assets that we manage and also receive incentive fees based on a percentage of a fund&#8217;s or a separately managed account&#8217;s return, or when the return exceeds a specified benchmark or other performance targets. These incentive fees are recognized when it is probable that a significant reversal of such fees will not occur. Our estimated unrecognized incentive fees were $1.58 billion as of March 2020 and $1.63 billion as of December 2019. Such amounts are based on the completion of the funds&#8217; financial statements, which is generally one quarter in arrears. These fees will be recognized, assuming no decline in fair value, if and when it is probable that a significant reversal of such fees will not occur, which is generally when such fees are no longer subject to fluctuations in the market value of the assets of the funds. 

The table below presents changes in our assets under supervision.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Balance Sheet and Funding Sources 

Balance Sheet Management 

One of our risk management disciplines is our ability to manage the size and composition of our balance sheet. While our asset base changes due to client activity, market fluctuations and business opportunities, the size and composition of our balance sheet also reflects factors including (i) our overall risk tolerance, (ii) the amount of equity capital we hold and (iii) our funding profile, among other factors. See &#8220;Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital &#8212; Equity Capital Management&#8221; for information about our equity capital management process. 

Although our balance sheet fluctuates on a day-to-day 

basis, our total assets at quarter-end

and year-end

dates are generally not materially different from those occurring within our reporting periods.

In order to ensure appropriate risk management, we seek to maintain a sufficiently liquid balance sheet and have processes in place to dynamically manage our assets and liabilities, which include (i) balance sheet planning, (ii) balance sheet limits, (iii) monitoring of key metrics and (iv) scenario analyses. 

Balance Sheet Planning.

We prepare a balance sheet plan that combines our projected total assets and composition of assets with our expected funding sources over a three-year time horizon. This plan is reviewed quarterly and may be adjusted in response to changing business needs or market conditions. The objectives of this planning process are:

&#160;

To develop our balance sheet projections, taking into account the general state of the financial markets and expected business activity levels, as well as regulatory requirements; 

&#160;

&#8226;

To allow Treasury and our independent risk oversight and control functions to objectively evaluate balance sheet limit requests from our revenue-producing units in the context of our overall balance sheet constraints, including our liability profile and equity capital levels, and key metrics; and 

&#160;

&#8226;

To inform the target amount, tenor and type of funding to raise, based on our projected assets and contractual maturities. 

Treasury and our independent risk oversight and control functions, along with our revenue-producing units, review current and prior period information and expectations for the year to prepare our balance sheet plan. The specific information reviewed includes asset and liability size and composition, limit utilization, risk and performance measures, and capital usage. 

Our consolidated balance sheet plan, including our balance sheets by business, funding projections and projected key metrics, is reviewed and approved by the Firmwide Asset Liability Committee and the Risk Governance Committee. See &#8220;Risk Management &#8212; Overview and Structure of Risk Management&#8221; for an overview of our risk management structure. 

Balance Sheet Limits.

The Firmwide Asset Liability Committee and the Risk Governance Committee have the responsibility to review and approve balance sheet limits. These limits are set at levels which are close to actual operating levels, rather than at levels which reflect our maximum risk appetite, in order to ensure prompt escalation and discussion among our revenue-producing units, Treasury and our independent risk oversight and control functions on a routine basis. Requests for changes in limits are evaluated after giving consideration to their impact on our key metrics. Compliance with limits is monitored by our revenue-producing units and Treasury, as well as our independent risk oversight and control functions.

Monitoring of Key Metrics.

We monitor key balance sheet metrics both by business and on a consolidated basis, including asset and liability size and composition, limit utilization and risk measures. We allocate assets to businesses and review and analyze movements resulting from new business activity, as well as market fluctuations.

Scenario Analyses.

We conduct various scenario analyses including as part of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) Stress Tests (DFAST), as well as our resolution and recovery planning. See &#8220;Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital &#8212; Equity Capital Management&#8221; for further information about these scenario analyses. These scenarios cover short- and long-term time horizons using various macroeconomic and firm-specific assumptions, based on a range of economic scenarios. We use these analyses to assist us in developing our longer-term balance sheet management strategy, including the level and composition of assets, funding and equity capital. Additionally, these analyses help us develop approaches for maintaining appropriate funding, liquidity and capital across a variety of situations, including a severely stressed environment.

Balance Sheet Analysis and Metrics 

As of March 2020, total assets in our consolidated balance sheets were $1.09 trillion, an increase of $96.79 billion from December 2019, primarily reflecting increases in customer and other receivables of $46.32 billion, collateralized agreements of $32.24 billion, trading assets of $20.14 billion, and loans of $19.55 billion, partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $28.06 billion. The increase in customer and other receivables primarily reflected higher client activity. The net increase in collateralized agreements reflected the impact of our activities and our clients&#8217; activities. The increase in trading assets primarily reflected the impact of interest rate and currency movements in derivative instruments. The increase in loans primarily reflected an increase in corporate loans, partially offset by a decrease in residential real estate loans. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents primarily reflected our activities. 

As of March 2020, total liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets were $997.38 billion, an increase of $94.67 billion from December 2019, primarily reflecting increases in customer and other payables of $38.36 billion, deposits of $29.98 billion and trading liabilities of $27.52 billion. The increase in customer and other payables primarily reflected higher client activity. The increase in deposits primarily reflected increases in consumer, institutional and transaction banking deposits. The increase in trading liabilities reflected the impact of interest rate and currency movements in derivative instruments. 

Our total repurchase agreements, accounted for as collateralized financings, were $95.86 billion as of March 2020 and $117.76 billion as of December 2019, which were 12% lower as of March 2020 and 32% higher as of December 2019 than the average daily amount of repurchase agreements over the respective quarters. As of March 2020, the decrease in our repurchase agreements relative to the average daily amount of repurchase agreements during the quarter resulted from lower levels of our activity and our clients&#8217; activity at the end of the period. 

The level of our repurchase agreements fluctuates between and within periods, primarily due to providing clients with access to highly liquid collateral, such as liquid government and agency obligations, through collateralized financing activities. 

The table below presents information about our balance sheet and leverage ratios.

Tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity is calculated as total shareholders&#8217; equity less preferred stock, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. We believe that tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity is meaningful because it is a measure that we and investors use to assess capital adequacy. Tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity is a non-GAAP

measure and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP

measures used by other companies. 

&#160;

&#8226;

Book value per common share and tangible book value per common share are based on common shares outstanding and restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements and not subject to performance conditions (collectively, basic shares) of 355.7 million as of March 2020 and 361.8 million as of December 2019. We believe that tangible book value per common share (tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity divided by basic shares) is meaningful because it is a measure that we and investors use to assess capital adequacy. Tangible book value per common share is a non-GAAP

measure and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP

measures used by other companies.

Funding Sources 

Our primary sources of funding are deposits, collateralized financings, unsecured short- and long-term borrowings, and shareholders&#8217; equity. We seek to maintain broad and diversified funding sources globally across products, programs, markets, currencies and creditors to avoid funding concentrations. 

The table below presents information about our funding sources.

Our funding is primarily raised in U.S. dollar, Euro, British pound and Japanese yen. We generally distribute our funding products through our own sales force and third-party distributors to a large, diverse creditor base in a variety of markets in the Americas, Europe and Asia. We believe that our relationships with our creditors are critical to our liquidity. Our creditors include banks, governments, securities lenders, corporations, pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds and individuals. We have imposed various internal guidelines to monitor creditor concentration across our funding programs. 

Deposits.

Our deposits provide us with a diversified source of funding and reduce our reliance on wholesale funding. We raise deposits, including savings, demand and time deposits, from consumers and institutional clients, and through internal and third-party broker-dealers, as well as transaction banking channels. Our deposits are primarily raised through GS Bank USA and GSIB. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our deposits.

Secured Funding.

We fund a significant amount of inventory and a portion of investments on a secured basis. Secured funding includes collateralized financings in the consolidated balance sheets. We may also pledge our inventory and investments as collateral for securities borrowed under a securities lending agreement. We also use our own inventory and investments to cover transactions in which we or our clients have sold securities that have not yet been purchased. Secured funding is less sensitive to changes in our credit quality than unsecured funding, due to our posting of collateral to our lenders. Nonetheless, we analyze the refinancing risk of our secured funding activities, taking into account trade tenors, maturity profiles, counterparty concentrations, collateral eligibility and counterparty rollover probabilities. We seek to mitigate our refinancing risk by executing term trades with staggered maturities, diversifying counterparties, raising excess secured funding and pre-funding

residual risk through our GCLA.

We seek to raise secured funding with a term appropriate for the liquidity of the assets that are being financed, and we seek longer maturities for secured funding collateralized by asset classes that may be harder to fund on a secured basis, especially during times of market stress. Our secured funding, excluding funding collateralized by liquid government and agency obligations, is primarily executed for tenors of one month or greater and is primarily executed through term repurchase agreements and securities loaned contracts. 

The weighted average maturity of our secured funding included in collateralized financings in the consolidated balance sheets, excluding funding that can only be collateralized by liquid government and agency obligations 

and funding through participation in Federal Reserve facilities, 

exceeded 120 days as of March 2020.

Assets that may be harder to fund on a secured basis during times of market stress include certain financial instruments in the following categories: mortgage and other asset-backed loans and securities, non-investment-grade 

corporate debt securities, equity securities and emerging market securities. Assets that are classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are generally funded on an unsecured basis. See Notes 4 through 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the classification of financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy and &#8220;Unsecured Long-Term Borrowings&#8221; below for further information about the use of unsecured long-term borrowings as a source of funding.

We also raise financing through other types of collateralized financings, such as secured loans and notes. GS Bank USA has access to funding from the Federal Home Loan Bank. Our outstanding borrowings against the Federal Home Loan Bank were $4.03 billion as of March 2020 and $527 million as of December 2019. 

In an effort to mitigate the financial impact of the COVID-19

pandemic, central banks around the world have taken aggressive measures to increase liquidity. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve has taken a broad set of actions to support the functioning of financial markets. These actions by the Federal Reserve include establishing a Primary Dealer Credit Facility, which permits broker dealers to borrow against a wide array of collateral, and creating a Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, under which banks that purchase assets from money market mutual funds can pledge those assets on a nonrecourse basis to the Federal Reserve. The banking sector, including us, has acted in support of the financial system through active participation in the Federal Reserve&#8217;s initiatives.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

We also have access to funding through the Federal Reserve discount window. While we do not rely on this funding in our liquidity planning and stress testing, we accessed the Federal Reserve discount window during the first quarter of 2020, in line with the commitment announced alongside the nation&#8217;s other large banks. The discount window allows the Federal Reserve to lend directly to depository institutions to provide liquidity and stability to the banking system so that they can better serve their individual and corporate clients. 

Unsecured Short-Term Borrowings.

A significant portion of our unsecured short-term borrowings was originally long-term debt that is scheduled to mature within one year of the reporting date. We use unsecured short-term borrowings, including U.S. and non-U.S.

hybrid financial instruments, to finance liquid assets and for other cash management purposes. In light of regulatory developments, Group Inc. no longer issues debt with an original maturity of less than one year, other than to its subsidiaries. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our unsecured short-term borrowings.

Unsecured Long-Term Borrowings.

Unsecured long-term borrowings, including structured notes, are raised through syndicated U.S. registered offerings, U.S. registered and Rule 144A medium-term note programs, offshore medium-term note offerings and other debt offerings. We issue in different tenors, currencies and products to maximize the diversification of our investor base.

The table below presents our quarterly unsecured long-term borrowings maturity profile.

The weighted average maturity of our unsecured long-term borrowings as of March 2020 was approximately eight years. To mitigate refinancing risk, we seek to limit the principal amount of debt maturing over the course of any monthly, quarterly or annual time horizon. We enter into interest rate swaps to convert a portion of our unsecured long-term borrowings into floating-rate obligations to manage our exposure to interest rates. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our unsecured long-term borrowings. 

Shareholders&#8217; Equity.

Shareholders&#8217; equity is a stable and perpetual source of funding. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our shareholders&#8217; equity.

Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital 

Capital adequacy is of critical importance to us. We have in place a comprehensive capital management policy that provides a framework, defines objectives and establishes guidelines to assist us in maintaining the appropriate level and composition of capital in both business-as-usual

and stressed conditions.

Equity Capital Management 

We determine the appropriate amount and composition of our equity capital by considering multiple factors, including our current and future regulatory capital requirements, the results of our capital planning and stress testing process, the results of resolution capital models and other factors, such as rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, the business environment and conditions in the financial markets. 

We manage our capital requirements and the levels of our capital usage principally by setting limits on the balance sheet and/or limits on risk, in each case at both the firmwide and business levels. 

We principally manage the level and composition of our equity capital through issuances and repurchases of our common stock. We may also, from time to time, issue or repurchase our preferred stock, junior subordinated debt issued to trusts, and other subordinated debt or other forms of capital as business conditions warrant. Prior to any repurchases, we must receive confirmation that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) does not object to such capital action. See Notes 14 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our preferred stock, junior subordinated debt issued to trusts and other subordinated debt. 

Capital Planning and Stress Testing Process.

As part of capital planning, we project sources and uses of capital given a range of business environments, including stressed conditions. Our stress testing process is designed to identify and measure material risks associated with our business activities, including market risk, credit risk and operational risk, as well as our ability to generate revenues.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Our capital planning process incorporates an internal capital adequacy assessment with the objective of ensuring that we are appropriately capitalized relative to the risks in our businesses. We incorporate stress scenarios into our capital planning process with a goal of holding sufficient capital to ensure we remain adequately capitalized after experiencing a severe stress event. Our assessment of capital adequacy is viewed in tandem with our assessment of liquidity adequacy and is integrated into our overall risk management structure, governance and policy framework. 

Our stress tests incorporate our internally designed stress scenarios, including our internally developed severely adverse scenario, and those required under CCAR and DFAST, and are designed to capture our specific vulnerabilities and risks. We provide further information about our stress test processes and a summary of the results on our website as described in &#8220;Available Information.&#8221; 

As required by the FRB&#8217;s CCAR rules, we submit an annual capital plan for review by the FRB. The purpose of the FRB&#8217;s review is to ensure that we have a robust, forward-looking capital planning process that accounts for our unique risks and that permits continued operation during times of economic and financial stress. 

The FRB evaluates us based, in part, on whether we have the capital necessary to continue operating under the baseline and severely adverse scenarios provided by the FRB and those developed internally. This evaluation also takes into account our process for identifying risk, our controls and governance for capital planning, and our guidelines for making capital planning decisions. In addition, the FRB evaluates our plan to make capital distributions (i.e., dividend payments and repurchases or redemptions of stock, subordinated debt or other capital securities) and issue capital, across the range of macroeconomic scenarios and firm-specific assumptions. 

With respect to our 2019 CCAR submission, the FRB informed us that it did not object to our capital plan, which includes the return of up to $8.8 billion of capital from the third quarter of 2019 through the second quarter of 2020 (2019 CCAR cycle). The capital plan provides for up to $7.0 billion in repurchases of outstanding common stock and $1.8 billion in total common stock dividends, including an increase in our common stock dividend from $0.85 to $1.25 per share in the third quarter of 2019. During the third and fourth quarters of 2019 and first quarter of 2020, we returned a total of $6.13 billion of capital, including stock repurchases of $4.76 billion and common stock dividends of $1.37 billion. Due to the current market conditions, we, along with other member banks of the Financial Services Forum, have voluntarily decided to temporarily suspend stock repurchases through the end of the 2019 CCAR cycle, and we will continue to evaluate our share repurchases for the remainder of 2020 as circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic evolve. 

We published a summary of our annual DFAST results in June 2019. See &#8220;Available Information.&#8221; We submitted our 2020 CCAR capital plan in April 2020 and expect to publish a summary of our annual DFAST results in June 2020. The FRB also conducts its own annual stress tests and publishes a summary of certain results. 

GS Bank USA has its own capital planning process, but was not required to conduct its annual stress test in 2019. 

Goldman Sachs International (GSI) and GSIB also have their own capital planning and stress testing process, which incorporates internally designed stress tests and those required under the Prudential Regulation Authority&#8217;s (PRA) Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Contingency Capital Plan.

As part of our comprehensive capital management policy, we maintain a contingency capital plan. Our contingency capital plan provides a framework for analyzing and responding to a perceived or actual capital deficiency, including, but not limited to, identification of drivers of a capital deficiency, as well as mitigants and potential actions. It outlines the appropriate communication procedures to follow during a crisis period, including internal dissemination of information, as well as timely communication with external stakeholders.

Capital Attribution.

We assess each of our businesses&#8217; capital usage based on our internal assessment of risks, which incorporates an attribution of all of our relevant regulatory capital requirements. These regulatory capital requirements are allocated using our attributed equity framework, which takes into consideration our most binding capital constraints. Our most binding capital constraint is based on the results of the FRB&#8217;s annual stress test scenarios which include the Standardized risk-based capital and leverage ratios. See &#8220;Segment Assets and Operating Results &#8212; Segment Operating Results&#8221; for information about our attributed equity by segment.

Share Repurchase Program.

We use our share repurchase program to help maintain the appropriate level of common equity. The repurchase program is effected primarily through regular open-market purchases (which may include repurchase plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1

and accelerated share repurchases), the amounts and timing of which are determined primarily by our current and projected capital position and our capital plan submitted to the FRB as part of CCAR. The amounts and timing of the repurchases may also be influenced by general market conditions and the prevailing price and trading volumes of our common stock.

On July 15, 2019, the Board of Directors of Group Inc. (Board) authorized the repurchase of an additional 50 million shares of common stock pursuant to our existing share repurchase program; however, we are only permitted to make repurchases to the extent that such repurchases have not been objected to by the FRB. As of March 2020, the remaining share authorization under our existing repurchase program was 49.7 million shares. See &#8220;Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds&#8221; in Part II, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q

and Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our share repurchase program, and see above for information about our capital planning and stress testing process.

Resolution Capital Models.

In connection with our resolution planning efforts, we have established a Resolution Capital Adequacy and Positioning framework, which is designed to ensure that our major subsidiaries (GS Bank USA, Goldman Sachs &#38; Co. LLC (GS&#38;Co.), GSI, GSIB, Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd. (GSJCL), Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. and Goldman Sachs Asset Management International) have access to sufficient loss-absorbing capacity (in the form of equity, subordinated debt and unsecured senior debt) so that they are able to wind-down following a Group Inc. bankruptcy filing in accordance with our preferred resolution strategy.

In addition, we have established a triggers and alerts framework, which is designed to provide the Board with information needed to make an informed decision on whether and when to commence bankruptcy proceedings for Group Inc. 

Rating Agency Guidelines 

The credit rating agencies assign credit ratings to the obligations of Group Inc., which directly issues or guarantees substantially all of our senior unsecured debt obligations. GS&#38;Co. and GSI have been assigned long-term and short-term issuer ratings by certain credit rating agencies. GS Bank USA and GSIB have also been assigned long-term and short-term issuer ratings, as well as ratings on their long-term and short-term bank deposits. In addition, credit rating agencies have assigned ratings to debt obligations of certain other subsidiaries of Group Inc. 

The level and composition of our equity capital are among the many factors considered in determining our credit ratings. Each agency has its own definition of eligible capital and methodology for evaluating capital adequacy, and assessments are generally based on a combination of factors rather than a single calculation. See &#8220;Risk Management &#8212; Liquidity Risk Management &#8212; Credit Ratings&#8221; for further information about credit ratings of Group Inc., GS Bank USA, GSIB, GS&#38;Co. and GSI.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Consolidated Regulatory Capital 

We are subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements which are calculated in accordance with the regulations of the FRB (Capital Framework). Under the Capital Framework, we are an &#8220;Advanced approach&#8221; banking organization and have been designated as a global systemically important bank (G-SIB). 

The capital requirements calculated in accordance with the Capital Framework include the risk-based capital buffers and G-SIB

surcharge. The risk-based capital buffers, applicable to us for 2020, include the capital conservation buffer of 2.5% and the countercyclical capital buffer, which the FRB has set to zero percent. In addition, the G-SIB 

surcharge applicable to us for 2020 is 2.5% based on 2018 financial data and 2.5% for 2021 based on 2019 financial data. Based on financial data for the three months ended March 2020, our current estimate is that we are above the threshold for the 3.0% G-SIB

surcharge. We expect that our G-SIB

surcharge may remain above the 3% threshold over the next three years. This increase would be effective on January 1 of the year that is one full calendar year after the increased G-SIB

surcharge is finalized. The G-SIB 

surcharge and countercyclical buffer in the future may differ due to additional guidance from our regulators and/or positional changes. Our target CET1 capital ratio over the next three years is between 13.0% and 13.5% (including management buffers). This target reflects, among other things, our calculations based on the final stress capital buffer rule. See &#8220;Regulatory and Other Matters&#8221; for further information about the final rule.

See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios, and the Capital Framework. 

TLAC 

We are also subject to the FRB&#8217;s TLAC and related requirements. Failure to comply with the TLAC and related requirements could result in restrictions being imposed by the FRB and could limit our ability to repurchase shares, pay dividends and make certain discretionary compensation payments. 

The table below presents TLAC and external long-term debt requirements.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Subsidiary Capital Requirements 

Many of our subsidiaries, including our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to separate regulation and capital requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate. 

Bank Subsidiaries.

GS Bank USA is our primary U.S. banking subsidiary and GSIB is our primary non-U.S. 

banking subsidiary. These entities are subject to regulatory capital requirements. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the regulatory capital requirements of our bank subsidiaries.

U.S. Regulated Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries.

GS&#38;Co. is our primary U.S. regulated broker-dealer subsidiary and is subject to regulatory capital requirements, including those imposed by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. In addition, GS&#38;Co. is a registered futures commission merchant and is subject to regulatory capital requirements imposed by the CFTC, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the National Futures Association. Rule 15c3-1

of the SEC and Rule 1.17 of the CFTC specify uniform minimum net capital requirements, as defined, for their registrants, and also effectively require that a significant part of the registrants&#8217; assets be kept in relatively liquid form. GS&#38;Co. has elected to calculate its minimum capital requirements in accordance with the &#8220;Alternative Net Capital Requirement&#8221; as permitted by Rule 15c3-1. 

GS&#38;Co. had regulatory net capital, as defined by Rule 15c3-1,

of $18.66 billion as of March 2020 and $20.88 billion as of December 2019, which exceeded the amount required by $14.26 billion as of March 2020 and $18.15 billion as of December 2019. In addition to its alternative minimum net capital requirements, GS&#38;Co. is also required to hold tentative net capital in excess of $1 billion and net capital in excess of $500 million in accordance with the market and credit risk standards of Appendix E of Rule 15c3-1.

GS&#38;Co. is also required to notify the SEC in the event that its tentative net capital is less than $5 billion. As of both March 2020 and December 2019, GS&#38;Co. had tentative net capital and net capital in excess of both the minimum and the notification requirements.

&#160;

Non-U.S. Regulated Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries.

Our principal non-U.S.

regulated broker-dealer subsidiaries include GSI and GSJCL.

GSI, our U.K. broker-dealer, is regulated by the PRA and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). 

GSI is subject to the capital framework for E.U.-regulated financial institutions prescribed in the E.U. Fourth Capital Requirements Directive and the E.U. Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). These capital regulations are largely based on Basel III.

The table below presents GSI&#8217;s risk-based capital requirements.

In the table above, CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital as of March 2020 excluded GSI&#8217;s undistributed profits from December 1, 2019 through March 31, 2020, as such profits have not yet been approved to be included as regulatory capital by the PRA. 

In November 2016, the European Commission proposed amendments to the CRR to implement a 3% leverage ratio requirement for certain E.U. financial institutions. This leverage ratio compares the CRR&#8217;s definition of Tier 1 capital to a measure of leverage exposure, defined as the sum of certain assets plus certain off-balance

sheet exposures (which include a measure of derivatives, securities financing transactions, commitments and guarantees), less Tier 1 capital deductions. The required leverage ratio is expected to become effective for GSI on June 28, 2021. GSI had a leverage ratio of 4.3% as of March 2020 and 4.6% as of December 2019. GSI&#8217;s leverage ratio as of March 2020 excluded GSI&#8217;s undistributed profits from December 1, 2019 through March 31, 2020, as such profits have not yet been approved to be included as regulatory capital by the PRA. This leverage ratio is based on our current interpretation and understanding of this rule and may evolve as we discuss the interpretation and application of this rule with GSI&#8217;s regulators.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

GSI is also subject to a minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities issued to affiliates. This requirement is subject to a transitional period which began to phase in from January 1, 2019 and will become fully effective on January 1, 2022. As of March 2020, GSI was in compliance with this requirement. 

GSJCL, our Japanese broker-dealer, is regulated by Japan&#8217;s Financial Services Agency. GSJCL and certain other non-U.S.

subsidiaries are also subject to capital requirements promulgated by authorities of the countries in which they operate. As of both March 2020 and December 2019, these subsidiaries were in compliance with their local capital requirements.

Regulatory and Other Matters 

Regulatory Matters 

Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and supervision worldwide. Regulations have been adopted or are being considered by regulators and policy makers worldwide. Given that many of the new and proposed rules are highly complex, the full impact of regulatory reform will not be known until the rules are implemented and market practices develop under the final regulations. 

Stress Capital Buffer.

In March 2020, the FRB released the stress capital buffer final rule, and it will begin to apply on October 1, 2020. In accordance with the final rule, our Standardized capital ratio requirements will include the stressed capital buffer, which will be measured as the difference between the starting and lowest projected CET1 capital ratio in the supervisory severely adverse stress scenario, as calculated by the FRB, including four quarters of planned common stock dividends, subject to a 2.5% floor. Under the rule, stress leverage requirements, as calculated by the FRB, have been eliminated.

Leverage Ratios.

In April 2020, the FRB released an interim final rule that provides an option for depository institution holding companies, such as Group Inc., to exclude U.S. Treasury securities holdings and deposits at the Federal Reserve from the calculation of total leverage exposure beginning April 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021. We have elected to exclude such instruments from our calculation of supplementary leverage ratio and TLAC leverage requirement for the applicable period.

See &#8220;Business &#8212; Regulation&#8221; in Part I, Item 1 of the 2019 Form 10-K

for further information about the laws, rules and regulations and proposed laws, rules and regulations that apply to us and our operations.

Other Matters 

Brexit.

In March 2017, the U.K. government commenced the formal proceedings to withdraw from the E.U.

The E.U. and the U.K. agreed to a withdrawal agreement (the Withdrawal Agreement), which became effective on January 31, 2020. The transition period under the Withdrawal Agreement will last until the end of December 2020 to allow the two sides to negotiate a future trade agreement. During the transition period, the U.K. will be treated as if it were a member state of the E.U. and therefore the existing arrangements between the U.K. and the E.U. will not change. The Withdrawal Agreement provides for the possibility of an extension of the transition period for either one or two more years. However, the U.K. has pledged not to extend the transition period beyond December 31, 2020. 

Based upon the existing non-E.U.

country equivalence regimes, the E.U. and the U.K. have agreed to complete their assessments of equivalence by the end of June 2020. There is significant uncertainty as to the outcome of those assessments. We are monitoring the ongoing development related to Brexit and continue to prepare for a scenario where the U.K. financial services firms will lose access to E.U. markets on December 31, 2020 (a &#8220;hard&#8221; Brexit) while ensuring we remain flexible and well positioned to allow our clients to benefit from any more favorable scenarios. Our planning also recognizes that after the end of the transition period, we can rely on a degree of continuing access for our U.K. entities pursuant to national cross-border access regimes in certain jurisdictions (for example, based on specific licenses or exemptions). See &#8220;Regulatory Matters and Other Developments &#8212; Other Developments&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the 2019 Form 10-K

for further information about our plan to manage a hard Brexit scenario.

Replacement of Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs), including LIBOR.

Central banks and regulators in a number of major jurisdictions (for example, U.S., U.K., E.U., Switzerland and Japan) have convened working groups to find, and implement the transition to, suitable replacements for IBORs. The FCA, which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it will not compel panel banks to contribute to LIBOR after 2021. In addition, in light of COVID-19,

the FCA, alongside the Bank of England and the members of the Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Reference Rates, issued a statement reaffirming that firms cannot rely on LIBOR being published after 2021. Accordingly, we continue to make progress on our LIBOR transition program in line with this deadline.

&#160; 122

&#160;

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

We have created a program that focuses on achieving an orderly transition from IBORs to alternative risk-free reference rates for us and our clients. As part of this transition, we continue to actively engage with our regulators and clients, as well as participate in central bank and sector working groups. We have issued debt and deposits linked to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) and Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) and have executed SOFR- and SONIA-based derivative contracts to make markets and facilitate client activities. Where possible, we continue to execute transactions in the market to reduce our LIBOR exposures arising from hedges to our fixed-rate debt issuances and replace with alternative risk-free reference rates exposures. See &#8220;Regulatory Matters and Other Developments &#8212; Other Developments&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the 2019 Form 10-K

for further information about our transition program.

Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic.

The COVID-19 

pandemic has resulted in governments around the world implementing a broad suite of measures to help control the spread of the virus, including, among others, quarantines, travel restrictions and business curtailments.

In response to the COVID-19

pandemic, we activated and successfully executed on our BCP strategy. Our priority has been to safeguard our employees and to seek to ensure continuity of business operations on behalf of our clients. We have a central team that manages our COVID-19 

response, which is led by our chief administrative officer and chief medical officer, and includes senior management within Risk and the chief operating officers across all regions and businesses. As a result of our BCP plan, nearly all of our employees are working remotely. Our systems and infrastructure have continued to support the increased volumes of activity. We implemented a heightened level of communication across senior management and among senior management, the rest of our employees and the Board of Directors. Real-time information sharing and decision-making are occurring through a variety of senior management meetings. Our Management Committee and other senior leaders have multiple standing meetings on a daily and weekly basis. Our executive officers have provided regular and enhanced communications to promote connectivity with our clients and employees worldwide. Furthermore, we have proactively engaged with our vendors on a regular basis in connection with our efforts to ensure they continue to meet our criteria for business continuity. 

The adverse impacts of COVID-19

on financial markets has led central banks to take aggressive steps to increase liquidity. At the encouragement of the Federal Reserve, the banking sector, including us, has utilized a variety of facilities to help clients access financing to support their businesses. We will continue to evaluate our level of participation in these facilities and any new facilities or programs that become available. We have also decided to temporarily suspend share buybacks through the second quarter of 2020. As we make capital return decisions beyond the second quarter of 2020, we will continue to assess what is needed for reinvestment and to support our clients. Another action we took during the first quarter of 2020 was the purchase by GS Bank USA of short-term debt securities, primarily certificates of deposit, from two money market funds that we manage, which are not covered by the Volcker Rule. GS Bank USA&#8217;s purchase price of $1.84 billion represented the fair value of these securities, which also closely approximated their face values. These purchases were made to promote liquidity in the short-term credit markets and to increase the funds&#8217; weekly liquid assets.

Our liquidity position during the first quarter of 2020 remained strong. We maintained an average GCLA of $243 billion for the first quarter of 2020, an increase of $6 billion compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. Our deposits increased by $30 billion to $220 billion compared with December 2019. In addition, we also issued unsecured vanilla debt of $15.7 billion during the first quarter of 2020. Our capital ratios declined during the first quarter of 2020, primarily driven by balance sheet growth to support clients amid increased activity and demand for risk intermediation, but remained in excess of our minimum requirements.

The valuation of financial instruments and determination of the provision for credit losses are more difficult when severe economic and market shocks occur. Recent market conditions, characterized by dislocations between asset prices, higher volatility, reduced price transparency and a deterioration in the creditworthiness of borrowers have made it more challenging to determine the fair value of some of our financial assets and liabilities and the provision for credit losses. The current circumstances have required greater use of judgment, and in the case of financial instruments accounted for at fair value, have contributed to an increase in level 3 balances. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about fair value measurements and Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the provision for credit losses.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

As a result of the dramatic change in the macroeconomic environment since we last performed a goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2019, we assessed goodwill for impairment as of March 2020 and determined that it was not impaired. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about goodwill. 

Over the latter part of the first quarter of 2020, financial markets experienced a spike in volatility as concerns over the spread of COVID-19

intensified. Clients sought to reduce risk exposures, resulting in a significant increase in transaction volumes. Our average daily VaR for the first quarter of 2020 was $81 million, an increase of $26 million compared to March 2019, reflecting, among other things, the role that we have played as a risk intermediary for our clients in the current challenging environment. Throughout the crisis, our approach to managing market risk levels has been proactive, involving ongoing review and monitoring of exposures and risk mitigation opportunities. In addition, the sharp decline in economic activity as the pandemic became more acute has increased credit risk in general and particularly with regard to companies in industries that have been most severely impacted by the economic disruption, including oil and gas, gaming and lodging, and airlines. During the first quarter of 2020, we had approximately $19 billion in drawdowns on committed corporate credit lines in our relationship lending business, which was below the amount that was pre-funded

based on our liquidity models. Given the stresses on clients&#8217; liquidity, we have elevated our approach to credit risk management, with an increased focus on monitoring of credit exposures and management of margin calls and disputes. Our risk positions remained balanced, controlled and adequately provisioned for, both in terms of counterparty risk and sector exposure. See &#8220;Market Risk Management&#8221; and &#8220;Credit Risk Management&#8221; for further information.

Our response to COVID-19

has involved a number of actions and initiatives aimed at providing support to our clients, employees, vendors and communities. See &#8220;Executive Overview&#8221; for further information.

The COVID-19

pandemic has created significant uncertainty regarding the operating environment for the remainder of 2020 and possibly longer, as the duration and future course of the pandemic cannot be predicted at this time. A sustained period of weak economic conditions as a result of the pandemic would be detrimental to our businesses as it would negatively affect factors that are important to our operating performance, such as the level of client activity, creditworthiness of counterparties and borrowers, and the amount of our assets under supervision. We are monitoring the ongoing developments related to COVID-19

and will take further action as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, clients and counterparties. For further information about the risks associated with COVID-19,

see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Part II, Item 1A.

Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations 

Off-Balance

Sheet Arrangements 

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into various types of off-balance

sheet arrangements. Our involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms, including:

&#160;

&#8226;

Purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in special purpose entities, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securitization vehicles; 

&#160;

&#8226;

Holding senior and subordinated debt, interests in limited and general partnerships, and preferred and common stock in other nonconsolidated vehicles; 

&#160;

&#8226;

Entering into interest rate, foreign currency, equity, commodity and credit derivatives, including total return swaps; and 

&#160;

&#8226;

Providing guarantees, indemnifications, commitments, letters of credit and representations and warranties. 

We enter into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes, including securitizations. The securitization vehicles that purchase mortgages, corporate bonds, and other types of financial assets are critical to the functioning of several significant investor markets, including the mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities markets, since they offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process. 

We also enter into these arrangements to underwrite client securitization transactions; provide secondary market liquidity; make investments in performing and nonperforming debt, distressed loans, power-related assets, equity securities, real estate and other assets; provide investors with credit-linked and asset-repackaged notes; and receive or provide letters of credit to satisfy margin requirements and to facilitate the clearance and settlement process.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Risk Management 

Risks are inherent in our businesses and include liquidity, market, credit, operational, model, legal, compliance, conduct, regulatory and reputational risks. Our risks include the risks across our risk categories, regions or global businesses, as well as those which have uncertain outcomes and have the potential to materially impact our financial results, our liquidity and our reputation. For further information about our risk management processes, see &#8220;Overview and Structure of Risk Management,&#8221; and for information about our areas of risk, see &#8220;Liquidity Risk Management,&#8221; &#8220;Market Risk Management,&#8221; &#8220;Credit Risk Management,&#8221; &#8220;Operational Risk Management&#8221; and &#8220;Model Risk Management&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q

and in Part I, Item 1A of the 2019 Form 10-K. 

Overview and Structure of Risk Management 

Overview 

We believe that effective risk management is critical to our success. Accordingly, we have established an enterprise risk management framework that employs a comprehensive, integrated approach to risk management, and is designed to enable comprehensive risk management processes through which we identify, assess, monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our activities. Our risk management structure is built around three core components: governance, processes and people. 

Governance.

Risk management governance starts with the Board, which both directly and through its committees, including its Risk Committee, oversees our risk management policies and practices implemented through the enterprise risk management framework. The Board is also responsible for the annual review and approval of our risk appetite statement. The risk appetite statement describes the levels and types of risk we are willing to accept or to avoid, in order to achieve our objectives included in our strategic business plan, while remaining in compliance with regulatory requirements. The Board reviews our strategic business plan and is ultimately responsible for overseeing and providing direction about our strategy and risk appetite.

The Board receives regular briefings on firmwide risks, including liquidity risk, market risk, credit risk, operational risk and model risk from our independent risk oversight and control functions, including the chief risk officer, and on compliance risk and conduct risk from Compliance, on legal and regulatory enforcement matters from the general counsel, and on other matters impacting our reputation from the chair of our Firmwide Client and Business Standards Committee and our Firmwide Reputational Risk Committee. The chief risk officer reports to our chief executive officer and to the Risk Committee of the Board. As part of the review of the firmwide risk portfolio, the chief risk officer regularly advises the Risk Committee of the Board of relevant risk metrics and material exposures, including risk limits and thresholds established in our risk appetite statement. 

The implementation of our risk governance structure and core risk management processes are overseen by Enterprise Risk, which reports to our chief risk officer, and is responsible for ensuring that our enterprise risk management framework provides the Board, our risk committees and senior management with a consistent and integrated approach to managing our various risks in a manner consistent with our risk appetite. 

Our revenue-producing units, as well as Treasury, Engineering, Human Capital Management, Operations and Services, are considered our first line of defense. They are accountable for the outcomes of our risk-generating activities, as well as for assessing and managing those risks within our risk appetite. 

Our independent risk oversight and control functions are considered our second line of defense and provide independent assessment, oversight and challenge of the risks taken by our first line of defense, as well as lead and participate in risk committees. Independent risk oversight and control functions include Compliance, Conflicts Resolution, Controllers, Credit Risk, Enterprise Risk, Legal, Liquidity Risk, Market Risk, Model Risk, Operational Risk and Tax. 

Internal Audit is considered our third line of defense and reports to the Audit Committee of the Board and administratively to our chief executive officer. Internal Audit includes professionals with a broad range of audit and industry experience, including risk management expertise. Internal Audit is responsible for independently assessing and validating the effectiveness of key controls, including those within the risk management framework, and providing timely reporting to the Audit Committee of the Board, senior management and regulators. 

The three lines of defense structure promotes the accountability of first line risk takers, provides a framework for effective challenge by the second line and empowers independent review from the third line.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Processes.

We maintain various processes that are critical components of our risk management framework, including (i) risk identification and assessment, (ii) risk appetite, limit and threshold setting, (iii) risk reporting and monitoring, and (iv) risk decision-making.

&#160;

&#8226;

Risk Identification and Assessment.

We believe that the identification and assessment of our risks is a critical step in providing our Board and senior management transparency and insight into the range and materiality of our risks. We have a comprehensive data collection process, including firmwide policies and procedures that require all employees to report and escalate risk events. Our approach for risk identification and assessment is comprehensive across all risk types, is dynamic and forward-looking to reflect and adapt to our changing risk profile and business environment, leverages subject matter expertise, and allows for prioritization of our most critical risks. 

To effectively assess our risks, we maintain a daily discipline of marking substantially all of our inventory to current market levels. We carry our inventory at fair value, with changes in valuation reflected immediately in our risk management systems and in net revenues. We do so because we believe this discipline is one of the most effective tools for assessing and managing risk and that it provides transparent and realistic insight into our inventory exposures. 

An important part of our risk management process is firmwide stress testing. It allows us to quantify our exposure to tail risks, highlight potential loss concentrations, undertake risk/reward analysis, and assess and mitigate our risk positions. Firmwide stress tests are performed on a regular basis and are designed to ensure a comprehensive analysis of our vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks combining financial and nonfinancial risks, including, but not limited to, credit, market, liquidity and funding, operational and compliance, strategic, systemic and emerging risks into a single combined scenario. We also perform ad hoc stress tests in anticipation of market events or conditions. Stress tests are also used to assess capital adequacy as part of our capital planning and stress testing process. See &#8220;Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital &#8212; Equity Capital Management&#8221; for further information. 

&#8226;

Risk Appetite, Limit and Threshold Setting.

We apply a rigorous framework of limits and thresholds to control and monitor risk across transactions, products, businesses and markets. The Board, directly or indirectly through its Risk Committee, approves limits and thresholds included in our risk appetite statement at firmwide, business and product levels. In addition, the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee is responsible for approving our risk limits framework, subject to the overall limits approved by the Risk Committee of the Board, and monitoring these limits. 

The Risk Governance Committee is responsible for approving limits at firmwide, business and product levels. Certain limits may be set at levels that will require periodic adjustment, rather than at levels that reflect our maximum risk appetite. This fosters an ongoing dialogue about risk among our first and second lines of defense, committees and senior management, as well as rapid escalation of risk-related

matters. Additionally, through delegated authority from the Risk Governance Committee, Market Risk sets limits at certain product and desk levels, and Credit Risk sets limits for individual counterparties, counterparties and their subsidiaries, industries and countries. Limits are reviewed regularly and amended on a permanent or temporary basis to reflect changing market conditions, business conditions or risk tolerance.

&#160;

&#8226;

Risk Reporting and Monitoring.

Effective risk reporting and risk decision-making depends on our ability to get the right information to the right people at the right time. As such, we focus on the rigor and effectiveness of our risk systems, with the objective of ensuring that our risk management technology systems provide us with complete, accurate and timely information. Our risk reporting and monitoring processes are designed to take into account information about both existing and emerging risks, thereby enabling our risk committees and senior management to perform their responsibilities with the appropriate level of insight into risk exposures. Furthermore, our limit and threshold breach processes provide means for timely escalation. 

We evaluate changes in our risk profile and our businesses, including changes in business mix or jurisdictions in which we operate, by monitoring risk factors at a firmwide level.

&#160; Goldman Sachs March 2020 Form 10-Q 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

&#8226;

Risk Decision-Making.

Our governance structure provides the protocol and responsibility for decision-making

on risk management issues and ensures implementation of those decisions. We make extensive use of risk committees that meet regularly and serve as an important means to facilitate and foster ongoing discussions to manage and mitigate risks. 

We maintain strong and proactive communication about risk and we have a culture of collaboration in decision-making among our first and second lines of defense, committees and senior management. While our first line of defense is responsible for management of their risk, we dedicate extensive resources to our second line of defense in order to ensure a strong oversight structure and an appropriate segregation of duties. We regularly reinforce our strong culture of escalation and accountability across all functions. 

People.

Even the best technology serves only as a tool for helping to make informed decisions in real time about the risks we are taking. Ultimately, effective risk management requires our people to interpret our risk data on an ongoing and timely basis and adjust risk positions accordingly. The experience of our professionals, and their understanding of the nuances and limitations of each risk measure, guides us in assessing exposures and maintaining them within prudent levels. 

We reinforce a culture of effective risk management, consistent with our risk appetite, in our training and development programs, as well as in the way we evaluate performance, and recognize and reward our people. Our training and development programs, including certain sessions led by our most senior leaders, are focused on the importance of risk management, client relationships and reputational excellence. As part of our annual performance review process, we assess reputational excellence, including how an employee exercises good risk management and reputational judgment, and adheres to our code of conduct and compliance policies. Our review and reward processes are designed to communicate and reinforce to our professionals the link between behavior and how people are recognized, the need to focus on our clients and our reputation, and the need to always act in accordance with our highest standards. 

Structure 

Ultimate oversight of risk is the responsibility of our Board. The Board oversees risk both directly and through its committees, including its Risk Committee. We have a series of committees with specific risk management mandates that have oversight or decision-making responsibilities for risk management activities. Committee membership generally consists of senior managers from both our first and second lines of defense. We have established procedures for these committees to ensure that appropriate information barriers are in place. Our primary risk committees, most of which also have additional sub-committees

or working groups, are described below. In addition to these committees, we have other risk committees that provide oversight for different businesses, activities, products, regions and entities. All of our committees have responsibility for considering the impact of transactions and activities, which they oversee, on our reputation.

Membership of our risk committees is reviewed regularly and updated to reflect changes in the responsibilities of the committee members. Accordingly, the length of time that members serve on the respective committees varies as determined by the committee chairs and based on the responsibilities of the members. 

The chart below presents an overview of our risk management governance structure. 

&#160;

Management Committee.

The Management Committee oversees our global activities. It provides this oversight directly and through authority delegated to committees it has established. This committee consists of our most senior leaders, and is chaired by our chief executive officer. Most members of the Management Committee are also members of other committees. The following are the committees that are principally involved in firmwide risk management.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Conflicts Management 

Conflicts of interest and our approach to dealing with them are fundamental to our client relationships, our reputation and our long-term success. The term &#8220;conflict of interest&#8221; does not have a universally accepted meaning, and conflicts can arise in many forms within a business or between businesses. The responsibility for identifying potential conflicts, as well as complying with our policies and procedures, is shared by all of our employees. 

We have a multilayered approach to resolving conflicts and addressing reputational risk. Our senior management oversees policies related to conflicts resolution, and, in conjunction with Conflicts Resolution, Legal and Compliance, the Firmwide Client and Business Standards Committee, and other internal committees, formulates policies, standards and principles, and assists in making judgments regarding the appropriate resolution of particular conflicts. Resolving potential conflicts necessarily depends on the facts and circumstances of a particular situation and the application of experienced and informed judgment. 

As a general matter, Conflicts Resolution reviews financing and advisory assignments in Investment Banking and certain of our investing, lending and other activities. In addition, we have various transaction oversight committees, such as the Firmwide Capital, Commitments and Suitability Committees and other committees that also review new underwritings, loans, investments and structured products. These groups and committees work with internal and external counsel and Compliance to evaluate and address any actual or potential conflicts. Conflicts Resolution reports to our president and chief operating officer. 

We regularly assess our policies and procedures that address conflicts of interest in an effort to conduct our business in accordance with the highest ethical standards and in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. 

Compliance Risk Management 

Compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or damage to our reputation arising from our failure to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules and regulations, and our internal policies and procedures. Compliance risk is inherent in all activities through which we conduct our businesses. Our Compliance Risk Management Program, administered by Compliance, assesses our compliance, regulatory and reputational risk; monitors for compliance with new or amended laws, rules and regulations; designs and implements controls, policies, procedures and training; conducts independent testing; investigates, surveils and monitors for compliance risks and breaches; and leads our responses to regulatory examinations, audits and inquiries. We monitor and review business practices to assess whether they meet or exceed minimum regulatory and legal standards in all markets and jurisdictions in which we conduct business. 

Liquidity Risk Management 

Overview 

Liquidity risk is the risk that we will be unable to fund ourselves or meet our liquidity needs in the event of firm-specific, broader industry or market liquidity stress events. We have in place a comprehensive and conservative set of liquidity and funding policies. Our principal objective is to be able to fund ourselves and to enable our core businesses to continue to serve clients and generate revenues, even under adverse circumstances. 

Treasury, which reports to our chief financial officer, has primary responsibility for developing, managing and executing our liquidity and funding strategy within our risk appetite. 

Liquidity Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and Treasury, and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our liquidity risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses and the establishment of stress testing and limits frameworks. 

Liquidity Risk Management Principles 

We manage liquidity risk according to three principles: (i) hold sufficient excess liquidity in the form of GCLA to cover outflows during a stressed period, (ii) maintain appropriate Asset-Liability Management and (iii) maintain a viable Contingency Funding Plan. 

GCLA.

GCLA is liquidity that we maintain to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows and collateral needs in a stressed environment. A primary liquidity principle is to pre-fund

our estimated potential cash and collateral needs during a liquidity crisis and hold this liquidity in the form of unencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash. We believe that the securities held in our GCLA would be readily convertible to cash in a matter of days, through liquidation, by entering into repurchase agreements or from maturities of resale agreements, and that this cash would allow us to meet immediate obligations without needing to sell other assets or depend on additional funding from credit-sensitive markets.

Our GCLA reflects the following principles: 

&#160;

&#8226;

The first days or weeks of a liquidity crisis are the most critical to a company&#8217;s survival; 

&#160;

&#8226;

Focus must be maintained on all potential cash and collateral outflows, not just disruptions to financing flows. Our businesses are diverse, and our liquidity needs are determined by many factors, including market movements, collateral requirements and client commitments, all of which can change dramatically in a difficult funding environment; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 131

&#160; Goldman Sachs March 2020 Form 10-Q 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

&#8226;

During a liquidity crisis, credit-sensitive funding, including unsecured debt, certain deposits and some types of secured financing agreements, may be unavailable, and the terms (e.g., interest rates, collateral provisions and tenor) or availability of other types of secured financing may change and certain deposits may be withdrawn; and 

&#160;

&#8226;

As a result of our policy to pre-fund

liquidity that we estimate may be needed in a crisis, we hold more unencumbered securities and have larger funding balances than our businesses would otherwise require. We believe that our liquidity is stronger with greater balances of highly liquid unencumbered securities, even though it increases our total assets and our funding costs. 

We maintain our GCLA across Group Inc., Goldman Sachs Funding LLC (Funding IHC) and Group Inc.&#8217;s major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries, asset types and clearing agents to provide us with sufficient operating liquidity to ensure timely settlement in all major markets, even in a difficult funding environment. In addition to the GCLA, we maintain cash balances and securities in several of our other entities, primarily for use in specific currencies, entities or jurisdictions where we do not have immediate access to parent company liquidity. 

Asset-Liability Management.

Our liquidity risk management policies are designed to ensure we have a sufficient amount of financing, even when funding markets experience persistent stress. We manage the maturities and diversity of our funding across markets, products and counterparties, and seek to maintain a diversified funding profile with an appropriate tenor, taking into consideration the characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets.

Our approach to asset-liability management includes: 

&#160;

&#8226;

Conservatively managing the overall characteristics of our funding book, with a focus on maintaining long-term, diversified sources of funding in excess of our current requirements. See &#8220;Balance Sheet and Funding Sources &#8212; Funding Sources&#8221; for further information; 

&#160;

&#8226;

Actively managing and monitoring our asset base, with particular focus on the liquidity, holding period and ability to fund assets on a secured basis. We assess our funding requirements and our ability to liquidate assets in a stressed environment while appropriately managing risk. This enables us to determine the most appropriate funding products and tenors. See &#8220;Balance Sheet and Funding Sources &#8212; Balance Sheet Management&#8221; for further information about our balance sheet management process and &#8220;&#8212; Funding Sources &#8212; Secured Funding&#8221; for further information about asset classes that may be harder to fund on a secured basis; and 

&#8226;

Raising secured and unsecured financing that has a long tenor relative to the liquidity profile of our assets. This reduces the risk that our liabilities will come due in advance of our ability to generate liquidity from the sale of our assets. Because we maintain a highly liquid balance sheet, the holding period of certain of our assets may be materially shorter than their contractual maturity dates. 

Our goal is to ensure that we maintain sufficient liquidity to fund our assets and meet our contractual and contingent obligations in normal times, as well as during periods of market stress. Through our dynamic balance sheet management process, we use actual and projected asset balances to determine secured and unsecured funding requirements. Funding plans are reviewed and approved by the Firmwide Asset Liability Committee. In addition, our independent risk oversight and control functions analyze, and the Firmwide Asset Liability Committee reviews, our consolidated total capital position (unsecured long-term borrowings plus total shareholders&#8217; equity) so that we maintain a level of long-term funding that is sufficient to meet our long-term financing requirements. In a liquidity crisis, we would first use our GCLA in order to avoid reliance on asset sales (other than our GCLA). However, we recognize that orderly asset sales may be prudent or necessary in a severe or persistent liquidity crisis. 

Subsidiary Funding Policies 

The majority of our unsecured funding is raised by Group Inc., which lends the necessary funds to Funding IHC and other subsidiaries, some of which are regulated, to meet their asset financing, liquidity and capital requirements. In addition, Group Inc. provides its regulated subsidiaries with the necessary capital to meet their regulatory requirements. The benefits of this approach to subsidiary funding are enhanced control and greater flexibility to meet the funding requirements of our subsidiaries. Funding is also raised at the subsidiary level through a variety of products, including deposits, secured funding and unsecured borrowings. 

Our intercompany funding policies assume that a subsidiary&#8217;s funds or securities are not freely available to its parent, Funding IHC or other subsidiaries unless (i) legally provided for and (ii) there are no additional regulatory, tax or other restrictions. In particular, many of our subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to Group Inc. or Funding IHC. Regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that Group Inc. needs to make payments on its obligations. Accordingly, we assume that the capital provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to Group Inc. or other subsidiaries and any other financing provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to Group Inc. or Funding IHC until the maturity of such financing.

&#160; 132

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Group Inc. has provided substantial amounts of equity and subordinated indebtedness, directly or indirectly, to its regulated subsidiaries. For example, as of March 2020, Group Inc. had $33.23 billion of equity and subordinated indebtedness invested in GS&#38;Co., its principal U.S. registered broker-dealer; $41.68 billion invested in GSI, a regulated U.K. broker-dealer; $2.94 billion invested in GSJCL, a regulated Japanese broker-dealer; $33.87 billion invested in GS Bank USA, a regulated New York State-chartered bank; and $4.04 billion invested in GSIB, a regulated U.K. bank. Group Inc. also provided, directly or indirectly, $117.52 billion of unsubordinated loans (including secured loans of $55.61 billion) and $17.01 billion of collateral and cash deposits to these entities, substantially all of which was to GS&#38;Co., GSI and GSJCL, as of March 2020. In addition, as of March 2020, Group Inc. had significant amounts of capital invested in and loans to its other regulated subsidiaries. 

Contingency Funding Plan.

We maintain a contingency funding plan to provide a framework for analyzing and responding to a liquidity crisis situation or periods of market stress. Our contingency funding plan outlines a list of potential risk factors, key reports and metrics that are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assist in assessing the severity of, and managing through, a liquidity crisis and/or market dislocation. The contingency funding plan also describes in detail our potential responses if our assessments indicate that we have entered a liquidity crisis, which include pre-funding

for what we estimate will be our potential cash and collateral needs, as well as utilizing secondary sources of liquidity. Mitigants and action items to address specific risks which may arise are also described and assigned to individuals responsible for execution.

The contingency funding plan identifies key groups of individuals and their responsibilities, which include fostering effective coordination, control and distribution of information, implementing liquidity maintenance activities and managing internal and external communication, all of which are critical in the management of a crisis or period of market stress. 

Stress Tests 

In order to determine the appropriate size of our GCLA, we model liquidity outflows over a range of scenarios and time horizons. One of our primary internal liquidity risk models, referred to as the Modeled Liquidity Outflow, quantifies our liquidity risks over a 30-day

stress scenario. We also consider other factors, including, but not limited to, an assessment of our potential intraday liquidity needs through an additional internal liquidity risk model, referred to as the Intraday Liquidity Model, the results of our long-term stress testing models, our resolution liquidity models and other applicable regulatory requirements and a qualitative assessment of our condition, as well as the financial markets. The results of the Modeled Liquidity Outflow, the Intraday Liquidity Model, the long-term stress testing models and the resolution liquidity models are reported to senior management on a regular basis. We also perform firmwide stress tests. See &#8220;Overview and Structure of Risk Management&#8221; for information about firmwide stress tests.

Modeled Liquidity Outflow.

Our Modeled Liquidity Outflow is based on conducting multiple scenarios that include combinations of market-wide and firm-specific stress. These scenarios are characterized by the following qualitative elements:

&#160;

&#8226;

Severely challenged market environments, which includes low consumer and corporate confidence, financial and political instability, and adverse changes in market values, including potential declines in equity markets and widening of credit spreads; and 

&#160;

&#8226;

A firm-specific crisis potentially triggered by material losses, reputational damage, litigation and/or a ratings downgrade. 

The following are key modeling elements of our Modeled Liquidity Outflow: 

&#160;

&#8226;

Liquidity needs over a 30-day

scenario; 

&#160;

&#8226;

A two-notch

downgrade of our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings; 

&#160;

&#8226;

Changing conditions in funding markets, which limit our access to unsecured and secured funding; 

&#160;

&#8226;

No support from additional government funding facilities. Although we have access to various central bank funding programs, we do not assume reliance on additional sources of funding in a liquidity crisis; and 

&#160;

&#8226;

A combination of contractual outflows, such as upcoming maturities of unsecured debt, and contingent outflows, including, but not limited to, the withdrawal of customer credit balances in our prime brokerage business, increase in variation margin requirements due to adverse changes in the value of our exchange-traded and OTC-cleared

derivatives, and withdrawals of deposits that have no contractual maturity.

&#160; Goldman Sachs March 2020 Form 10-Q 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Intraday Liquidity Model.

Our Intraday Liquidity Model measures our intraday liquidity needs using a scenario analysis characterized by the same qualitative elements as our Modeled Liquidity Outflow. The model assesses the risk of increased intraday liquidity requirements during a scenario where access to sources of intraday liquidity may become constrained.

Long-Term Stress Testing.

We utilize longer-term stress tests to take a forward view on our liquidity position through prolonged stress periods in which we experience a severe liquidity stress and recover in an environment that continues to be challenging. We are focused on ensuring conservative asset-liability management to prepare for a prolonged period of potential stress, seeking to maintain a diversified funding profile with an appropriate tenor, taking into consideration the characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets.

Resolution Liquidity Models.

In connection with our resolution planning efforts, we have established our Resolution Liquidity Adequacy and Positioning framework, which estimates liquidity needs of our major subsidiaries in a stressed environment. The liquidity needs are measured using our Modeled Liquidity Outflow assumptions and include certain additional inter-affiliate exposures. We have also established our Resolution Liquidity Execution Need framework, which measures the liquidity needs of our major subsidiaries to stabilize and wind-down following a Group Inc. bankruptcy filing in accordance with our preferred resolution strategy.

In addition, we have established a triggers and alerts framework, which is designed to provide the Board with information needed to make an informed decision on whether and when to commence bankruptcy proceedings for Group Inc. 

Limits 

We use liquidity risk limits at various levels and across liquidity risk types to manage the size of our liquidity exposures. Limits are measured relative to acceptable levels of risk given our liquidity risk tolerance. See &#8220;Overview and Structure of Risk Management&#8221; for information about the limit approval process. 

Limits are monitored by Treasury and Liquidity Risk. Liquidity Risk is responsible for identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded. 

GCLA and Unencumbered Metrics 

GCLA.

Based on the results of our internal liquidity risk models, described above, as well as our consideration of other factors, including, but not limited to, a qualitative assessment of our condition, as well as the financial markets, we believe our liquidity position as of both March 2020 and December 2019 was appropriate. We strictly limit our GCLA to a narrowly defined list of securities and cash because they are highly liquid, even in a difficult funding environment. We do not include other potential sources of excess liquidity in our GCLA, such as less liquid unencumbered securities or committed credit facilities.

The table below presents information about our GCLA.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

We maintain our GCLA to enable us to meet current and potential liquidity requirements of our parent company, Group Inc., and its subsidiaries. Our Modeled Liquidity Outflow and Intraday Liquidity Model incorporate a requirement for Group Inc., as well as a standalone requirement for each of our major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries. Funding IHC is required to provide the necessary liquidity to Group Inc. during the ordinary course of business, and is also obligated to provide capital and liquidity support to major subsidiaries in the event of our material financial distress or failure. Liquidity held directly in each of our major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries is intended for use only by that subsidiary to meet its liquidity requirements and is assumed not to be available to Group Inc. or Funding IHC unless (i) legally provided for and (ii) there are no additional regulatory, tax or other restrictions. In addition, the Modeled Liquidity Outflow and Intraday Liquidity Model also incorporate a broader assessment of standalone liquidity requirements for other subsidiaries and we hold a portion of our GCLA directly at Group Inc. or Funding IHC to support such requirements. 

Other Unencumbered Assets.

In addition to our GCLA, we have a significant amount of other unencumbered cash and financial instruments, including other government obligations, high-grade money market securities, corporate obligations, marginable equities, loans and cash deposits not included in our GCLA. The fair value of our unencumbered assets averaged $205.95 billion for the three months ended March 2020 and $206.01 billion for the three months ended December 2019. We do not consider these assets liquid enough to be eligible for our GCLA.

Liquidity Regulatory Framework 

As a bank holding company (BHC), we are subject to a minimum Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) under the LCR rule approved by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies. The LCR rule requires organizations to maintain an adequate ratio of eligible high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to expected net cash outflows under an acute short-term liquidity stress scenario. Eligible HQLA excludes HQLA held by subsidiaries that is in excess of their minimum requirement and is subject to transfer restrictions. We are required to maintain a minimum LCR of 100%. We expect that fluctuations in client activity, business mix and the market environment will impact our LCR. 

The table below presents information about our average daily LCR. 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

&#160; 

The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have issued a proposed rule that calls for a net stable funding ratio (NSFR) for large U.S. banking organizations. The proposal would require banking organizations to ensure they have access to stable funding over a one-year

time horizon and includes quarterly disclosure of the ratio and a description of the banking organization&#8217;s stable funding sources. We expect that we will be compliant with the NSFR requirement when it is effective.

The following provides information about our subsidiary liquidity regulatory requirements: 

&#160;

&#8226;

GS Bank USA.

GS Bank USA is subject to a minimum LCR of 100% under the LCR rule approved by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies. As of March 2020, GS Bank USA&#8217;s LCR exceeded the minimum requirement. The NSFR requirement described above would also apply to GS Bank USA. 

&#160;

&#8226;

GSI.

GSI is subject to a minimum LCR of 100% under the LCR rule approved by the U.K. regulatory authorities and the European Commission. GSI&#8217;s average monthly LCR for the trailing twelve-month period ended March 2020 exceeded the minimum requirement. 

&#160;

&#8226;

Other Subsidiaries.

We monitor local regulatory liquidity requirements of our subsidiaries to ensure compliance. For many of our subsidiaries, these requirements either have changed or are likely to change in the future due to the implementation of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision&#8217;s framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring, as well as other regulatory developments. 

The implementation of these rules and any amendments adopted by the regulatory authorities could impact our liquidity and funding requirements and practices in the future. 

Credit Ratings 

We rely on the short- and long-term debt capital markets to fund a significant portion of our day-to-day

operations and the cost and availability of debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings. Credit ratings are also important when we are competing in certain markets, such as OTC derivatives, and when we seek to engage in longer-term transactions. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Part I, Item 1A of the 2019 Form 10-K

for information about the risks associated with a reduction in our credit ratings.

We believe our credit ratings are primarily based on the credit rating agencies&#8217; assessment of: 

&#160;

&#8226;

Our liquidity, market, credit and operational risk management practices; 

&#160;

&#8226;

Our level and variability of earnings; 

&#160;

&#8226;

Our capital base; 

&#160;

&#8226;

Our franchise, reputation and management; 

&#160;

&#8226;

Our corporate governance; and 

&#160;

&#8226;

The external operating and economic environment, including, in some cases, the assumed level of government support or other systemic considerations, such as potential resolution. 

Certain of our derivatives have been transacted under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings. We manage our GCLA to ensure we would, among other potential requirements, be able to make the additional collateral or termination payments that may be required in the event of a two-notch 

reduction in our long-term credit ratings, as well as collateral that has not been called by counterparties, but is available to them.

See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about derivatives with credit-related contingent features and the additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements that could have been called by counterparties in the event of a one-

or two-notch 

downgrade in our credit ratings.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Cash Flows 

As a global financial institution, our cash flows are complex and bear little relation to our net earnings and net assets. Consequently, we believe that traditional cash flow analysis is less meaningful in evaluating our liquidity position than the liquidity and asset-liability management policies described above. Cash flow analysis may, however, be helpful in highlighting certain macro trends and strategic initiatives in our businesses. 

Three Months Ended March 2020.

Our cash and cash equivalents decreased by $28.06 billion to $105.49 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to net cash used for operating activities and investing activities, partially offset by net cash provided by financing activities. The net cash used for operating activities primarily reflected an increase in collateralized transactions (an increase in collateralized agreements and a decrease in collateralized financings) as a result of our activities and our clients&#8217; activities. The net cash used for investing activities primarily reflected an increase in corporate loans and net purchases of investments. The net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflected an increase in deposits, the issuance of unsecured long-term borrowings and an increase in other secured financings.

Three Months Ended March 2019.

Our cash and cash equivalents decreased by $42.66 billion to $87.88 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2019, primarily due to net cash used for operating activities. The net cash used for operating activities primarily reflected an increase in trading assets and collateralized transactions (an increase in collateralized agreements and a decrease in collateralized financings) as a result of our activities and our clients&#8217; activities.

Market Risk Management 

Overview 

Market risk is the risk of loss in the value of our inventory, investments, loans and other financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value due to changes in market conditions. We hold such positions primarily for market making for our clients and for our investing and financing activities, and therefore, these positions change based on client demands and our investment opportunities. Since these positions are accounted for at fair value, they fluctuate on a daily basis, with the related gains and losses included in the consolidated statements of earnings. We employ a variety of risk measures, each described in the respective sections below, to monitor market risk. Categories of market risk include the following: 

&#160;

&#8226;

Interest rate risk: results from exposures to changes in the level, slope and curvature of yield curves, the volatilities of interest rates, prepayment speeds and credit spreads; 

&#160;

&#8226;

Equity price risk: results from exposures to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities, baskets of equities and equity indices; 

&#160;

&#8226;

Currency rate risk: results from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of currency rates; and 

&#160;

&#8226;

Commodity price risk: results from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of commodities, such as crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas, electricity, and precious and base metals. 

Market Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our market risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses. 

Managers in revenue-producing units and Market Risk discuss market information, positions and estimated loss scenarios on an ongoing basis. Managers in revenue-producing units are accountable for managing risk within prescribed limits. These managers have in-depth

knowledge of their positions, markets and the instruments available to hedge their exposures.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Market Risk Management Process 

Our process for managing market risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the &#8220;Overview and Structure of Risk Management,&#8221; as well as the following: 

&#160;

&#8226;

Monitoring compliance with established market risk limits and reporting our exposures; &#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

Diversifying exposures; &#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

Controlling position sizes; and &#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

Evaluating mitigants, such as economic hedges in related securities or derivatives. &#160;

Our market risk management systems enable us to perform an independent calculation of Value-at-Risk

(VaR) and stress measures, capture risk measures at individual position levels, attribute risk measures to individual risk factors of each position, report many different views of the risk measures (e.g., by desk, business, product type or entity) and produce ad hoc analyses in a timely manner.

Risk Measures 

We produce risk measures and monitor them against established market risk limits. These measures reflect an extensive range of scenarios and the results are aggregated at product, business and firmwide levels. 

We use a variety of risk measures to estimate the size of potential losses for both moderate and more extreme market moves over both short- and long-term time horizons. Our primary risk measures are VaR, which is used for shorter-term periods, and stress tests. Our risk reports detail key risks, drivers and changes for each desk and business, and are distributed daily to senior management of both our revenue-producing units and our independent risk oversight and control functions. 

Value-at-Risk.

VaR is the potential loss in value due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level. For assets and liabilities included in VaR, see &#8220;Financial Statement Linkages to Market Risk Measures.&#8221; We typically employ a one-day 

time horizon with a 95% confidence level. We use a single VaR model, which captures risks including interest rates, equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices. As such, VaR facilitates comparison across portfolios of different risk characteristics. VaR also captures the diversification of aggregated risk at the firmwide level.

We are aware of the inherent limitations to VaR and therefore use a variety of risk measures in our market risk management process. Inherent limitations to VaR include: 

&#160;

&#8226;

VaR does not estimate potential losses over longer time horizons where moves may be extreme; &#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

VaR does not take account of the relative liquidity of different risk positions; and &#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

Previous moves in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of all future market moves. &#160;

To comprehensively capture our exposures and relevant risks in our VaR calculation, we use historical simulations with full valuation of market factors at the position level by simultaneously shocking the relevant market factors for that position. These market factors include spot prices, credit spreads, funding spreads, yield curves, volatility and correlation, and are updated periodically based on changes in the composition of positions, as well as variations in market conditions. We sample from five years of historical data to generate the scenarios for our VaR calculation. The historical data is weighted so that the relative importance of the data reduces over time. This gives greater importance to more recent observations and reflects current asset volatilities, which improves the accuracy of our estimates of potential loss. As a result, even if our positions included in VaR were unchanged, our VaR would increase with increasing market volatility and vice versa. 

Given its reliance on historical data, VaR is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. 

Our VaR measure does not include: 

&#160;

&#8226;

Positions that are best measured and monitored using sensitivity measures; and &#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

The impact of changes in counterparty and our own credit spreads on derivatives, as well as changes in our own credit spreads on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected. &#160;

&#160; 138

&#160;

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

We perform daily backtesting of our VaR model (i.e., comparing daily net revenues for positions included in VaR to the VaR measure calculated as of the prior business day) at the firmwide level and for each of our businesses and major regulated subsidiaries. 

Stress Testing.

Stress testing is a method of determining the effect of various hypothetical stress scenarios. We use stress testing to examine risks of specific portfolios, as well as the potential impact of our significant risk exposures. We use a variety of stress testing techniques to calculate the potential loss from a wide range of market moves on our portfolios, including firmwide stress tests, sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis. The results of our various stress tests are analyzed together for risk management purposes. See &#8220;Overview and Structure of Risk Management&#8221; for information about firmwide stress tests.

Sensitivity analysis is used to quantify the impact of a market move in a single risk factor across all positions (e.g., equity prices or credit spreads) using a variety of defined market shocks, ranging from those that could be expected over a one-day

time horizon up to those that could take many months to occur. We also use sensitivity analysis to quantify the impact of the default of any single entity, which captures the risk of large or concentrated exposures.

Scenario analysis is used to quantify the impact of a specified event, including how the event impacts multiple risk factors simultaneously. For example, for sovereign stress testing we calculate potential direct exposure associated with our sovereign positions, as well as the corresponding debt, equity and currency exposures associated with our non-sovereign

positions that may be impacted by the sovereign distress. When conducting scenario analysis, we often consider a number of possible outcomes for each scenario, ranging from moderate to severely adverse market impacts. In addition, these stress tests are constructed using both historical events and forward-looking hypothetical scenarios.

Unlike VaR measures, which have an implied probability because they are calculated at a specified confidence level, there may not be an implied probability that our stress testing scenarios will occur. Instead, stress testing is used to model both moderate and more extreme moves in underlying market factors. When estimating potential loss, we generally assume that our positions cannot be reduced or hedged (although experience demonstrates that we are generally able to do so). 

Limits 

We use market risk limits at various levels to manage the size of our market exposures. These limits are set based on VaR and on a range of stress tests relevant to our exposures. See &#8220;Overview and Structure of Risk Management&#8221; for information about the limit approval process. 

Market Risk is responsible for monitoring these limits, and identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded (e.g., due to positional changes or changes in market conditions, such as increased volatilities or changes in correlations). Such instances are remediated by a reduction in the positions we hold and/or a temporary or permanent increase to the limit. 

Metrics 

We analyze VaR at the firmwide level and a variety of more detailed levels, including by risk category, business and region. Diversification effect in the tables below represents the difference between total VaR and the sum of the VaRs for the four risk categories. This effect arises because the four market risk categories are not perfectly correlated. 

The table below presents our average daily VaR.

Our period-end

VaR increased to $123 million as of March 2020 from $57 million as of March 2019, due to increases in the interest rates, equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices categories, partially offset by an increase in the diversification effect. The overall increase was primarily due to higher levels of volatility.

During the three months ended March 2020 the firmwide VaR risk limit was exceeded on 10 occasions primarily due to higher levels of volatility and was not raised or reduced. During the year ended December 2019, the firmwide VaR risk limit was not exceeded, raised or reduced. 

The table below presents our high and low VaR.

Daily net revenues for positions included in VaR are compared with VaR calculated as of the end of the prior business day. Net losses incurred on a single day for such positions exceeded our 95% one-day

VaR (i.e., a VaR exception) on two occasions during the three months ended March 2020 and did not exceed our 95% one-day

VaR during the three months ended March 2019.

During periods in which we have significantly more positive net revenue days than net revenue loss days, we expect to have fewer VaR exceptions because, under normal conditions, our business model generally produces positive net revenues. In periods in which our franchise revenues are adversely affected, we generally have more loss days, resulting in more VaR exceptions. The daily net revenues for positions included in VaR used to determine VaR exceptions reflect the impact of any intraday activity, including bid/offer net revenues, which are more likely than not to be positive by their nature.

Equity positions relate to private and restricted public equity securities, including interests in funds that invest in corporate equities and real estate and interests in hedge funds. &#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

Debt positions include interests in funds that invest in corporate mezzanine and senior debt instruments, loans backed by commercial and residential real estate, corporate bank loans and other corporate debt, including acquired portfolios of distressed loans. &#160;

Credit and Funding Spread Sensitivity on Derivatives and Financial Liabilities.

VaR excludes the impact of changes in counterparty credit spreads, our own credit spreads and unsecured funding spreads on derivatives, as well as changes in our own credit spreads (debt valuation adjustment) on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected. The estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in credit spreads (counterparty and our own) and unsecured funding spreads on derivatives (including hedges) was a loss of $4 million as of March 2020 and $2 million as of December 2019. In addition, the estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in our own credit spreads on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected was a gain of $33 million as of March 2020 and $29 million as of December 2019. However, the actual net impact of a change in our own credit spreads is also affected by the liquidity, duration and convexity (as the sensitivity is not linear to changes in yields) of those financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected, as well as the relative performance of any hedges undertaken.

Interest Rate Sensitivity.

Loans accounted for at amortized cost were $111.47 billion as of March 2020 and $89.20 billion as of December 2019, substantially all of which had floating interest rates. The estimated sensitivity to a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on such loans was $872 million as of March 2020 and $681 million as of December 2019 of additional interest income over a twelve-month period, which does not take into account the potential impact of an increase in costs to fund such loans. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about loans accounted for at amortized cost.

Other Market Risk Considerations 

As of both March 2020 and December 2019, we had commitments and held loans for which we have obtained credit loss protection from Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about such lending commitments. 

In addition, we make investments in securities that are accounted for as available-for-sale,

held-to-maturity

or under the equity method which are included in investments in the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.

Direct investments in real estate are accounted for at cost less accumulated depreciation. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about other assets.

Credit Risk Management 

Overview 

Credit risk represents the potential for loss due to the default or deterioration in credit quality of a counterparty (e.g., an OTC derivatives counterparty or a borrower) or an issuer of securities or other instruments we hold. Our exposure to credit risk comes mostly from client transactions in OTC derivatives and loans and lending commitments. Credit risk also comes from cash placed with banks, securities financing transactions (i.e., resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending activities) and customer and other receivables. 

Credit Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our credit risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses. The Risk Governance Committee reviews and approves credit policies and parameters. In addition, we hold other positions that give rise to credit risk (e.g., bonds and secondary bank loans). These credit risks are captured as a component of market risk measures, which are monitored and managed by Market Risk. We also enter into derivatives to manage market risk exposures. Such derivatives also give rise to credit risk, which is monitored and managed by Credit Risk. 

Credit Risk Management Process 

Our process for managing credit risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the &#8220;Overview and Structure of Risk Management,&#8221; as well as the following: 

&#160;

&#8226;

Monitoring compliance with established credit risk limits and reporting our credit exposures and credit concentrations; &#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

Establishing or approving underwriting standards; &#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

Assessing the likelihood that a counterparty will default on its payment obligations; &#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

Measuring our current and potential credit exposure and losses resulting from a counterparty default; &#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

Using credit risk mitigants, including collateral and hedging; and &#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

Maximizing recovery through active workout and restructuring of claims. &#160;

We also perform credit reviews, which include initial and ongoing analyses of our counterparties. For substantially all of our credit exposures, the core of our process is an annual counterparty credit review. A credit review is an independent analysis of the capacity and willingness of a counterparty to meet its financial obligations, resulting in an internal credit rating. The determination of internal credit ratings also incorporates assumptions with respect to the nature of and outlook for the counterparty&#8217;s industry, and the economic environment. Senior personnel, with expertise in specific industries, inspect and approve credit reviews and internal credit ratings. 

Our risk assessment process may also include, where applicable, reviewing certain key metrics, including, but not limited to, delinquency status, collateral values, Fair Isaac Corporation credit scores and other risk factors.

&#160;

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Our credit risk management systems capture credit exposure to individual counterparties and on an aggregate basis to counterparties and their subsidiaries. These systems also provide management with comprehensive information about our aggregate credit risk by product, internal credit rating, industry, country and region. 

Risk Measures 

We measure our credit risk based on the potential loss in the event of non-payment

by a counterparty using current and potential exposure. For derivatives and securities financing transactions, current exposure represents the amount presently owed to us after taking into account applicable netting and collateral arrangements, while potential exposure represents our estimate of the future exposure that could arise over the life of a transaction based on market movements within a specified confidence level. Potential exposure also takes into account netting and collateral arrangements. For loans and lending commitments, the primary measure is a function of the notional amount of the position.

Stress Tests 

We conduct regular stress tests to calculate the credit exposures, including potential concentrations that would result from applying shocks to counterparty credit ratings or credit risk factors (e.g., currency rates, interest rates, equity prices). These shocks cover a wide range of moderate and more extreme market movements, including shocks to multiple risk factors, consistent with the occurrence of a severe market or economic event. In the case of sovereign default, we estimate the direct impact of the default on our sovereign credit exposures, changes to our credit exposures arising from potential market moves in response to the default, and the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties that may result from the sovereign default. Unlike potential exposure, which is calculated within a specified confidence level, stress testing does not generally assume a probability of these events occurring. We also perform firmwide stress tests. See &#8220;Overview and Structure of Risk Management&#8221; for information about firmwide stress tests. 

To supplement these regular stress tests, as described above, we also conduct tailored stress tests on an ad hoc basis in response to specific market events that we deem significant. We also utilize these stress tests to estimate the indirect impact of certain hypothetical events on our country exposures, such as the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties along with the shocks to the risk factors described above. The parameters of these shocks vary based on the scenario reflected in each stress test. We review estimated losses produced by the stress tests in order to understand their magnitude, highlight potential loss concentrations, and assess and mitigate our exposures where necessary. 

Limits 

We use credit risk limits at various levels, as well as underwriting standards to manage the size and nature of our credit exposures. Limits for industries and countries are based on our risk appetite and are designed to allow for regular monitoring, review, escalation and management of credit risk concentrations. See &#8220;Overview and Structure of Risk Management&#8221; for information about the limit approval process. 

Credit Risk is responsible for monitoring these limits, and identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded. 

Risk Mitigants 

To reduce our credit exposures on derivatives and securities financing transactions, we may enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. We may also reduce credit risk with counterparties by entering into agreements that enable us to obtain collateral from them on an upfront or contingent basis and/or to terminate transactions if the counterparty&#8217;s credit rating falls below a specified level. We monitor the fair value of the collateral to ensure that our credit exposures are appropriately collateralized. We seek to minimize exposures where there is a significant positive correlation between the creditworthiness of our counterparties and the market value of collateral we receive. 

For loans and lending commitments, depending on the credit quality of the borrower and other characteristics of the transaction, we employ a variety of potential risk mitigants. Risk mitigants include collateral provisions, guarantees, covenants, structural seniority of the bank loan claims and, for certain lending commitments, provisions in the legal documentation that allow us to adjust loan amounts, pricing, structure and other terms as market conditions change. The type and structure of risk mitigants employed can significantly influence the degree of credit risk involved in a loan or lending commitment. 

When we do not have sufficient visibility into a counterparty&#8217;s financial strength or when we believe a counterparty requires support from its parent, we may obtain third-party guarantees of the counterparty&#8217;s obligations. We may also mitigate our credit risk using credit derivatives or participation agreements.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Credit Exposures 

As of March 2020, our aggregate credit exposure increased as compared with December 2019, primarily reflecting an increase in OTC derivatives, receivables from clearing organizations and securities financing transactions, partially offset by a decrease in cash deposits with central banks. The percentage of our credit exposures arising from non-investment-grade

counterparties (based on our internally determined public rating agency equivalents) increased slightly as compared with December 2019, primarily reflecting an increase in non-investment-grade 

OTC derivatives. Our credit exposure to counterparties that defaulted during the three months ended March 2020 was higher as compared with our credit exposure to counterparties that defaulted during the same prior year period, and such exposure was primarily related to OTC derivatives. Our credit exposure to counterparties that defaulted during the three months ended March 2020 remained low, representing less than 0.5% of our total credit exposure. Estimated losses associated with these defaults have been recognized in earnings. Our credit exposures are described further below.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Our credit exposure on cash and cash equivalents arises from our unrestricted cash, and includes both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing 

deposits. To mitigate the risk of credit loss, we place substantially all of our deposits with highly rated banks and central banks.

The table below presents our credit exposure from unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, and the concentration by industry, region and credit quality.

OTC Derivatives.

Our credit exposure on OTC derivatives arises primarily from our market-making activities. As a market maker, we enter into derivative transactions to provide liquidity to clients and to facilitate the transfer and hedging of their risks. We also enter into derivatives to manage market risk exposures. We manage our credit exposure on OTC derivatives using the credit risk process, measures, limits and risk mitigants described above.

We generally enter into OTC derivatives transactions under bilateral collateral arrangements that require the daily exchange of collateral. As credit risk is an essential component of fair value, we include a credit valuation adjustment (CVA) in the fair value of derivatives to reflect counterparty credit risk, as described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. CVA is a function of the present value of expected exposure, the probability of counterparty default and the assumed recovery upon default. 

The table below presents our net credit exposure from OTC derivatives and the concentration by industry and region.

In the table above: 

&#160;

&#8226;

OTC derivative assets, included in the consolidated balance sheets, are reported on a net-by-counterparty 

basis (i.e., the net receivable for a given counterparty) when a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement (counterparty netting) and are accounted for at fair value, net of cash collateral received under enforceable credit support agreements (cash collateral netting). 

&#160;

&#8226;

Collateral represents cash collateral and the fair value of securities collateral, primarily U.S. and non-U.S. 

government and agency obligations, received under credit support agreements, that we consider when determining credit risk, but such collateral is not eligible for netting under U.S. GAAP.

Lending Activities.

We manage our lending activities using the credit risk process, measures, limits and risk mitigants described above. Other lending positions, including secondary trading positions, are risk-managed as a component of market risk.

&#160;

&#8226;

Commercial Lending.

Our commercial lending activities include lending to investment-grade and non-investment-grade

corporate borrowers. Loans and lending commitments associated with these activities are principally used for operating and general corporate purposes or in connection with contingent acquisitions. Corporate loans may be secured or unsecured, depending on the loan purpose, the risk profile of the borrower and other factors. Our commercial lending activities also include extending loans to borrowers that are secured by commercial and other real estate. 

The table below presents our credit exposure from commercial loans and lending commitments, and the concentration by industry, region and credit quality.

Wealth Management, Residential Real Estate and Other Lending.

We extend wealth management loans and lending commitments to private bank clients, substantially all of which are secured by commercial and residential real estate, securities or other assets. The fair value of the collateral received against such loans and lending commitments generally exceeds their carrying value.

Installment and Credit Card Lending.

We originate installment and credit card loans. Our credit exposure to installment loans was $4.83 billion as of March 2020 and $4.75 billion as of December 2019 and our credit exposure to credit card loans was $2.08 billion as of March 2020 and $1.86 billion as of December 2019. 

See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about U.S. state concentrations and the credit quality indicators of installment and credit card loans. 

Securities Financing Transactions.

We enter into securities financing transactions in order to, among other things, facilitate client activities, invest excess cash, acquire securities to cover short positions and finance certain activities. We bear credit risk related to resale agreements and securities borrowed only to the extent that cash advanced or the value of securities pledged or delivered to the counterparty exceeds the value of the collateral received. We also have credit exposure on repurchase agreements and securities loaned to the extent that the value of securities pledged or delivered to the counterparty for these transactions exceeds the amount of cash or collateral received. Securities collateral obtained for securities financing transactions primarily includes U.S. and non-U.S.

government and agency obligations.

The table above reflects both netting agreements and collateral that we consider when determining credit risk. 

Other Credit Exposures.

We are exposed to credit risk from our receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations and customers and counterparties. Receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations primarily consist of initial margin placed with clearing organizations and receivables related to sales of securities which have traded, but not yet settled. These receivables generally have minimal credit risk due to the low probability of clearing organization default and the short-term nature of receivables related to securities settlements. Receivables from customers and counterparties generally consist of collateralized receivables related to customer securities transactions and generally have minimal credit risk due to both the value of the collateral received and the short-term nature of these receivables.

The table above reflects collateral that we consider when determining credit risk. 

Selected Exposures 

We have credit and market exposures, as described below, that have had heightened focus due to recent events and broad market concerns. Credit exposure represents the potential for loss due to the default or deterioration in credit quality of a counterparty or borrower. Market exposure represents the potential for loss in value of our long and short positions due to changes in market prices. 

Country Exposures.

High inflation in Turkey combined with current account deficits and significant depreciation of the Turkish Lira has led to concerns about its economic stability. As of March 2020, our total credit exposure to Turkey was $1.52 billion, which was with non-sovereign 

counterparties or borrowers. Such exposure consisted of $1.10 billion related to OTC derivatives, $411 million related to loans and lending commitments and $12 million related to secured receivables. After taking into consideration the benefit of Turkish corporate and sovereign collateral and other risk mitigants provided by Turkish counterparties, our net credit exposure was $524 million. Our total market exposure to Turkey as of March 2020 was not material.

Liquidity pressures prompted the Argentine government to delay payment on certain debt obligations, and announce its intention to restructure most of its bonds, worsening the country&#8217;s economic distress. As of March 2020, our total credit exposure to Argentina was $182 million, which was with non-sovereign

counterparties or borrowers, and was primarily related to loans and lending commitments. Our total market exposure to Argentina as of March 2020 was not material.

The restructuring of Lebanon&#8217;s sovereign debt has led to concerns about its financial stability. As of March 2020, our total credit exposure to Lebanon was $210 million, substantially all of which related to loans and lending commitments with non-sovereign

borrowers. Our total market exposure to Lebanon as of March 2020 was not material.

Economic, social and political factors have led to concerns that Ecuador may default on its sovereign debt. As of March 2020, our total credit exposure to Ecuador was $792 million, which was with sovereign counterparties or borrowers. Such exposure consisted of $367 million related to loans and lending commitments and $425 million related to OTC derivatives. After taking into consideration the benefit of highly liquid collateral, our net credit exposure was $307 million. Our total market exposure to Ecuador as of March 2020 was not material. 

The potential restructuring of Zambia&#8217;s sovereign debt and significant depreciation of the Zambian kwacha has led to concerns about Zambia&#8217;s financial stability. As of March 2020, our total credit exposure to Zambia was $115 million and was related to loans and lending commitments with non-sovereign

borrowers. Our total market exposure to Zambia as of March 2020 was not material.

Venezuela has delayed payments on its sovereign debt and its political situation remains unclear. As of March 2020, our total credit and market exposure for Venezuela was not material.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

We have a comprehensive framework to monitor, measure and assess our country exposures and to determine our risk appetite. We determine the country of risk by the location of the counterparty, issuer or underlier&#8217;s assets, where they generate revenue, the country in which they are headquartered, the jurisdiction where a claim against them could be enforced, and/or the government whose policies affect their ability to repay their obligations. We monitor our credit exposure to a specific country both at the individual counterparty level, as well as at the aggregate country level. See &#8220;Stress Tests&#8221; for information about stress tests that are designed to estimate the direct and indirect impact of events involving the above countries. 

Industry Exposures.

The recent decline in oil prices has led to market concerns regarding the creditworthiness of certain companies in the oil and gas industry. As of March 2020, our credit exposure to oil and gas companies related to loans and lending commitments was $12.44 billion ($3.96 billion of loans and $8.48 billion of lending commitments). Such exposure included $6.81 billion of exposure to non-investment-grade

-grade counterparties. As of March 2020, our market exposure related to gaming and lodging companies was not material.

Concerns surrounding the COVID-19

pandemic have resulted in a sharp decline in travel which has significantly impacted the airline industry. As of March 2020, our credit exposure to airline companies related to loans and lending commitments was $2.81 billion ($1.88 billion of loans and $932 million of lending commitments). Such exposure included $2.37 billion of exposure to non-investment-grade

Operational Risk Management 

Overview 

Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or from external events. Our exposure to operational risk arises from routine processing errors, as well as extraordinary incidents, such as major systems failures or legal and regulatory matters. 

Potential types of loss events related to internal and external operational risk include: 

&#160;

&#8226;

Clients, products and business practices; &#160;

&#160;

Operational Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for developing and implementing a formalized framework for assessing, monitoring and managing operational risk with the goal of maintaining our exposure to operational risk at levels that are within our risk appetite. 

Operational Risk Management Process 

Our process for managing operational risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the &#8220;Overview and Structure of Risk Management,&#8221; including a comprehensive data collection process, as well as firmwide policies and procedures, for operational risk events. 

We combine top-down

and bottom-up

approaches to manage and measure operational risk. From a top-down 

perspective, our senior management assesses firmwide and business-level operational risk profiles. From a bottom-up 

perspective, our first and second lines of defense are responsible for risk identification and risk management on a day-to-day

basis, including escalating operational risks to senior management.

We maintain a comprehensive control framework designed to provide a well-controlled environment to minimize operational risks. The Firmwide Operational Risk and Resilience Committee is responsible for overseeing operational risk, and for ensuring our business and operational resilience. 

Our operational risk management framework is in part designed to comply with the operational risk measurement rules under the Capital Framework and has evolved based on the changing needs of our businesses and regulatory guidance. 

We have established policies that require all employees to report and escalate operational risk events. When operational risk events are identified, our policies require that the events be documented and analyzed to determine whether changes are required in our systems and/or processes to further mitigate the risk of future events. 

We use operational risk management applications to capture and organize operational risk event data and key metrics. One of our key risk identification and assessment tools is an operational risk and control self-assessment process, which is performed by our managers. This process consists of the identification and rating of operational risks, on a forward-looking basis, and the related controls. The results from this process are analyzed to evaluate operational risk exposures and identify businesses, activities or products with heightened levels of operational risk. 

Risk Measurement 

We measure our operational risk exposure using both statistical modeling and scenario analyses, which involve qualitative and quantitative assessments of internal and external operational risk event data and internal control factors for each of our businesses. Operational risk measurement also incorporates an assessment of business environment factors, including: 

&#160;

&#8226;

Evaluations of the complexity of our business activities; &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

The degree of automation in our processes; &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

New activity information; &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

The legal and regulatory environment; and &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

Changes in the markets for our products and services, including the diversity and sophistication of our customers and counterparties. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The results from these scenario analyses are used to monitor changes in operational risk and to determine business lines that may have heightened exposure to operational risk. These analyses are used in the determination of the appropriate level of operational risk capital to hold. We also perform firmwide stress tests. See &#8220;Overview and Structure of Risk Management&#8221; for information about firmwide stress tests.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Types of Operational Risks 

Increased reliance on technology and third-party relationships has resulted in increased operational risks, such as information and cyber security risk, third-party risk and business resilience risk. We manage those risks as follows: 

Information and Cyber Security Risk.

Information and cyber security risk is the risk of compromising the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our data and systems, leading to an adverse impact to us, our reputation, our clients and/or the broader financial system. We seek to minimize the occurrence and impact of unauthorized access, disruption or use of information and/or information systems. We deploy and operate preventive and detective controls and processes to mitigate emerging and evolving information security and cyber security threats, including monitoring our network for known vulnerabilities and signs of unauthorized attempts to access our data and systems. There is increased information risk through diversification of our data across external service providers, including use of a variety of cloud-provided or -hosted services and applications. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Part I, Item 1A of the 2019 Form 10-K

for further information about information and cyber security risk.

Third-Party Risk.

Third-party risk, including vendor risk, is the risk of an adverse impact due to reliance on third parties performing services or activities on our behalf. These risks may include legal, regulatory, information security, reputational, operational or any other risks inherent in engaging a third party. We identify, manage and report key third-party risks and conduct due diligence across multiple risk domains, including information security and cyber security, resilience and additional third-party dependencies. The Third-Party Risk Program monitors, reviews and reassesses third-party risks on an ongoing basis. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q and Part I, Item 1A of the 2019 Form 10-K

for further information about third-party risk.

Business Resilience Risk.

Business resilience risk is the risk of disruption to our critical processes. We monitor threats and assess risks and seek to ensure our state of readiness in the event of a significant operational disruption to the normal operations of our critical functions or their dependencies, such as, critical facilities, systems, third parties, data and/or personnel. We approach BCP through the lens of business and operational resilience. The resilience framework defines the fundamental principles for BCP and crisis management to ensure that critical functions can continue to operate in the event of a disruption. The business continuity program is comprehensive, consistent firmwide and up-to-date,

incorporating new information, techniques and technologies as and when they become available, and our resilience recovery plans incorporate and test specific and measurable recovery time objectives in accordance with local market best practices and regulatory requirements, and under specific scenarios. See &#8220;Regulatory and Other Matters &#8212; Other Matters&#8221; for information about the impact of the COVID-19

pandemic. See &#8220;Business &#8212; Business Continuity and Information Security&#8221; in Part I, Item 1 of the 2019 Form 10-K

for further information about business continuity.

Model Risk Management 

Overview 

Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions made based on model outputs that may be incorrect or used inappropriately. We rely on quantitative models across our business activities primarily to value certain financial assets and liabilities, to monitor and manage our risk, and to measure and monitor our regulatory capital. 

Model Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units, model developers, model owners and model users, and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our model risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses, and provides periodic updates to senior management, risk committees and the Risk Committee of the Board. 

Our model risk management framework is managed through a governance structure and risk management controls, which encompass standards designed to ensure we maintain a comprehensive model inventory, including risk assessment and classification, sound model development practices, independent review and model-specific usage controls. The Firmwide Model Risk Control Committee oversees our model risk management framework.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Model Review and Validation Process 

Model Risk consists of quantitative professionals who perform an independent review, validation and approval of our models. This review includes an analysis of the model documentation, independent testing, an assessment of the appropriateness of the methodology used, and verification of compliance with model development and implementation standards. 

We regularly refine and enhance our models to reflect changes in market or economic conditions and our business mix. All models are reviewed on an annual basis, and new models or significant changes to existing models and their assumptions are approved prior to implementation. 

The model validation process incorporates a review of models and trade and risk parameters across a broad range of scenarios (including extreme conditions) in order to critically evaluate and verify: 

&#160;

&#8226;

The model&#8217;s conceptual soundness, including the reasonableness of model assumptions, and suitability for intended use; &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

The testing strategy utilized by the model developers to ensure that the models function as intended; &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

The suitability of the calculation techniques incorporated in the model; &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

The model&#8217;s accuracy in reflecting the characteristics of the related product and its significant risks; &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

The model&#8217;s consistency with models for similar products; and &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

The model&#8217;s sensitivity to input parameters and assumptions. &#160;

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Cautionary Statement Pursuant to the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

We have included in this Form 10-Q,

and our management may make, statements that may constitute &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts or statements of current conditions, but instead represent only our beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside our control.

These statements may relate to, among other things, (i) our future plans and results, including our target ROE, ROTE, efficiency ratio and CET1 capital ratio, and how they can be achieved, 

(ii) various legal proceedings, governmental investigations or other contingencies as set forth in Notes 27 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q,

(iii) the results of stress tests, (iv) the objectives and effectiveness of our business continuity plan, information security program, risk management and liquidity policies, (v) our resolution plan and resolution strategy and their implications for stakeholders, (vi) the design and effectiveness of our resolution capital and liquidity models and triggers and alerts framework, (vii) trends in or growth opportunities for our businesses, including the timing and benefits of business and strategic initiatives and changes in and the importance of the efficiency ratio, (viii) the effect of changes to regulations, as well as our future status, activities or reporting under banking and financial regulation, (ix) our NSFR, (x) our level of future compensation expense as a percentage of operating expenses, (xi) our investment banking transaction backlog, (xii) our expected tax rate, (xiii) the future state of our liquidity and regulatory capital ratios, and our prospective capital distributions, (xiv) our expected interest income, (xv) our credit exposures, (xvi) our expected provisions for credit losses, (xvii) our preparations for Brexit, (xviii) the replacement of LIBOR and other IBORs and our program for the transition to alternative risk-free reference rates, (xix) the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses, (xx) the projected growth of our deposits and associated interest expense savings, (xxi) the projected growth of our installment loan and credit card businesses, (xxii) our business initiatives, including 

those related to transaction banking 

and new consumer financial products, (xxiii) our expense savings initiatives and increasing use of strategic locations, (xxiv) our planned 2020 parent vanilla debt issuances, (xxv) the amount of GCLA we expect to hold, (xxvi) our expected SCB and G-SIB

surcharge, 

(xxvii) the impact of the COVID-19

pandemic on our business, results, financial position and liquidity and (xxviii) expenses we may incur, including future litigation expense and those associated with investing in our installment lending, credit card and transaction banking activities.

By identifying these statements for you in this manner, we are alerting you to the possibility that our actual results, financial condition and liquidity may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results, financial condition and liquidity in these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our results, financial condition and capital actions to differ from those in these statements include, among others, those described below and in &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q 

and in Part I, Item 1A of the 2019 Form 10-K. 

Statements about our investment banking transaction backlog are subject to the risk that such transactions may be modified or may not be completed at all and related net revenues may not be realized or may be materially less than expected. Important factors that could have such a result include, for underwriting transactions, a decline or weakness in general economic conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities markets or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, for financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an inability to obtain adequate financing, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For information about other important factors that could adversely affect our investment banking transactions, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q

and in Part I, Item 1A of the 2019 Form 10-K. 

Statements about our future effective income tax rate are subject to the risk that it may differ from the anticipated rate indicated in such statements, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in our earnings mix, our profitability and entities in which we generate profits, the assumptions we have made in forecasting our expected tax rate, as well as guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. 

Statements about our NSFR and SCB are based on our current interpretation and expectations of the relevant proposal and final rule, and reflect significant assumptions about how our NSFR and SCB are calculated. Our actual NSFR will depend on the final rule and, for the SCB, the results of the applicable supervisory stress tests, and the methods used to calculate our NSFR and SCB may differ, possibly materially, from those used to calculate our NSFR and SCB for future disclosures.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Statements about the level of compensation expense, including as a percentage of operating expenses, and our efficiency ratio as our platform business initiatives reach scale are subject to the risks that the compensation and other costs to operate our businesses, including platform initiatives, may be greater than currently expected. 

Statements about our expected provisions for credit losses are subject to the risk that actual credit losses may differ and our expectations may change, possibly materially, from that currently anticipated due to, among other things, changes to the composition of our loan portfolio and changes in the economic environment in future periods and our forecasts of future economic conditions, as well as changes in our models, policies and other management judgments. 

Statements about the projected growth of our deposits and associated interest expense savings, and our installment loan and credit card businesses, are subject to the risk that actual growth may differ, possibly materially, from that currently anticipated due to, among other things, changes in interest rates and competition from other similar products. 

Statements about our target ROE, ROTE, efficiency ratio, and expense savings, and how they can be achieved, are based on our current expectations regarding our business prospects and are subject to the risk that we may be unable to achieve our targets due to, among other things, changes in our business mix, lower profitability of new business initiatives, increases in technology and other costs to launch and bring new business initiatives to scale, and increases in liquidity requirements. 

Statements about our target ROE, ROTE and CET1 capital ratio, and how they can be achieved, are based on our current expectations regarding the capital requirements applicable to us and are subject to the risk that our actual capital requirements may be higher than currently anticipated because of, among other factors, changes in the regulatory capital requirements applicable to us resulting from changes in regulations or the interpretation or application of existing regulations or changes in the nature and composition of our activities. 

Statements about the timing, costs and benefits of business and expense savings initiatives, the level and composition of more durable revenues and increases in market share are based on our current expectations regarding our ability to implement these initiatives and actual results may differ, possibly materially, from current expectations due to, among other things, a delay in the timing of these initiatives, increased competition and an inability to reduce expenses and grow businesses with durable revenues. 

Statements about planned 2020 parent vanilla debt issuances and the amount of GCLA we expect to hold are subject to the risk that actual issuances and GCLA levels may differ, possibly materially, from that currently expected due to changes in market conditions, business opportunities or our funding and projected liquidity needs. 

Statements about the future state of our liquidity and regulatory capital ratios, as well as our prospective capital distributions, are subject to the risk that our actual liquidity, regulatory capital ratios and capital distributions may differ, possibly materially, from what is currently expected due to, among other things, the need to use capital to support clients, increased regulatory requirements and changes to the composition of our balance sheet.
