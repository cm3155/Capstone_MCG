2023 OVERVIEW

Comerica  Incorporated  (the  Corporation)  is  a  financial  holding  company  headquartered  in  Dallas,  Texas.  The  Corporation's  major  business
segments are the Commercial Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. Information about the activities of the Corporation's business segments is
provided in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements.

As a financial institution, the Corporation's principal activity is lending to and accepting deposits from businesses and individuals. The primary
source of revenue is net interest income, which is principally derived from the difference between interest earned on loans and investment securities and
interest paid on deposits and other funding sources. The Corporation also provides other products and services that meet the financial needs of customers
which generate noninterest income, the Corporation's secondary source of revenue. Growth in loans, deposits and noninterest income is affected by many
factors, including economic conditions in the markets the Corporation serves, the financial requirements and economic health of customers and the ability
to  add  new  customers  and/or  increase  the  number  of  products  used  by  current  customers.  Success  in  providing  products  and  services  depends  on  the
financial needs of customers and the types of products desired.

The accounting and reporting policies of the Corporation and its subsidiaries conform to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the
United States (U.S.). The Corporation's consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant
of  which  are  described  in  Note  1  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  When  necessary,  the  Corporation  uses  reasonable  assumptions  to  develop
estimates that affect the consolidated results of operations. The most critical of these estimates are discussed in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section
of this financial review.

Full-Year 2023 compared to Full-Year 2022

• Net income decreased $270 million to $881 million, driven by increases in noninterest expenses and provision for credit losses, partially offset by

an increase in net interest income due to higher short-term rates and loan growth.
• Diluted net income per common share was $6.44 in 2023 compared to $8.47 in 2022.
• Average loans increased $3.4 billion, or 7 percent, to $53.9 billion, and included increases in Commercial Real Estate, National Dealer Services,
Corporate  Banking,  Wealth  Management  and  Environmental  Services,  partially  offset  by  declines  in  Mortgage  Banker  Finance  related  to  the
planned exit from this line of business and Equity Fund Services.

• Average securities decreased $1.6 billion, or 8 percent, to $17.4 billion, reflecting unrealized losses and maturities of Treasury securities, partially

offset by the full-year impact of mortgage-backed securities purchased during 2022.

• Average deposits decreased $9.5 billion, or 13 percent, to $66.0 billion. Average noninterest-bearing deposits, which decreased $11.1 billion, or 27
percent, were impacted by customer diversification efforts following the banking industry disruption in the first quarter of 2023, partially offset by
an increase in average interest-bearing deposits of $1.7 billion, or 5 percent, primarily due to increases in brokered time deposits and customer
certificates of deposit.

• Average short-term borrowings increased $6.8 billion to $7.2 billion, while average medium- and long-term debt increased $3.0 billion to $5.8

billion, reflecting higher Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances.

• Net interest income increased $48 million to $2.5 billion, and the net interest margin increased 4 basis points to 3.06 percent, largely due to higher

•

short-term rates and average loan growth, partly offset by an increase in average borrowings and interest-bearing deposits.
The  provision  for  credit  losses  increased  $29  million  to  $89  million,  reflecting  average  loan  growth,  an  uncertain  economic  outlook  and  credit
migration, as well as changes in portfolio composition.

• Noninterest  income  increased  $10  million  to  $1.1  billion,  reflecting  increases  in  deferred  compensation  asset  returns  (offset  in  noninterest
expenses), FHLB stock dividends, brokerage fees, card fees, commercial lending fees and letter of credit fees, partially offset by decreases in risk
management hedging income, service charges on deposit accounts and capital markets income.

• Noninterest expenses increased $361 million to $2.4 billion, primarily due to increases in FDIC insurance expense, salaries and benefits expense,
non-salary pension expense, outside processing fee expense, litigation and regulatory-related expenses, consulting fees, software expense and legal
fees, partially offset by gains on the sale of real estate during the current year.
The Corporation declared common dividends of $2.84 per share, returning $375 million to common shareholders. Additionally, the Corporation
declared $23 million in preferred dividends.

•

The  following  provides  a  comparative  discussion  of  the  Corporation's  consolidated  results  of  operations  for  2023  compared  to  2022.  A
comparative discussion of results for 2022 compared to 2021 is provided in the "Results of Operations" section beginning on page F-3 of the Corporation's
2022 Annual Report.

Impact of other portfolio dynamics and interest rate swaps reflected as part of rate impact, rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume.

Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities. Gains and losses related to risk management
interest rate swaps that convert fixed rate debt to a floating rate and qualify as fair value hedges are included in interest expense on medium- and long-term
debt. Additionally, the portion of gains and losses on risk management interest rate swaps that convert variable-rate loans to fixed rates through cash flow
hedges that relate to the earnings effect of the hedged loans during the period are included in loan interest income.

Refer to the Analysis of Net Interest Income and the Rate/Volume Analysis tables above for an analysis of net interest income for the years ended
December  31,  2023,  2022  and  2021  and  details  of  the  components  of  the  change  in  net  interest  income  for  2023  compared  to  2022  as  well  as  2022
compared to 2021.

Net interest income was $2.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $48 million compared to the year ended December 31,
2022. The increase in net interest income reflected the net benefit from higher short-term rates and loan growth, partially offset by increased balances of
interest-bearing deposits and borrowings. Net interest margin increased 4 basis points to 3.06 percent for the year ended December 31, 2023, reflecting
higher short-term rates, partially offset by higher- cost funding sources.

Average earning assets of $79.2 billion were relatively stable compared to the prior year and included $3.4 billion in loan growth, partially offset
by  declines  of  $1.8  billion  in  interest-bearing  deposits  with  banks  and  $1.6  billion  in  investment  securities.  Average  interest-bearing  funding  sources
increased  $11.5  billion,  driven  by  increases  of  $6.8  billion  in  short-term  borrowings,  $3.0  billion  in  medium-  and  long-term  debt  and  $1.7  billion  in
interest-bearing deposits.

The Corporation utilizes various asset and liability management strategies to manage net interest income exposure to interest rate risk. Refer to the
“Market and Liquidity Risk” section of this financial review for additional information regarding the Corporation's asset and liability management policies
and the “Balance Sheet and Capital Funds Analysis” section for further discussion on changes in earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.

Provision for Credit Losses

The provision for credit losses increased $29 million to $89 million, reflecting average loan growth, an uncertain economic outlook and credit
migration, as well as changes in portfolio composition. Net loan charge-offs increased $5 million to $22 million, or 0.04 percent of average total loans for
the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $17 million, or 0.03 percent of average total loans for the year ended December 31, 2022, with net charge-
offs in Corporate Banking, Business Banking and Technology and Life Sciences partially offset by net recoveries in general Middle Market. The provision
for  credit  losses  on  lending-related  commitments  was  a  benefit  of  $11  million  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2023,  compared  to  an  expense  of  $21
million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

An analysis of the allowance for credit losses and a summary of nonperforming assets are presented under the "Credit Risk" subheading in the
"Risk Management" section of this financial review. For information regarding methodology used in the determination of allowance for credit losses, refer

(a) 2023 results include changes in presentation consistent with contractual terms with new investment program partner resulting in a net $2 million increase to brokerage
fees  with  corresponding  decreases  of  $2  million  each  in  fiduciary  income,  other  noninterest  income  and  commission  costs  (recorded  within  salaries  and  benefits
expense).

(b) Effective January 1, 2023, the Corporation reported derivative income, syndication agent fees (previously a component of commercial lending fees) and investment
banking fees (previously a component of other noninterest income) as a combined item captioned by capital markets income on the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Beginning with fourth quarter 2023, risk management hedging income (previously a component of other noninterest income) was presented as a separate item on the
Consolidated Statements of Income. Prior periods have been adjusted to conform to this presentation, and the changes do not impact total noninterest income.

(c) The table below provides further details on certain categories included in other noninterest income.

Noninterest income increased $10 million to $1.1 billion, reflecting increases in other noninterest income, brokerage fees, card fees, commercial
lending  fees  and  letter  of  credit  fees,  partially  offset  by  decreases  in  risk  management  hedging  income,  service  charges  on  deposit  accounts  and  capital
markets  income.  Other  noninterest  income  included  increases  in  deferred  compensation  asset  returns  (offset  in  noninterest  expenses)  and  FHLB  stock
dividends.

Brokerage  fees  are  commissions  earned  for  facilitating  securities  transactions  for  customers  as  well  as  other  brokerage  services  provided.  In
November  2023,  the  Corporation  transitioned  support  of  its  retail  brokerage  business,  including  specific  insurance,  brokerage  and  investment  advisory
activities previously conducted by the Corporation's broker-dealer subsidiary, to Ameriprise Financial Institutions Group, an independent financial services
broker. Since this transition, brokerage fees include income from sales of select investment products of an independent financial services broker, net of
commissions passed through to employees licensed by the independent broker to sell their products. Brokerage fees increased $9 million, or 47 percent,
reflecting the impact of the Corporation's new investment program partner as well as increased money market funds revenue related to higher short-term
rates as well as elevated transactional revenue for personal trusts.

Card  fees  consist  primarily  of  interchange  and  other  fee  income  earned  on  government  prepaid  card,  commercial  card,  debit/Automated  Teller
Machine  (ATM)  card  and  merchant  payment  processing  services.  Card  fees  increased  $7  million,  or  2  percent,  reflecting  higher  processing  volumes  in
merchant services and ATM network bonuses, partially offset by a one-time government card vendor incentive received in 2022.

Commercial lending fees include fees assessed on the unused portion of lines of credit (unused commitment fees) and loan servicing fees. These

fees increased $4 million, or 6 percent, driven by higher commitment fees from growth in loan

F-6

Table of Contents

commitments,  partially  offset  by  a  decrease  in  Mortgage  Banker  Finance  service  charges  due  to  the  mostly  completed  planned  exit  from  this  line  of
business.

Letter of credit fees increased $4 million, or 11 percent, reflecting an increase in standby letters of credit activity.

Risk management hedging income declined $50 million, resulting from a $91 million net loss related to Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index
(BSBY) cessation, which was partially offset by a $41 million increase in price alignment income received on collateral posted for centrally cleared risk
management positions. Refer to the "BSBY Cessation" subheading in the "Market and Liquidity Risk" section of this financial review, as well as Note 8 to
the consolidated financial statements, for further discussion of de-designated interest rate hedges.

Service charges on deposit accounts consist primarily of charges on retail and business accounts, including fees for treasury management services.
Service charges on deposit accounts decreased $10 million, or 5 percent, reflecting declines in volume-based deposit fees and the elimination of certain
consumer account fees as well as an increase in earnings credit allowances provided to customers that reduced their service charges.

Capital markets income consists of net gains and losses recognized on customer-initiated derivative instruments, net of the impact of offsetting
positions, syndication agent fees, investment banking fees and merger and acquisition advisory fees. Capital markets income decreased $7 million, or 5
percent, primarily due to unfavorable credit valuation adjustments, lower interest rate and energy derivative income and a decline in syndication agent fees,
partially offset by increases in advisory fees and foreign exchange derivative income.

Other  noninterest  income  increased  $52  million,  as  detailed  below,  driven  by  increases  in  deferred  compensation  asset  returns  (offset  in

noninterest expenses) and FHLB stock dividends due to higher rates and additional stock acquired during the year.

Noninterest expenses increased $361 million to $2.4 billion, primarily due to increases in FDIC insurance expense, salaries and benefits expense,

other noninterest expenses, outside processing fee expenses and software expense.

FDIC  insurance  expense  increased  $149  million,  reflecting  $109  million  in  additional  expense  resulting  from  the  FDIC  Board  of  Directors'
November 2023 approval of a special assessment to recover the loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) following the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and
Signature Bank. In February 2024, the FDIC indicated that it now expects a larger loss to the DIF than originally estimated and that it plans to provide
institutions with an updated estimate of their total special assessment amount with its first quarter 2024 special assessment invoice, to be released in June
2024. This updated special assessment total may result in additional FDIC expense to be recorded later this year.

Salaries and benefits expense increased $98 million, or 8 percent, reflecting increases from annual merit increases and staff additions, temporary

labor and deferred compensation expense (offset in other noninterest income), partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation.

Other  noninterest  expenses  increased  $80  million,  or  95  percent,  including  increases  in  non-salary  pension  expense,  litigation  and  regulatory-
related  expenses,  consulting  fees  and  legal  fees,  partially  offset  by  a  net  gain  on  fixed  asset  disposals,  which  included  gains  on  real  estate  and  asset
impairments.

Outside processing fee expense increased $26 million, or 10 percent, reflecting an increase in state program costs and data processing conversion

costs, partially offset by lower card fulfillment fees and a decline in volume of government card transactions tied to card fee revenues.

Software expenses increased $10 million, or 6 percent, driven by higher cloud computing costs and an increase in rental and maintenance fees.

The  above  detail  includes  expenses  for  certain  modernization  initiatives  related  to  the  transformation  of  the  retail  banking  delivery  model,
alignment of corporate facilities and optimization of technology platforms. Modernization-related expenses totaled $6 million during 2023, compared to
$38 million during 2022, and were comprised of transitional real estate costs (reported in occupancy expense), severance and contract labor (reported in
salaries and benefits expense) as well as gains on sale of real estate assets, asset impairments and contract termination costs (reported in other noninterest
expenses).  The  above  detail  also  includes  $25  million  of  severance  costs  during  2023  related  to  expense  recalibration  initiatives  intended  to  enhance
earnings power and create capacity for strategic and risk management initiatives.

Income Taxes and Related Items

The  provision  for  income  taxes  was  $263  million  in  2023,  compared  to  $325  million  in  2022.  Net  deferred  tax  assets  were  $1.0  billion  at
December 31, 2023, compared to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for information about the
components of net deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets of $1.3 billion were evaluated for realization and it was determined that a valuation allowance of
$6  million  for  federal  foreign  tax  credits  and  certain  state  net  operating  loss  (NOL)  carryforwards  was  needed  at  December  31,  2023.  For  further
information on the Corporation’s valuation policy for deferred tax assets, refer to Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements.

STRATEGIC LINES OF BUSINESS

The Corporation has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments: the Commercial Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth
Management. These business segments are differentiated based on the type of customer and the related products and services provided. In addition to the
three  major  business  segments,  the  Finance  Division  is  also  reported  as  a  segment.  The  Other  category  includes  items  not  directly  associated  with  the
business segments or the Finance segment. The performance of the business segments is not comparable with the Corporation's consolidated results and is
not  necessarily  comparable  with  similar  information  for  any  other  financial  institution.  Additionally,  because  of  the  interrelationships  of  the  various
segments,  the  information  presented  is  not  indicative  of  how  the  segments  would  perform  if  they  operated  as  independent  entities.  Note  22  to  the
consolidated financial statements describes the Corporation's segment reporting methodology as well as the business activities of each business segment
and presents financial results of the business segments for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.

The  Corporation's  management  accounting  system  assigns  balance  sheet  and  income  statement  items  to  each  segment  using  certain
methodologies, which are regularly reviewed and refined. These methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and
changes occur in the organizational structure and/or product lines.

Net interest income for each segment reflects the interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities
plus  the  net  impact  from  associated  internal  funds  transfer  pricing  (FTP)  funding  credits  and  charges.  The  FTP  methodology  allocates  credits  to  each
business segment for deposits and other funds provided as well as charges for loans and other assets being funded. FTP crediting rates on deposits and other
funds provided reflect the long-term value of deposits and other funding sources based on their implied maturities. Due to the longer-term nature of implied
maturities, FTP crediting rates are generally less volatile than changes in interest rates observed in the market. FTP charge rates for funding loans and other
assets  reflect  a  matched  cost  of  funds  based  on  the  pricing  and  duration  characteristics  of  the  assets.  As  a  result  of  applying  matched  funding,  interest
revenue for each segment resulting from loans and other assets is generally not impacted by changes in interest rates. Therefore, net interest income for
each segment primarily reflects the volume of loans and other earning assets at the spread over the matched cost of funds, as well as the volume of deposits
at the associated FTP crediting rates. Generally, in periods of rising interest rates, FTP charge rates for funding loans and FTP crediting rates on deposits
will increase, with FTP crediting rates for deposits typically repricing at a slower pace than FTP charge rates for funding loans.

The following table presents net income (loss) by business segment.

Average  loans  increased  $3.0  billion  and  included  increases  in  Commercial  Real  Estate,  National  Dealer  Services,  Corporate  Banking  and
Environmental Services, partially offset by decreases in Mortgage Banker Finance related to planned exit from this business and Equity Fund Services.
Average deposits decreased $9.6 billion, with declines in all deposit categories reflecting customer diversification efforts following the banking industry
disruption in the first quarter of 2023. This decline was primarily driven by decreases in noninterest-bearing and money market deposits, with the largest
declines in general Middle Market, Technology and Life Sciences, Business Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Corporate Banking and National Dealer
Services.

The Commercial Bank's net income increased $59 million to $1.1 billion. Net interest income increased $290 million due to increased loan income
as well as higher FTP crediting rates on deposits related to the increase in short-term interest rates, partially offset by higher allocated net FTP charges. The
provision for credit losses increased $58 million to $90 million, reflecting loan growth, an uncertain economic outlook and credit migration. Net credit-
related  charge-offs  were  $20  million,  relatively  stable  compared  to  the  prior  year,  with  net  charge-offs  in  Corporate  Banking,  Business  Banking  and
Technology and Life Sciences partially offset by net recoveries in general Middle Market. Noninterest income decreased $4 million, primarily due to lower
capital  markets  income  and  service  charges  on  deposit  accounts,  partially  offset  by  higher  securities  trading  income  and  commercial  lending  fees.
Noninterest expenses increased $142 million, primarily reflecting increases in FDIC insurance expense (related to special assessment), salaries and benefits
expense and outside processing fee expense.

million,  primarily  due  to  higher  FTP  crediting  rates  on  deposits.  Noninterest  income  was  relatively  stable,  while  noninterest  expenses  increased  $38
million, primarily due to increases in FDIC insurance expense (related to special assessment), partially offset by decreases in occupancy and consulting

Average deposits, which primarily consist of centrally-managed brokered time deposits fully insured by the FDIC, increased $3.7 billion. Net loss
for  the  Finance  and  Other  category  increased  $410  million  to  $501  million.  Net  interest  expense  increased  $417  million  to  $591  million,  reflecting  the
impact of interest rate swaps (which are centrally managed) as well as increased balances from higher-cost funding sources. Noninterest income increased
$8 million to $49 million, primarily due to higher investment fees and FHLB stock dividends, partially offset by a decrease in risk management hedging
income  (BSBY  cessation).  Noninterest  expenses  increased  $127  million,  reflecting  higher  salaries  and  benefits  expense  and  FDIC  insurance  expense
(special assessment), partially offset by gains on the sale of real estate.

Average total loans increased $3.4 billion to $53.9 billion in 2023, compared to $50.5 billion in 2022, which included a $2.2 billion increase in
Commercial  Real  Estate,  which  generally  serves  real  estate  developers  and  investors.  National  Dealer  Services,  which  provides  floor  plan  inventory
financing  and  commercial  mortgages  to  auto  dealerships,  increased  by  $1.1  billion,  while  Corporate  Banking,  which  serves  companies  with  revenues
generally over $500 million, increased by $516 million. These increases were partially offset by a $634 million decline in Mortgage Banker Finance due to
the mostly completed planned exit from this line of business.

securities portfolio was approximately 5.5 years. On an average basis, investment securities decreased $1.6 billion to $17.4 billion in 2023, compared to
$19.0 billion in 2022, primarily due to unrealized losses and maturities of Treasury securities.

Interest-Bearing Deposits with Banks and Other Short-Term Investments

Interest-bearing deposits with banks, which are mostly used to manage liquidity requirements of the Corporation, primarily include deposits with
the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) and also include deposits with banks in developed countries or international banking facilities of foreign banks located in
the United States. On a period-end basis, interest-bearing deposits with banks increased $3.5 billion to $8.1 billion at December 31, 2023. On an average
basis, interest-bearing deposits with banks decreased $1.8 billion to $7.5 billion in 2023.

Other short-term investments include federal funds sold, trading securities, money market investments and loans held-for-sale. Substantially all
trading securities are deferred compensation plan assets. Loans held-for-sale include variable-rate demand notes for which the Corporation has purchased
the  underlying  bonds  as  well  as  residential  mortgage  loans  originated  with  management's  intention  to  sell  and,  from  time  to  time,  other  loans  that  are
transferred to held-for-sale. On a period-end basis, other short-term investments increased $242 million to $399 million at December 31, 2023, which was
driven by the above-referenced variable-rate demand notes. On an average basis, other short-term investments increased $165 million to $339 million in
2023.

On a period-end basis, total deposits decreased $4.6 billion to $66.8 billion at December 31, 2023, compared to $71.4 billion at December 31,

2022, reflecting a decrease of $12.1 billion in noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a $7.5 billion increase in interest-bearing deposits.

Uninsured deposits are defined as the portion of deposit accounts in U.S. offices that exceed the FDIC insurance limit and amounts in any other
uninsured investment or deposit account that are classified as deposits and are not subject to any federal or state deposit insurance regimes. Total uninsured
deposits were $31.5 billion and $45.5 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, as calculated per regulatory guidance. The portion of domestic
time  deposits  in  excess  of  insurance  limits  was  $797  million  and  $370  million  at  December  31,  2023  and  2022,  respectively.  Time  deposits  otherwise
uninsured, which consist of foreign office time deposits and all mature in three months or less, totaled $13 million at December 31, 2023, compared to $51
million at December 31, 2022.

On  a  period-end  basis,  short-term  borrowings  totaled  $3.6  billion  at  December  31,  2023,  compared  to  $3.2  billion  at  December  31,  2022,  and
included federal funds purchased and short-term Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances. On a period-end basis, total medium- and long-term debt
totaled $6.2 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of $3.2 billion from $3.0 billion at December 31, 2022. The Corporation uses medium- and long-
term debt, which includes medium- and long-term senior notes, subordinated notes and FHLB advances, to provide funding for earning assets, liquidity and
regulatory capital.

Average  deposits  decreased  $9.5  billion  to  $66.0  billion  in  2023,  compared  to  $75.5  billion  in  2022,  reflecting  an  $11.1  billion  decrease  in
noninterest-bearing  deposits,  partially  offset  by  a  $1.7  billion  increase  in  interest-bearing  deposits.  The  decline  in  noninterest-bearing  deposits  reflected
customer diversification efforts following the banking industry disruption in the first quarter of 2023 as well as a shift in deposit mix from noninterest-
bearing to interest-bearing due to the current higher interest rate environment, while the increase in interest-bearing deposits was primarily due to increases
in brokered time deposits and customer certificates of deposit.

Average short-term borrowings increased by $6.8 billion to $7.2 billion in 2023, compared to $436 million in 2022, while average medium- and
long-term debt increased $3.0 billion to $5.8 billion in 2023, compared to $2.8 billion in 2022, primarily driven by FHLB advances, partially offset by $850
million  in  senior  notes  that  matured  in  the  third  quarter  of  2023.  Further  information  on  medium-  and  long-term  debt  is  provided  in  Note  12  to  the

Corporation's repurchase program.

Since the inception of the Corporation's share repurchase program in 2010, a total of 97.2 million shares have been authorized for repurchase.
There is no expiration date for the share repurchase program. Management is not currently engaged in repurchasing shares and will continue to monitor
various factors, including the Corporation's earnings generation, capital needs to fund future loan growth, regulatory changes and market conditions, before
resuming the share repurchase program.

The Corporation continues to target a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio of approximately 10 percent with active capital management. At

December 31, 2023, the Corporation's CET1 capital ratio was 11.09 percent, a increase of 109 basis points compared to December 31, 2022.

The  Corporation  is  subject  to  the  capital  adequacy  standards  under  the  Basel  III  regulatory  framework  (Basel  III).  This  regulatory  framework
establishes comprehensive methodologies for calculating regulatory capital and risk-weighted assets (RWA). Basel III also set minimum capital ratios as
well as overall capital adequacy standards.

Under  Basel  III,  regulatory  capital  comprises  CET1  capital,  additional  Tier  1  capital  and  Tier  2  capital.  CET1  capital  predominantly  includes
common  shareholders'  equity,  less  certain  deductions  for  goodwill,  intangible  assets  and  deferred  tax  assets  that  arise  from  net  operating  losses  and  tax
credit  carry-forwards.  Additionally,  the  Corporation  has  elected  to  permanently  exclude  capital  in  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  (AOCI)
related to debt classified as available-for-sale as well as for cash flow hedges and defined benefit postretirement plans from CET1, an option available to
standardized approach entities under Basel III. Tier 1 capital incrementally includes noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital includes Tier 1
capital as well as subordinated debt qualifying as Tier 2 and qualifying allowance for credit losses.

Table of Contents

The Corporation computes RWA using the standardized approach. Under the standardized approach, RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-
weightings which vary by counterparty type and asset class. Under the Basel III standardized approach, capital is required for credit risk RWA, to cover the
risk of unexpected losses due to failure of a customer or counterparty to meet its financial obligations in accordance with contractual terms; and if trading
assets and liabilities exceed certain thresholds, capital is also required for market risk RWA, to cover the risk of losses due to adverse market movements or
from position-specific factors.

At December 31, 2023, the Corporation and its U.S. banking subsidiaries exceeded the capital ratios required for an institution to be considered
“well  capitalized”  by  the  standards  developed  under  the  Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation  Improvement  Act  of  1991.  Refer  to  Note  20  to  the
consolidated financial statements for further discussion of regulatory capital requirements, capital ratio calculations and restrictions on the ability of the
Corporation's banking subsidiaries to transfer assets to the Corporation.

The common shareholders' equity ratio increased 140 basis points to 7.00 percent at December 31, 2023, primarily due to lower unrealized losses
on  investment  securities  available-for-sale  and  the  Corporation's  cash  flow  hedge  portfolio.  The  unrealized  losses  in  the  Corporation's  available-for-sale
investment security portfolio, which are due to market valuations since the time of initial acquisition, are not expected to be realized. The tangible common
equity  ratio,  which  excludes  goodwill  and  other  intangible  assets,  increased  141  basis  points  to  6.30  percent  for  the  same  reasons  discussed  above.
Common shareholders' equity included $3.0 billion in accumulated other comprehensive losses, with approximately $2.3 billion of those losses relating to
balances  recorded  in  total  assets,  comprised  of  valuation  adjustments  to  available-for-sale  securities  and  pension  assets,  as  well  as  related  deferred  tax
assets. These amounts impacted the common shareholders' equity ratio by 328 basis points; the impact on the tangible common equity ratio using the same
calculation method was 332 basis points.

Basel III Endgame Framework

On July 27, 2023, the federal banking agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking, commonly referred to as Basel III Endgame (the Capital
Proposal) that would significantly increase the capital requirements applicable to large banking organizations with total assets of $100 billion or more. The
Capital Proposal would align the regulatory capital calculation and the calculation of risk-weighted assets across large banking organizations subject to the
Capital Proposal and require Category III and IV banking organizations to include most components of AOCI, including net unrealized gains and losses on
available-for-sale  securities,  in  their  regulatory  capital  ratios.  The  Capital  Proposal  is  subject  to  a  public  comment  period,  which  ended  on  January  16,
2024, and, if adopted, would include a three-year transition period beginning July 1, 2025. As of December 31, 2023, the Corporation had total assets of
$85.8  billion.  While  the  Capital  Proposal  would  not  apply  to  the  Corporation  as  it  is  currently  proposed,  if  the  Corporation  becomes  subject  to  the
requirements  of  the  Capital  Proposal  in  the  future  or  becomes  subject  to  any  other  new  laws  or  regulations  related  to  capital  and  liquidity,  such
requirements could limit the Corporation’s ability to pay dividends or make share repurchases or require Comerica to reduce business levels or to raise
capital, which would have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s financial condition and results of operations. If subject to the Capital Proposal, the
estimated impact related to proposed inclusion of most components of AOCI would be an approximate 300 basis point decrease to common equity tier-1
capital based on December 31, 2023 financials.

RISK MANAGEMENT

The  Corporation  assumes  various  types  of  risk  as  a  result  of  conducting  business  in  the  normal  course.  The  Corporation's  enterprise  risk
management  framework  provides  a  process  for  identifying,  measuring,  controlling  and  managing  these  risks.  This  framework  incorporates  a  risk
assessment process, a collection of risk committees that manage the Corporation's major risk elements and a risk appetite statement that outlines the levels
and  types  of  risks  the  Corporation  accepts.  The  Corporation  continuously  enhances  its  enterprise  risk  framework  with  additional  processes,  tools  and
systems designed to not only provide management with deeper insight into the various existing and emerging risks in accordance with its appetite for risk,
but also to improve the Corporation's ability to control those risks and ensure that appropriate consideration is received for the risks taken.

The Corporation’s front line employees, the first line of defense, are responsible for the day-to-day management and ownership of risks, including
the identification, assessment, measurement and control of risks encountered as a part of the normal course of business. Each of the major risk categories
are further monitored and measured by specialized risk managers in the second line of defense within the Enterprise Risk Division, who provide oversight
as well as independent and effective challenge and guidance for the risk management activities of the organization. The Enterprise Risk Division, led by the
Chief  Risk  Officer,  is  responsible  for  designing  and  managing  the  Corporation’s  enterprise  risk  management  framework  and  ensures  effective  risk
management oversight. Risk management committees serve as a point of review and escalation for those risks which may have risk interdependencies or
where  risk  levels  may  be  nearing  the  limits  outlined  in  the  Corporation’s  risk  appetite  statement.  These  committees  comprise  senior  and  executive
management that represent views from both the lines of business and risk management. Internal Audit, the third line of defense, monitors and assesses the
overall  effectiveness  of  the  risk  management  framework  on  an  ongoing  basis  and  provides  an  independent,  objective  assessment  of  the  Corporation’s
ability to manage and control risk to management and the Audit Committee of the Board.

The Enterprise Risk and Return Committee, chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, is established by the Enterprise Risk Committee of the Board and
responsible for governance over the risk management framework, providing oversight in managing the Corporation's aggregate risk position and reporting
on the comprehensive portfolio of risks as well as the potential impact these risks can have on the Corporation's risk profile and resulting capital level.
Capital  provides  the  primary  buffer  for  risk  and  also  serves  as  a  measuring  tool  when  evaluating  risk.  The  Enterprise  Risk  and  Return  Committee  is
principally  composed  of  senior  officers  and  executives  representing  the  different  risk  areas  and  business  units  who  are  appointed  by  the  Chairman  and
Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation.

The Board's Enterprise Risk Committee meets quarterly and is chartered to assist the Board in promoting the best interests of the Corporation by
overseeing policies and risk practices relating to enterprise-wide risk and ensuring compliance with bank regulatory obligations. Members of the Enterprise
Risk Committee are selected such that the committee comprises individuals whose experiences and qualifications can lead to broad and informed views on
risk matters facing the Corporation and the financial services industry. These include, but are not limited to, existing and emerging risk matters related to
credit,  market,  liquidity,  operational,  technology,  compliance  and  strategic  conditions.  A  comprehensive  risk  report  is  submitted  to  the  Enterprise  Risk
Committee each quarter providing management's view of the Corporation's aggregate risk position.

Further discussion and analyses of each major risk area are included in the following sub-sections of the Risk Management section in this financial

review.

Credit Risk

Credit risk represents the risk of loss due to failure of a customer or counterparty to meet its financial obligations in accordance with contractual
terms. Credit risk is found in all activities where success depends on counterparty, issuer or borrower performance. It arises any time funds are extended,
committed, invested or otherwise exposed, whether reflected on or off the balance sheet. The governance structure is administered through the Strategic
Credit  Committee.  The  Strategic  Credit  Committee  is  chaired  by  the  Chief  Credit  Officer  and  approves  recommendations  to  address  credit  risk  matters
through  credit  policy,  credit  risk  management  practices  and  required  credit  risk  actions.  The  Strategic  Credit  Committee  also  ensures  a  comprehensive
reporting of credit risk levels and trends, including exception levels, along with identification and mitigation of emerging risks. In order to facilitate the
corporate  credit  risk  management  process,  various  other  corporate  functions  provide  the  resources  for  the  Strategic  Credit  Committee  to  carry  out  its
responsibilities. The Corporation manages credit risk through underwriting and periodically reviewing and approving its credit exposures in accordance
with established credit policies and guidelines. Additionally, the Corporation manages credit risk through loan portfolio diversification, limiting exposure to
any  single  industry,  customer  or  guarantor,  and  selling  participations  and/or  syndicating  credit  exposures  above  those  levels  it  deems  prudent  to  third
parties.

The Credit Division manages credit policy and provides the resources to manage the line of business transactional credit risk, assuring that all

exposure is risk rated according to the requirements of the credit risk rating policy and providing

F-18

Table of Contents

business segment reporting support as necessary. The Enterprise Risk Division provides credible and well-documented challenge of overall portfolio credit
risk, and other credit-related attributes of the Corporation's loan portfolios, with a particular emphasis on all attendant modeled results. The Corporation's
Asset Quality Review function, a division of Internal Audit, audits the accuracy of internal risk ratings that are assigned by the lending and credit groups.
The Special Assets Group is responsible for managing the recovery process on distressed or defaulted loans and loan sales.

Credit Analytics and Strategy, within the Credit Division, provides comprehensive reporting on portfolio credit risk levels and trends, continuous
assessment  and  verification  of  risk  rating  models,  quarterly  calculation  of  the  allowance  for  loan  losses  and  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  on  lending-
related commitments and calculations of both expected and unexpected loss.

Allowance for Credit Losses

The allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The
allowance  for  credit  losses  increased  by  $67  million  from  $661  million  at  December  31,  2022  to  $728  million  at  December  31,  2023,  reflecting  an
uncertain economic outlook and credit migration, as well as changes in portfolio composition.

The following table presents metrics of the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming loans.

The economic forecasts informing the current expected credit loss (CECL) model reflect the cumulative effects of the Federal Reserve Bank's tight
monetary  policy  that  are  weighing  on  the  real  economy,  as  well  as  several  years  of  elevated  inflation  that  have  largely  depleted  excess  savings  that
households accumulated during the pandemic. Energy prices are projected to level off amid crosswinds from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, rising U.S. crude
production and weak demand from China and other major foreign economies. Residential and commercial real estate property prices face headwinds from
the long and variable lags by which the Federal Reserve Bank's tighter monetary policy affect real asset prices.

Downside risks to growth from geopolitical risks, a potential government shutdown, the restart of student loan payments and less expansionary
fiscal policy are projected to collectively contribute to slower growth in 2024. Price pressures are forecasted to gradually return to pre-pandemic norms as a
modest margin of slack opens in the economy's productive capacity. The Federal Reserve Bank's aggressive tightening of monetary policy, including rapid
increases in interest rates and reductions in the size of its balance sheet, contribute to elevated risk of a policy error or recession.

These factors shaped the 2-year reasonable and supportable forecast used by the Corporation in its CECL estimate at December 31, 2023. The
U.S. economy is projected to grow at a below-trend rate through 2024 before gradually normalizing to its trend growth rate. Certain economic variables,
like oil prices, are expected to increase in the short term before decreasing as inflation normalizes. Forecasts for other key economic variables are generally
consistent  with  those  of  Gross  Domestic  Product  (GDP),  while  interest  rate  forecasts  reflect  market  expectations  and  recent  guidance  from  the  Federal
Reserve Bank. The following table summarizes select economic variables representative of the economic forecasts used to develop the allowance for credit
losses estimate at December 31, 2023.

Economic Variable

Real GDP growth

Unemployment rate

Corporate BBB bond to 10-year Treasury bond spreads

Oil Prices

Base Forecast
Gradual growth to a peak near 3 percent in second quarter 2025 before returning to
a growth rate of around 2 percent.
Remains near 4 percent throughout the forecast period.
Spreads widen to 2.4 percent by third quarter 2024 before normalizing to 2 percent
by the end of the forecast period.
Prices  increase  from  current  levels  to  $84  dollars  in  first  quarter  2024  before
declining to $76 by the end of the forecast period.

Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding recessionary pressures, persistent inflation, continued high interest rates and other tail risks to the
outlook, management considered other economic scenarios to make appropriate qualitative adjustments for certain sectors of its lending portfolio, including
more benign as well as more severe scenarios.

F-19

Table of Contents

Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit

losses.

Allowance for Loan Losses

The  allowance  for  loan  losses  represents  management’s  estimates  of  current  expected  credit  losses  in  the  Corporation’s  loan  portfolio.  The

allowance for loan losses increased $78 million to $688 million at December 31, 2023, compared to $610 million at December 31, 2022.

Collective  loss  estimates  are  determined  by  applying  reserve  factors,  designed  to  estimate  current  expected  credit  losses,  to  amortized  cost
balances over the remaining contractual life of the collectively evaluated portfolio. Loans with similar risk characteristics are aggregated into homogeneous
pools. The allowance for loan losses also includes qualitative adjustments to bring the allowance to the level management believes is appropriate based on
factors that have not otherwise been fully accounted for, including adjustments for foresight risk, input imprecisions and model imprecision. Credit losses
for  loans  that  no  longer  share  risk  characteristics  with  the  loan  pools  are  estimated  on  an  individual  basis.  Individual  credit  loss  estimates  are  typically
performed for nonaccrual loans and are based on one of several methods, including the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, observable market
value of similar debt or the present value of expected cash flows.    

Allowance for Credit Losses on Lending-Related Commitments

The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments estimates current expected credit losses on collective pools of letters of credit and
unused  commitments  to  extend  credit  based  on  reserve  factors,  determined  in  a  manner  similar  to  business  loans,  multiplied  by  a  probability  of  draw
estimate based on historical experience and credit risk, applied to commitment amounts. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments
totaled $40 million and $51 million at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

Nonperforming Assets

Nonperforming assets include loans on nonaccrual status and foreclosed assets. Effective January 1, 2023, the Corporation prospectively adopted
the provisions of Accounting Standards Update No. 2022-02, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructuring and Vintage
Disclosures", which eliminated the accounting for TDRs. Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. At December 31,
2022, reduced-rate loans represented TDRs which had been renegotiated to less than their original contractual rates.

Nonperforming assets decreased $66 million to $178 million at December 31, 2023, from $244 million at December 31, 2022. The decrease in
nonperforming assets primarily reflected decreases of $33 million in nonaccrual business loans and $29 million in nonaccrual retail loans. Nonperforming
loans  were  0.34  percent  of  total  loans  at  December  31,  2023,  compared  to  0.46  percent  at  December  31,  2022.  For  further  information  regarding  the

Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest generally represent loans that are well-collateralized and in the process of collection.
Loans past due 90 days or more decreased $3 million to $20 million at December 31, 2023, compared to $23 million at December 31, 2022. Loans past due
30-89 days decreased $180 million to $198 million at December 31, 2023, compared to $378 million at December 31, 2022. Loans past due 30 days or
more  and  still  accruing  interest  as  a  percentage  of  total  loans  were  0.42  percent  and  0.75  percent  at  December  31,  2023  and  December  31,  2022,
respectively.  An  aging  analysis  of  loans  included  in  Note  4  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  provides  further  information  about  the  balances
comprising past due loans.

The  following  table  presents  a  summary  of  total  criticized  loans.  The  Corporation's  criticized  list  is  consistent  with  the  Special  Mention,
Substandard and Doubtful categories defined by regulatory authorities. Criticized loans on nonaccrual status are individually subjected to quarterly credit
quality reviews, and the Corporation may establish specific allowances for such loans. A table of loans by credit quality indicator included in Note 4 to the
consolidated financial statements provides further information about the balances comprising total criticized loans.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Concentrations of credit risk may exist when a number of borrowers are engaged in similar activities, or activities in the same geographic region,
and have similar economic characteristics that would cause them to be similarly impacted by changes in economic or other conditions. The Corporation has
concentrations  of  credit  risk  with  the  commercial  real  estate  and  automotive  industries.  All  other  industry  concentrations,  as  defined  by  management,
individually represented less than 10 percent of total loans at December 31, 2023.

(a) Primarily loans to real estate developers.
(b) Primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real estate.

The Corporation limits risk inherent in its commercial real estate lending activities by monitoring borrowers directly involved in the commercial
real  estate  markets  and  adhering  to  conservative  policies  on  loan-to-value  ratios  for  such  loans.  Commercial  real  estate  loans,  consisting  of  real  estate
construction  and  commercial  mortgage  loans,  totaled  $18.8  billion  at  December  31,  2023.  Commercial  real  estate  loans  made  to  borrowers  in  the
Commercial  Real  Estate  business  line,  which  includes  loans  to  real  estate  developers,  totaled  $9.3  billion,  or  50  percent  of  total  commercial  real  estate
loans, an increase of $2.1 billion compared to December 31, 2022. The Commercial Real Estate business line at December 31, 2023 was predominantly
secured by multi-family and industrial properties, comprising 46 percent and 34 percent of the portfolio, respectively, with only 6 percent secured by office
properties. Commercial real estate loans in other business lines totaled $9.5 billion, or 50 percent of total commercial real estate loans, at December 31,
2023, an increase of $247 million compared to December 31, 2022. These loans consisted primarily of owner-occupied commercial mortgages, which bear
credit characteristics similar to non-commercial real estate business loans. Generally, loans previously reported as real estate construction are classified as
commercial mortgage loans upon receipt of a certificate of occupancy.

The  real  estate  construction  loan  portfolio  primarily  contains  loans  made  to  long-tenured  customers  with  satisfactory  completion  experience.
Criticized  real  estate  construction  loans  in  the  Commercial  Real  Estate  business  line  totaled  $86  million  at  December  31,  2023  compared  to  none  at
December 31, 2022. In other business lines, criticized real estate construction loans totaled $12 million at December 31, 2023, compared to $3 million at
December 31, 2022. There were no real estate construction loan net charge-offs in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

Commercial  mortgage  loans  are  loans  where  the  primary  collateral  is  a  lien  on  any  real  property  and  are  primarily  loans  secured  by  owner-
occupied  real  estate.  Real  property  is  generally  considered  primary  collateral  if  the  value  of  that  collateral  represents  more  than  50  percent  of  the
commitment at loan approval. Loans in the commercial mortgage portfolio generally mature within three to five years. Criticized commercial mortgage
loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $378 million and $16 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, with the increase
primarily in multi-family properties. In other business lines, $395 million and $151 million of commercial mortgage loans were criticized at December 31,
2023 and 2022, respectively. Commercial mortgage loan net recoveries were $1 million in 2023, compared to no net charge-offs in 2022.

increase of $934 million compared to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2022, resulting from increasing vehicle levels due to supply chain improvements. At
December 31, 2023 and 2022, other loans in the National Dealer Services business line totaled $3.9 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively, including $2.2
billion and $2.3 billion of owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans, respectively.

There were no nonaccrual dealer loans at both December 31, 2023, and 2022. Additionally, there were no net charge-offs of dealer loans in either

of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

issues with supply chains and logistics operations and impacts resulting from labor union strikes. As such, management continues to monitor this portfolio.

Nonaccrual  loans  to  borrowers  involved  with  automotive  production  totaled  $17  million  in  at  December  31,  2023,  compared  to  $5  million  at

Residential real estate loans, which consist of traditional residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit, totaled $3.7 billion at
December  31,  2023.  The  residential  real  estate  portfolio  is  principally  located  within  the  Corporation's  primary  geographic  markets.  Substantially  all
residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more are placed on nonaccrual status, and substantially all junior lien home equity loans that are current or
less than 90 days past due are placed on nonaccrual status if full collection of the senior position is in doubt. At no later than 180 days past due, such loans
are charged off to current appraised values less costs to sell.

Residential mortgages totaled $1.9 billion at December 31, 2023, and were primarily larger, variable-rate mortgages originated and retained for
certain  private  banking  relationship  customers.  Of  the  $1.9  billion  of  residential  mortgage  loans  outstanding,  $19  million  were  on  nonaccrual  status  at
December 31, 2023, a decrease of $34 million compared to December 31, 2022. The home equity portfolio totaled $1.8 billion at December 31, 2023, of
which 96 percent was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit, 3 percent were in amortizing status and 1 percent
were closed-end home equity loans. Of the $1.8 billion of home equity loans outstanding, $21 million were on nonaccrual status at December 31, 2023, an
increase of $6 million compared to December 31, 2022. A majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens at December 31, 2023.

Energy Lending

The Corporation has a portfolio of Energy loans that are included entirely in commercial loans in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Customers in
the Corporation's Energy business line (approximately 120 relationships) are engaged in exploration and production (E&P) and midstream. E&P generally
includes such activities as searching for potential oil and gas fields, drilling exploratory wells and operating active wells. Commitments to E&P borrowers
are  generally  subject  to  semi-annual  borrowing  base  re-determinations  based  on  a  variety  of  factors  including  updated  prices  (reflecting  market  and
competitive conditions), energy reserve levels and the impact of hedging. The midstream sector is generally involved in the

Table of Contents

transportation,  storage  and  marketing  of  crude  and/or  refined  oil  and  gas  products.  The  Corporation's  energy  services  customers  provide  products  and
services primarily to the E&P segment. Approximately 94% of loans in the Energy business line are Shared National Credits (SNC), which are facilities
greater than or equal to $100 million shared by three or more federally supervised institutions, reflecting the Corporation's focus on larger middle market
companies  that  have  financing  needs  that  generally  exceed  internal  individual  borrower  credit  risk  limits.  The  Corporation  seeks  to  develop  full
relationships with SNC borrowers.

Loans in the Energy business line totaled $1.4 billion, or 3 percent of total loans, at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $33 million compared to
December 31, 2022. Total exposure, including unused commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, was $3.3 billion (a utilization rate of 42 percent)
and $3.4 billion (a utilization of 43 percent) at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Nonaccrual Energy loans decreased $3 million to
$4  million  at  December  31,  2023,  compared  to  $7  million  at  December  31,  2022.  Criticized  Energy  loans  decreased  $8  million  to  $4  million  at
December  31,  2023,  compared  to  $12  million  at  December  31,  2022.  Energy  net  recoveries  were  $1  million  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2023,
compared to net charge-offs of $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Leveraged Loans

Certain  loans  in  the  Corporation's  commercial  portfolio  are  considered  leveraged  transactions.  These  loans  are  typically  used  for  mergers,
acquisitions, business recapitalizations, refinancing and equity buyouts. To help mitigate the risk associated with these loans, the Corporation focuses on
middle market companies with highly capable management teams, strong sponsors and solid track records of financial performance. Industries prone to
cyclical downturns and acquisitions with a high degree of integration risk are generally avoided. Other considerations include the sufficiency of collateral,
the level of balance sheet leverage and the adequacy of financial covenants. During the underwriting process, cash flows are stress-tested to evaluate the
borrowers' abilities to handle economic downturns and an increase in interest rates.

The FDIC defines higher-risk commercial and industrial (HR C&I) loans for assessment purposes as loans generally with leverage of four times
total  debt  to  earnings  before  interest,  taxes  and  depreciation  (EBITDA)  as  well  as  three  times  senior  debt  to  EBITDA,  excluding  certain  collateralized
loans.

Market and Liquidity Risk

Market risk represents the risk of loss due to adverse movement in prices, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and
equity prices. Liquidity risk represents the risk that the Corporation does not have sufficient access to funds to maintain its normal operations at all times or
does not have the ability to raise or borrow funds at a reasonable cost at all times.

The  Asset  Liability  Management  Committee  (ALCO)  of  the  Corporation  establishes  and  monitors  compliance  with  the  policies  and  risk  limits
pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities. ALCO meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies
and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the Corporation, including treasury, finance, economics, lending, deposit gathering
and  risk  management.  Corporate  Treasury  mitigates  market  and  liquidity  risk  under  the  direction  of  ALCO  through  the  actions  it  takes  to  manage  the
Corporation's market, liquidity and capital positions.

The Corporation performs monthly liquidity stress testing to evaluate its ability to meet funding needs in hypothetical stressed environments. Such
environments  cover  a  series  of  scenarios,  including  both  idiosyncratic  and  market-wide  in  nature,  which  vary  in  terms  of  duration  and  severity.  Recent
events have created greater uncertainty with respect to normal deposit patterns. Following the March 2023 banking industry disruption, the Corporation
activated  its  contingency  funding  plan  by  increasing  its  cash  position  through  wholesale  funding  channels  and  brokered  deposits.  The  Corporation's
evaluation as of December 31, 2023 projected that sufficient sources of liquidity were available under each series of events.

In addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis, Corporate Treasury also monitors the parent company's liquidity and has established
liquidity coverage requirements for meeting expected obligations without the support of additional dividends from subsidiaries. ALCO's policy on liquidity
risk management requires the parent company to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet expected cash obligations, such as debt service, dividend payments
and normal operating expenses, over a period of no less than 12 months. The Corporation had liquid assets of $1.4 billion on an unconsolidated basis at
December 31, 2023.

Corporate Treasury and the Enterprise Risk Division support ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other
market risks. Key activities encompass: (i) providing information and analyses of the Corporation's balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate
and all other market risks; (ii) monitoring and reporting of the Corporation's positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines; (iii) developing
and presenting analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions; (iv) reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval; and (v) monitoring of
industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market and liquidity risks.

Interest Rate Risk

Net  interest  income  is  the  primary  source  of  revenue  for  the  Corporation.  Interest  rate  risk  arises  in  the  normal  course  of  business  due  to
differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities, primarily through the Corporation's core business activities of extending
loans and acquiring deposits. The Corporation's balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating-rate loans funded by core deposits. Including the
impact of interest rate swaps converting floating-rate loans to fixed, the Corporation's loan composition at December 31, 2023 was 40 percent fixed-rate, 51
percent overnight to 30-day rate, 6 percent 90-day and greater rates and 3 percent prime. The composition of the loan portfolio creates sensitivity to interest
rate movements due to the imbalance between the faster repricing of the floating-rate loan portfolio versus deposit products. In addition, the growth and/or
contraction  in  the  Corporation's  loans  and  deposits  may  lead  to  changes  in  sensitivity  to  interest  rate  movements  in  the  absence  of  mitigating  actions.
Examples  of  such  actions  are  purchasing  fixed-rate  investment  securities,  which  provide  liquidity  to  the  balance  sheet  and  act  to  mitigate  the  inherent
interest rate sensitivity, as well as hedging with interest rate swaps and options. Other mitigating factors include interest rate floors on a portion of the loan
portfolio.

The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic

value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.

Since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives, a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk. These
techniques  examine  the  impact  of  interest  rate  risk  on  net  interest  income  and  the  economic  value  of  equity  under  a  variety  of  alternative  scenarios,
including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve utilizing multiple simulation analyses. Simulation analyses produce only estimates of net
interest income as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors, including, but not
limited to, the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions, regulatory impacts and management strategies.

Sensitivity of Net Interest Income to Changes in Interest Rates

The analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is management's principal risk
management technique. Management models a base-case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment using a static balance sheet and
generates  sensitivity  scenarios  by  changing  certain  model  assumptions.  Each  scenario  includes  assumptions  such  as  loan  growth,  investment  security
prepayment  levels,  depositor  behavior  and  overall  balance  sheet  mix  and  growth  which  are  in  line  with  historical  patterns.  Additionally,  the  analysis
assumes  that  all  loan  hedges  qualify  for  hedge  accounting.  Changes  in  actual  economic  activity  may  result  in  a  materially  different  interest  rate
environment as well as a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis. Model assumptions in
the sensitivity scenarios at December 31, 2023 included for the rising rate scenarios, a modest increase in loan balances and a moderate decrease in deposit
balances, and for the declining rate scenarios, a modest decrease in loan balances and a moderate increase in deposit balances. In addition, both scenarios
assumed  loan  spreads  held  at  current  levels,  an  incremental  interest-bearing  deposit  beta  of  approximately  48%,  deposit  mix  shifts  based  on  historical
observations, partial reinvestment of securities portfolio cash flows and no additions to interest rate swaps.

The average balance of the securities portfolio included in the analysis was $17.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 with an average

yield of 2.10% and effective duration of 5.5 years.

The table below details components of the variable-rate loan swap portfolio at December 31, 2023.

Includes forward starting swaps of $2.0 billion starting in 2024. Excluding forward starting swaps, the weighted average yield was 2.43%.

The  analysis  also  includes  interest  rate  swaps  that  convert  $6.3  billion  of  fixed-rate  medium-  and  long-term  debt  to  variable  rates  through  fair
value  hedges.  Additionally,  included  in  this  analysis  are  $15.5  billion  of  loans  that  were  subject  to  an  average  interest  rate  floor  of  52  basis  points  at
December 31, 2023. This base-case net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which short-term rates rise or decline 100 or 200
basis points (with a floor of zero percent) in a linear, non-parallel fashion from the base case over 12 months, resulting in an average change of 50 or 100
basis points over the period.

The table below, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating

the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above.

In both the 100 and 200 basis point scenarios, sensitivity to declining interest rates shifted from reducing net interest income at December 31,
2022  to  benefiting  net  interest  income  at  December  31,  2023,  resulting  from  a  decline  in  non-maturity  deposits,  partially  offset  by  an  increase  in  time
deposits. In the 100 basis point scenario, sensitivity to rising interest rates shifted from benefiting net interest income at December 31, 2022 to reducing net
interest  income  at  December  31,  2023,  while  in  the  200  basis  point  scenario,  negative  sensitivity  to  rising  interest  rates  increased  compared  to
December 31, 2022, resulting from the change in liability mix that occurred in 2023.

F-28

Table of Contents

At  December  31,  2023,  additional  sensitivity  scenarios  applied  the  rising  and  declining  100  basis  point  scenario  assumptions  with  a  60%
incremental deposit beta relative to the base case scenario to assess the impact of the Corporation's deposit beta assumptions. In these rising and declining
scenarios, net interest income decreased by $65 million and increased by $44 million, respectively, due to a more rapid repricing pace compared to the
standard model assumptions. All scenarios presented for December 31, 2023 reflected a change in balance sheet composition following the March 2023
banking industry disruption, as the balance sheet maintained a higher concentration of cash as well as increased wholesale funding and brokered deposits,
which contributed to the decrease in net interest income in all scenarios presented.

Sensitivity of Economic Value of Equity to Changes in Interest Rates

In addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income, an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate
risk position. The economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the Corporation's financial assets, liabilities and
off-balance sheet instruments, derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period, and the estimated economic value after
applying the estimated impact of rate movements. The Corporation primarily monitors the percentage change on the base-case economic value of equity.
The economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel 100 or 200 basis point shock with a floor of zero percent.

The  table  below,  as  of  December  31,  2023  and  December  31,  2022,  displays  the  estimated  impact  on  the  economic  value  of  equity  from  the

interest rate scenario described above.

The negative sensitivity of the economic value of equity to rising rates increased from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023 due to deposit
runoff  and  adjustments  to  deposit  behavioral  assumptions,  partially  offset  by  a  declining  notional  amount  of  cash  flow  swaps  and  a  smaller  securities
portfolio. Sensitivity to declining rates increased the economic value of equity due to the same factors.

The  Corporation  uses  investment  securities  and  derivative  instruments  as  asset  and  liability  management  tools  with  the  overall  objective  of
managing  the  volatility  of  net  interest  income  from  changes  in  interest  rates.  These  tools  assist  management  in  achieving  the  desired  interest  rate  risk
management  objectives.  Activity  related  to  derivative  instruments  currently  involves  interest  rate  swaps  effectively  converting  fixed-rate  medium-  and
long-term  debt  to  a  floating  rate  as  well  as  variable  rate  loans  to  a  fixed  rate.  Notional  activity  for  2023  included  the  impact  of  LIBOR  transition  for
centrally-cleared  swaps,  where  LIBOR-based  swaps  were  replaced  with  short-dated  LIBOR  bridge  swaps  that  matured  in  2023  and  surviving  forward-
starting Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) swaps.

The notional amount of risk management interest rate swaps totaled $31.2 billion at December 31, 2023, which included cash flow swaps that
convert $24.9 billion of variable-rate loans to a fixed rate as well as fair value swaps that convert $6.3 billion of fixed-rate medium- and long-term debt to a
floating rate. Risk management interest rate swaps generated $715 million of net interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to no
impact  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022.  Of  the  $24.9  billion  of  cash  flow  swaps,  $7.0  billion  were  un-designated  for  accounting  purposes  as  of
December 31, 2023. Refer to Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of de-designated interest rate hedges.

In  addition  to  interest  rate  swaps,  the  Corporation  employs  various  other  types  of  derivative  instruments  as  offsetting  positions  to  mitigate
exposures to foreign currency risks associated with specific assets and liabilities (e.g., customer loans or deposits denominated in foreign currencies). Such
instruments may include foreign exchange spot and forward contracts as well as foreign exchange swap agreements.

Further information regarding risk management derivative instruments is provided in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.

The  Corporation  sells  and  purchases  interest  rate  caps  and  floors  and  enters  into  foreign  exchange  contracts,  interest  rate  swaps  and  energy
derivative contracts to accommodate the needs of customers requesting such services. Changes in the fair value of customer-initiated and other derivatives
are recognized in earnings as they occur. To limit the market risk of these activities, the Corporation generally takes offsetting positions with dealers. The
notional  amounts  of  offsetting  positions  are  included  in  the  table  above.  Customer-initiated  and  other  notional  activity  represented  55  percent  of  total
interest rate, energy and foreign exchange contracts at both December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Further information regarding customer-initiated and other derivative instruments is provided in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.

LIBOR Transition

On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, publicly announced that it intends to stop
persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. Effective March 2021, the FCA confirmed that certain LIBOR tenors would no longer
be  supported  after  December  31,  2021  and  that  the  remaining  tenors,  including  those  most  commonly  used  by  the  Corporation,  would  no  longer  be
supported after June 30, 2023. The Corporation had substantial exposure to LIBOR-based products, ceased originating LIBOR-based products in the fourth
quarter 2021 and has worked to remediate its outstanding LIBOR contracts. As of December 31, 2023, LIBOR transition was substantially complete.

BSBY Cessation

On  November  15,  2023,  the  Bloomberg  Index  Services  Limited  (Bloomberg)  announced  that  it  will  discontinue  publishing  the  BSBY  on
November 15, 2024; accordingly, the Corporation was required to “de-designate” $7.0 billion of interest rate swaps used in cash flow hedges of certain
BSBY-indexed  loans  and  reclassify  amounts  recognized  in  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  into  earnings.  For  each  de-designated  swap,
settlement of interest payments and changes in fair value are recorded as risk management hedging losses within other noninterest income instead of net
interest  income  until  the  swap  is  re-designated.  In  January  2024,  $4.2  billion  of  these  swaps  were  re-designated,  with  the  remaining  expected  to  be  re-
designated in early 2024. The net impact of BSBY cessation to interest income on commercial loans was a $3 million benefit for the year ended December
31,  2023.  Additionally,  the  Corporation  recognized  a  net  loss  of  $91  million  in  other  noninterest  income.  Refer  to  Note  8  to  the  consolidated  financial
statements for further discussion of de-designated interest rate hedges.

At December 31, 2023, the Corporation had $33.0 billion of exposure to BSBY-based products, including $21.7 billion in loans and $11.3 billion
in interest rate swaps. The Corporation is currently evaluating contracts to ensure appropriate fallback language is included, and will remediate contracts as
necessary.  The  Corporation  expects  that  the  majority  of  BSBY-based  contracts  will  organically  transition  to  SOFR  over  the  upcoming  year,  with  any
remaining contracts transitioning to SOFR through fallback language at the first repricing date after BSBY cessation occurs in November 2024.

Sources of Liquidity

The Corporation maintains a liquidity position that it believes will adequately satisfy its financial obligations while taking into account potential
commitment  draws  and  deposit  run-off  that  may  occur  in  the  normal  course  of  business.  The  majority  of  the  Corporation's  balance  sheet  is  funded  by
customer deposits. Cash flows from loan repayments, increases in deposit accounts (including brokered deposits), activity in the securities portfolio and
wholesale funding channels serve as the Corporation's primary liquidity sources.

The Corporation satisfies incremental liquidity needs with either liquid assets or external funding sources. Available liquidity includes cash, FHLB
advances  and  Federal  Reserve  Bank  (FRB)  borrowing,  comprised  of  borrowing  through  the  discount  window  and  the  newly  established  Bank  Term
Funding Program (BTFP). The Corporation has pledged its investment securities portfolio to access wholesale funding as needed and does not intend to sell
or restructure securities at this time.

F-31

Table of Contents

The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Dallas, Texas, which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized
by real estate-related loans, certain government agency-backed securities and other eligible assets. Actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount
of collateral pledged to the FHLB and the fair value of pledged assets, as well as applicable FHLB haircuts.

At December 31, 2023, the Bank had pledged real estate-related loans totaling $21.9 billion and investment securities totaling $6.6 billion to the

FHLB, which provided for up to $17.1 billion of collateralized borrowing with the FHLB.

The FRB provides liquidity through its discount window, where banks may borrow funds based on the discounted fair value of pledged assets.
Additionally, in March 2023, the FRB established the BTFP in response to the 2023 industry disruption, offering loans with up to one year in maturity to
eligible  depository  institutions  in  exchange  for  pledged  collateral  in  the  form  of  U.S  Treasuries,  agency  debt  and  mortgage-backed  securities  and  other
qualifying assets. Unlike other funding sources, borrowing capacity under the BTFP is based on the par value, not fair value, of collateral.

At  December  31,  2023,  the  Bank  had  pledged  loans  totaling  $24.6  billion  and  investment  securities  totaling  $7.7  billion  to  the  FRB,  which
provided for up to $21.0 billion and $9.3 billion of collateralized borrowing through the discount window and BTFP program, respectively. The Bank did
not  rely  on  the  BTFP  facility  as  a  funding  source,  except  to  perform  an  operational  test  at  the  onset,  and  does  not  plan  to  use  the  facility  before  its
announced expiration on March 11, 2024. Total available collateralized borrowings with the FRB was $30.3 billion at December 31, 2023.

The Corporation may also use brokered deposits and external debt as additional sources of funding, and maintains a shelf registration statement
with the Securities and Exchange Commission through which it may issue securities.The ability of the Corporation and the Bank to raise unsecured funding
at  competitive  rates  is  impacted  by  rating  agencies'  views  of  the  credit  quality,  liquidity,  capital,  earnings  and  other  relevant  factors  related  to  the
Corporation and the Bank. As of December 31, 2023, the three major rating agencies had assigned the following ratings to long-term senior unsecured
obligations of the Corporation and the Bank, as well as long-term deposits at the Bank. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold
securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any
other rating.

Deposit Concentrations and Uninsured Deposits

The Corporation's focus is commercial customers, and accordingly, it has a larger percentage of uninsured deposits relative to financial institutions
with a higher consumer focus. These deposits are well-diversified between geographies, industries and customers. At December 31, 2023, the Retail Bank

Uninsured deposits are defined as the portion of deposit accounts in U.S. offices that exceed the FDIC insurance limit and amounts in any other

uninsured investment or deposit account that are classified as deposits and are not subject to any federal or state deposit insurance regimes.

Potential Uses of Liquidity

Various financial obligations such as contractual obligations, unfunded commitments and deposit withdrawals may require future cash payments
by  the  Corporation.  Certain  obligations  are  recognized  on  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets,  while  others  are  off-balance  sheet  under  U.S.  generally
accepted accounting principles.

The following table summarizes the Corporation's material noncancelable contractual obligations and future required minimum payments. Refer to

Since many of these commitments expire without being fully drawn, and each customer must continue to meet the conditions established in the
contract, the total amount of these commercial commitments does not necessarily represent the future cash requirements of the Corporation. Refer to Note 8

Other Market Risks

Market  risk  related  to  the  Corporation's  trading  instruments  is  not  significant,  as  trading  activities  are  limited.  Certain  components  of  the
Corporation's noninterest income, primarily fiduciary income, are at risk to fluctuations in the market values of underlying assets, particularly equity and
debt securities. Other components of noninterest income, primarily brokerage fees, are at risk to changes in the volume of market activity.

Operational Risk

Operational risk represents the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes and people, or from external events, excluding in
most cases those driven by technology (see Technology Risk below). The Corporation's definition of operational risk includes fraud; employment practice
and workplace safety; clients, products and business practice; business continuity or disaster recovery; execution, delivery, and process management; third
party and model risks. The definition does not include strategic or reputational risks. Although operational losses are experienced by all companies and are
routinely incurred in business operations, the Corporation recognizes the need to identify and control operational losses and seeks to limit losses to a level
deemed appropriate by management, as outlined in the Corporation’s risk appetite statement. The appropriate risk level is determined through consideration
of the nature of the Corporation's business and the environment in which it operates, in combination with the impact from, and the possible impact on, other
risks faced by the Corporation. Operational risk is mitigated through a system of internal controls that are designed to keep operating risks at appropriate
levels. The Operational Risk Management Committee monitors risk management techniques and systems. The Corporation has developed a framework that
includes a centralized operational risk reporting function in the Enterprise Risk Division and business/support unit risk liaisons responsible for managing
operational risk specific to the respective business lines.

Technology Risk

        Technology  risk  represents  the  risk  of  loss  or  adverse  outcomes  arising  from  the  people,  processes,  applications  and  infrastructure  that  support  the
technology environment. The Corporation's definition of technology risk includes technology delivery risk, technology investment risk, cybersecurity risk,
information security risk and information management risk. Technology risk is inclusive of the risks associated with the execution of technology processes
and activities by third-party contractors and suppliers to the Corporation. Other risk types may materialize in the event of a technology risk event, such as
the risk of a financial reporting error or regulatory non-compliance, and the impact of such risks are highly interdependent with operational risk.

        The  Technology  Risk  Committee,  comprising  senior  and  executive  business  unit  managers,  as  well  as  managers  responsible  for  technology,
cybersecurity,  information  security  and  enterprise  risk  management,  oversees  technology  risk.  The  Technology  Risk  Committee  also  ensures  that
appropriate actions are implemented in business units to mitigate risk to an acceptable level.

Compliance Risk

Compliance  risk  represents  the  risk  of  sanctions  or  financial  loss  resulting  from  the  Corporation's  failure  to  comply  with  all  applicable  laws,
regulations and standards of good banking practice. The impact of such risks is highly interdependent with strategic risk, as the reputational impact from
compliance breaches can be severe. Activities which may expose the Corporation to compliance risk include, but are not limited to, those dealing with the
prevention of money laundering, privacy and data protection, community reinvestment initiatives, fair lending, consumer protection, employment and tax
matters, over-the-counter derivative activities and other regulated activities.

The  Enterprise-Wide  Compliance  Committee,  comprising  senior  and  executive  business  unit  managers,  as  well  as  managers  responsible  for
compliance,  audit  and  overall  risk,  oversees  compliance  risk.  This  enterprise-wide  approach  provides  a  consistent  view  of  compliance  across  the
organization. The Enterprise-Wide Compliance Committee also ensures that appropriate actions are implemented in business units to mitigate risk to an
acceptable level.

Strategic Risk

Strategic  risk  represents  the  risk  of  inadequate  returns  or  possible  losses  due  to  impairment  of  reputation,  failure  to  fully  develop  and  execute
business plans, failure to assess current and new opportunities in business, markets and products, failure to determine appropriate consideration for risks
accepted,  and  any  other  event  not  identified  in  the  defined  risk  categories  of  credit,  market  and  liquidity,  operational,  technology  or  compliance  risks.
Mitigation  of  the  various  risk  elements  that  represent  strategic  risk  is  achieved  through  numerous  metrics  and  initiatives  to  help  the  Corporation  better
understand, measure and report on such risks.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The Corporation’s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are
described  in  Note  1.  These  policies  require  numerous  estimates  and  strategic  or  economic  assumptions,  which  may  prove  inaccurate  or  subject  to
variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporation’s future financial condition and results
of  operations.  At  December  31,  2023,  the  most  critical  of  these  estimates  related  to  the  allowance  for  credit  losses,  fair  value  measurement,  goodwill,
pension  plan  accounting  and  income  taxes.  These  estimates  were  reviewed  with  the  Audit  Committee  of  the  Corporation’s  Board  of  Directors  and  are
discussed more fully below.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

In accordance with CECL, the allowance for credit losses, which includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on
lending-related commitments, is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve for current expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life
of the portfolio. The Corporation uses loss factors, based on estimated probability of default for internal risk ratings and loss given default, to determine the
allowance for credit losses for the majority of its portfolio. Management applies loss factors to pools of loans and lending-related commitments with similar
risk characteristics, calibrates these factors using economic forecasts and incorporates qualitative adjustments. For further discussion of the methodology
used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses, refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. For further discussion on the economic
forecast incorporated into the 2023 model, refer to the “Risk Management” section of this financial review.

Management's  determination  of  the  appropriateness  of  the  allowance  is  based  on  periodic  evaluations  of  the  loan  portfolio,  lending-related
commitments,  current  as  well  as  forecasted  economic  factors  and  other  relevant  information.  The  calculation  is  inherently  subjective  and  requires
management to exercise significant judgment in developing assumptions for the estimate, the most significant of which are the loan risk rating process,
development of economic forecasts and application of qualitative adjustments. Sensitivities are disclosed to demonstrate how changes in loan risk ratings
and economic forecast scenarios may impact the allowance for credit losses. Sensitivities only consider changes to each specific assumption in isolation
and their impact to the quantitative modeled results. They do not contemplate impacts to the qualitative framework.

Loan Risk Rating Process

Reserve factors are applied to pools of loans based on risk characteristics, including the Corporation's internal risk rating system; therefore, loss
estimates are highly dependent on the accuracy of the risk rating assigned to each loan. The inherent imprecision in the risk rating system resulting from
inaccuracy in assigning and/or entering risk ratings in the loan accounting system is monitored by the Corporation's asset quality review function. Changes
to internal risk ratings, beyond the forecasted migration inherent in the credit models, would result in a different estimated allowance for credit losses. To
illustrate, if 5 percent of the individual risk ratings were adjusted down by one rating across all pools, the allowance for loan losses as of December 31,
2023 would change by approximately $6 million.

Forecasted Economic Variables

Management  utilizes  models  through  which  historical  reserve  factor  estimates  are  calibrated  to  economic  forecasts  over  the  reasonable  and
supportable forecast period based on the projected performance of specific economic variables that statistically correlate with the probability of default and
loss given default pools. Loss estimates revert to historical loss experience for contractual lives beyond the forecast period. Management selects economic
variables it believes to be most relevant based on the composition of the loan portfolio and customer base, including forecasted levels of employment, gross
domestic product, corporate bond and treasury spreads, industrial production levels, consumer and commercial real estate price indices as well as housing
statistics.

The allowance for credit losses is highly sensitive to the economic forecasts used to develop the estimate. Due to the high level of uncertainty
regarding  significant  assumptions,  the  Corporation  evaluated  a  range  of  economic  scenarios,  including  a  more  severe  economic  forecast  scenario,  with
varying responses to current economic risks. The following table summarizes the more severe forecast scenario for the economic variables that are most
impactful.

More Severe Forecast
Contracts through third quarter 2024, peaking at a decline of 3.5 percent annualized
in second quarter 2024, subsequently improving to a 2.2 percent annual growth rate
by the end of the forecast period.
Increases to 7.7 percent by first quarter 2025 followed by a gradual decline to 6.9
percent by the end of the forecast period.
Spreads  widen  to  a  peak  of  over  4.2  percent  before  gradually  narrowing  to  2.3
percent by the end of the forecast period.
Decline to $53 per barrel by first quarter 2025 before increasing to $61 per barrel by
the end of the forecast period.

Selecting a different forecast in the current environment could result in a significantly different estimated allowance for credit losses. To illustrate,
absent model overlays and other qualitative adjustments that are part of the quarterly reserving process, if the Corporation selected the more severe scenario
to inform its models, the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2023 would increase by approximately $376 million. However, factoring in model
overlays and qualitative adjustments could result in a materially different estimate under a more severe scenario.

Qualitative Adjustments and Model Overlays

The Corporation includes qualitative adjustments, as appropriate, intended to capture the impact of uncertainties not reflected in the quantitative
estimate, including foresight risk, model imprecisions and input imprecisions. Qualitative adjustments for foresight risk reflect the inherent imprecision in
economic forecasts and may be included based on management’s evaluation of different forecast scenarios, ranging from more benign to more severe, and
known  recent  events  impacting  the  Corporation’s  portfolio.  Model  imprecision  adjustments  and  model  overlays  may  be  included  to  mitigate  known
limitations in the quantitative models. Input imprecision includes adjustments for portfolios where recent historical losses exceed expected losses or known
recent  events  are  expected  to  alter  risk  ratings  once  evidence  is  acquired,  as  well  as  a  qualitative  assessment  of  the  lending  environment,  including
underwriting  standards,  current  economic  and  political  conditions,  and  other  factors  affecting  credit  quality.  Qualitative  reserves  at  December  31,
2023 primarily included adjustments for uncertainties related to forecasted economic variables.

Other Considerations

To  the  extent  actual  outcomes  differ  from  management  estimates,  additional  provision  for  credit  losses  may  be  required  that  would  adversely
impact earnings in future periods. The allowance is assigned to business segments, and any earnings impact resulting from actual outcomes differing from
management estimates would primarily affect the Commercial Bank segment.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

Investment securities available-for-sale, derivatives and deferred compensation plan assets and associated liabilities are recorded at fair value on a
recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, other assets and liabilities may be recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, such as impaired loans
that have been measured based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, loans held-for-sale recorded at the lower of cost or market, other real estate
(primarily  foreclosed  property),  nonmarketable  equity  securities  and  certain  other  assets  and  liabilities.  Nonrecurring  fair  value  adjustments  typically
involve write-downs of individual assets or application of lower of cost or fair value accounting.

Fair value is an estimate of the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction (i.e.,
not  a  forced  transaction,  such  as  a  liquidation  or  distressed  sale)  between  market  participants  at  the  measurement  date  and  is  based  on  the  assumptions
market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability. Fair value measurement and disclosure guidance establishes a three-level hierarchy for
disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements include information about the fair value
hierarchy, the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities, as well as the valuation methodologies and key inputs used.

At December 31, 2023, assets and liabilities measured using observable inputs that are classified as Level 1 or Level 2 represented substantially all
of  total  assets  and  liabilities  recorded  at  fair  value,  respectively.  Valuations  generated  from  model-based  techniques  that  use  at  least  one  significant
assumption not observable in the market are considered Level 3 and reflect estimates of assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or
liability. The valuation of Level 3 assets and liabilities are considered critical accounting estimates.

GOODWILL

Goodwill is initially recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination and is
subsequently  evaluated  at  least  annually  for  impairment.  Goodwill  impairment  testing  is  performed  at  the  reporting  unit  level,  equivalent  to  a  business
segment or one level below. The Corporation has three reporting units: the Commercial Bank, the Retail Bank, and Wealth Management. At December 31,
2023 and 2022, goodwill totaled $635 million, including $473 million allocated to the Commercial Bank, $101 million allocated to the Retail Bank, and
$61 million allocated to Wealth Management.

The Corporation performs its annual evaluation of goodwill impairment in the third quarter of each year and may elect to perform a quantitative
impairment  analysis  or  first  conduct  a  qualitative  analysis  to  determine  if  a  quantitative  analysis  is  necessary.  Additionally,  the  Corporation  evaluates
goodwill  impairment  on  an  interim  basis  if  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  between  annual  tests  indicate  additional  testing  may  be  warranted  to
determine if goodwill might be impaired.

During the third quarter of 2023, the Corporation elected to perform a quantitative impairment analysis. The estimated fair values of the reporting
units were determined using a blend of two commonly used valuation techniques: the market approach and the income approach. For the market approach,
valuations of reporting units considered a combination of earnings and equity multiples from companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit.
Since the fair values determined under the market approach are representative of noncontrolling interests, the valuations incorporated a control premium.
For the income approach, estimated future cash flows were derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations for each reporting unit. In the short-
and mid-term, forecasts incorporated current economic conditions and impacts of expected monetary policy decisions by the Federal Reserve Bank. Long-
term projections reflected normalized rate and credit environments, as well as a long-term rate of return for each reporting unit. Projections were discounted
using an applicable discount rate to calculate the fair value. The discount rate was based on the imputed cost of equity capital for each reporting unit, which
incorporates the risk-free rate of return, a market equity risk premium, potential stock volatility, and a size risk premium. The discount rate further reflected
the uncertainty of current economic conditions and potential impacts to the forecasted financial information.

The  combined  fair  value  of  all  units  was  compared  to  the  Corporation's  market  capitalization  for  reasonableness.  At  the  conclusion  of  the
quantitative  impairment  test  in  the  third  quarter  2023,  the  estimated  fair  values  of  all  reporting  units  substantially  exceeded  their  carrying  amounts,
including goodwill. The Corporation performed a hypothetical sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact to the estimated fair value of each reporting unit
from an adverse change in the discount rate. A 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in the fair value of each reporting unit to continue
to substantially exceed its carrying value.

The Corporation continues to monitor economic conditions that could significantly impact the impairment analysis and result in future goodwill
impairment  charges  that,  if  incurred,  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  Corporation's  results  of  operations  in  the  period  such  charges  are
recognized. Additionally, any new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in management's expectations may cause the fair value of one or more
of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Any impairment charge would not affect the Corporation's
regulatory capital ratios, tangible common equity ratio or liquidity position.

PENSION PLAN ACCOUNTING

The Corporation has a qualified and a non-qualified defined benefit pension plan. Effective January 1, 2017, benefits are calculated using a cash
balance formula based on years of service, age, compensation and an interest credit based on the 30-year Treasury rate. Participants under age 60 as of
December 31, 2016 are eligible to receive a frozen final average pay benefit in addition to amounts earned under the cash balance formula. Participants age
60 or older as of December 31, 2016 continue to be eligible for a final average pay benefit. The Corporation makes assumptions concerning future events
that will determine the amount and timing of required benefit payments, funding requirements and defined benefit pension expense. The major assumptions
are  the  discount  rate  used  in  determining  the  current  benefit  obligation,  the  long-term  rate  of  return  expected  on  plan  assets,  mix  of  assets  within  the
portfolio and the projected mortality rate.

The discount rate is determined by matching the expected cash flows of the pension plans to a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds as of the
measurement date, December 31. The long-term rate of return expected on plan assets is set after considering both long-term returns in the general market
and  long-term  returns  experienced  by  the  assets  in  the  plan.  The  current  target  asset  allocation  model  for  the  plans  is  provided  in  Note  17  to  the
consolidated financial statements. The expected returns on these various asset categories are blended to derive one long-term return assumption. The assets
are  primarily  invested  in  certain  collective  investment  funds,  common  stocks,  U.S.  Treasury  and  other  U.S.  government  agency  securities,  as  well  as
corporate and municipal bonds and notes. Mortality rate assumptions are based on mortality tables published by third

F-37

Table of Contents

parties such as the Society of Actuaries, considering other available information including historical data as well as studies and publications from reputable
sources.

The  Corporation  reviews  its  pension  plan  assumptions  on  an  annual  basis  with  its  actuarial  consultants  to  determine  if  the  assumptions  are
reasonable and adjusts the assumptions to reflect changes in future expectations. The major assumptions used to calculate 2024 and 2023 defined benefit
plan pension expense (benefit) were as follows:

Defined benefit plan benefit is expected to increase $19 million to approximately $45 million in 2024, compared to a benefit of $26 million in
2023. This includes service cost expense of $37 million and a benefit from other components of $82 million. Service costs are included in salaries and
benefits expense, while the benefit from other components are included in other noninterest expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

The Corporation’s pension plan is most sensitive to changes in discount rate and long-term rate of return. A change to the discount rate implies a
corresponding change in interest rates that affect the value of the plan’s fixed income assets. An increase of 25 basis points to the discount rate, including
the effect of higher interest rates on the plan’s fixed income assets, would result in a net increase to pension expense of $6 million, while a decrease of 25
basis points would reduce pension expense by $6 million. Increasing the long-term rate of return by 25 basis points would reduce pension expense by $7
million, while a decrease of 25 basis points would increase pension expense by $7 million.

Due to the long-term nature of pension plan assumptions, actual results may differ significantly from the actuarial-based estimates. Differences
resulting in actuarial gains or losses are required to be recorded in shareholders' equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss and amortized to
defined benefit pension expense in future years. Refer to Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.

INCOME TAXES

The  provision  for  income  taxes  is  the  sum  of  income  taxes  due  for  the  current  year  and  deferred  taxes.  Deferred  taxes  arise  from  temporary
differences between the income tax basis and financial accounting basis of assets and liabilities. Accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to or
to  be  received  from  taxing  jurisdictions,  currently  or  in  the  future,  and  are  included  in  accrued  income  and  other  assets  or  accrued  expenses  and  other
liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Included in net deferred taxes are deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for realization based on available evidence of projected
future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, assumptions made regarding future events and, when applicable, state loss carryback capacity. A
valuation  allowance  is  provided  when  it  is  more-likely-than-not  that  some  portion  of  the  deferred  tax  asset  will  not  be  realized.  Determining  whether
deferred tax assets are realizable is subjective and requires the use of significant judgment.

The  Corporation  assesses  the  relative  risks  and  merits  of  tax  positions  for  various  transactions  after  considering  statutes,  regulations,  judicial
precedent and other available information and maintains tax accruals consistent with these assessments. This assessment is complex and requires judgment.
The Corporation is subject to audit by taxing authorities that could question and/or challenge the tax positions taken by the Corporation. Changes in the
estimate  of  accrued  taxes  occur  due  to  changes  in  tax  law,  interpretations  of  existing  tax  laws,  new  judicial  or  regulatory  guidance,  the  status  of
examinations conducted by taxing authorities that impact the relative risks and merits of tax positions taken by the Corporation. These changes, when they
occur, impact the estimate of accrued taxes and could be significant to the operating results of the Corporation. For further information on tax accruals and
related risks, see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.

SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATA

The  Corporation  believes  non-GAAP  measures  are  meaningful  because  they  reflect  adjustments  commonly  made  by  management,  investors,
regulators  and  analysts  to  evaluate  the  adequacy  of  common  equity  and  performance  trends.  Tangible  common  equity  is  used  by  the  Corporation  to
measure  the  quality  of  capital  and  the  return  relative  to  balance  sheet  risk.  Common  equity  tier  1  capital  ratio  removes  preferred  stock  from  the  Tier  1
capital ratio as defined by and calculated in conformity with bank regulations. The tangible common equity ratio removes the effect of intangible assets
from  capital  and  total  assets.  Tangible  common  equity  per  share  of  common  stock  removes  the  effect  of  intangible  assets  from  common  shareholders'
equity per share of common stock.

financial position, strategies and growth prospects as well as general economic conditions expected to exist in the future are forward-looking statements.
The  words,  “anticipates,”  “believes,”  "contemplates,"  “feels,”  “expects,”  “estimates,”  “seeks,”  “strives,”  “plans,”  “intends,”  “outlook,”  “forecast,”

future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “might,” “can,” “may” or similar expressions, as they relate to the Corporation or its
management,  are  intended  to  identify  forward-looking  statements.  The  Corporation  cautions  that  forward-looking  statements  are  subject  to  numerous
assumptions,  risks  and  uncertainties,  which  change  over  time.  Forward-looking  statements  speak  only  as  of  the  date  the  statement  is  made,  and  the
Corporation does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect facts, circumstances, assumptions or events that occur after the date the
forward-looking statements are made. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements and future results could
differ materially from historical performance.
