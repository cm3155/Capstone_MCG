2020 OVERVIEW

Comerica  Incorporated  (the  Corporation)  is  a  financial  holding  company  headquartered  in  Dallas,  Texas.  The  Corporation's  major  business
segments are the Commercial Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. The core businesses are tailored to each of the Corporation's three primary
geographic  markets:  Michigan,  California  and  Texas.  Information  about  the  activities  of  the  Corporation's  business  and  market  segments  is  provided  in
Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements.

As a financial institution, the Corporation's principal activity is lending to and accepting deposits from businesses and individuals. The primary
source of revenue is net interest income, which is principally derived from the difference between interest earned on loans and investment securities and
interest paid on deposits and other funding sources. The Corporation also provides other products and services that meet the financial needs of customers
which generate noninterest income, the Corporation's secondary source of revenue. Growth in loans, deposits and noninterest income is affected by many
factors, including economic conditions in the markets the Corporation serves, the financial requirements and economic health of customers, and the ability
to  add  new  customers  and/or  increase  the  number  of  products  used  by  current  customers.  Success  in  providing  products  and  services  depends  on  the
financial needs of customers and the types of products desired.

The accounting and reporting policies of the Corporation and its subsidiaries conform to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the
United States (U.S.). The Corporation's consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant
of which are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. The most critical of these significant accounting policies are discussed in the
“Critical Accounting Policies” section of this financial review.

Full-Year 2020 compared to Full-Year 2019

• Net  income  decreased  $724  million,  or  60  percent,  to  $474  million,  driven  by  increased  provision  for  credit  losses  in  light  of  the  forecasted
impacts  related  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  lower  net  interest  income  resulting  from  a  lower  rate  environment.  Diluted  net  income  per
common share was $3.27 in 2020 compared to $7.87 in 2019.

• Average  loans  increased  $1.1  billion,  or  2  percent,  to  $51.6  billion.  The  increase  primarily  reflected  increases  in  Mortgage  Banker  Finance,
Commercial Real Estate and smaller increases in Business, Retail and Corporate Banking, partially offset by decreases in National Dealer Services
and Energy. In 2020, the Corporation participated as a lender in the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), created
in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Average PPP loans for 2020 were $2.5 billion.

• Average  securities  increased  $1.3  billion,  or  11  percent,  to  $13.4  billion,  as  a  portion  of  excess  liquidity  was  invested  in  $1.8  billion  of  U.S.

Treasury bonds and $500 million of mortgage-backed securities in the third quarter 2020.

• Average  deposits  increased  $9.6  billion,  or  17  percent,  to  a  record  level  of  $65.0  billion,  driven  by  customers  conserving  cash  in  an  uncertain
economy.  Average  noninterest-bearing  deposits  increased  $6.4  billion,  or  24  percent,  while  average  interest-bearing  deposits  increased  $3.2
billion, or 11 percent.

• Net  interest  income  decreased  $428  million  to  $1.9  billion  and  the  net  interest  margin  decreased  100  basis  points  to  2.54  percent,  primarily

•

reflecting the impact of lower interest rates.
The  provision  for  credit  losses  increased  $463  million  to  $537  million  in  2020  from  $74  million  in  2019,  reflecting  credit  migration  and  the
forecasted impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the economic impacts of social distancing which peaked during the first half of 2020,
and pressures on Energy.

• Noninterest income was relatively stable at $1.0 billion, reflecting decreases in service charges on deposit accounts and commercial lending fees,

partially offset by increases in securities trading income and card fees.

• Noninterest expenses increased $41 million to $1.8 billion, primarily due to increases in operational losses, outside processing fee expense (net of
cloud  computing  accounting  classification  change)  and  FDIC  insurance  expense,  as  well  as  additional  expenses  related  to  COVID-19,  which
included compensation and stipends to colleagues, charitable contributions, cleaning supplies, personal protective equipment and PPP technology
costs.
The provision for income taxes decreased $217 million to $117 million, primarily due to lower pre-tax income.
The Corporation repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares of common stock prior to the suspension of the share repurchase program in first
quarter 2020 and issued cash dividends of $2.72 per share, returning a total of $567 million to common shareholders.
The Corporation issued $400 million of 5.625% non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock in second quarter 2020, resulting in preferred dividends
declared of $13 million.

(a) Rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume.

        Net  interest  income  is  the  difference  between  interest  earned  on  assets  and  interest  paid  on  liabilities.  Gains  and  losses  related  to  risk  management
interest rate swaps that convert fixed rate debt to a floating rate and qualify as fair value hedges are included in interest expense on medium- and long-term
debt. Additionally, the portion of gains and losses on risk management interest rate swaps that convert variable-rate loans to fixed rates through cash flow
hedges that relate to the earnings effect of the hedged loans during the period are included in loan interest income. Refer to the Analysis of Net Interest
Income  and  the  Rate/Volume  Analysis  tables  above  for  an  analysis  of  net  interest  income  for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2020,  2019  and  2018  and
details of the components of the change in net interest income for 2020 compared to 2019 as well as 2019 compared to 2018.

Net interest income was $1.9 billion, a decrease of $428 million, and net interest margin decreased 100 basis points to 2.54 percent, both primarily
reflecting the impact of lower interest rates. Average earning assets increased $9.3 billion, primarily reflecting increases of $6.8 billion in lower-yielding
interest-bearing  deposits  with  banks  and  $2.5  billion  in  PPP  loans.  Average  funding  sources  increased  $2.7  billion,  reflecting  a  $3.2  billion  increase  in
interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a $406 million decrease in medium- and long-term debt.

The Corporation utilizes various asset and liability management strategies to manage net interest income exposure to interest rate risk. Refer to the
“Market and Liquidity Risk” section of this financial review for additional information regarding the Corporation's asset and liability management policies
and the “Balance Sheet and Capital Funds Analysis” section for further discussion on changes in earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.

Provision for Credit Losses

The provision for credit losses, which includes the provision for loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments,
calculated under the current expected credit loss (CECL) model for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, increased $463 million to $537 million,
primarily driven by credit migration and the forecasted impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the first half of 2020, including the economic impacts of
social distancing, as well as pressures on

Energy.  Net  loan  charge-offs  increased  $89  million  to  $196  million,  or  0.38  percent  of  average  total  loans,  compared  to  $107  million,  or  0.21  percent.
Energy  net  loan  charge-offs  increased  $39  million  to  $125  million,  while  general  Middle  Market  net  loan  charge-offs  increased  by  $37  million  to  $38
million.

An analysis of the allowance for credit losses and a summary of nonperforming assets are presented under the "Credit Risk" subheading in the
"Risk Management" section of this financial review. Further information about the adoption of CECL is presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements.

(a) The table below provides further details on certain categories included in other noninterest income.

Noninterest income was relatively stable at $1.0 billion. Decreases in service charges on deposit accounts, commercial lending fees, brokerage
fees, customer derivative income, foreign exchange income and income from principal investing and warrants were mostly offset by increases in securities
trading income, card fees, investment banking fees and deferred compensation asset returns (offset in noninterest expenses). Noninterest income was also
impacted by a $7 million reduction in net securities losses, primarily due to a repositioning loss recorded in 2019, as well as a gain recorded in the fourth
quarter of 2019 on the sale of Comerica's Health Savings Account (HSA) business.

Card  fees  consist  primarily  of  interchange  and  other  fee  income  earned  on  government  prepaid  card,  commercial  card,  debit/Automated  Teller
Machine  (ATM)  card  and  merchant  payment  processing  services.  Card  fees  increased  $13  million,  or  5  percent,  driven  by  volume  increases  in  the
government  card  program  from  stimulus  payments  under  the  Coronavirus  Aid,  Relief,  and  Economic  Security  Act,  as  amended  by  the  Consolidated
Appropriations  Act  of  2021  (CARES  Act),  resulting  in  higher  interchange  revenue,  partially  offset  by  a  decrease  in  commercial  and  consumer  card
volumes due to the impact of social distancing restrictions.

Service charges on deposit accounts consist primarily of charges on retail and business accounts, including fees for treasury management services.
Service  charges  on  deposit  accounts  decreased  $18  million,  or  9  percent.  The  decrease  reflected  pandemic-driven  changes  in  customer  behavior.  On
commercial  accounts,  activity  levels  declined,  while  earnings  credit  allowances  provided  to  customers  increased  due  to  growth  in  deposit  balances.
Additionally, consumer accounts were impacted by reduced non-sufficient funds and overdraft fees.

Commercial lending fees include fees assessed on the unused portion of lines of credit (unused commitment fees), syndication agent fees and loan

servicing fees. These fees decreased $14 million, or 15 percent, reflecting a decrease in syndication agent fees.

Foreign  exchange  income  decreased  $4  million,  or  8  percent,  due  to  pandemic-related  disruptions  to  international  business  flows  and  global

shutdowns throughout the year.

Brokerage  fees  are  commissions  earned  for  facilitating  securities  transactions  for  customers  as  well  as  other  brokerage  services  provided.
Brokerage fees decreased $7 million, or 23 percent, primarily due to lower money market funds fee revenue driven by spread reductions in fees earned as a
result of the decline in the fed funds rate in early 2020.

Other noninterest income increased $9 million, or 8 percent, driven by increases of $14 million in securities trading income due to fair value gains
from  previously  converted  warrants,  $7  million  in  deferred  compensation  asset  returns  (offset  in  noninterest  expenses)  and  $5  million  in  investment
banking  fees.  These  increases  were  partially  offset  by  the  $6  million  decrease  from  the  gain  on  sale  of  Comerica's  HSA  business  in  2019,  as  well  as
decreases of $5 million in customer derivative income and $4 million in income from principal investing and warrants.

Includes classification adjustments related to costs incurred in cloud computing arrangements of $33 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. These
adjustments reduce outside processing fee expense and increase software expense due to the prospective adoption of ASU No. 2018-15, effective January 1, 2020.

Noninterest  expenses  increased  $41  million  to  $1.8  billion.  The  change  in  noninterest  expenses  was  primarily  due  to  increases  in  operational
losses, outside processing fee expense (net of classification change) and FDIC insurance expense, partially offset by a decrease in travel and entertainment
expense. Expenses incurred during 2020 included approximately $18 million related to COVID-19, primarily for compensation and stipends to colleagues,
charitable contributions, cleaning supplies, personal protective equipment and PPP technology costs.

Salaries and benefits expense was stable at $1.0 billion, reflecting lower incentive and annual stock-based compensation, mostly offset by merit

increases and higher deferred compensation expense (offset in noninterest income).

Outside processing fee expense, net of the $33 million classification change, increased $11 million, or 4 percent, primarily due to volume-driven
increases in government card processing expenses tied to card fee revenues and increased mortgage application volumes, partially offset by decreases in
service fees associated with credit and collection.

FDIC insurance expense increased $10 million, or 43 percent, to $33 million, primarily due to higher risk-based assessment fees.

Other noninterest expenses increased $15 million and included increases of $16 million in operational losses related to several unrelated events, $5
million in other pension and postretirement benefit costs and $4 million in charitable contributions, partially offset by a $10 million reduction in travel and
entertainment expense related to the pandemic.

Income Taxes and Related Items

The  provision  for  income  taxes  was  $117  million  in  2020,  compared  to  $334  million  in  2019.  The  $217  million  decrease  in  the  provision  for

income taxes primarily reflected lower pre-tax income partially offset by an $11 million decrease in tax benefits from employee stock transactions.

Net  deferred  tax  assets  were  $4  million  at  December  31,  2020,  compared  to  $42  million  at  December  31,  2019.  Refer  to  Note  18  to  the
consolidated financial statements for information about the components of net deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets of $404 million were evaluated for
realization  and  it  was  determined  that  a  valuation  allowance  of  $3  million  related  to  state  net  operating  loss  carryforwards  was  needed  at  both
December 31, 2020 and 2019. These conclusions were based on

available evidence of projected future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, assumptions made regarding future events and, when applicable,
state loss carryback capacity.

First Quarter 2021 Outlook

FIRST QUARTER 2021 OUTLOOK

This outlook is based on management expectations for gradual improvement in economic conditions.
• Decline in average loans reflects decreases in Mortgage Banker Finance and Energy, partially offset by growth in National Dealer Services and general

Middle Market. PPP loan forgiveness potentially exceeds additional advances.

• Average deposits to remain strong.

• Decline in net interest income with lower average loan balances, LIBOR and security yields as well as two fewer days in the quarter, partially offset by

careful management of loan and deposit pricing.

•

Provision for credit losses reflects pace of economic recovery; net charge-offs modestly higher.

• Decrease in noninterest income as fourth quarter levels of deferred compensation asset returns, card fees, warrants and securities trading income not
expected  to  repeat,  as  well  as  a  seasonal  reduction  in  syndication  fees;  partly  offset  by  increases  in  service  charges  on  deposit  accounts,  fiduciary
income and brokerage fees.

• Decrease  in  noninterest  expenses  reflects  lower  deferred  compensation  and  pension  expenses,  seasonal  reduction  in  occupancy,  staff  insurance  and

advertising, as well as two less days in the quarter; partially offset by higher annual stock-based compensation.

•

Income tax expense to be approximately 22 percent of pre-tax income, excluding discrete items.

• Maintain strong capital levels. Preferred stock dividends of $6 million.

STRATEGIC LINES OF BUSINESS AND MARKETS

The Corporation has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments: the Commercial Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth
Management. These business segments are differentiated based on the type of customer and the related products and services provided. In addition to the
three  major  business  segments,  the  Finance  Division  is  also  reported  as  a  segment.  The  Other  category  includes  items  not  directly  associated  with  the
business segments or the Finance segment. The performance of the business segments is not comparable with the Corporation's consolidated results and is
not  necessarily  comparable  with  similar  information  for  any  other  financial  institution.  Additionally,  because  of  the  interrelationships  of  the  various
segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. Market segment results
are  also  provided  for  the  Corporation's  three  primary  geographic  markets:  Michigan,  California  and  Texas.  In  addition  to  the  three  primary  geographic
markets,  Other  Markets  is  also  reported  as  a  market  segment.  Note  22  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  describes  the  Corporation's  segment
reporting methodology as well as the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of the business and market segments for the
years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.

The  Corporation's  management  accounting  system  assigns  balance  sheet  and  income  statement  items  to  each  segment  using  certain
methodologies, which are regularly reviewed and refined. These methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and
changes occur in the organizational structure and/or product lines.

Net interest income for each segment reflects the interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities
plus the net impact from associated internal funds transfer pricing (FTP). The FTP methodology allocates credits to each business segment for deposits and
other funds provided as well as charges for loans and other assets being funded. FTP crediting rates on deposits and other funds provided reflect the long-
term value of deposits and other funding sources based on their implied maturities. Due to the longer-term nature of implied maturities, FTP crediting rates
are generally less volatile than changes in interest rates observed in the market. FTP charge rates for funding loans and other assets reflect a matched cost
of funds based on the pricing and duration characteristics of the assets. As a result of applying matched funding, interest revenue for each segment resulting
from loans and other assets is generally not impacted by changes in interest rates. Therefore, net interest income for each segment primarily reflects the
volume of loans and other earning assets at the spread over the matched cost of funds, as well as the volume of deposits at the associated FTP crediting
rates.  As  overall  interest  rates  decreased  in  2020,  business  segments,  particularly  those  focused  on  generating  deposits,  were  impacted  by  lower  FTP
crediting  rates  on  deposits  compared  to  the  prior  year.  Similarly,  FTP  charges  for  funding  loans  decreased  in  2020.  Effective  January  1,  2019,  the
Corporation prospectively discontinued allocating an additional FTP charge for the cost of maintaining liquid assets to support potential draws on unfunded
loan commitments.

The $646 million increase in average loans primarily reflected growth in Mortgage Banker Finance, due to elevated activity, Commercial Real
Estate  and  Business  Banking,  partially  offset  by  decreases  in  National  Dealer  Services,  due  to  an  imbalance  in  supply  and  demand  resulting  in  lower
inventory, and Energy. The 2020 period included average PPP loans totaling $2.0 billion. Average deposits increased $7.6 billion, reflecting increases in all
deposit categories, as customers conserved cash due to an uncertain economy. The Commercial Bank's net income decreased $361 million to $660 million.
Net interest income decreased $47 million to $1.6 billion, primarily due to lower interest income from deposits (FTP basis). The provision for credit losses
increased $407 million to $495 million, reflecting credit migration and the forecasted impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Net credit-related charge-offs
increased $81 million to $192 million, primarily due to increases in Energy and general Middle Market. Noninterest income was stable, while noninterest
expenses increased $31 million, primarily reflecting increased corporate overhead and higher FDIC insurance expense, partially offset by lower salaries
and benefits expense.

Middle Market business lines generally serve customers with annual revenue between $30 million and $500 million. Within the Middle Market
business lines, the largest changes were decreases in National Dealer Services and Energy. National Dealer Services provides floor plan inventory financing
and commercial mortgages to auto dealerships. The $1.7 billion decrease in National Dealer Services loans reflected an imbalance in supply and demand
resulting  in  lower  inventory.  Customers  in  the  Energy  business  line  are  primarily  engaged  in  the  oil  and  gas  businesses.  The  $428  million  decrease  in
Energy loans reflected lower oil and gas prices as well as reduced production activity. For more information on Energy loans, refer to "Energy Lending" in
the "Risk Management" section of this financial review.

Mortgage Banker Finance provides short-term, revolving lines of credit to independent mortgage banking companies and therefore partly reflects
the level of home sales and refinancing activity in the market as a whole. The $1.0 billion increase was primarily due to elevated activity resulting from the
lower interest rate environment.

Commercial Real Estate is comprised of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans. Real estate construction loans primarily include
loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line, which generally serve commercial real estate developers. Commercial mortgage loans are loans where
the primary collateral is a lien on any real property and are primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real estate. Real property is generally considered
primary  collateral  if  the  value  of  that  collateral  represents  more  than  50  percent  of  the  commitment  at  loan  approval.  The  $969  million  increase  in
Commercial  Real  Estate  was  primarily  driven  by  additional  draws  on  existing  multifamily,  industrial  and  storage  construction  lines,  a  slowdown  in
prepayments due to current economic conditions and increased term debt financing.

Investment securities were $15.0 billion at December 31, 2020 and $12.4 billion at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2020, the weighted-
average expected life of the Corporation's residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio was approximately 2.9 years. On an average basis, investment
securities increased $1.3 billion to $13.4 billion in 2020, compared to $12.1 billion in 2019, as a portion of excess liquidity was invested in $1.8 billion of
U.S. Treasury bonds and $500 million of mortgage-backed securities in the third quarter of 2020.

The Corporation repositioned treasury securities in 2019 by selling $1.0 billion and purchasing higher-yielding treasuries, which resulted in after-

tax losses of $6 million.

Interest-Bearing Deposits with Banks and Other Short-Term Investments

Interest-bearing  deposits  with  banks  primarily  include  deposits  with  the  Federal  Reserve  Bank  (FRB)  and  also  include  deposits  with  banks  in
developed countries or international banking facilities of foreign banks located in the United States. Interest-bearing deposits with banks are mostly used to
manage  liquidity  requirements  of  the  Corporation.  Interest-bearing  deposits  with  banks  increased  $9.9  billion  to  $14.7  billion  at  December  31,  2020,
resulting from growth in relationship-based deposits as customers conserve cash in an uncertain economy. On an average basis, interest-bearing deposits
with banks increased $6.8 billion to $10.2 billion in 2020.

Other short-term investments include federal funds sold, trading securities, money market investments and loans held-for-sale. Substantially all
trading securities are deferred compensation plan assets. Loans held-for-sale typically represent residential mortgage loans originated with management's
intention to sell and, from time to time, other loans that are transferred to held-for-sale. Other short-term investments increased $17 million to $172 million
at December 31, 2020. On an average basis, other short-term investments increased $10 million to $153 million in 2020.

Average  deposits  increased  $9.6  billion  to  $65.0  billion  in  2020,  compared  to  $55.5  billion  in  2019,  reflecting  increases  of  $6.4  billion  in
noninterest-bearing and $3.2 billion in interest-bearing deposits. The increases were primarily the result of customers continuing to conserve cash in the
face of the current uncertain economic climate.

There were no short-term borrowings at December 31, 2020, compared to $71 million at December 31, 2019. Short-term borrowings primarily
include federal funds purchased, short-term FHLB advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase. Average short-term borrowings decreased
$55 million, to $314 million in 2020, compared to $369 million in 2019.

The Corporation uses medium- and long-term debt, which includes long-term FHLB advances, medium- and long-term senior notes as well as
subordinated  notes,  to  provide  funding  for  earning  assets,  liquidity  and  regulatory  capital.  Total  medium-  and  long-term  debt  at  December  31,  2020
decreased $1.5 billion to $5.7 billion, compared to $7.3 billion at December 31, 2019. The decrease primarily reflected the early redemption of $1.0 billion
of  FHLB  advances,  as  well  as  the  maturity  of  $675  million  of  medium-term  notes.  Average  medium-  and  long-term  debt  decreased  $406  million,  or  6
percent, to $6.5 billion in 2020, compared to $7.0 billion in 2019.

Further information on medium- and long-term debt is provided in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.

(b) Includes approximately 112,000 shares purchased pursuant to deferred compensation plans and shares purchased from employees to pay for taxes related to restricted
stock vesting under the terms of an employee share-based compensation plan during the year ended December 31, 2020. These transactions are not considered part of
the Corporation's repurchase program.

In March 2020, as the economic climate grew increasingly uncertain, the Corporation suspended its share repurchase program with a focus on
deploying capital to meet customers' growing financing requirements, resulting in no share repurchases under the program for the remainder of the year.
The Corporation will continue to assess the resumption of repurchases subject to various factors including financial performance, capital needs and market
conditions. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in 2010, a total of 87.2 million shares have been authorized for repurchase. There is no
expiration date for the share repurchase program.

In May 2020, the Corporation issued $400 million of 5.625% non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, which yielded $394 million in proceeds
net of underwriting discounts and offering expenses. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the terms of the
preferred stock.

The Corporation is prepared to continue using capital and liquidity in a responsible way to assist customers impacted by the COVID-19 crisis with
a target of attaining and maintaining a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio of approximately 10 percent. At December 31, 2020, the Corporation's
CET1 capital ratio was 10.34 percent, an increase of 21 basis points compared to December 31, 2019.

The  Corporation  is  subject  to  the  capital  adequacy  standards  under  the  Basel  III  regulatory  framework  (Basel  III).  This  regulatory  framework
establishes comprehensive methodologies for calculating regulatory capital and risk-weighted assets (RWA). Basel III also set minimum capital ratios as
well as overall capital adequacy standards.

Under  Basel  III,  regulatory  capital  comprises  CET1  capital,  additional  Tier  1  capital  and  Tier  II  capital.  CET1  capital  predominantly  includes
common  shareholders'  equity,  less  certain  deductions  for  goodwill,  intangible  assets  and  deferred  tax  assets  that  arise  from  net  operating  losses  and  tax
credit  carry-forwards.  Additionally,  the  Corporation  has  elected  to  permanently  exclude  capital  in  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  (AOCI)
related to debt and equity securities classified as available-for-sale as well as for cash flow hedges and defined benefit postretirement plans from CET1, an
option available to standardized approach entities under Basel III. Tier 1 capital incrementally includes noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2
capital includes Tier 1 capital as well as subordinated debt qualifying as Tier 2 and qualifying allowance for credit losses. In 2020, the Corporation elected
regulatory relief to defer the impact of adopting the CECL model for measuring credit losses on regulatory capital. At December 31, 2020, $72 million, or a
cumulative 11-basis-point benefit to the capital ratios, was deferred. Also in 2020, the Corporation adopted capital rules issued by federal banking agencies
that simplified certain regulatory capital rules, including the capital treatment of mortgage servicing assets, certain deferred tax assets, investments in the
capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions and minority interests. For further information about the adoption of CECL, refer to Note 1 to
the consolidated financial statement.

The Corporation computes RWA using the standardized approach. Under the standardized approach, RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-
weightings which vary by counterparty type and asset class. Under the Basel III standardized approach, capital is required for credit risk RWA, to cover the
risk of unexpected losses due to failure of a customer or counterparty to meet its financial obligations in accordance with contractual terms; and if trading
assets and liabilities exceed certain thresholds, capital is also required for market risk RWA, to cover the risk of losses due to adverse market movements or
from position-specific factors.

RISK MANAGEMENT

The  Corporation  assumes  various  types  of  risk  as  a  result  of  conducting  business  in  the  normal  course.  The  Corporation's  enterprise  risk
management  framework  provides  a  process  for  identifying,  measuring,  controlling  and  managing  these  risks.  This  framework  incorporates  a  risk
assessment process, a collection of risk committees that manage the Corporation's major risk elements and a risk appetite statement that outlines the levels
and  types  of  risks  the  Corporation  accepts.  The  Corporation  continuously  enhances  its  enterprise  risk  framework  with  additional  processes,  tools  and
systems designed to not only provide management with deeper insight into the various existing and emerging risks in accordance with its appetite for risk,
but also to improve the Corporation's ability to control those risks and ensure that appropriate consideration is received for the risks taken.

The Corporation’s front line employees, the first line of defense, are responsible for the day-to-day management and ownership of risks, including
the identification, assessment, measurement and control of risks encountered as a part of the normal course of business. Each of the major risk categories
are further monitored and measured by specialized risk managers in the second line of defense within the Enterprise Risk Division, who provide oversight,
independent and effective challenge and guidance for the risk management activities of the organization. The Enterprise Risk Division, led by the Chief
Risk Officer, is responsible for designing and managing the Corporation’s enterprise risk management framework and ensures effective risk management
oversight. Risk management committees serve as a point of review and escalation for those risks which may have risk interdependencies or where risk
levels may be nearing the limits outlined in the Corporation’s risk appetite statement. These committees comprise senior and executive management that
represent  views  from  both  the  lines  of  business  and  risk  management.  Internal  Audit,  the  third  line  of  defense,  monitors  and  assesses  the  overall
effectiveness of the risk management framework on an ongoing basis and provides an independent, objective assessment of the Corporation’s ability to
manage and control risk to management and the Audit Committee of the Board.

The  Enterprise-Wide  Risk  Management  Committee,  chaired  by  the  Chief  Risk  Officer,  is  established  by  the  Enterprise  Risk  Committee  of  the
Board, and is responsible for governance over the risk management framework, providing oversight in managing the Corporation's aggregate risk position
and reporting on the comprehensive portfolio of risks as well as the potential impact these risks can have on the Corporation's risk profile and resulting
capital level. Capital provides the primary buffer for risk and also serves as a measuring tool when evaluating risk. The Enterprise-Wide Risk Management
Committee  is  principally  composed  of  senior  officers  and  executives  representing  the  different  risk  areas  and  business  units  who  are  appointed  by  the
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation.

The Board's Enterprise Risk Committee meets quarterly and is chartered to assist the Board in promoting the best interests of the Corporation by
overseeing policies and risk practices relating to enterprise-wide risk and ensuring compliance with bank regulatory obligations. Members of the Enterprise
Risk Committee are selected such that the committee comprises individuals whose experiences and qualifications can lead to broad and informed views on
risk matters facing the Corporation and the financial services industry. These include, but are not limited to, existing and emerging risk matters related to
credit,  market,  liquidity,  operational,  technology,  compliance  and  strategic  conditions.  A  comprehensive  risk  report  is  submitted  to  the  Enterprise  Risk
Committee each quarter providing management's view of the Corporation's aggregate risk position.

Further discussion and analyses of each major risk area are included in the following sub-sections of the Risk Management section in this financial

review.

Credit Risk

Credit risk represents the risk of loss due to failure of a customer or counterparty to meet its financial obligations in accordance with contractual
terms. Credit risk is found in all activities where success depends on counterparty, issuer or borrower performance. It arises any time funds are extended,
committed, invested or otherwise exposed, whether reflected on or off the balance sheet. The governance structure is administered through the Strategic
Credit  Committee.  The  Strategic  Credit  Committee  is  chaired  by  the  Chief  Credit  Officer  and  approves  recommendations  to  address  credit  risk  matters
through  credit  policy,  credit  risk  management  practices  and  required  credit  risk  actions.  The  Strategic  Credit  Committee  also  ensures  a  comprehensive
reporting of credit risk levels and trends, including exception levels, along with identification and mitigation of emerging risks. In order to facilitate the
corporate  credit  risk  management  process,  various  other  corporate  functions  provide  the  resources  for  the  Strategic  Credit  Committee  to  carry  out  its
responsibilities. The Corporation manages credit risk through underwriting and periodically reviewing and approving its credit exposures using approved
credit  policies  and  guidelines.  Additionally,  the  Corporation  manages  credit  risk  through  loan  portfolio  diversification,  limiting  exposure  to  any  single
industry, customer or guarantor, and selling participations and/or syndicating credit exposures above those levels it deems prudent to third parties.

The Credit Division manages credit policy and provides the resources to manage the line of business transactional credit risk, assuring that all
exposure is risk rated according to the requirements of the credit risk rating policy and providing business segment reporting support as necessary. The
Enterprise  Risk  Division  provides  credible  and  well-documented  challenge  of  overall  portfolio  credit  risk,  and  other  credit-related  attributes  of  the
Corporation's loan portfolios, with a particular

emphasis on all attendant modeled results. The Corporation's Asset Quality Review function, a division of Internal Audit, audits the accuracy of internal
risk ratings that are assigned by the lending and credit groups. The Special Assets Group is responsible for managing the recovery process on distressed or
defaulted loans and loan sales.

Portfolio  Risk  Analytics,  within  the  Credit  Division,  provides  comprehensive  reporting  on  portfolio  credit  risk  levels  and  trends,  continuous
assessment  and  verification  of  risk  rating  models,  quarterly  calculation  of  the  allowance  for  loan  losses  and  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  on  lending-
related commitments and calculations of both expected and unexpected loss.

Allowance for Credit Losses

The allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments.
Effective January 1, 2020, the allowance for credit losses reflected the adoption of Topic 326, which requires companies to estimate credit losses using the
CECL  framework.  As  a  percentage  of  total  loans,  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  was  1.90  percent  at  December  31,  2020,  compared  to  1.33  percent  at
December 31, 2019. Excluding $3.5 billion in PPP loans, which are guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, the allowance for credit losses was
2.03  percent  of  total  loans  at  December  31,  2020.  The  allowance  for  credit  losses  covered  2.8  times  and  3.3  times  total  nonperforming  loans  at
December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.

At adoption on January 1, 2020, the scope and severity of the economic crisis resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic were unknown. As such,
the  economic  scenario  used  by  the  Corporation  to  develop  its  estimate  of  CECL  as  of  the  adoption  date  reflected  a  continued  moderate  U.S.  economic
expansion compared to 2019 levels and a stable interest rate environment, with the federal funds rate remaining in the 1.50- to 1.75-percent range. Other
assumptions  included  the  resolution  of  trade  tensions,  a  calmer  global  economy  and  a  strong  U.S.  dollar,  all  of  which  supported  modest  industrial
production growth and stable oil prices. The forecast also assumed strong labor market conditions to support the consumer sector. Management considered
the level of uncertainty regarding its economic assumptions as part of the qualitative adjustment. The adoption of CECL resulted in a $17 million day-one
decrease in the allowance for credit losses, from $668 million at December 31, 2019 under the incurred loss model. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements for further information about the adoption of CECL.

The allowance for credit losses increased by $341 million from the adoption date to $992 million at December 31, 2020, primarily reflecting the
economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the response by domestic and global governmental authorities, including quarantines and other social
distancing policies aimed at fighting the spread of the virus. In early 2020, energy markets, which were experiencing stress prior to the pandemic, were
further impacted by the rapid decline in demand resulting from social distancing policies. Energy prices and demand improved in the second half of 2020
as the economy began to recover, but energy markets remain uncertain.

The U.S. economy contracted into a recession with unusual speed and force in the first half of 2020, ending the longest expansionary period in
U.S. history. The U.S. government and the Federal Reserve responded to the pandemic with unprecedented measures. The Federal Reserve reduced the
target federal funds rate to zero to 0.25 percent and Congress passed the CARES Act that included an estimated $2 trillion stimulus package. Although the
U.S. economy began to recover in third quarter 2020 as social distancing policies loosened, economic metrics in fourth quarter 2020 indicate an uneven
path to recovery. In December 2020, Congress amended the CARES Act through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 to add an additional $900
billion  of  stimulus  relief  to  mitigate  the  continued  impacts  of  the  pandemic.  While  certain  factors  point  to  improving  economic  conditions,  uncertainty
remains  regarding  the  path  of  the  economic  recovery,  the  mitigating  impacts  of  government  interventions,  the  success  of  vaccine  distribution  and  the
efficacy of administered vaccines, as well as the effects of the change in leadership resulting from the recent elections.

These factors shaped the 2-year reasonable and supportable forecast used by the Corporation in its CECL modeled estimate at December 31, 2020.
After  a  partial  rebound  in  real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  in  third  and  fourth  quarters  2020,  forecasted  GDP  reaches  pre-pandemic,  fourth
quarter 2019 levels by the latter portion of 2021, normalizing into historical growth rates in the second half of the forecast period. Forecasts for other key
economic variables, including the unemployment rate and oil prices, are generally in line with GDP projections. Interest rates remain low, reflecting the
Federal Reserve's expectation that rates will remain at current levels in the near-to mid-term, while corporate bond rates reflect decreasing default risk, with
slight  improvements  as  the  forecasted  horizon  moved  by  one  quarter.  Economic  forecasts  for  fourth  quarter  2020  were  generally  consistent  with  third
quarter 2020 forecasts. The following table summarizes the forecasts for the economic variables most impactful to the allowance for credit losses estimate
at December 31, 2020.

Growth peaks at 4 percent in second and third quarters 2021, normalizing into long-

Current levels gradually decrease throughout forecast period to 5 percent by fourth
quarter 2022.
Spreads  at  normalized  levels  between  1.5  and  1.7  percent  throughout  the  forecast
period.
Prices steadily increase from $40 to $53 per barrel by fourth quarter 2022.

Due  to  the  high  degree  of  uncertainty  regarding  the  ultimate  economic  consequences  of  the  pandemic,  as  well  as  the  effectiveness  of  the
government's stimulus packages, management considered other economic scenarios to make appropriate qualitative adjustments for certain sectors of its
lending portfolio, including more benign and more severe forecasts.

Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit

losses.

Allowance for Loan Losses

The allowance for loan losses represents management’s estimates of current expected credit losses in the Corporation’s loan portfolio. Pools of
loans  with  similar  risk  characteristics  are  collectively  evaluated,  while  loans  that  no  longer  share  risk  characteristics  with  loan  pools  are  evaluated
individually.

Collective  loss  estimates  are  determined  by  applying  reserve  factors,  designed  to  estimate  current  expected  credit  losses,  to  amortized  cost
balances over the remaining contractual life of the collectively evaluated portfolio. Loans with similar risk characteristics are aggregated into homogeneous
pools. The allowance for loan losses also includes qualitative adjustments to bring the allowance to the level management believes is appropriate based on
factors that have not otherwise been fully accounted for, including adjustments for foresight risk, input imprecisions and model imprecision. Credit losses
for  loans  that  no  longer  share  risk  characteristics  with  the  loan  pools  are  estimated  on  an  individual  basis.  Individual  credit  loss  estimates  are  typically
performed for nonaccrual loans and modified loans classified as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) and are based on one of several methods, including the
estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, observable market value of similar debt or the present value of expected cash flows.    

Allowance for Credit Losses on Lending-Related Commitments

The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments estimates current expected credit losses on collective pools of letters of credit and
unused  commitments  to  extend  credit  based  on  reserve  factors,  determined  in  a  manner  similar  to  business  loans,  multiplied  by  a  probability  of  draw
estimate based on historical experience and credit risk, applied to commitment amounts.

Nonperforming Assets

Nonperforming assets include loans on nonaccrual status, TDRs which have been renegotiated to less than the original contractual rates (reduced-
rate  loans)  and  foreclosed  assets.  TDRs  include  performing  and  nonperforming  loans,  with  nonperforming  TDRs  on  either  nonaccrual  or  reduced-rate
status. In accordance with the provisions of the CARES Act, the Corporation elected not to consider qualifying COVID-19-related modifications, primarily
deferrals, as TDRs and does not designate such loans as past due or nonaccrual. For additional information regarding the Corporation's accounting policies
for the CARES Act, refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.

Nonperforming assets increased $144 million to $359 million at December 31, 2020, from $215 million at December 31, 2019. Nonperforming

assets were 0.69 percent of total loans and foreclosed property at December 31, 2020, compared to 0.43 percent at December 31, 2019.

As of December 31, 2020, COVID-19-related payment deferrals totaled $141 million, or 0.27 percent of total loans, representing approximately
100 obligors and consisting of 58 percent retail loans, primarily residential mortgages, and 42 percent commercial loans. Initial deferrals have expired and
new  requests  have  been  nominal  as  customers  continue  to  adjust  to  the  new  environment,  resulting  in  a  $244  million  decrease  in  deferrals  since  third
quarter 2020. Loans with COVID-19-related deferred payments on a third deferral, primarily residential mortgages, totaled $72 million at December 31,
2020 and would generally be considered TDRs if not for the provisions in the CARES Act.

Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest generally represent loans that are well collateralized and in the process of collection.
Loans past due 90 days or more increased $19 million to $45 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $26 million at December 31, 2019. Loans past
due 30-89 days increased $277 million to $404 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $127 million at December 31, 2019. An aging analysis of loans
included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements provides further information about the balances comprising past due loans.

The  following  table  presents  a  summary  of  total  criticized  loans.  The  Corporation's  criticized  list  is  consistent  with  the  Special  Mention,
Substandard and Doubtful categories defined by regulatory authorities. Criticized loans with balances of $2 million or more on nonaccrual status or loans
with  balances  of  $1  million  or  more  whose  terms  have  been  modified  in  a  TDR  are  individually  subjected  to  quarterly  credit  quality  reviews,  and  the
Corporation may establish specific allowances for such loans. A table of loans by credit quality indicator included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial
statements provides further information about the balances comprising total criticized loans.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Concentrations of credit risk may exist when a number of borrowers are engaged in similar activities, or activities in the same geographic region,
and have similar economic characteristics that would cause them to be similarly impacted by changes in economic or other conditions. The Corporation has
concentrations  of  credit  risk  with  the  commercial  real  estate  and  automotive  industries.  All  other  industry  concentrations,  as  defined  by  management,
individually represented less than 10 percent of total loans at December 31, 2020.

The Corporation limits risk inherent in its commercial real estate lending activities by monitoring borrowers directly involved in the commercial
real  estate  markets  and  adhering  to  conservative  policies  on  loan-to-value  ratios  for  such  loans.  Commercial  real  estate  loans,  consisting  of  real  estate
construction and commercial mortgage loans, totaled $14.0 billion at December 31, 2020. Of the total, $5.9 billion, or 42 percent, were to borrowers in the
Commercial  Real  Estate  business  line,  which  includes  loans  to  real  estate  developers,  an  increase  of  $710  million  compared  to  December  31,  2019.
Commercial real estate loans in other business lines totaled $8.1 billion, or 58 percent, at December 31, 2020. These loans consisted primarily of owner-
occupied commercial mortgages, which bear credit characteristics similar to non-commercial real estate business loans.

The  real  estate  construction  loan  portfolio  primarily  contains  loans  made  to  long-time  customers  with  satisfactory  completion  experience.
Criticized real estate construction loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $27 million and $31 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019,
respectively. In other business lines, criticized real estate construction loans totaled $20 million at December 31, 2020, compared to none at December 31,
2019. There were no net charge-offs in either of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.

Commercial  mortgage  loans  are  loans  where  the  primary  collateral  is  a  lien  on  any  real  property  and  are  primarily  loans  secured  by  owner
occupied  real  estate.  Real  property  is  generally  considered  primary  collateral  if  the  value  of  that  collateral  represents  more  than  50  percent  of  the
commitment at loan approval. Loans in the commercial mortgage portfolio generally mature within three to five years. Criticized commercial mortgage

totaled $73 million and $55 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In other business lines, $440 million and $242 million of commercial
mortgage loans were criticized at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Commercial mortgage loan net recoveries were $3 million and $1 million in
2020 and 2019, respectively.

Substantially  all  dealer  loans  are  in  the  National  Dealer  Services  business  line  and  primarily  include  floor  plan  financing  and  other  loans  to
automotive dealerships. Floor plan loans, included in commercial loans in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, totaled $2.3 billion at December 31, 2020, a
decrease  of  $1.7  billion  compared  to  $4.0  billion  at  December  31,  2019  due  to  an  imbalance  in  supply  and  demand  resulting  in  lower  inventory.  At
December 31, 2020 and 2019, other loans in the National Dealer Services business line totaled $3.3 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, including $2.0
billion of owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans at both December 31, 2020 and 2019. The National Dealer Services business line includes
a wide array of franchises with a focus on mega dealers consisting of five or more dealerships in a group.

There  were  no  nonaccrual  dealer  loans  at  December  31,  2020,  compared  to  $9  million  at  December  31,  2019.  Additionally,  there  were  no  net

December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These borrowers could face financial difficulties due to disruptions in auto production as well as their supply
chains and logistics operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, management prudently increased allocated reserves for this portfolio in
2020.

Nonaccrual loans to borrowers involved with automotive production totaled $7 million at December 31, 2020 and $10 million at December 31,
2019. Criticized automotive production loans were 24 percent of the automotive production portfolio at December 31, 2020, compared to 15 percent at
December 31, 2019. Automotive production loan net charge-offs totaled $2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net recoveries of $1

Residential real estate loans, which consist of traditional residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit, totaled $3.4 billion at
December  31,  2020.  The  residential  real  estate  portfolio  is  principally  located  within  the  Corporation's  primary  geographic  markets.  Substantially  all
residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more are placed on nonaccrual status, and substantially all junior lien home equity loans that are current or
less than 90 days past due are placed on nonaccrual status if full collection of the senior position is in doubt. At no later than 180 days past due, such loans
are charged off to current appraised values less costs to sell.

Residential mortgages totaled $1.8 billion at December 31, 2020, and were primarily larger, variable-rate mortgages originated and retained for
certain  private  banking  relationship  customers.  Of  the  $1.8  billion  of  residential  mortgage  loans  outstanding,  $47  million  were  on  nonaccrual  status  at
December 31, 2020. The home equity portfolio totaled $1.6 billion at December 31, 2020, of which $1.5 billion was outstanding under primarily variable-
rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit, $70 million were in amortizing status and $16 million were closed-end home equity loans. Of the $1.6 billion
of home equity loans outstanding, $17 million were on nonaccrual status at December 31, 2020. A majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by
junior liens at December 31, 2020.

Energy Lending

The Corporation has a portfolio of Energy loans that are included entirely in commercial loans in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Customers in
the  Corporation's  Energy  business  line  (approximately  130  relationships)  are  engaged  in  three  segments  of  the  oil  and  gas  business:  exploration  and
production (E&P), midstream and energy services. E&P generally includes such activities as searching for potential oil and gas fields, drilling exploratory
wells  and  operating  active  wells.  Commitments  to  E&P  borrowers  are  generally  subject  to  semi-annual  borrowing  base  re-determinations  based  on  a
variety of factors including updated prices (reflecting market and competitive conditions), energy reserve levels and the impact of hedging. The midstream
sector is generally involved in the transportation, storage and marketing of crude and/or refined oil and gas products. The Corporation's energy services
customers provide products and services primarily to the E&P segment.

Loans in the Energy business line totaled $1.6 billion, or approximately 3 percent of total loans, at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $621 million.
Total exposure, including unused commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, was $3.1 billion (a utilization rate of 52 percent) and $4.3 billion at
December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.

The decrease in total exposure in the Energy business line primarily reflected reduced borrowing bases as a result of lower oil and gas prices as
well  as  reduced  production  activity.  At  December  31,  2020,  the  Corporation  had  completed  approximately  92  percent  of  the  Fall  borrowing  base  re-
determinations, resulting in a modest decrease to borrowing bases. The value and coverage benefit of hedging contracts are dependent upon the oil/gas
price in each contract, as well as the operational costs, which are different for each borrower. As of December 31, 2020, 75 percent of the Corporation's
E&P customers had at least 50 percent of their oil and/or gas production hedged up to one year and 38 percent of customers had at least 50 percent of
production hedged for two years or more.

The  Corporation's  allowance  methodology  considers  the  various  risk  elements  within  the  loan  portfolio.  When  merited,  the  Corporation  may
incorporate  a  qualitative  reserve  component  for  Energy  loans.  The  allocation  of  reserves  for  Energy  loans  was  approximately  8  percent  of  the  Energy
portfolio at December 31, 2020. Energy markets, which were already experiencing stress prior to the pandemic, were further impacted by the rapid decline
in demand resulting from social distancing policies. Demand and prices improved slightly in the latter half of 2020 as the economy began to recover, but
energy markets remain uncertain. There were $125 million and $86 million in net credit-related charge-offs in the Energy business line for the years ended
December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Nonaccrual Energy loans increased $71 million to $114 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $43 million
at December 31, 2019. Criticized loans increased $230 million to $596 million at December 31, 2020.

Leveraged Loans

Certain  loans  in  the  Corporation's  commercial  portfolio  are  considered  leveraged  transactions.  These  loans  are  typically  used  for  mergers,
acquisitions, business recapitalizations, refinancing and equity buyouts. To help mitigate the risk associated with these loans, the Corporation focuses on
middle market companies with highly capable management teams, strong sponsors and solid track records of financial performance. Industries prone to
cyclical downturns and acquisitions with a high degree of integration risk are generally avoided. Other considerations include the sufficiency of collateral,
the level of balance sheet leverage and the adequacy of financial covenants. During the underwriting process, cash flows are stress-tested to evaluate the
borrowers' abilities to handle economic downturns and an increase in interest rates. Management considers the leveraged loan portfolio to be one of the
most  sensitive  to  economic  impacts  stemming  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  social  distancing  policies  and  has  continued  to  set  aside  increased
reserves for this portfolio as of December 31, 2020. Certain energy, automotive production and loans in other portfolios specifically identified as subject to
additional stress due to COVID-19 impacts, totaling approximately $250 million, are also considered leveraged transactions.

The FDIC defines higher-risk commercial and industrial (HR C&I) loans for assessment purposes as loans generally with leverage of four times
total  debt  to  earnings  before  interest,  taxes  and  depreciation  (EBITDA)  as  well  as  three  times  senior  debt  to  EBITDA,  excluding  certain  collateralized
loans.

Other Sectors Most at Risk due to Economic Stress Resulting from COVID-19 Impacts

The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and increased unemployment levels. The
resulting temporary closure of many businesses and the implementation of social distancing and sheltering in place policies has impacted, and will continue
to impact, many of the Corporation’s customers. In addition to the energy, automotive production and leveraged loan portfolios, the Corporation considers
the  following  sectors  of  its  loan  portfolio  to  be  most  vulnerable  to  financial  risks  from  business  disruptions  caused  by  the  pandemic  spread  mitigation
efforts. For further discussion, see Item 1.A "Risk Factors" on page 13 of this report.

Market and Liquidity Risk

Market risk represents the risk of loss due to adverse movement in prices, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and
equity prices. Liquidity risk represents the risk that the Corporation does not have sufficient access to funds to maintain its normal operations at all times,
or does not have the ability to raise or borrow funds at a reasonable cost at all times.

The  Asset  and  Liability  Policy  Committee  (ALCO)  of  the  Corporation  establishes  and  monitors  compliance  with  the  policies  and  risk  limits
pertaining  to  market  and  liquidity  risk  management  activities.  ALCO  meets  regularly  to  discuss  and  review  market  and  liquidity  risk  management
strategies, and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the Corporation, including treasury, finance, economics, lending, deposit
gathering and risk management. Corporate Treasury mitigates market and liquidity risk under the direction of ALCO through the actions it takes to manage
the Corporation's market, liquidity and capital positions.

In addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis, Corporate Treasury also monitors the parent company's liquidity and has established
limits for the minimum number of months into the future in which the parent company can meet existing and forecasted obligations without the support of
additional dividends from subsidiaries. ALCO's liquidity policy requires the parent company to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet expected capital and
debt obligations with a target of 24 months but no less than 18 months.

Corporate Treasury and the Enterprise Risk Division support ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other
market risks. Key activities encompass: (i) providing information and analyses of the Corporation's balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate
and all other market risks; (ii) monitoring and reporting of the Corporation's positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines; (iii) developing
and presenting analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions; (iv) reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval; and (v) monitoring of
industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market and liquidity risks.

Interest Rate Risk

Net  interest  income  is  the  primary  source  of  revenue  for  the  Corporation.  Interest  rate  risk  arises  in  the  normal  course  of  business  due  to
differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities, primarily through the Corporation's core business activities of extending
loans and acquiring deposits. The Corporation's balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating-rate loans funded by core deposits. Including the
impact of interest rate swaps converting floating-rate loans to fixed, the Corporation's loan composition at December 31, 2020 was 62 percent LIBOR, 12
percent  prime  and  26  percent  fixed  rate.  Additionally,  20  percent  of  loans  had  non-zero  interest  rate  floors  protecting  against  future  rate  declines.  The
composition of the loan portfolio creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the faster repricing of the floating-rate loan
portfolio versus deposit products. In addition, the growth and/or contraction in the Corporation's loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to
interest  rate  movements  in  the  absence  of  mitigating  actions.  Examples  of  such  actions  are  purchasing  fixed-rate  investment  securities,  which  provide
liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest sensitivity, as well as hedging with interest rate swaps and options. The Corporation
actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while
operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.

Since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives, a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk. These
techniques  examine  the  impact  of  interest  rate  risk  on  net  interest  income  and  the  economic  value  of  equity  under  a  variety  of  alternative  scenarios,
including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve utilizing multiple simulation analyses. Simulation analyses produce only estimates of net
interest income as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors, including, but not
limited to, the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions, regulatory impacts and management strategies.

Sensitivity of Net Interest Income to Changes in Interest Rates

The analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is management's principal risk
management technique. Management models a base case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment. Existing derivative instruments
entered  into  for  risk  management  purposes  as  of  the  balance  sheet  dates  are  included  in  the  analysis,  but  no  additional  hedging  is  forecasted.  At
December 31, 2020, these derivative instruments comprise interest rate swaps that convert $2.7 billion of fixed-rate medium- and long-term debt to variable
rates  through  fair  value  hedges  and  convert  $5.6  billion  of  variable-rate  loans  to  fixed  rates  through  cash  flow  hedges.  Additionally,  included  in  this
analysis  are  $10.6  billion  of  loans  that  were  subject  to  an  average  interest  rate  floor  of  0.86  percent  at  December  31,  2020.  This  base-case  net  interest
income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which rates rise or decline 100 basis points

F-33

Table of Contents

(with a floor of zero percent) in a linear, non-parallel fashion from the base case over 12 months, resulting in an average increase or decrease in short-term
interest rates of 50 basis points over the period.

Each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth, investment security prepayment levels, depositor behavior, yield curve changes, loan and
deposit pricing, and overall balance sheet mix and growth. In this low rate environment, depositors have maintained a higher level of liquidity and their
historical  behavior  may  be  less  indicative  of  future  trends.  As  a  result,  the  rising  rate  scenario  reflects  a  greater  decrease  in  deposits  than  we  have
experienced historically as rates rise. Changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance
sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis.

The table below, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating

the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above.

Sensitivity to declining interest rates decreased from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 due to changes in balance sheet composition, as
well as limited remaining downward movement in rates before hitting zero percent floors. Sensitivity to rising interest rates increased due to changes in
balance sheet composition, partially offset by fixed-rate PPP lending and an increase in the number of variable-rate loans with active floors.

Sensitivity of Economic Value of Equity to Changes in Interest Rates

In addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income, an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate
risk position. The economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the Corporation's financial assets, liabilities and
off-balance sheet instruments, derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period, and the estimated economic value after
applying the estimated impact of rate movements. The Corporation primarily monitors the percentage change on the base-case economic value of equity. At
December 31, 2020, the economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel 100 basis point shock with a floor of zero percent, compared

The sensitivity of the economic value of equity to rising rates increased from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 due to changes in deposit
pay  rates  and  expected  lives,  partially  offset  by  increased  variable-rate  loans  with  floors.  The  sensitivity  to  declining  rates  decreased  due  to  changes  in
balance sheet composition as well as limited remaining downward movement in rates before hitting modeled zero-percent floors.

LIBOR Transition

On  July  27,  2017,  the  United  Kingdom’s  Financial  Conduct  Authority,  which  regulates  LIBOR,  publicly  announced  that  it  intends  to  stop
persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. The Corporation has substantial exposure to LIBOR-based products, including loans,
securities,  derivatives  and  hedges,  and  is  preparing  for  a  transition  from  LIBOR  toward  alternative  rates.  A  dedicated  program  office  and  governance
structure,  with  direction  and  oversight  from  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  Chief  Financial  Officer  and  Chief  Risk  Officer,  continues  to  guide  a  cross-
functional  implementation  team  to  execute  an  enterprise  LIBOR  transition  plan.  Comerica’s  enterprise  transition  milestones  are  closely  aligned  with
recommendations  from  the  Alternative  Reference  Rates  Committee  (ARRC)  for  both  best  practices  and  recommended  2020  objectives.  Beginning  in
second quarter 2020, customer disclosure information for both consumer and commercial loans were provided for new originations. The Corporation began
indexing  new  retail  adjustable  rate  mortgages  to  SOFR  (Secured  Overnight  Financing  Rate)  in  third  quarter  2020.  During  fourth  quarter  2020,  the
Corporation  began  the  process  of  incorporating  fallback  language  in  legacy  LIBOR-based  commercial  loans  and  updated  International  Swaps  and
Derivative Association (ISDA) protocols in interest rate derivatives. The Corporation continues to monitor market developments and regulatory updates,
including recent announcements from the ICE Benchmark Administrator to extend the cessation date for several USD LIBOR tenors to June 30, 2023, as
well as collaborate with regulators and industry groups on the transition. For a

The  Corporation  uses  investment  securities  and  derivative  instruments  as  asset  and  liability  management  tools  with  the  overall  objective  of
managing  the  volatility  of  net  interest  income  from  changes  in  interest  rates.  These  tools  assist  management  in  achieving  the  desired  interest  rate  risk
management  objectives.  Activity  related  to  derivative  instruments  currently  involves  interest  rate  swaps  effectively  converting  fixed-rate  medium-  and
long-term debt to a floating rate as well as variable rate loans to a fixed rate.

The notional amount of risk management interest rate swaps totaled $8.2 billion at December 31, 2020 and $7.9 billion at December 31, 2019,
which  included  fair  value  hedging  strategies  that  convert  $5.6  billion  of  fixed-rate  medium-  and  long-term  debt  to  a  floating  rate  as  well  as  cash  flow
hedging  strategies  that  convert  $2.7  billion  of  variable-rate  loans  to  a  fixed  rate.  Risk  management  interest  rate  swaps  generated  $121  million  and  $4
million of net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.

In  addition  to  interest  rate  swaps,  the  Corporation  employs  various  other  types  of  derivative  instruments  as  offsetting  positions  to  mitigate
exposures to foreign currency risks associated with specific assets and liabilities (e.g., customer loans or deposits denominated in foreign currencies). Such
instruments may include foreign exchange spot and forward contracts as well as foreign exchange swap agreements.

Further information regarding risk management derivative instruments is provided in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.

The  Corporation  sells  and  purchases  interest  rate  caps  and  floors  and  enters  into  foreign  exchange  contracts,  interest  rate  swaps  and  energy
derivative contracts to accommodate the needs of customers requesting such services. Changes in the fair value of customer-initiated and other derivatives
are recognized in earnings as they occur. To limit the market risk of these activities, the Corporation generally takes offsetting positions with dealers. The
notional  amounts  of  offsetting  positions  are  included  in  the  table  above.  Customer-initiated  and  other  notional  activity  represented  75  percent  and  73
percent of total interest rate, energy and foreign exchange contracts at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Further information regarding customer-initiated and other derivative instruments is provided in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.

Liquidity Risk and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Liquidity is the ability to meet financial obligations through the maturity or sale of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds. Various
financial  obligations,  including  contractual  obligations  and  commercial  commitments,  may  require  future  cash  payments  by  the  Corporation.  Certain
obligations are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, while others are off-balance sheet under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

The  following  contractual  obligations  table  summarizes  the  Corporation's  noncancelable  contractual  obligations  and  future  required  minimum

payments. Refer to Notes 9, 10, 12, 18 and 26 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these contractual obligations.

Since many of these commitments expire without being drawn upon, and each customer must continue to meet the conditions established in the
contract, the total amount of these commercial commitments does not necessarily represent the future cash requirements of the Corporation. Refer to the
“Other Market Risks” section below and Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of these commercial commitments.

Wholesale Funding

The Corporation may access the purchased funds market when necessary, which includes a variety of funding sources. Capacity for incremental
purchased  funds  at  December  31,  2020  included  short-term  FHLB  advances,  the  ability  to  purchase  federal  funds,  sell  securities  under  agreements  to
repurchase,  as  well  as  issue  deposits  through  brokers.  Purchased  funds,  which  includes  brokered  deposits  and  short-term  borrowings,  decreased  to
$66 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $295 million at December 31, 2019, as total deposits increased, reducing the need for additional funding
sources.

At  December  31,  2020,  the  Bank  had  pledged  loans  totaling  $18.0  billion  which  provided  for  up  to  $14.2  billion  of  available  collateralized

borrowing with the FRB.

The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Dallas, Texas, which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized
by real estate-related assets. Actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral available to be pledged to the FHLB. At December 31,
2020, $19.5 billion of real estate-related loans and $4.4 billion of investment securities were pledged to the FHLB as collateral for current and potential
future borrowings. The Corporation used excess liquidity to repay $2.8 billion of FHLB advances in the first quarter of 2021. Potential future borrowing
capacity of approximately $12.0 billion is available at December 31, 2020.

Additionally,  the  Bank  had  the  ability  to  issue  up  to  $13.5  billion  of  debt  at  December  31,  2020  under  an  existing  $15.0  billion  note  program
which allows the issuance of debt with maturities between three months and 30 years. The Corporation also maintains a shelf registration statement with
the Securities and Exchange Commission from which it may issue debt and equity securities.

The ability of the Corporation and the Bank to raise funds at competitive rates is impacted by rating agencies' views of the credit quality, liquidity,
capital and earnings of the Corporation and the Bank. As of December 31, 2020, the three major rating agencies had assigned the following ratings to long-
term senior unsecured obligations of the Corporation and the Bank. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be
subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

The Corporation satisfies liquidity needs with either liquid assets or various funding sources. Liquid assets totaled $25.9 billion at December 31,
2020, compared to $17.9 billion at December 31, 2019. Liquid assets include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits with
banks, other short-term investments and unencumbered investment securities.

The Corporation performs monthly liquidity stress testing to evaluate its ability to meet funding needs in hypothetical stressed environments. Such
environments  cover  a  series  of  broad  events,  distinguished  in  terms  of  duration  and  severity.  The  evaluation  as  of  December  31,  2020  projected  that
sufficient sources of liquidity were available under each series of events.

Other Market Risks

Market  risk  related  to  the  Corporation's  trading  instruments  is  not  significant,  as  trading  activities  are  limited.  Certain  components  of  the
Corporation's noninterest income, primarily fiduciary income, are at risk to fluctuations in the market values of underlying assets, particularly equity and
debt securities. Other components of noninterest income, primarily brokerage fees, are at risk to changes in the volume of market activity.

Operational Risk

Operational risk represents the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes and people, or from external events, excluding in
most cases those driven by technology (see Technology Risk below). The Corporation's definition of operational risk includes fraud; employment practice
and workplace safety; clients, products and business practice; business continuity or disaster recovery; execution, delivery, and process management; third
party and model risks. The definition does not include strategic or reputational risks. Although operational losses are experienced by all companies and are
routinely incurred in business operations, the Corporation recognizes the need to identify and control operational losses and seeks to limit losses to a level
deemed appropriate by management, as outlined in the Corporation’s risk appetite statement. The appropriate risk level is determined through consideration
of the nature of the Corporation's business and the environment in which it operates, in combination with the impact from, and the possible impact on, other
risks faced by the Corporation. Operational risk is mitigated through a system of internal controls that are designed to keep operating risks at appropriate
levels. The Operational Risk Management Committee monitors risk management techniques and systems. The Corporation has developed a framework that
includes a centralized operational risk reporting function in the Enterprise Risk Division and business/support unit risk liaisons responsible for managing
operational risk specific to the respective business lines.

Technology Risk

Technology risk represents the risk of loss or adverse outcomes arising from the people, processes, applications and infrastructure that support the
technology environment. The Corporation's definition of technology risk includes technology delivery risk, technology investment risk, cybersecurity risk,
information security risk and information management risk. Technology risk is inclusive of the risks associated with the execution of technology processes
and activities by third-party contractors and suppliers to the Corporation. Other risk types may materialize in the event of a technology risk event, such as
the risk of a financial reporting error or regulatory non-compliance, and the impact of such risks are highly interdependent with operational risk.

The  Technology  Risk  Management  Committee,  comprising  senior  and  executive  business  unit  managers,  as  well  as  managers  responsible  for
technology, cybersecurity, information security and enterprise risk management, oversees technology risk. The Technology Risk Management Committee
also ensures that appropriate actions are implemented in business units to mitigate risk to an acceptable level.

Compliance Risk

Compliance  risk  represents  the  risk  of  sanctions  or  financial  loss  resulting  from  the  Corporation's  failure  to  comply  with  all  applicable  laws,
regulations and standards of good banking practice. The impact of such risks is highly interdependent with strategic risk, as the reputational impact from
compliance breaches can be severe. Activities which may expose the Corporation to compliance risk include, but are not limited to, those dealing with the
prevention of money laundering, privacy and data protection, community reinvestment initiatives, fair lending, consumer protection, employment and tax
matters, over-the-counter derivative activities and other regulated activities.

The  Enterprise-Wide  Compliance  Committee,  comprising  senior  and  executive  business  unit  managers,  as  well  as  managers  responsible  for
compliance,  audit  and  overall  risk,  oversees  compliance  risk.  This  enterprise-wide  approach  provides  a  consistent  view  of  compliance  across  the
organization. The Enterprise-Wide Compliance Committee also ensures that appropriate actions are implemented in business units to mitigate risk to an
acceptable level.

Strategic Risk

Strategic  risk  represents  the  risk  of  inadequate  returns  or  possible  losses  due  to  impairment  of  reputation,  failure  to  fully  develop  and  execute
business plans, failure to assess current and new opportunities in business, markets and products, failure to determine appropriate consideration for risks
accepted,  and  any  other  event  not  identified  in  the  defined  risk  categories  of  credit,  market  and  liquidity,  operational,  technology  or  compliance  risks.
Mitigation  of  the  various  risk  elements  that  represent  strategic  risk  is  achieved  through  numerous  metrics  and  initiatives  to  help  the  Corporation  better
understand, measure and report on such risks. The Executive Strategic and Pricing Committee, comprised of senior managers, oversees strategic risk and
ensures that strategic risk is mitigated to appropriate levels.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Corporation’s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are
described  in  Note  1.  These  policies  require  numerous  estimates  and  strategic  or  economic  assumptions,  which  may  prove  inaccurate  or  subject  to
variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporation’s future financial condition and results
of operations. At December 31, 2020, the most critical of these significant accounting policies were the policies related to the allowance for credit losses,
fair value measurement, goodwill, pension plan accounting and income taxes. These policies were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporation’s
Board of Directors and are discussed more fully below.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

In accordance with CECL, the allowance for credit losses, which includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on
lending-related commitments, is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve for current expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life
of the portfolio. The Corporation uses loss factors, based on estimated probability of default for internal risk ratings and loss given default, to determine the
allowance for credit losses for the majority of its portfolio. Management applies loss factors to pools of loans and lending-related commitments with similar
risk characteristics, calibrates these factors using economic forecasts and incorporates qualitative adjustments. For further discussion of the methodology
used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses, refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. For further discussion on the economic
forecast incorporated into the 2020 model, refer to the “Risk Management” section of this financial review.

Management's  determination  of  the  appropriateness  of  the  allowance  is  based  on  periodic  evaluations  of  the  loan  portfolio,  lending-related
commitments,  current  as  well  as  forecasted  economic  factors,  and  other  relevant  information.  The  calculation  is  inherently  subjective  and  requires
management to exercise significant judgment in developing assumptions for the estimate, the most significant of which are the loan risk rating process,
development of economic forecasts and application of qualitative adjustments. Sensitivities are disclosed to demonstrate how changes in loan risk ratings
and economic forecast scenarios may impact the allowance for credit losses. Sensitivities only consider changes to each specific assumption in isolation
and their impact to the quantitative modeled results. They do not contemplate impacts to the qualitative framework.

Loan Risk Rating Process

Reserve factors are applied to pools of loans based on risk characteristics, including the Corporation's internal risk rating system; therefore, loss
estimates are highly dependent on the accuracy of the risk rating assigned to each loan. The inherent imprecision in the risk rating system resulting from
inaccuracy in assigning and/or entering risk ratings in the loan accounting system is monitored by the Corporation's asset quality review function. Changes
to internal risk ratings, beyond the forecasted migration inherent in the credit models, would result in a different estimated allowance for credit losses. To
illustrate, if 5 percent of the individual risk ratings were adjusted down by one rating across all pools, the allowance for loan losses as of December 31,
2020 would change by approximately $9 million.

Forecasted Economic Variables

Management  selects  models  through  which  historical  reserve  factor  estimates  are  calibrated  to  economic  forecasts  over  the  reasonable  and
supportable forecast period based on the projected performance of specific economic variables that statistically correlate with the probability of default and
loss given default pools. Loss estimates revert to historical loss experience for contractual lives beyond the forecast period. Management selects economic
variables it believes to be most relevant based on the composition of the loan portfolio and customer base, including forecasted levels of employment, gross
domestic product, corporate bond and treasury spreads, industrial production levels, consumer and commercial real estate price indices as well as housing
statistics.

The allowance for credit losses is highly sensitive to the economic forecasts used to develop the estimate. Due to the high level of uncertainty
regarding significant assumptions, such as the ultimate impact of the global pandemic and effectiveness of government stimulus programs, the Corporation
evaluated  a  range  of  economic  scenarios,  including  a  more  severe  economic  forecast  scenario,  with  varying  speeds  of  recovery.  The  following  table
summarizes the more severe forecast scenario for the economic variables that are most impactful.

More Severe Forecast
Contracts  through  third  quarter  2021,  including  a  5  percent  decline  in  the  first
quarter 2021, followed by a gradual improvement to a growth rate above 4 percent
by the end of the forecast period.
Current  levels  increase  to  near  10  percent  in  the  second  half  of  2021,  gradually
lowering to below 9 percent by the end of the forecast period.
Spreads  widen  above  2.5  percent  in  the  near  term,  gradually  normalizing  to  2
percent or lower in 2022.
Decline below $25 per barrel part-way through the forecast period before improving
to over $30 per barrel by fourth quarter 2022.

Selecting a different forecast in the current environment could result in a significantly different estimated allowance for credit losses. To illustrate,
absent model overlays and other qualitative adjustments that are part of the quarterly reserving process, if the Corporation selected the more severe scenario
to inform its models, the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2020 would increase by approximately $515 million. However, factoring in model
overlays and qualitative adjustments could result in a materially different estimate under a more severe scenario.

Qualitative Adjustments and Model Overlays

The Corporation includes qualitative adjustments, as appropriate, intended to capture the impact of uncertainties not reflected in the quantitative
estimate, including foresight risk, model imprecisions and input imprecisions. Qualitative adjustments for foresight risk reflect the inherent imprecision in
economic forecasts and may be included based on management’s evaluation of different forecast scenarios, ranging from more benign to more severe, and
known  recent  events  impacting  the  Corporation’s  portfolio.  Model  imprecision  adjustments  and  model  overlays  may  be  included  to  mitigate  known
limitations in the quantitative models. Input imprecision includes adjustments for portfolios where recent historical losses exceed expected losses or known
recent  events  are  expected  to  alter  risk  ratings  once  evidence  is  acquired,  as  well  as  a  qualitative  assessment  of  the  lending  environment,  including
underwriting  standards,  current  economic  and  political  conditions,  and  other  factors  affecting  credit  quality.  Qualitative  reserves  at  December  31,
2020 primarily included adjustments for uncertainties related to forecasted economic variables.

Other Considerations

To  the  extent  actual  outcomes  differ  from  management  estimates,  additional  provision  for  credit  losses  may  be  required  that  would  adversely
impact earnings in future periods. The allowance is assigned to business segments, and any earnings impact resulting from actual outcomes differing from
management estimates would primarily affect the Commercial Bank segment.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

Investment securities available-for-sale, derivatives and deferred compensation plan assets and associated liabilities are recorded at fair value on a
recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, other assets and liabilities may be recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, such as impaired loans
that have been reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, other real estate (primarily foreclosed property), nonmarketable equity securities
and certain other assets and liabilities. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve write-downs of individual assets or application of lower
of cost or fair value accounting.

Fair value is an estimate of the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction (i.e.,
not  a  forced  transaction,  such  as  a  liquidation  or  distressed  sale)  between  market  participants  at  the  measurement  date  and  is  based  on  the  assumptions
market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability. Fair value measurement and disclosure guidance establishes a three-level hierarchy for
disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements include information about the fair value
hierarchy, the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities, as well as the valuation methodologies and key inputs used.

At December 31, 2020, assets and liabilities measured using observable inputs that are classified as Level 1 or Level 2 represented 98.8 percent
and 100 percent of total assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, respectively. Valuations generated from model-based techniques that use at least one
significant assumption not observable in the market are considered Level 3 and reflect estimates of assumptions market participants would use in pricing
the asset or liability.

GOODWILL

Goodwill  is  initially  recorded  as  the  excess  of  the  purchase  price  over  the  fair  value  of  net  assets  acquired  in  a  business  combination  and  is
subsequently  evaluated  at  least  annually  for  impairment.  Goodwill  impairment  testing  is  performed  at  the  reporting  unit  level,  equivalent  to  a  business
segment or one level below. The Corporation has three reporting units: the Commercial Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. At December 31,
2020, goodwill totaled $635 million, including $473 million allocated to the Commercial Bank, $101 million allocated to the Retail Bank and $61 million
allocated to Wealth Management.

The Corporation performs its annual evaluation of goodwill impairment in the third quarter of each year and may elect to perform a quantitative
impairment  analysis  or  first  conduct  a  qualitative  analysis  to  determine  if  a  quantitative  analysis  is  necessary.  Additionally,  the  Corporation  evaluates
goodwill  impairment  on  an  interim  basis  if  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  between  annual  tests  indicate  additional  testing  may  be  warranted  to
determine if goodwill might be impaired.

In the first quarter 2020, economic conditions deteriorated significantly with the spread of the coronavirus global pandemic. The outbreak resulted
in social distancing requirements throughout the world, severely restricting the economy. In response to the crisis, the Federal Reserve lowered the Federal
Funds rate in March 2020 to close to zero. Additionally, the U.S. government initiated numerous measures to support the economy, including the CARES
Act. Given the economic deterioration in the first quarter of 2020, the Corporation assessed whether the events and circumstances resulted in it being more
likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying value. Impairment indicators considered comprised economic conditions,
including projections of the duration of current conditions and timing of a potential recovery; industry and market considerations; government intervention
and regulatory updates; the impact of recent events to financial performance and cost factors of the reporting units; performance of the Corporation’s stock
and  other  relevant  events.  The  Corporation  further  considered  the  amount  by  which  fair  value  exceeded  book  value  for  each  unit  in  the  most  recent
quantitative analysis and sensitivities performed. At the conclusion of the first quarter 2020 assessment, the Corporation determined that it was more likely
than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.

In second quarter 2020, the Corporation performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test in response to continued macroeconomic deterioration
and  the  ongoing  impacts  to  the  banking  industry  and  markets  in  which  the  Corporation  operates.  The  estimated  fair  values  of  the  reporting  units  were
determined using a blend of two commonly used valuation techniques: the market approach and the income approach. For the market approach, valuations
of reporting units considered a combination of earnings and equity multiples from companies with characteristics similar to each reporting unit. Since the
fair  values  determined  under  the  market  approach  are  representative  of  noncontrolling  interests,  the  valuations  incorporated  a  control  premium.  For  the
income approach, estimated future cash flows were derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations for each reporting unit. In the short- and
mid-term, forecasts incorporated current economic conditions and ongoing impacts of the global pandemic, including a federal funds target near zero and
an elevated allowance for credit losses. Long-term projections reflected normalized rate and credit environments, as well as a long-term rate of return for
each reporting unit. Projections were discounted using an applicable discount rate to calculate fair value. The discount rate was based on the imputed cost
of  equity  capital  appropriate  for  each  reporting  unit,  which  incorporated  the  risk-free  rate  of  return,  the  level  of  non-diversified  risk  associated  with
companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit, a size risk premium and a market equity risk premium. The discount rate further reflected the
uncertainty of current economic conditions and potential impacts to the forecasted financial information. The combined fair value of all units was compared
to the Corporation’s market capitalization for reasonableness. At the conclusion of the quantitative impairment test in second quarter 2020, the estimated
fair values of all reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying amounts, including goodwill.

The  annual  goodwill  impairment  test  was  performed  as  of  the  beginning  of  third  quarter  2020. The Corporation assessed qualitative factors to
determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. Qualitative
factors  included  economic  conditions,  industry  and  market  considerations,  cost  factors,  overall  financial  performance,  regulatory  developments  and
performance of the Corporation’s stock, among other events and circumstances. At the conclusion of the qualitative assessment in third quarter 2020, the
Corporation determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.

Analyzing  goodwill  includes  consideration  of  various  factors  that  continue  to  rapidly  evolve  and  for  which  significant  uncertainty  remains,
including the impact of the coronavirus global pandemic to the economy and ongoing government intervention to mitigate that impact. Further weakening
in the economic environment, such as continued decline in the performance of the reporting units or other factors, could cause the fair value of one or more
of the reporting units to fall below their carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Additionally, new legislative or regulatory changes not
anticipated in management's expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value, resulting in a
goodwill impairment charge. Any impairment charge would not affect the Corporation's regulatory capital ratios, tangible common equity ratio or liquidity
position.

PENSION PLAN ACCOUNTING

The Corporation has a qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plan. Effective January 1, 2017, benefits are calculated using a cash
balance formula based on years of service, age, compensation and an interest credit based on the 30-year Treasury rate. Participants under age 60 as of
December 31, 2016 are eligible to receive a frozen final average pay benefit in addition to amounts earned under the cash balance formula. Participants age
60 or older as of December 31, 2016 continue to be eligible for a final average pay benefit. The Corporation makes assumptions concerning future events
that will determine the amount and timing of required benefit payments, funding requirements and defined benefit pension expense. The major assumptions
are  the  discount  rate  used  in  determining  the  current  benefit  obligation,  the  long-term  rate  of  return  expected  on  plan  assets,  mix  of  assets  within  the
portfolio and the projected mortality rate.

The discount rate is determined by matching the expected cash flows of the pension plans to a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds as of the
measurement date, December 31. The long-term rate of return expected on plan assets is set after considering both long-term returns in the general market
and  long-term  returns  experienced  by  the  assets  in  the  plan.  The  current  target  asset  allocation  model  for  the  plans  is  provided  in  Note  17  to  the
consolidated financial statements. The expected returns on these various asset categories are blended to derive one long-term return assumption. The assets
are  primarily  invested  in  certain  collective  investment  funds,  common  stocks,  U.S.  Treasury  and  other  U.S.  government  agency  securities,  as  well  as
corporate  and  municipal  bonds  and  notes.  Mortality  rate  assumptions  are  based  on  mortality  tables  published  by  third-parties  such  as  the  Society  of
Actuaries, considering other available information including historical data as well as studies and publications from reputable sources.

The  Corporation  reviews  its  pension  plan  assumptions  on  an  annual  basis  with  its  actuarial  consultants  to  determine  if  the  assumptions  are
reasonable  and  adjusts  the  assumptions  to  reflect  changes  in  future  expectations.  The  major  assumptions  used  to  calculate  2021  defined  benefit  plan
pension expense (benefit) were as follows:

Defined benefit plan benefit is expected to increase $37 million to approximately $61 million in 2021, compared to a benefit of $24 million in
2020. This includes service cost expense of $41 million and a benefit from other components of $102 million. Service costs are included in salaries and
benefits expense, while the benefit from other components are included in other noninterest expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Changing the 2021 discount rate and long-term rate of return by 25 basis points would impact defined benefit expense in 2021 by $8 million and

$7 million, respectively.

Due to the long-term nature of pension plan assumptions, actual results may differ significantly from the actuarial-based estimates. Differences
resulting in actuarial gains or losses are required to be recorded in shareholders' equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss and amortized to
defined benefit pension expense in future years. Refer to Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.

INCOME TAXES

The calculation of the Corporation's income tax provision and tax-related accruals is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments.
The provision for income taxes is the sum of income taxes due for the current year and deferred taxes. Deferred taxes arise from temporary differences
between  the  income  tax  basis  and  financial  accounting  basis  of  assets  and  liabilities.  Accrued  taxes  represent  the  net  estimated  amount  due  to  or  to  be
received from taxing jurisdictions, currently or in the future, and are included in accrued income and other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities
on  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  The  Corporation  assesses  the  relative  risks  and  merits  of  tax  positions  for  various  transactions  after  considering
statutes, regulations, judicial precedent and other available information and maintains tax accruals consistent with these assessments. The Corporation is
subject to audit by taxing authorities that could question and/or challenge the tax positions taken by the Corporation.

Included in net deferred taxes are deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for realization based on available evidence of projected
future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, assumptions made regarding future events and, when applicable, state loss carryback capacity. A
valuation allowance is provided when it is more-likely-than-not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur due to changes in tax law, interpretations of existing tax laws, new judicial or regulatory guidance,
and the status of examinations conducted by taxing authorities that impact the relative risks and merits of tax positions taken by the Corporation. These
changes, when they occur, impact the estimate of accrued taxes and

could be significant to the operating results of the Corporation. For further information on tax accruals and related risks, see Note 18 to the consolidated
financial statements.

SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATA

The  Corporation  believes  non-GAAP  measures  are  meaningful  because  they  reflect  adjustments  commonly  made  by  management,  investors,
regulators and analysts to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and our performance trends. Tangible common equity is used by the Corporation to
measure the quality of capital and the return relative to balance sheet risk.

Common equity tier 1 capital ratio removes preferred stock from the Tier 1 capital ratio as defined by and calculated in conformity with bank
regulations. The tangible common equity ratio removes the effect of intangible assets from capital and total assets. Tangible common equity per share of
common stock removes the effect of intangible assets from common shareholders' equity per share of common stock.

The following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and regulatory ratios used in this financial review with financial

measures defined by GAAP.
