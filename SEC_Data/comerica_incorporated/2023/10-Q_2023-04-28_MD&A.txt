RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 Compared to Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 

Three Months Ended (dollar amounts in millions, except per share data) March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Net interest income $ 708 $ 742 Provision for credit losses 30 33 Noninterest income 282 278 Noninterest expenses 551 541 Income before income taxes 409 446 Provision for income taxes 85 96 Net income $ 324 $ 350 Diluted earnings per common share $ 2.39 $ 2.58 

Net income for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $324 million, a decrease of $26 million compared to $350 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, reflecting a $34 million decrease in net interest income driven by higher borrowings, partially offset by loan growth and higher short-term rates. An $11 million decrease in the provision for income taxes and a $4 million increase in noninterest income were partially offset by a $10 million increase in noninterest expenses. Net income per diluted common share was $2.39 and $2.58 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, a decrease of $0.19 per diluted common share.

(a) Impact of additional days, other portfolio dynamics and interest rate swaps reflected as part of rate impact, rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume. 

Net interest income decreased $34 million to $708 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $742 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in net interest income was driven by higher funding costs, a $4.0 billion increase in average short-term FHLB advances and an $800 million increase in medium- and long-term FHLB advances, as well as the impact of two fewer days in the quarter, partially offset by higher short-term rates and loan growth. Net interest margin was 3.57 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2023, a decrease of 17 basis points from 3.74 percent for the three months ended December 31, 2022, primarily driven by higher-cost funding sources, partially offset by an increase in short-term rates. 

Average earning assets increased $1.8 billion, driven by increases of $1.1 billion each in loans and interest-bearing deposits with banks, partially offset by a $363 million decrease in investment securities. Average interest-bearing sources increased $4.9 billion primarily due to a $4.7 billion increase in borrowings, mostly comprised of FHLB advances. 

For further discussion of the effects of market rates on net interest income, refer to the "Market and Liquidity Risk" section of this financial review. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses, which includes the provision for loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments, decreased $3 million to $30 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $33 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, increasing the allowance for credit losses to $693 million reflecting loan growth, continued strong credit metrics combined with a weakening of the economic outlook. Net loan recoveries were $2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments decreased $2 million compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022. 

An analysis of the allowance for credit losses and a summary of nonperforming assets are presented under the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review. 

Noninterest Income 

Three Months Ended (in millions) March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Card fees $ 69 $ 68 Fiduciary income 58 55 Service charges on deposit accounts 46 47 Capital markets income (a) 39 34 Commercial lending fees (a) 18 18 Bank-owned life insurance 10 10 Letter of credit fees 10 10 Brokerage fees 8 7 Other noninterest income (a), (b) 24 29 Total noninterest income $ 282 $ 278 

(a) Effective January 1, 2023, the Corporation reported derivative income, syndication agent fees (previously a component of commercial lending fees) and investment banking fees (previously a component of other noninterest income) as a combined item captioned by capital markets income on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Prior periods have been adjusted to conform to this presentation, and the changes in presentation do not impact total noninterest income. 

(b) The table below provides further details on certain categories included in other noninterest income. 

Noninterest income increased $4 million to $282 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, reflecting increases in capital markets income and fiduciary income, partially offset by a $5 million valuation reserve for assets held for sale (included in other noninterest income). Higher capital markets income was mostly due to energy and foreign exchange derivative income, while growth in personal trust fees drove the increase in fiduciary income. 

The following table presents certain categories included in other noninterest income on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 

Three Months Ended (in millions) March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Risk management hedging income $ 8 $ 8 Deferred compensation asset returns (a) 4 6 Securities trading income 4 4 Insurance commissions 4 3 All other noninterest income 4 8 Other noninterest income $ 24 $ 29 

(a) Compensation deferred by the Corporation's officers and directors is invested based on investment selections of the officers and directors. Income earned on these assets is reported in other noninterest income and the offsetting change in deferred compensation plan liabilities is reported in salaries and benefits expense. 

Noninterest Expenses 

Three Months Ended (in millions) March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Salaries and benefits expense $ 326 $ 318 Outside processing fee expense 64 63 Occupancy expense 41 53 Software expense 40 41 FDIC insurance expense 13 7 Equipment expense 12 14 Advertising expense 8 14 Other noninterest expenses 47 31 Total noninterest expenses $ 551 $ 541 

Noninterest expenses increased $10 million to $551 million, primarily driven by increases in other noninterest expenses, salaries and benefits expense and FDIC insurance expense, partially offset by decreases in occupancy expense, advertising expense and equipment expense. Salaries and benefits expense included increases from significant seasonal items including annual stock-based compensation, payroll taxes and 401-K expense, partially offset by decreases in incentive compensation and staff insurance. The increase in other noninterest expenses was driven by higher non-salary pension expense due to actuarial adjustments and increased litigation-related expense, partially offset by a refund related to a favorable state tax ruling and a decrease in consulting fees. FDIC insurance expense increased due to a statutory assessment rate increase as well as funding-related impacts. 

For the three months ended March 31, 2023, expenses for certain modernization initiatives, including transition costs related to the recently announced partnership with the Corporation's new investment program provider, decreased $2 million to $16 million. Modernization-related expenses for the periods presented were comprised of transitional real estate costs (reported in occupancy expense), severance and contract labor (reported in salaries and benefits expense) and asset impairment and contract termination costs (reported in other noninterest expenses).

(a) Impact of additional days, other portfolio dynamics and interest rate swaps reflected as part of rate impact, rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume. 

Net interest income was $708 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, an increase of $252 million compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase in net interest income reflected higher short-term rates (including the impact of interest rate swaps) and loan growth, partially offset by lower deposits with the Federal Reserve and an increase in borrowings. Net interest margin was 3.57 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2023, an increase of 138 basis points compared to 2.19 percent for the comparable period in 2022, mostly due to the impact of higher short-term rates, partially offset by higher-cost funding sources. 

Average earning assets decreased $6.2 billion, due to a decrease of $12.8 billion in interest-bearing deposits with banks, partially offset by increases of $5.2 billion in loans and $1.4 billion in investment securities. Average interest-bearing sources increased $2.4 billion, reflecting increases of $5.5 billion in short-term borrowings and $1.1 billion in medium- and long-term debt, partially offset by a $4.1 billion decrease in interest-bearing deposits.

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses was an expense of $30 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to a benefit of $11 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, reflecting loan growth and a moderate weakening in the economic outlook. Net loan recoveries were $2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to net charge-offs of $8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. General Middle Market net recoveries were $4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to net charge-offs of $5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. Additionally, Energy net charge-offs decreased $6 million over the period. Provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments decreased $14 million compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022.

(b) The table below provides further details on certain categories included in other noninterest income. 

Noninterest income increased $38 million, which included increases in other noninterest income, capital markets income and brokerage fees, partially offset by a decrease in bank-owned life insurance. The increase in capital markets income was driven by higher derivative income and syndication agent fees. Other noninterest income included increases in deferred compensation asset returns (offset in noninterest expense) and risk management hedging income related to an increase in price alignment income received for centrally cleared risk management positions, as well as the impact of fair value losses on warrants in first quarter 2022. 

The following table presents certain categories included in other noninterest income on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

Noninterest expenses increased $78 million due to increases in other noninterest expenses, salaries and benefits expense, FDIC insurance expense and occupancy expense. The increase in salaries and benefits expense was driven by higher deferred compensation expense (offset in other noninterest income), the impact of annual merit increases and staff additions, as well as increases in staff insurance and 401-K expense. Other noninterest expenses included increases in litigation-related expenses and non-salary pension expense, partially offset by a refund related to a favorable state tax ruling and lower operational losses. 

STRATEGIC LINES OF BUSINESS 

The Corporation has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments: the Commercial Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. These business segments are differentiated based on the type of customer and the related products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, the Finance Division is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes items not directly associated with the business segments or the Finance segment. The performance of the business segments is not comparable with the Corporation's consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements describes the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of the business segments for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. 

The Corporation's management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies, which are regularly reviewed and refined. These methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure and/or product lines. Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation's 2022 Annual Report describes the Corporation's segment reporting methodology. 

Net interest income for each segment reflects the interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities plus the net impact from associated internal funds transfer pricing (FTP) funding credits and charges. The FTP methodology allocates credits to each business segment for deposits and other funds provided as well as charges for loans and other assets being funded. FTP crediting rates on deposits and other funds provided reflect the long-term value of deposits and other funding sources based on their implied maturities. Due to the longer-term nature of implied maturities, FTP crediting rates are generally less volatile than changes in interest rates observed in the market. FTP charge rates for funding loans and other assets reflect a matched cost of funds based on the pricing and duration characteristics of the assets. As a result of applying matched funding, interest revenue for each segment resulting from loans and other assets is generally not impacted by changes in interest rates. Therefore, net interest income for each segment primarily reflects the volume of loans and other earning assets at the spread over the matched cost of funds, as well as the volume of deposits at the associated FTP crediting rates. Generally, in periods of rising interest rates, FTP charge rates for funding loans and FTP crediting rates on deposits will increase, with FTP crediting rates for deposits typically repricing at a slower pace than FTP charge rates for funding loans. 

Business Segments 

The following sections present a summary of the performance of each of the Corporation's business segments for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year. 

Commercial Bank

n/m - not meaningful 

Average loans increased $4.5 billion, with increases in Commercial Real Estate, National Dealer Services, Corporate Banking and general Middle Market, partially offset by a decrease in Mortgage Banker Finance. Average deposits decreased $9.6 billion in all deposit categories with the exception of savings deposits, primarily driven by decreases in noninterest-bearing and money market deposits, most significantly in the California market. The largest declines included general Middle Market, Technology and Life Sciences, Corporate Banking, National Dealer Services and Business Banking. The Commercial Bank's net income increased $108 million. Net interest income increased $175 million due to an increase in loan income, partially offset by higher allocated net FTP charges and a decline in loan fees. The provision for credit losses increased to an expense of 

$26 million from a benefit of $23 million, reflecting increases in general Middle Market, Commercial Real Estate, Business Banking and Entertainment Lending, partially offset by a decrease in Technology and Life Sciences. Net credit-related charge-offs decreased $11 million to $2 million in net recoveries, primarily due to a reduction in general Middle Market and Energy net charge-offs. Noninterest income increased $21 million, primarily driven by higher capital markets income and a decrease in securities trading losses. Noninterest expenses increased $17 million, primarily reflecting increases in salaries and benefits expense, corporate overhead, FDIC insurance expense and litigation-related expenses.

FINANCIAL CONDITION 

First Quarter 2023 Compared to Fourth Quarter 2022 

Period-End Balances 

Total assets increased $5.7 billion to $91.1 billion, reflecting a $4.6 billion increase in interest-bearing deposits with banks (primarily deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank) and a $1.5 billion increase in loans, partially offset by a decrease of $717 million in investment securities driven by Treasury maturities and paydowns on mortgage-backed securities. The increase in loans included growth of $570 million in Commercial Real Estate, $480 million in Equity Fund Services, $263 million in Corporate Banking and $245 million in National Dealer Services. 

Total liabilities increased $4.9 billion to $85.1 billion, reflecting increases of $7.8 billion in short-term borrowings and $4.1 billion in medium- and long-term debt, partially offset by a decrease of $6.8 billion in noninterest-bearing deposits. The increases in short-term borrowings and medium- and long-term debt were primarily driven by FHLB advances, while the decline in deposits reflected normal first quarter seasonality and customers utilizing balances to fund business activities, as well as predominantly localized decreases related to uncertainty in the banking industry following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March 2023 and the subsequent impacts. For additional information regarding deposits, refer to "Deposit Concentrations and Uninsured Deposits" under the "Market Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review. Total shareholders' equity increased $813 million, primarily due to reductions in unrealized losses on investment securities available-for-sale and cash flow hedges and net income. 

Average Balances 

Total assets increased $1.3 billion to $85.1 billion, driven by increases of $1.1 billion in both loans and interest-bearing deposits with banks, partially offset by decreases of $409 million in accrued income and other assets primarily due to a decline in pension plan assets as well as $363 million in investment securities. The following table provides information about the change in the Corporation's average loan portfolio by loan type. 

Three Months Ended Percent Change (dollar amounts in millions) March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Change Commercial loans $ 30,517 $ 30,585 $ (68) &#8212; % Real estate construction loans 3,345 2,978 367 12 Commercial mortgage loans 13,464 12,752 712 6 Lease financing 765 753 12 2 International loans 1,226 1,227 (1) &#8212; Residential mortgage loans 1,833 1,786 47 3 Consumer loans 2,318 2,294 24 1 Total loans $ 53,468 $ 52,375 $ 1,093 2 % 

The $1.1 billion increase in loans was primarily driven by increases of $642 million in the Commercial Real Estate line of business, $361 million in National Dealer Services, $97 million in Wealth Management and $96 million in general Middle Market, partially offset by a decrease of $184 million in Mortgage Banker Finance. 

Total liabilities increased $883 million to $79.4 billion, primarily reflecting increases of $3.9 billion in short-term borrowings and $812 million in medium- and long-term debt (mainly consisting of FHLB advances), partially offset by a decrease of $3.7 billion in noninterest-bearing deposits, reflecting the impacts described above in "Period-End Balances." The decline in deposits included diversification efforts by customers with excess balances significantly above those of the average relationship profile and included decreases of $926 million in the Retail Bank, $914 million in Technology and Life Sciences, $806 million in general Middle Market (largest impact in the California market), $495 million in Wealth Management, $352 million in Business Banking, $329 million in Commercial Real Estate and $209 million in Equity Fund Services, partially offset by increases of $598 million in reciprocal money market deposits and $109 million in brokered time deposits, all of which are fully insured by the FDIC.

(a) Maximum number of shares that may be repurchased under the publicly announced plans or programs. 

(b) Includes approximately 31,000 shares purchased pursuant to deferred compensation plans and shares purchased from employees to pay for taxes related to restricted stock vesting under the terms of an employee share-based compensation plan during the three months ended March 31, 2023. These transactions are not considered part of the Corporation's repurchase program. 

The Corporation continues to target a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio of approximately 10 percent with active capital management. At March 31, 2023, the Corporation's estimated CET1 capital ratio was 10.09 percent, up from 10.00 percent at December 31, 2022. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in 2010, a total of 97.2 million shares have been authorized for repurchase. There is no expiration date for the share repurchase program. Due to recent disruption in the banking industry, management is not currently engaged in repurchasing shares and will continue to monitor various factors, including the Corporation's earnings generation, capital needs to fund future loan growth, regulatory changes and market conditions, before resuming the share repurchase program. 

The following table presents the minimum ratios required. 

Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 4.5 % Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 6.0 Total capital to risk-weighted assets 8.0 Capital conservation buffer (a) 2.5 Tier 1 capital to adjusted average assets (leverage ratio) 4.0 

(a) In addition to the minimum risk-based capital requirements, the Corporation is required to maintain a minimum capital conservation buffer, in the form of common equity, in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses. 

The Corporation's capital ratios exceeded minimum regulatory requirements as follows: 

March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 (dollar amounts in millions) Capital/Assets Ratio Capital/Assets Ratio Common equity tier 1 (a), (b) $ 8,124 10.09 % $ 7,884 10.00 % Tier 1 risk-based (a), (b) 8,518 10.58 8,278 10.50 Total risk-based (a) 10,089 12.53 9,817 12.45 Leverage (a) 8,518 9.71 8,278 9.55 Common shareholders' equity 5,600 6.15 4,787 5.60 Tangible common equity (b) 4,956 5.48 4,143 4.89 Risk-weighted assets (a) 80,518 78,871 

(a) March 31, 2023 capital, risk-weighted assets and ratios are estimated. 

(b) See Supplemental Financial Data section for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and regulatory ratios. 

The common shareholders' equity ratio increased 55 basis points to 6.15 percent at March 31, 2023 primarily due to decreased unrealized losses in the Corporation's investment securities and cash flow hedge portfolio. The unrealized losses in the Corporation's available-for-sale investment security portfolio are due to market valuations since the time of initial acquisition which are not expected to be realized. The tangible common equity ratio, which excludes goodwill and other intangible assets, increased 59 basis points to 5.48 percent for the same reasons discussed above. The impact of cumulative unrealized losses recorded within other comprehensive loss at March 31, 2023 to both ratios was approximately 350 basis points. 

RISK MANAGEMENT 

The following updated information should be read in conjunction with the "Risk Management" section on pages F-15 through F-30 in the Corporation's 2022 Annual Report. 

Credit Risk 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses increased $32 million from $661 million at December 31, 2022 to $693 million at March 31, 2023. As a percentage of total loans, the allowance for credit losses was 1.26 percent at March 31, 2023, compared to 1.24 percent at December 31, 2022. The allowance for credit losses covered 3.1 times and 2.7 times total nonperforming loans at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

The following table presents metrics of the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming loans. 

March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans 1.26 % 1.24 % Allowance for credit losses as a multiple of total nonaccrual loans 3.1x 2.8x Allowance for credit losses as a multiple of total nonperforming loans 3.1x 2.7x 

The economic forecasts informing the current expected credit loss (CECL) model primarily reflected continued strong credit quality, a tight labor market and strong demand for goods and services. Strong job and wage growth and pent-up demand from consumers have supported growth in the broader U.S. economy. However, there are increasing downside risks from recent bank failures, inflationary pressures, tighter monetary policy, negotiations around the U.S. federal debt ceiling, and the slowing housing market. Foreign developments also pose continued headwinds, including the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the uncertain effects of China's reopening on supply chains and inflationary pressures. 

These factors shaped the 2-year reasonable and supportable forecasts used by the Corporation in its CECL estimate at March 31, 2023. The U.S. economy is projected to contract modestly in second and third quarters 2023, before returning to growth in line with its longer-run average in 2024. Oil prices are expected to remain elevated over the forecast period and the unemployment rate is projected to increase. Interest rates are projected to increase in second quarter 2023, followed by a gradual decline as the Federal Reserve calibrates monetary policy to reduce inflation. Corporate bond spreads are expected to reflect normalized default risk. The following table summarizes select variables representative of the economic forecasts used to develop the allowance for credit losses estimate at March 31, 2023. 

Economic Variable Base Forecast Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth Contracts modestly in second and third quarters 2023 before recovering to an average growth rate of 2.0 percent in 2024. Unemployment rate Expected to increase to 4.8 percent by second quarter 2024 then improve modestly through the remainder of the forecast period. Corporate BBB bond to 10-year Treasury bond spreads Spreads widen to 2.5 percent by fourth quarter 2023 before normalizing to 2.0 percent in 2024. Oil Prices Prices steadily increase to over $88 per barrel by third quarter 2023, followed by a gradual decline to $78 per barrel by the end of the forecast period. 

Due to the high level of uncertainty regarding conditioning assumptions used as inputs to the forecast, the Corporation evaluated a range of economic scenarios, including more benign and more severe economic forecasts. In a more severe scenario, real GDP is projected to contract through second quarter 2024, subsequently improving to a growth rate of 1.8 percent by the end of the forecast period. Other key economic variables follow a similar pattern of short-term deterioration followed by a recovery. Selecting the more severe forecast would result in an increase in the quantitative calculation of allowance for credit losses of approximately $389 million as of March 31, 2023. However, factoring in model overlays and qualitative adjustments could result in a materially different estimate under a more severe scenario. The Corporation monitors evolving economic conditions for impacts to the allowance for credit losses. 

Allowance for Loan Losses 

The allowance for loan losses represents management&#8217;s estimates of current expected credit losses in the Corporation&#8217;s loan portfolio. Pools of loans with similar risk characteristics are collectively evaluated, while loans that no longer share risk characteristics with loan pools are evaluated individually. The allowance for loan losses increased $31 million to $641 million at March 31, 2023, compared to $610 million at December 31, 2022. 

Collective loss estimates are determined by applying reserve factors, designed to estimate current expected credit losses, to amortized cost balances over the remaining contractual life of the collectively evaluated portfolio. Loans with similar risk characteristics are aggregated into homogeneous pools. The allowance for loan losses also includes qualitative adjustments to bring the allowance to the level management believes is appropriate based on factors that have not otherwise been fully 

accounted for, including adjustments for foresight risk, input imprecisions and model imprecision. Credit losses for loans that no longer share risk characteristics with the loan pools are estimated on an individual basis. Individual credit loss estimates are typically performed for nonaccrual loans and are based on one of several methods, including the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, observable market value of similar debt or the present value of expected cash flows. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Lending-Related Commitments 

The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments estimates current expected credit losses on collective pools of letters of credit and unused commitments to extend credit based on reserve factors, determined in a manner similar to business loans, multiplied by a probability of draw estimate based on historical experience and credit risk, applied to commitment amounts. 

For additional information regarding the allowance for credit losses, refer to the "Critical Accounting Estimates" section and pages F-48 through F-49 in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation's 2022 Annual Report. 

Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming assets include loans on nonaccrual status and foreclosed assets. Effective January 1, 2023, the Corporation prospectively adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2022-02, which eliminated the accounting for TDRs. Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. At December 31, 2022, reduced-rate loans represented TDRs which had been renegotiated to less than their original contractual rates. 

The following table presents a summary of nonperforming assets and past due loans. 

(dollar amounts in millions) March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Nonaccrual loans $ 221 $ 240 Reduced-rate loans n/a 4 Total nonperforming loans/Total nonperforming assets $ 221 $ 244 Nonaccrual loans as a percentage of total loans 0.40 % 0.45 % Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans 0.40 0.46 Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and foreclosed property 0.40 0.46 Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing $ 20 $ 23 

Nonperforming assets decreased $23 million to $221 million at March 31, 2023, from $244 million at December 31, 2022. The decrease in nonperforming assets was primarily due to decreases of $12 million in nonaccrual retail loans and $7 million in nonaccrual business loans. Nonperforming loans were 0.40 percent of total loans at March 31, 2023, compared to 0.46 percent at December 31, 2022. For further information regarding the composition of nonaccrual loans, refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.

(b) Consumer, excluding residential mortgage and certain personal purpose nonaccrual loans and net charge-offs, are included in the Other category. 

Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest generally represent loans that are well-collateralized and in the process of collection. Loans past due 90 days or more decreased $3 million to $20 million at March 31, 2023, compared to $23 million at December 31, 2022. Loans past due 30-89 days decreased $210 million to $168 million at March 31, 2023, compared to $378 million at December 31, 2022. Loans past due 30 days or more and still accruing interest as a percentage of total loans were 0.34 percent and 0.75 percent at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. An aging analysis of loans included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements provides further information about the balances comprising past due loans. 

The following table presents a summary of total criticized loans. The Corporation's criticized list is consistent with the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful categories defined by regulatory authorities. Criticized loans on nonaccrual status are individually subjected to quarterly credit quality reviews, and the Corporation may establish specific allowances for such loans. A table of loans by credit quality indicator included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements provides further information about the balances comprising total criticized loans. 

(dollar amounts in millions) March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Total criticized loans $ 1,918 $ 1,572 As a percentage of total loans 3.5 % 2.9 % 

The $346 million increase in criticized loans during the three months ended March 31, 2023 included increases of $202 million in Commercial Real Estate, $58 million in general Middle Market, $57 million in Technology and Life Sciences and $42 million in Business Banking, partially offset by a decrease of $11 million in Corporate Banking. 

Concentrations of Credit Risk 

Concentrations of credit risk may exist when a number of borrowers are engaged in similar activities, or activities in the same geographic region, and have similar economic characteristics that would cause them to be similarly impacted by changes in economic or other conditions. The Corporation has concentrations of credit risk with the commercial real estate and automotive industries. All other industry concentrations, as defined by management, individually represented less than 10 percent of total loans at March 31, 2023. 

Commercial Real Estate Lending 

At March 31, 2023, the Corporation's commercial real estate portfolio represented 31 percent of total loans. The following table summarizes the Corporation's commercial real estate loan portfolio by loan category.

(a) Primarily loans to real estate developers. 

(b) Primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real estate. 

The Corporation limits risk inherent in its commercial real estate lending activities by monitoring borrowers directly involved in the commercial real estate markets and adhering to conservative policies on loan-to-value ratios for such loans. Commercial real estate loans, consisting of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans, totaled $17.2 billion at March 31, 2023. Commercial real estate loans made to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line, which includes loans to real estate developers, totaled $7.8 billion, or 46 percent of total commercial real estate loans, an increase of $623 million compared to December 31, 2022. The Commercial Real Estate business line at March 31, 2023 was predominantly secured by multi-family and industrial properties, comprising 44% and 33% of the portfolio, respectively, with only 7% secured by office properties, most of which were suburban. Commercial real estate loans in other business lines totaled $9.4 billion, or 54 percent of total commercial real estate loans, at March 31, 2023, an increase of $125 million compared to December 31, 2022. These loans consisted primarily of owner-occupied commercial mortgages, which bear credit characteristics similar to non-commercial real estate business loans. Generally, loans previously reported as real estate construction are classified as commercial mortgage loans upon receipt of a certificate of occupancy. 

The real estate construction loan portfolio primarily contains loans made to long-tenured customers with satisfactory completion experience. Criticized real estate construction loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line were $26 million at March 31, 2023, compared to none at December 31, 2022. In other business lines, criticized real estate construction loans totaled $3 million at both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

The following table summarizes net charge-offs related to the Corporation's commercial real estate loan portfolio.

Commercial mortgage loans are loans where the primary collateral is a lien on any real property and are primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real estate. Real property is generally considered primary collateral if the value of that collateral represents more than 50 percent of the commitment at loan approval. Loans in the commercial mortgage portfolio generally mature within three to five years. Criticized commercial mortgage loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $192 million and $16 million at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, with the increase primarily in multi-family properties. In other business lines, $157 million and $151 million of commercial mortgage loans were criticized at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. There were no commercial mortgage loan net charge-offs during the three months ended March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 or March 31, 2022. 

Automotive Lending - Dealer 

The following table presents a summary of dealer loans. 

March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 (in millions) Loans Outstanding Percent of Total Loans Loans Outstanding Percent of Total Loans Dealer: Floor plan $ 1,576 $ 1,379 Other 4,036 3,988 Total dealer $ 5,612 10.2 % $ 5,367 10.1 % 

Substantially all dealer loans are in the National Dealer Services business line and primarily include floor plan financing and other loans to automotive dealerships. Floor plan loans, included in commercial loans in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, totaled $1.6 billion at March 31, 2023, an increase of $197 million compared to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2022, as a result of new relationships and continued merger and acquisition activity by our customers. Other loans to automotive dealers in the National Dealer Services business line totaled $4.0 billion, including $2.3 billion of owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans, at both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

There were no nonaccrual dealer loans at both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Additionally, there were no net charge-offs of dealer loans during the three months ended March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 or March 31, 2022. 

Automotive Lending - Production 

The following table presents a summary of loans to borrowers involved with automotive production. 

March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 (in millions) Loans Outstanding Percent of Total Loans Loans Outstanding Percent of Total Loans Production: Domestic $ 758 $ 797 Foreign 302 271 Total production $ 1,060 1.9 % $ 1,068 2.0 % 

Loans to borrowers involved with automotive production, primarily Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers, totaled $1.1 billion at both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. These borrowers have faced, and could face in the future, financial difficulties due to disruptions in auto production as well as their supply chains and logistics operations. As such, management continues to monitor this portfolio. 

Nonaccrual loans to borrowers involved with automotive production totaled $5 million at both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. There were no automotive production loan net charge-offs during the three months ended March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 or March 31, 2022. 

Residential Real Estate Lending 

At March 31, 2023, residential real estate loans represented 7 percent of total loans. The following table summarizes the Corporation's residential mortgage and home equity loan portfolios by geographic market. 

March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 (dollar amounts in millions) Residential Mortgage Loans % of Total Home Equity Loans % of Total Residential Mortgage Loans % of Total Home Equity Loans % of Total Geographic market: Michigan $ 486 27 % $ 470 26 % $ 497 27 % $ 487 27 % California 872 48 879 49 866 48 852 48 Texas 279 15 351 20 258 14 354 20 Other Markets 185 10 84 5 193 11 83 5 Total $ 1,822 100 % $ 1,784 100 % $ 1,814 100 % $ 1,776 100 % 

Residential real estate loans, which consist of traditional residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit, totaled $3.6 billion at March 31, 2023. The residential real estate portfolio is principally located within the Corporation's primary geographic markets. Substantially all residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more are placed on nonaccrual status, and substantially all junior lien home equity loans that are current or less than 90 days past due are placed on nonaccrual 

status if full collection of the senior position is in doubt. At no later than 180 days past due, such loans are charged off to current appraised values less costs to sell. 

Residential mortgages totaled $1.8 billion at March 31, 2023, and were primarily larger, variable-rate mortgages originated and retained for certain private banking relationship customers. Of the $1.8 billion of residential mortgage loans outstanding, $39 million were on nonaccrual status at March 31, 2023, a decrease of $14 million. The home equity portfolio totaled $1.8 billion at March 31, 2023, of which 97 percent was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit, 2 percent were in amortizing status and 1 percent were closed-end home equity loans. Of the $1.8 billion of home equity loans outstanding, $18 million were on nonaccrual status at March 31, 2023. A majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens at March 31, 2023. 

Energy Lending 

The Corporation has a portfolio of Energy loans that are included entirely in commercial loans in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Customers in the Corporation's Energy business line are engaged in three segments of the oil and gas business: exploration and production (E&#38;P), midstream and energy services. E&#38;P generally includes such activities as searching for potential oil and gas fields, drilling exploratory wells and operating active wells. Commitments to E&#38;P borrowers are generally subject to semi-annual borrowing base re-determinations based on a variety of factors including updated prices (reflecting market and competitive conditions), energy reserve levels and the impact of hedging. The midstream sector is generally involved in the transportation, storage and marketing of crude and/or refined oil and gas products. The Corporation's legacy energy services customers provide products and services primarily to the E&#38;P segment. 

The following table summarizes information about loans in the Corporation's Energy business line.

Loans in the Energy business line totaled $1.4 billion, or less than 3 percent of total loans, at March 31, 2023, a decrease of $13 million compared to December 31, 2022. Total exposure, including unused commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, was $3.5 billion at March 31, 2023 (a utilization rate of 41 percent) and $3.4 billion at December 31, 2022 (a utilization rate of 43 percent). Nonaccrual Energy loans were $7 million at both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Criticized Energy loans were $12 million, or 1 percent of total criticized loans, at both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

The following table summarizes net charge-offs related to the Corporation's Energy business line.

Leveraged Loans 

Certain loans in the Corporation's commercial portfolio are considered leveraged transactions. These loans are typically used for mergers, acquisitions, business recapitalizations, refinancing and equity buyouts. To help mitigate the risk associated with these loans, the Corporation focuses on middle market companies with highly capable management teams, strong sponsors and solid track records of financial performance. Industries prone to cyclical downturns and acquisitions with a high degree of integration risk are generally avoided. Other considerations include the sufficiency of collateral, the level of balance sheet leverage and the adequacy of financial covenants. During the underwriting process, cash flows are stress-tested to evaluate the borrowers' abilities to handle economic downturns and an increase in interest rates. 

The FDIC defines higher-risk commercial and industrial (HR C&#38;I) loans for assessment purposes as loans generally with leverage of four times total debt to earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation (EBITDA) as well as three times senior debt to EBITDA, excluding certain collateralized loans. 

The following tables summarize information about HR C&#38;I loans, which represented 6 percent of total loans at both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

Market and Liquidity Risk 

Market risk represents the risk of loss due to adverse movement in prices, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. Liquidity risk represents the risk that the Corporation does not have sufficient access to funds to maintain its normal operations at all times or does not have the ability to raise or borrow funds at a reasonable cost at all times. 

The Asset and Liability Policy Committee (ALCO) of the Corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities. ALCO meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the Corporation, including treasury, finance, economics, lending, deposit gathering and risk management. Corporate Treasury mitigates market and liquidity risk under the direction of ALCO through the actions it takes to manage the Corporation's market, liquidity and capital positions. 

The Corporation performs monthly liquidity stress testing to evaluate its ability to meet funding needs in hypothetical stressed environments. Such environments cover a series of scenarios, including both idiosyncratic and market-wide in nature, which vary in terms of duration and severity. Recent events have created greater uncertainty with respect to normal deposit patterns. Following the March 2023 banking industry disruption, the Corporation activated its contingency funding plan by increasing its cash position through wholesale funding channels and brokered deposits. The Corporation's evaluation as of March 31, 2023 projected that sufficient sources of liquidity were available under each series of events. 

In addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis, Corporate Treasury also monitors the parent company's liquidity and has established liquidity coverage requirements for meeting expected obligations without the support of additional dividends from subsidiaries. ALCO's policy on liquidity risk management requires the parent company to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet expected cash obligations, such as debt service, dividend payments and normal operating expenses, over a period of no less than 12 months. The Corporation had liquid assets of $1.8 billion on an unconsolidated basis at March 31, 2023. 

Corporate Treasury and the Enterprise Risk Division support ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market risks. Key activities encompass: (i) providing information and analyses of the Corporation's balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate and all other market risks; (ii) monitoring and reporting the Corporation's positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines; (iii) developing and presenting analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions; (iv) reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval; and (v) monitoring industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market and liquidity risks. 

Interest Rate Risk 

Net interest income is the primary source of revenue for the Corporation. Interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities, primarily through the Corporation's core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits. The Corporation's balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating-rate loans funded by core deposits. Including the impact of interest rate swaps converting floating-rate loans to fixed, the Corporation's loan composition at March 31, 2023 was 48 percent fixed-rate, 42 percent overnight to 30-day rate (primarily BSBY and SOFR), 6 percent 90-day and greater rates and 4 percent prime. The composition of the loan portfolio creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the faster repricing of the floating-rate loan portfolio versus deposit products. In addition, the growth and/or contraction in the Corporation's loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions. Examples of such actions are purchasing fixed-rate investment securities, which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest rate sensitivity, as well as hedging with interest rate swaps and options. Other mitigating factors include interest rate floors on a portion of the loan portfolio. 

The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity. The Corporation is currently targeting low single digit net interest income at risk to a 100 basis point gradual decline in interest rates. 

Since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives, a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk. These techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios, including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve utilizing multiple simulation analyses. Simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors, including, but not limited to, the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions, regulatory impacts and management strategies. 

Sensitivity of Net Interest Income to Changes in Interest Rates 

The analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is management's principal risk management technique. Management models a base-case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment using a static balance sheet and generates sensitivity scenarios by changing certain model assumptions. Each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth, investment security prepayment levels, depositor behavior and overall balance sheet mix and growth which are in line with historical patterns. Changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis. Model assumptions in the sensitivity scenarios at March 31, 2023 included for the rising rate scenario, a modest increase in loan balances and a moderate decrease in deposit balances, and for the declining rate scenario, a modest decrease in loan balances and a moderate increase in deposit balances. In addition, both scenarios assumed loan spreads held at current levels, an incremental interest-bearing deposit beta of approximately 30%, no reinvestment of securities portfolio cash flows and no additions to interest rate swaps. 

The average balance of the securities portfolio included in the analysis was $18.8 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 with an average yield of 2.10% and effective duration of 5.5 years. 

The table below details components of the cash flow hedge portfolio at March 31, 2023. 

Cash Flow Hedges (dollar amounts in millions) Notional Amount Weighted Average Yield Years to Maturity (a) 

Swaps under contract at March 31, 2023 (b) 

$ 26,150 2.45 % 4.5 Weighted average notional active per period: Full year 2023 22,372 2.38 4.2 Full year 2024 23,575 2.50 4.7 Full year 2025 22,973 2.57 4.9 

(a) Years to maturity calculated from a starting date of March 31, 2023. 

(b) Includes forward starting swaps of $2.1 billion starting in 2023 and $2.0 billion starting in 2024. Excluding forward starting swaps, the weighted average yield was 2.34%. 

The analysis also includes interest rate swaps that convert $7.2 billion of fixed-rate medium- and long-term debt and FHLB advances to variable rates through fair value hedges. Additionally, included in this analysis are $16.2 billion of loans that were subject to an average interest rate floor of 50 basis points at March 31, 2023. This base-case net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which short-term rates rise or decline 100 basis points (with a floor of zero percent) in a linear, parallel fashion from the base case over 12 months, resulting in an average change of 50 basis points over the period. 

The table below, as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above. 

Estimated Annual Change March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 (dollar amounts in millions) Amount % Amount % Change in Interest Rates: Change in Interest Rates: Rising 100 basis points $ (35) (1 %) Rising 100 basis points 

$ 10 &#8212; % (50 basis points on average) (50 basis points on average) Declining 100 basis points (31) (1) Declining 100 basis points (72) (2) (50 basis points on average) (50 basis points on average) 

Sensitivity to declining interest rates decreased from December 31, 2022 to March 31, 2023 resulting from a decline in non-maturity deposits. Sensitivity to rising interest rates at March 31, 2023 projected lower interest income than the base case scenario due to non-maturity deposit runoff and an increase in floating-rate wholesale funding. 

At March 31, 2023, an additional sensitivity scenario was added, applying the rising 100 basis point scenario assumptions with a 50% incremental deposit beta relative to the base case scenario to assess the impact of the Corporation's deposit beta assumptions. In this scenario, net interest income decreased by $57 million due to a more competitive deposit pricing environment. All scenarios presented for March 31, 2023 reflected a change in balance sheet composition following the March 2023 banking industry disruption, as the balance sheet shifted to a higher concentration of cash as well as an increase in wholesale funding and brokered deposits, which contributed to the decrease in net interest income in all scenarios presented. 

Sensitivity of Economic Value of Equity to Changes in Interest Rates 

In addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income, an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk position. The economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the Corporation's financial assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period, and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements. The Corporation primarily monitors the percentage change on the base-case economic value of equity. The economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel 100 basis point shock with a floor of zero percent. 

The table below, as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate scenario described above. 

March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 (dollar amounts in millions) Amount % Amount % Change in Interest Rates: Change in Interest Rates: Rising 100 basis points $ (572) (4 %) Rising 100 basis points $ (417) (3 %) Declining 100 basis points 743 5 Declining 100 basis points 627 4 

The sensitivity of the economic value of equity to rising rates increased from December 31, 2022 to March 31, 2023 due to deposit runoff and a mix shift of funding sources. Sensitivity to declining rates increased the economic value of equity due to the same factors. 

LIBOR Transition 

On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. Effective March 2021, the FCA confirmed that certain LIBOR tenors will no longer be supported after December 31, 2021 and that the remaining tenors, including those most commonly used by the Corporation, will cease to be supported after June 30, 2023. The Corporation has substantial exposure to LIBOR-based products, including loans and derivatives, and is prepared for the transition from LIBOR toward alternative rates. 

The Corporation ceased originating LIBOR-based products in the fourth quarter of 2021 and has since reduced total LIBOR exposure by approximately 59 percent to $25.6 billion. Substantially all of the Corporation&#8217;s LIBOR exposure is comprised of loans, swaps and options. Of the remaining LIBOR-based products, 88 percent required no further remediation because the instruments mature prior to cessation or include fallback language. 

As of March 31, 2023, there were approximately $11.2 billion of LIBOR-based loans, compared to $16.0 billion at December 31, 2022. Of these, approximately 14 percent have maturity dates prior to cessation, 60 percent mature after cessation but have fallback language and the remaining 26 percent are in process of remediation. The Corporation is confident it will complete its remediation efforts in a timely manner. 

In addition to remediation activity on LIBOR-based loans, the Corporation has enacted the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) protocols which relates to $14.3 billion of derivatives. Once events occur that trigger a fallback, the reference rate for the variable leg of the swap will fall back from LIBOR to the ISDA Fallback Rate, which is the daily SOFR plus a spread. 

The Corporation's enterprise transition timelines are closely aligned with recommendations from the Alternative Reference Rates Committee for both best practices and recommended objectives. The Corporation will continue to align with industry and regulatory guidelines regarding the cessation of LIBOR as well as monitor market developments for alternative reference rates. For a discussion of the various risks facing the Corporation in relation to the transition away from LIBOR, see the market risk discussion within &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; beginning on page 15 of the Corporation's 2022 Annual Report. 

Sources of Liquidity 

The Corporation maintains a liquidity position that it believes will adequately satisfy its financial obligations while taking into account potential commitment draws and deposit run-off that may occur in the normal course of business. The majority of the Corporation's balance sheet is funded by customer deposits. Cash flows from loan repayments, increases in deposit accounts (including brokered deposits), activity in the securities portfolio and wholesale funding channels serve as the Corporation's primary liquidity sources. 

The Corporation satisfies incremental liquidity needs with either liquid assets or external funding sources. Available liquidity includes cash, FHLB advances and Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) borrowing, comprised of borrowing through the discount window and the newly established Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP). The Corporation has pledged its investment securities portfolio to access wholesale funding as needed and does not intend to sell or restructure securities at this time. 

The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Dallas, Texas, which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related loans, certain government agency-backed securities and other eligible assets. Actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral pledged to the FHLB and the fair value of pledged assets, as well as applicable FHLB haircuts. 

At March 31, 2023, the Bank had pledged real estate-related loans totaling $20.4 billion and investment securities totaling $6.6 billion to the FHLB, which provided for up to $16.0 billion of collateralized borrowing with the FHLB. 

The FRB provides liquidity through its discount window, where banks may borrow funds based on the discounted fair value of pledged assets. Additionally, in March 2023, the FRB established the BTFP in response to the recent industry disruption, offering loans with up to one year in maturity to eligible depository institutions in exchange for pledged collateral in the form of U.S Treasuries, agency debt and mortgage-backed securities and other qualifying assets. Unlike other funding sources, borrowing capacity under the BTFP is based on the par value, not fair value, of collateral. 

At March 31, 2023, the Bank had pledged loans totaling $25.0 billion and investment securities totaling $9.7 billion to the FRB, which provided for up to $20.4 billion and $11.4 billion of collateralized borrowing through the discount window and BTFP program, respectively. Total available collateralized borrowings with the FRB totaled $31.8 billion at March 31, 2023. 

The table below details the Corporation's sources of available liquidity at March 31, 2023.

(a) Included in interest-bearing deposits with banks on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

The Corporation may also use brokered deposits and external debt as additional sources of funding, and maintains a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission through which it may issue securities. 

The ability of the Corporation and the Bank to raise unsecured funding at competitive rates is impacted by rating agencies' views of the credit quality, liquidity, capital, earnings and other relevant factors related to the Corporation and the Bank. As of March 31, 2023, the three major rating agencies had assigned the following ratings to long-term senior unsecured obligations of the Corporation and the Bank, as well as long-term deposits at the Bank. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

At the same time, Moody's also lowered the macro profile of the U.S. banking system to "Strong +" from "Very Strong -", reflecting general concern around the banking industry as a whole. For additional information, see the credit rating discussion within &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221;. 

Deposit Concentrations and Uninsured Deposits 

The Corporation's focus is commercial customers, and accordingly, it has a larger percentage of uninsured deposits relative to financial institutions with a higher consumer focus. These deposits are well-diversified between geographies, industries and customers. From March 9, 2023 to March 31, 2023, deposits decreased by $3.7 billion largely due to diversification efforts by customers with excess balances above those of the average relationship profile, with the largest declines in Technology and Life Sciences, Corporate Banking and general Middle Market (mostly in the California market, which accounted for 42% of general Middle Market deposits).

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

The Corporation&#8217;s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Corporation's 2022 Annual Report. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporation&#8217;s future financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2022, the most critical of these estimates related to the allowance for credit losses, fair value measurement, pension plan accounting and income taxes. These estimates were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporation&#8217;s Board of Directors and are discussed more fully on pages F-31 through F-34 in the Corporation's 2022 Annual Report. As of the date of this report, there have been no significant changes to the Corporation's critical accounting estimates as disclosed in the Corporation's 2022 Annual Report. 

SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATA 

The Corporation believes non-GAAP measures are meaningful because they reflect adjustments commonly made by management, investors, regulators and analysts to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and our performance trends. Tangible common equity is used by the Corporation to measure the quality of capital and the return relative to balance sheet risk. 

Common equity tier 1 capital ratio removes preferred stock from the Tier 1 capital ratio as defined by and calculated in conformity with bank regulations. The tangible common equity ratio removes the effect of intangible assets from capital and total assets. Tangible common equity per share of common stock removes the effect of intangible assets from common shareholders' equity per share of common stock. The Corporation believes that the presentation of tangible common equity adjusted for the impact of accumulated other comprehensive loss provides a greater understanding of ongoing operations and enhances comparability with prior periods. 

The following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and regulatory ratios used in this financial review with financial measures defined by GAAP.
