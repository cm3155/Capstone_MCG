2022 OVERVIEW

Comerica Incorporated (the Corporation) is a financial holding company headquartered in Dallas, Texas. The Corporation's major business segments are
the Commercial Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. Information about the activities of the Corporation's business segments is provided in Note 22 to
the consolidated financial statements.

As a financial institution, the Corporation's principal activity is lending to and accepting deposits from businesses and individuals. The primary source of
revenue is net interest income, which is principally derived from the difference between interest earned on loans and investment securities and interest paid on
deposits  and  other  funding  sources.  The  Corporation  also  provides  other  products  and  services  that  meet  the  financial  needs  of  customers  which  generate
noninterest  income,  the  Corporation's  secondary  source  of  revenue.  Growth  in  loans,  deposits  and  noninterest  income  is  affected  by  many  factors,  including
economic conditions in the markets the Corporation serves, the financial requirements and economic health of customers and the ability to add new customers
and/or increase the number of products used by current customers. Success in providing products and services depends on the financial needs of customers and the
types of products desired.

The accounting and reporting policies of the Corporation and its subsidiaries conform to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United
States (U.S.). The Corporation's consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are
described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. When necessary, the Corporation uses reasonable assumptions to develop estimates that affect the
consolidated results of operations. The most critical of these estimates are discussed in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of this financial review.

Full-Year 2022 compared to Full-Year 2021

• Net income decreased $17 million to $1.2 billion, driven by an increase in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by an increase in net interest
income due to higher short-term rates and growth in investment securities and loans. Pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) increased $430 million to
$1.5 billion. (See Supplemental Financial Data section for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures.) Diluted net income per common share was
$8.47 in 2022 compared to $8.35 in 2021.

• Average loans increased $1.4 billion, or 3 percent, to $50.5 billion, and included increases in Corporate Banking, general Middle Market, Equity Fund
Services, Environmental Services, National Dealer Services, Commercial Real Estate and Entertainment Lending, partially offset by declines in Mortgage
Banker Finance, Business Banking and Retail Banking. Excluding the impact of a $2.2 billion decline in average Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)
loans, which are reported within lines of business, average loans increased $3.6 billion, or 8 percent.

• Average securities increased $3.3 billion, or 21 percent, to $19.0 billion, reflecting the investment of a portion of excess liquidity into mortgage-backed

securities, partly offset by maturities of Treasury securities.

• Average deposits decreased $2.2 billion, or 3 percent, to $75.5 billion. Average interest-bearing deposits decreased $2.8 billion, or 8 percent, reflecting
strategic deposit management and customers utilizing balances to fund business activities, partially offset by an increase in average noninterest bearing-
deposits of $577 million, or 1 percent.

• Net interest income increased $622 million to $2.5 billion, and the net interest margin increased 81 basis points to 3.02 percent, largely due to higher

•

short-term rates and growth in loans and securities balances, partly offset by the net impact of PPP loans.
The provision for credit losses increased to an expense of $60 million, compared to a benefit of $384 million in 2021, which was primarily the result of
loan growth and reflected strong credit metrics and a modest deterioration in economic forecasts.

• Noninterest  income  decreased  $55  million  to  $1.1  billion,  reflecting  decreases  in  deferred  compensation  asset  returns  (offset  in  noninterest  expenses),
warrant-related  income,  card  fees  and  investment  banking  fees,  partially  offset  by  increases  in  derivative  income,  risk  management  hedging  income,
brokerage fees and commercial lending fees.

• Noninterest expenses increased $137 million to $2.0 billion, primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits expense, operational losses, occupancy
expense, travel and entertainment expense, FDIC insurance expense and consulting fees, partially offset by decreases in outside processing fee expense,
non-salary pension expense and legal-related expenses.
The Corporation declared common dividends of $2.72 per share, returning $391 million to common shareholders. Additionally, the Corporation declared
$23 million in preferred dividends.

•

The  following  provides  a  comparative  discussion  of  the  Corporation's  consolidated  results  of  operations  for  2022  compared  to  2021.  A  comparative
discussion  of  results  for  2021  compared  to  2020  is  provided  in  the  "Results  of  Operations"  section  beginning  on  page  F-4  of  the  Corporation's  2021  Annual
Report.

(a) Rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume.

Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities. Gains and losses related to risk management interest
rate  swaps  that  convert  fixed  rate  debt  to  a  floating  rate  and  qualify  as  fair  value  hedges  are  included  in  interest  expense  on  medium-  and  long-term  debt.
Additionally, the portion of gains and losses on risk management interest rate swaps that convert variable-rate loans to fixed rates through cash flow hedges that
relate  to  the  earnings  effect  of  the  hedged  loans  during  the  period  are  included  in  loan  interest  income.  Refer  to  the  Analysis  of  Net  Interest  Income  and  the
Rate/Volume Analysis tables above for an analysis of net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 and details of the components of
the change in net interest income for 2022 compared to 2021 as well as 2021 compared to 2020.

Net interest income was $2.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $622 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2021.
The increase in net interest income reflected higher yields on earning assets and growth in mortgage-backed securities and loan balances, partially offset by higher
rates paid on deposits and debt as well as the net impact of PPP loans. Net interest margin was 3.02 percent for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of
81 basis points compared to 2.21 percent for the comparable period in 2021. The increase in net interest margin was driven by higher short-term rates as well as a
decrease in lower-yielding deposits held with the Federal Reserve.

Average  earning  assets  decreased  $4.7  billion,  due  to  declines  of  $9.4  billion  in  interest-bearing  deposits  with  banks  and  $1.2  billion  in  Treasury
securities, partially offset by increases of $4.5 billion in mortgage-backed securities and $1.4 billion in loans. Average interest-bearing funding sources decreased
$2.6 billion, reflecting a $2.8 billion decrease in interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a $434 million increase in short-term borrowings.

The  Corporation  utilizes  various  asset  and  liability  management  strategies  to  manage  net  interest  income  exposure  to  interest  rate  risk.  Refer  to  the

“Market and Liquidity Risk” section of this financial review for additional information regarding

assets and interest-bearing liabilities.

Provision for Credit Losses

The provision for credit losses was an expense of $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to a benefit of $384 million for the year
ended  December  31,  2021.  The  increase  in  provision  was  primarily  the  result  of  loan  growth  and  reflected  strong  credit  metrics  and  a  modest  deterioration  in
economic  forecasts.  Net  loan  charge-offs  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022  were  $17  million,  or  0.03  percent  of  average  total  loans,  compared  to  net
recoveries of $10 million, or 0.02 percent of average total loans, for the year ended December 31, 2021. Energy net charge-offs for the 2022 period totaled $3
million, compared to $48 million of Energy net recoveries recorded in the 2021 period, an increase of $51 million, which was partially offset by decreases of $12
million in general Middle Market and $9 million in Corporate Banking. The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments increased $35 million to
$21 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

An  analysis  of  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  and  a  summary  of  nonperforming  assets  are  presented  under  the  "Credit  Risk"  subheading  in  the  "Risk
Management" section of this financial review. For information regarding methodology used in the determination of allowance for credit losses, refer to Note 1 to
the consolidated financial statements.

(a) The table below provides further details on certain categories included in other noninterest income.

Noninterest income decreased $55 million to $1.1 billion, reflecting decreases in other noninterest income and card fees, partially offset by increases in
derivative  income,  brokerage  fees  and  commercial  lending  fees.  Other  noninterest  income  included  decreases  in  deferred  compensation  asset  returns  (offset  in
noninterest expenses), warrant-related income and investment banking fees, partially offset by an increase in risk management hedging income.

Card fees consist primarily of interchange and other fee income earned on government prepaid card, commercial card, debit/Automated Teller Machine
(ATM) card and merchant payment processing services. Card fees decreased $25 million, or 8 percent, reflecting a decline in government cards due to elevated
activity from stimulus payments during 2021. Commercial card and merchant services increased from higher sales and payment processing volumes, respectively,
while ATM surcharge income decreased.

Commercial  lending  fees  include  fees  assessed  on  the  unused  portion  of  lines  of  credit  (unused  commitment  fees),  syndication  agent  fees  and  loan
servicing  fees.  These  fees  increased  $5  million,  or  3  percent,  reflecting  higher  syndication  agent  fees  from  an  increase  in  the  number  of  deals,  as  well  as  an
increase  in  loan  commitment  fees  from  growth  and  lower  utilization  rates  on  lines  of  credit.  These  increases  were  partially  offset  by  a  decline  in  loan  service
charges from lower application volumes, primarily in Mortgage Banker Finance.

Derivative  income  consists  of  net  gains  and  losses  recognized  on  customer-initiated  derivative  instruments,  net  of  the  impact  of  offsetting  positions.
Derivative income increased $10 million, or 11 percent, primarily due to increases in energy and interest rate swap activity, partially offset by less favorable credit
valuation adjustments.

Brokerage fees are commissions earned for facilitating securities transactions for customers as well as other brokerage services provided. Brokerage fees
increased  $7  million,  or  45  percent,  driven  by  higher  money  market  funds  revenue  from  increased  service  fees,  partially  offset  by  lower  transactional  revenue
related to mutual funds.

Other noninterest income decreased $56 million, or 55 percent, as detailed below, driven by losses on deferred compensation assets, lower warrant-related
income mostly due to elevated gains on monetization in the 2021 period and a decrease in investment banking fees from a decline in the average size and number
of deals. These were partially offset by higher risk management hedging income related to an increase in price alignment income received for centrally cleared risk
management positions.

(a)        Centrally-cleared  derivative  positions  are  settled  daily  based  on  derivative  fair  values  and  the  party  receiving  net  settlement  amounts  pays  price  alignment,  based  on  an
earning rate, to the party making settlement payments. Accordingly, the Corporation may recognize risk management hedging income consisting of price alignment income or
expense depending on the fair value of its positions.

(b)    Includes changes in value of shares obtained through monetization of warrants, previously reported in securities trading income.
(c)    Compensation deferred by the Corporation's officers and directors is invested based on investment selections of the officers and directors. Income earned on these assets is

reported in noninterest income and the offsetting change in deferred compensation plan liabilities is reported in salaries and benefits expense.

Noninterest expenses increased $137 million to $2.0 billion, primarily due to higher salaries and benefits expense, operational losses, occupancy expense,
travel and entertainment expense, FDIC insurance expense and consulting fees, partially offset by decreases in outside processing fee expense, non-salary pension
expense and legal-related expenses.

Salaries  and  benefits  expense  increased  $75  million,  or  7  percent,  reflecting  increases  from  annual  merit  adjustments,  performance-  and  stock-based

compensation, contract labor and severance costs, partially offset by a decrease in deferred compensation expense (offset in other noninterest income).

Outside processing fee expense decreased $15 million, or 5 percent, reflecting a decline in data processing support for PPP loans and lower volumes of

government card transactions tied to card fee revenues.

Occupancy expense increased $14 million, or 8 percent, largely due to lease termination costs and accelerated amortization related to closures of bank

branches and offices, as well as rent on newly leased corporate facilities.

FDIC insurance expense increased $9 million, or 41 percent, reflecting higher assessment rates in 2022 primarily driven by a $16.9 billion decrease in

interest-bearing deposits with banks, declining from elevated levels seen in 2021, which had a punitive impact on the assessment rate.

Other  noninterest  expenses  increased  $45  million,  or  116  percent,  driven  by  increases  in  operational  losses,  travel  and  entertainment  expense  and

consulting fees, partially offset by decreases in non-salary pension expense and legal-related expenses.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, the above detail included expenses for certain modernization initiatives related to the transformation of the retail
banking delivery model, alignment of corporate facilities and optimization of technology platforms totaling $38 million, comprised of transitional real estate costs
($13 million reported in occupancy expense), asset impairments and consulting fees ($11 million reported in other noninterest expenses) as well as contract labor
and severance costs ($14 million reported in salaries and benefits expense).

Income Taxes and Related Items

The provision for income taxes was $325 million in 2022, compared to $322 million in 2021. Net deferred tax assets were $1.1 billion at December 31,
2022,  compared  to  $9  million  at  December  31,  2021.  Refer  to  Note  18  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for  information  about  the  components  of  net
deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets of $1.4 billion were evaluated for realization and it was determined that a valuation allowance of $5 million for federal
foreign tax credits and certain state net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards was needed at both December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

STRATEGIC LINES OF BUSINESS

The  Corporation  has  strategically  aligned  its  operations  into  three  major  business  segments:  the  Commercial  Bank,  the  Retail  Bank  and  Wealth
Management. These business segments are differentiated based on the type of customer and the related products and services provided. In addition to the three
major business segments, the Finance Division is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes items not directly associated with the business segments
or the Finance segment. The performance of the business segments is not comparable with the Corporation's consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable
with similar information for any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not
indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements describes the Corporation's
segment reporting methodology as well as the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of the business segments for the years
ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

The Corporation's management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies, which
are  regularly  reviewed  and  refined.  These  methodologies  may  be  modified  as  the  management  accounting  system  is  enhanced  and  changes  occur  in  the
organizational structure and/or product lines.

Net interest income for each segment reflects the interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities plus the
net impact from associated internal funds transfer pricing (FTP). The FTP methodology allocates credits to each business segment for deposits and other funds
provided  as  well  as  charges  for  loans  and  other  assets  being  funded.  FTP  crediting  rates  on  deposits  and  other  funds  provided  reflect  the  long-term  value  of
deposits and other funding sources based on their implied maturities. Due to the longer-term nature of implied maturities, FTP crediting rates are generally less
volatile than changes in interest rates observed in the market. FTP charge rates for funding loans and other assets reflect a matched cost of funds based on the
pricing and duration characteristics of the assets. As a result of applying matched funding, interest revenue for each segment resulting from loans and other assets
is generally not impacted by changes in interest rates. Therefore, net interest income for each segment primarily reflects the volume of loans and other earning
assets at the spread over the matched cost of funds, as well as the volume of deposits at the associated FTP crediting rates. Generally, in periods of rising interest
rates, FTP charge rates for funding loans and FTP crediting rates on deposits will increase, with FTP crediting rates for deposits typically repricing at a slower pace
than FTP charge rates for funding loans.

The following table presents net income (loss) by business segment.

(a) Included PPP loans with average balances of $100 million and $1.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
n/m - not meaningful

Average loans increased $1.7 billion, reflecting increases in Corporate Banking, general Middle Market, Equity Fund Services, Environmental Services,
National Dealer Services, Commercial Real Estate and Entertainment, partially offset by decreases in Mortgage Banker Finance and Business Banking (driven by
the decline in PPP balances). Average deposits decreased $3.0 billion, reflecting decreases in general Middle Market, Corporate Banking and Technology and Life
Sciences,  partially  offset  by  increases  in  Energy  and  Commercial  Real  Estate,  due  to  strategic  deposit  management  and  customers  utilizing  balances  to  fund
business activities. The Commercial Bank's net income decreased $277 million to $1.1 billion. Net interest income increased $179 million due to an increase in
loan  income,  partially  offset  by  higher  allocated  net  FTP  charges  and  a  decline  in  PPP  loan  fees.  The  provision  for  credit  losses  increased  $378  million  to  an
expense of $32 million, which primarily resulted from loan growth and reflected strong credit metrics and a modest deterioration in economic forecasts. Net credit-
related charge-offs were $21 million, an increase of $33 million, primarily due to an increase in Energy net charge-offs, partially offset by decreases in general
Middle Market and Corporate Banking net charge-offs. Noninterest income decreased $56 million, driven by lower warrant-related income as well as a decline in
card fees due to higher activity in 2021 from stimulus payments. Noninterest expenses increased $93 million, primarily reflecting increases in salaries and benefits
expense, corporate overhead and operational losses, partially offset by a decrease in outside processing fee expense.

Average  loans  decreased  $319  million  due  to  a  $397  million  decline  in  PPP  loans.  Average  deposits  increased  $1.0  billion,  reflecting  increases  in  all
deposit categories with the exception of time deposits as consumer deposits benefited from government stimulus payments made in 2021, which remained through
2022. The Retail Bank's net income increased $37 million to $80 million. Net interest income increased $115 million to $680 million, primarily due to higher FTP
crediting  rates  on  deposits.  The  provision  for  credit  losses  increased  $16  million  from  a  benefit  of  $5  million.  Noninterest  income  was  relatively  stable,  while
noninterest  expenses  increased  $44  million,  primarily  due  to  increases  in  corporate  overhead,  occupancy  expense,  operational  losses  and  salaries  and  benefits
expense, partially offset by a decrease in litigation-related expenses.

Average total loans increased $1.4 billion to $50.5 billion in 2022, compared to $49.1 billion in 2021, which included a $2.2 billion decline in PPP loans.
Organic  growth  through  the  expansion  of  new  and  existing  relationships  helped  drive  increases  in  most  business  lines,  including  a  $1.1  billion  increase  in
Corporate Banking, which generally serves customers with revenue over $500 million. Middle Market business lines, which generally serve customers with annual
revenue between $30 million and $500 million, increased by $2.2 billion, including a $749 million increase in general Middle Market and a $564 million increase
in Equity Fund Services.

Mortgage Banker Finance, which provides short-term, revolving lines of credit to mortgage banking companies, decreased by $1.3 billion, reflecting the

market-wide decline in home sales and refinancing activity resulting from lower average home sales volume and the higher interest rate environment.

Interest-Bearing Deposits with Banks and Other Short-Term Investments

Interest-bearing  deposits  with  banks,  which  are  mostly  used  to  manage  liquidity  requirements  of  the  Corporation,  primarily  include  deposits  with  the
Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) and also include deposits with banks in developed countries or international banking facilities of foreign banks located in the United
States. On a period-end basis, interest-bearing deposits with banks decreased $16.9 billion to $4.5 billion at December 31, 2022, declining from elevated levels
seen in 2021. On an average basis, interest-bearing deposits with banks decreased $9.4 billion to $9.4 billion in 2022.

Other short-term investments include federal funds sold, trading securities, money market investments and loans held-for-sale. Substantially all trading
securities are deferred compensation plan assets. Loans held-for-sale typically represent residential mortgage loans originated with management's intention to sell
and, from time to time, other loans that are transferred to held-for-sale. On a period-end basis, other short-term investments decreased $40 million to $157 million
at December 31, 2022. On an average basis, other short-term investments decreased $9 million to $174 million in 2022.

Deposits and Borrowed Funds

On a period-end basis, total deposits were $71.4 billion at December 31, 2022, a decrease of $10.9 billion compared to $82.3 billion at December 31,
2021,  reflecting  decreases  of  $5.9  billion,  or  13  percent,  in  noninterest-bearing  deposits  and  $5.1  billion,  or  14  percent,  in  interest-bearing  deposits.  The
Corporation's average deposits and borrowed funds balances are detailed in the following table.

Average deposits decreased $2.2 billion to $75.5 billion in 2022, compared to $77.7 billion in 2021, reflecting a $2.8 billion decrease in interest-bearing
deposits due to strategic deposit management and customers utilizing balances to fund business activities, partially offset by a $577 million increase in noninterest-
bearing deposits.

Uninsured deposits are defined as the portion of deposit accounts in U.S. offices that exceed the FDIC insurance limit and amounts in any other uninsured
investment or deposit account that are classified as deposits and are not subject to any federal or state deposit insurance regimes. Total uninsured deposits were
$45.5 billion and $56.7 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as calculated per regulatory guidance. The portion of domestic time deposits in excess
of insurance limits was $370 million and $554 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Time deposits otherwise uninsured, which consist of foreign
office time deposits, totaled $51 million at December 31, 2022 and all mature in three months or less.

On  a  period-end  basis,  short-term  borrowings  totaled  $3.2  billion  at  December  31,  2022  and  included  federal  funds  purchased  and  short-term  Federal
Home  Loan  Bank  (FHLB)  advances.  There  were  no  short-term  borrowings  at  December  31,  2021.  Average  short-term  borrowings  were  $436  million  in  2022,
compared to $2 million in 2021.

The Corporation uses medium- and long-term debt, which includes medium- and long-term senior notes as well as subordinated notes, to provide funding
for earning assets, liquidity and regulatory capital. On a period-end basis, total medium- and long-term debt at December 31, 2022 increased $228 million to $3.0
billion, compared to $2.8 billion at December 31, 2021. In the third quarter of 2022, the Bank issued $500 million of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due
in 2033. Average medium- and long-term debt decreased $217 million, or 7 percent, to $2.8 billion in 2022, compared to $3.0 billion in 2021.

Further information on medium- and long-term debt is provided in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.

Capital

Total shareholders' equity decreased $2.7 billion to $5.2 billion at December 31, 2022, compared to $7.9 billion at December 31, 2021, primarily due to a
$3.5  billion  decrease  in  unrealized  losses  in  the  Corporation's  investment  securities  portfolio  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  its  cash  flow  hedge  portfolio  and  defined
benefit plan. The following table presents a summary of changes in total shareholders' equity in 2022.

Corporation's repurchase program.

Since the inception of the share repurchase program in 2010, a total of 97.2 million shares have been authorized for repurchase. There is no expiration
date  for  the  share  repurchase  program.  The  Corporation  believes  that  share  repurchases  will  resume  in  2023,  although  the  timing  and  actual  amount  of  share
repurchases  are  subject  to  various  factors,  including  the  Corporation's  earnings  generation,  capital  needs  to  fund  future  loan  growth  and  the  macroeconomic
outlook.

The  Corporation  continues  to  target  a  Common  Equity  Tier  1  (CET1)  capital  ratio  of  approximately  10  percent  with  active  capital  management.  At

December 31, 2022, the Corporation's CET1 capital ratio was 10.00 percent, a decrease of 13 basis points compared to December 31, 2021.

The Corporation is subject to the capital adequacy standards under the Basel III regulatory framework (Basel III). This regulatory framework establishes
comprehensive methodologies for calculating regulatory capital and risk-weighted assets (RWA). Basel III also set minimum capital ratios as well as overall capital
adequacy standards.

Under Basel III, regulatory capital comprises CET1 capital, additional Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. CET1 capital predominantly includes common
shareholders'  equity,  less  certain  deductions  for  goodwill,  intangible  assets  and  deferred  tax  assets  that  arise  from  net  operating  losses  and  tax  credit  carry-
forwards. Additionally, the Corporation has elected to permanently exclude capital in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) related to debt and equity
securities classified as available-for-sale as well as for cash flow hedges and defined benefit postretirement plans from CET1, an option available to standardized
approach entities under Basel III. Tier 1 capital incrementally includes noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital includes Tier 1 capital as well as
subordinated debt qualifying as Tier 2 and qualifying allowance for credit losses.

Table of Contents

The  Corporation  computes  RWA  using  the  standardized  approach.  Under  the  standardized  approach,  RWA  is  generally  based  on  supervisory  risk-
weightings which vary by counterparty type and asset class. Under the Basel III standardized approach, capital is required for credit risk RWA, to cover the risk of
unexpected  losses  due  to  failure  of  a  customer  or  counterparty  to  meet  its  financial  obligations  in  accordance  with  contractual  terms;  and  if  trading  assets  and
liabilities exceed certain thresholds, capital is also required for market risk RWA, to cover the risk of losses due to adverse market movements or from position-
specific factors.

At December 31, 2022, the Corporation and its U.S. banking subsidiaries exceeded the capital ratios required for an institution to be considered “well
capitalized” by the standards developed under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991. Refer to Note 20 to the consolidated financial
statements  for  further  discussion  of  regulatory  capital  requirements,  capital  ratio  calculations  and  restrictions  on  the  ability  of  the  Corporation's  banking
subsidiaries to transfer assets to the Corporation.

The common shareholders' equity ratio decreased 233 basis points to 5.60 percent at December 31, 2022 primarily due to the change in unrealized losses
in  the  Corporation's  investment  securities  portfolio  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  its  cash  flow  hedge  portfolio  and  defined  benefit  plan.  The  unrealized  losses  in  the
Corporation's available-for-sale investment security portfolio are due to market valuations since the time of initial acquisition which, in substantially all cases, are
not expected to be realized. The tangible common equity ratio, which excludes goodwill and other intangible assets, decreased 241 basis points to 4.89 percent for
the same reasons. The impact of cumulative unrealized losses recorded within other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2022 to both ratios was approximately
440 basis points.

RISK MANAGEMENT

The Corporation assumes various types of risk as a result of conducting business in the normal course. The Corporation's enterprise risk management
framework  provides  a  process  for  identifying,  measuring,  controlling  and  managing  these  risks.  This  framework  incorporates  a  risk  assessment  process,  a
collection  of  risk  committees  that  manage  the  Corporation's  major  risk  elements  and  a  risk  appetite  statement  that  outlines  the  levels  and  types  of  risks  the
Corporation  accepts.  The  Corporation  continuously  enhances  its  enterprise  risk  framework  with  additional  processes,  tools  and  systems  designed  to  not  only
provide management with deeper insight into the various existing and emerging risks in accordance with its appetite for risk, but also to improve the Corporation's
ability to control those risks and ensure that appropriate consideration is received for the risks taken.

The Corporation’s front line employees, the first line of defense, are responsible for the day-to-day management and ownership of risks, including the
identification, assessment, measurement and control of risks encountered as a part of the normal course of business. Each of the major risk categories are further
monitored  and  measured  by  specialized  risk  managers  in  the  second  line  of  defense  within  the  Enterprise  Risk  Division,  who  provide  oversight  as  well  as
independent  and  effective  challenge  and  guidance  for  the  risk  management  activities  of  the  organization.  The  Enterprise  Risk  Division,  led  by  the  Chief  Risk
Officer,  is  responsible  for  designing  and  managing  the  Corporation’s  enterprise  risk  management  framework  and  ensures  effective  risk  management  oversight.
Risk management committees serve as a point of review and escalation for those risks

F-15

Table of Contents

which  may  have  risk  interdependencies  or  where  risk  levels  may  be  nearing  the  limits  outlined  in  the  Corporation’s  risk  appetite  statement.  These  committees
comprise senior and executive management that represent views from both the lines of business and risk management. Internal Audit, the third line of defense,
monitors and assesses the overall effectiveness of the risk management framework on an ongoing basis and provides an independent, objective assessment of the
Corporation’s ability to manage and control risk to management and the Audit Committee of the Board.

The  Enterprise  Risk  and  Return  Committee,  chaired  by  the  Chief  Risk  Officer,  is  established  by  the  Enterprise  Risk  Committee  of  the  Board  and
responsible for governance over the risk management framework, providing oversight in managing the Corporation's aggregate risk position and reporting on the
comprehensive portfolio of risks as well as the potential impact these risks can have on the Corporation's risk profile and resulting capital level. Capital provides
the primary buffer for risk and also serves as a measuring tool when evaluating risk. The Enterprise Risk and Return Committee is principally composed of senior
officers and executives representing the different risk areas and business units who are appointed by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation.

The  Board's  Enterprise  Risk  Committee  meets  quarterly  and  is  chartered  to  assist  the  Board  in  promoting  the  best  interests  of  the  Corporation  by
overseeing policies and risk practices relating to enterprise-wide risk and ensuring compliance with bank regulatory obligations. Members of the Enterprise Risk
Committee are selected such that the committee comprises individuals whose experiences and qualifications can lead to broad and informed views on risk matters
facing  the  Corporation  and  the  financial  services  industry.  These  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  existing  and  emerging  risk  matters  related  to  credit,  market,
liquidity, operational, technology, compliance and strategic conditions. A comprehensive risk report is submitted to the Enterprise Risk Committee each quarter
providing management's view of the Corporation's aggregate risk position.

Further  discussion  and  analyses  of  each  major  risk  area  are  included  in  the  following  sub-sections  of  the  Risk  Management  section  in  this  financial

review.

Credit Risk

Credit risk represents the risk of loss due to failure of a customer or counterparty to meet its financial obligations in accordance with contractual terms.
Credit risk is found in all activities where success depends on counterparty, issuer or borrower performance. It arises any time funds are extended, committed,
invested or otherwise exposed, whether reflected on or off the balance sheet. The governance structure is administered through the Strategic Credit Committee.
The Strategic Credit Committee is chaired by the Chief Credit Officer and approves recommendations to address credit risk matters through credit policy, credit
risk management practices and required credit risk actions. The Strategic Credit Committee also ensures a comprehensive reporting of credit risk levels and trends,
including exception levels, along with identification and mitigation of emerging risks. In order to facilitate the corporate credit risk management process, various
other corporate functions provide the resources for the Strategic Credit Committee to carry out its responsibilities. The Corporation manages credit risk through
underwriting  and  periodically  reviewing  and  approving  its  credit  exposures  in  accordance  with  established  credit  policies  and  guidelines.  Additionally,  the
Corporation manages credit risk through loan portfolio diversification, limiting exposure to any single industry, customer or guarantor, and selling participations
and/or syndicating credit exposures above those levels it deems prudent to third parties.

The Credit Division manages credit policy and provides the resources to manage the line of business transactional credit risk, assuring that all exposure is
risk  rated  according  to  the  requirements  of  the  credit  risk  rating  policy  and  providing  business  segment  reporting  support  as  necessary.  The  Enterprise  Risk
Division provides credible and well-documented challenge of overall portfolio credit risk, and other credit-related attributes of the Corporation's loan portfolios,
with a particular emphasis on all attendant modeled results. The Corporation's Asset Quality Review function, a division of Internal Audit, audits the accuracy of
internal risk ratings that are assigned by the lending and credit groups. The Special Assets Group is responsible for managing the recovery process on distressed or
defaulted loans and loan sales.

Credit  Analytics  and  Strategy,  within  the  Credit  Division,  provides  comprehensive  reporting  on  portfolio  credit  risk  levels  and  trends,  continuous
assessment  and  verification  of  risk  rating  models,  quarterly  calculation  of  the  allowance  for  loan  losses  and  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  on  lending-related
commitments and calculations of both expected and unexpected loss.

Allowance for Credit Losses

The allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments.

The  allowance  for  credit  losses  increased  by  $43  million  from  $618  million  at  December  31,  2021  to  $661  million  at  December  31,  2022,  primarily
reflecting  loan  growth  and  continued  strong  credit  metrics  as  well  as  a  modest  deterioration  in  economic  forecasts.  Excess  savings  and  pent-up  demand  from
consumers, as well as tight labor markets, have supported the U.S. economy. However, there are headwinds from recessionary pressures, surging inflation, higher
interest  rates  and  the  slowing  housing  market.  Foreign  developments  pose  additional  headwinds,  including  the  impacts  of  the  Russia-Ukraine  conflict,
uncertainties about China’s reopening and the impact of tighter monetary policy across much of the global economy.

These  factors  shaped  the  2-year  reasonable  and  supportable  forecast  used  by  the  Corporation  in  its  CECL  estimate  at  December  31,  2022.  The  U.S.
economy is expected to contract marginally in the first half of 2023 before gradually normalizing to its trend growth rates. Certain economic variables, like oil
prices, are expected to decrease as inflation normalizes. Forecasts for other key economic variables are generally consistent with those of Gross Domestic Product
(GDP), while interest rate forecasts reflect market expectations and recent guidance from the Federal Reserve. The following table summarizes select economic
variables representative of the economic forecasts used to develop the allowance for credit losses estimate at December 31, 2022.

Contracts  slightly  in  first  and  second  quarters  2023,  consistent  with  a  mild  recession,
before recovering to a trend growth rate of around 2 percent by the end of the forecast
period.
Increases to 4.7 percent by first quarter 2024 and remaining at that level through fourth
quarter 2024.
Spreads widen to 2.8 percent in first quarter 2023 before normalizing to 2.1 percent by
the end of the forecast period.
Prices gradually decline from current levels to $76 dollars by fourth quarter 2024.

Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding recessionary pressures, surging inflation and higher interest rates, management considered other economic

scenarios to make appropriate qualitative adjustments for certain sectors of its lending portfolio, including more benign and more severe forecasts.

Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses.

Allowance for Loan Losses

The allowance for loan losses represents management’s estimates of current expected credit losses in the Corporation’s loan portfolio. Pools of loans with
similar risk characteristics are collectively evaluated, while loans that no longer share risk characteristics with loan pools are evaluated individually. The allowance
for loan losses increased $22 million to $610 million at December 31, 2022, compared to $588 million at December 31, 2021.

Collective loss estimates are determined by applying reserve factors, designed to estimate current expected credit losses, to amortized cost balances over
the remaining contractual life of the collectively evaluated portfolio. Loans with similar risk characteristics are aggregated into homogeneous pools. The allowance
for  loan  losses  also  includes  qualitative  adjustments  to  bring  the  allowance  to  the  level  management  believes  is  appropriate  based  on  factors  that  have  not
otherwise been fully accounted for, including adjustments for foresight risk, input imprecisions and model imprecision. Credit losses for loans that no longer share
risk  characteristics  with  the  loan  pools  are  estimated  on  an  individual  basis.  Individual  credit  loss  estimates  are  typically  performed  for  nonaccrual  loans  and
modified loans classified as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) and are based on one of several methods, including the estimated fair value of the underlying
collateral, observable market value of similar debt or the present value of expected cash flows.    

Allowance for Credit Losses on Lending-Related Commitments

The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments estimates current expected credit losses on collective pools of letters of credit and unused

commitments to extend credit based on reserve factors, determined in a manner similar to

F-17

Table of Contents

business loans, multiplied by a probability of draw estimate based on historical experience and credit risk, applied to commitment amounts. The allowance for
credit losses on lending-related commitments totaled $51 million and $30 million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

Nonperforming Assets

Nonperforming  assets  include  loans  on  nonaccrual  status,  TDRs  which  have  been  renegotiated  to  less  than  the  original  contractual  rates  (reduced-rate
loans)  and  foreclosed  assets.  TDRs  include  performing  and  nonperforming  loans,  with  nonperforming  TDRs  on  either  nonaccrual  or  reduced-rate  status.  In
accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Coronavirus  Aid,  Relief,  and  Economic  Security  Act  (CARES  Act),  the  Corporation  elected  not  to  consider  qualifying
COVID-19-related modifications, primarily deferrals, as TDRs and did not designate such loans as past due or nonaccrual. The temporary relief

nonperforming assets primarily reflected a decrease of $45 million in nonaccrual business loans, partially offset by an increase of $21 million in nonaccrual retail
loans,  as  temporary  legislative  relief  for  COVID-19-related  deferrals  ended  on  December  31,  2021.  Nonperforming  loans  were  0.46  percent  of  total  loans  at

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Concentrations of credit risk may exist when a number of borrowers are engaged in similar activities, or activities in the same geographic region, and
have  similar  economic  characteristics  that  would  cause  them  to  be  similarly  impacted  by  changes  in  economic  or  other  conditions.  The  Corporation  has
concentrations of credit risk with the commercial real estate and automotive industries. All other industry concentrations, as defined by management, individually
represented less than 10 percent of total loans at December 31, 2022.

The  Corporation  limits  risk  inherent  in  its  commercial  real  estate  lending  activities  by  monitoring  borrowers  directly  involved  in  the  commercial  real
estate markets and adhering to conservative policies on loan-to-value ratios for such loans. Commercial real estate loans, consisting of real estate construction and
commercial mortgage loans, totaled $16.4 billion at December 31, 2022. Of the total, $7.2 billion, or 44 percent, were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate
business line, which includes loans to real estate developers, an increase of $1.5 billion compared to December 31, 2021. Commercial real estate loans in other
business  lines  totaled  $9.2  billion,  or  56  percent,  at  December  31,  2022,  an  increase  of  $751  million  compared  to  December  31,  2021.  These  loans  consisted
primarily  of  owner-occupied  commercial  mortgages,  which  bear  credit  characteristics  similar  to  non-commercial  real  estate  business  loans.  Generally,  loans
previously reported as real estate construction are classified as commercial mortgage loans upon receipt of a certificate of occupancy.

The real estate construction loan portfolio primarily contains loans made to long-tenured customers with satisfactory completion experience. There were
no criticized real estate construction loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. In other business lines, criticized real
estate construction loans totaled $3 million at December 31, 2022, compared to $35 million at December 31, 2021. There were no real estate construction loan net
charge-offs in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Commercial mortgage loans are loans where the primary collateral is a lien on any real property and are primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real
estate. Real property is generally considered primary collateral if the value of that collateral represents more than 50 percent of the commitment at loan approval.
Loans  in  the  commercial  mortgage  portfolio  generally  mature  within  three  to  five  years.  Criticized  commercial  mortgage  loans  in  the  Commercial  Real  Estate
business  line  totaled  $16  million  and  $29  million  at  December  31,  2022  and  2021,  respectively.  In  other  business  lines,  $151  million  and  $219  million  of
commercial  mortgage  loans  were  criticized  at  December  31,  2022  and  2021,  respectively.  There  were  no  commercial  mortgage  loan  net  charge-offs  in  2022,
compared to net charge-offs of $2 million in 2021.

Substantially all dealer loans are in the National Dealer Services business line and primarily include floor plan financing and other loans to automotive
dealerships. Floor plan loans, included in commercial loans in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, totaled $1.4 billion at December 31, 2022, an increase of $698
million compared to $681 million at December 31, 2021, although an imbalance in supply and demand impacted by a shortage in microchips used in automotive
production continues to depress floor plan loan balances below pre-pandemic levels. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, other loans in the National Dealer Services
business line totaled $4.0 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively, including $2.3 billion and $2.0 billion of owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans,
respectively.

There were no nonaccrual dealer loans at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. Additionally, there were no net charge-offs of dealer loans in either of the

years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Loans to borrowers involved with automotive production, primarily Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers, totaled $1.1 billion at both December 31, 2022 and 2021.
These borrowers have faced, and could face in the future, financial difficulties due to disruptions in auto production as well as their supply chains and logistics
operations. As such, management continues to monitor this portfolio.

There were $5 million in nonaccrual loans to borrowers involved with automotive production at December 31, 2022, compared to none at December 31,

2021. Automotive production loan net charge-offs totaled $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $7 million for the same period in 2021.

Residential  real  estate  loans,  which  consist  of  traditional  residential  mortgages  and  home  equity  loans  and  lines  of  credit,  totaled  $3.6  billion  at
December 31, 2022. The residential real estate portfolio is principally located within the Corporation's primary geographic markets. Substantially all residential
real estate loans past due 90 days or more are placed on nonaccrual status, and substantially all junior lien home equity loans that are current or less than 90 days
past due are placed on nonaccrual status if full collection of the senior position is in doubt. At no later than 180 days past due, such loans are charged off to current
appraised values less costs to sell.

Residential mortgages totaled $1.8 billion at December 31, 2022, and were primarily larger, variable-rate mortgages originated and retained for certain
private banking relationship customers. Of the $1.8 billion of residential mortgage loans outstanding, $53 million were on nonaccrual status at December 31, 2022.
The home equity portfolio totaled $1.8 billion at December 31, 2022, of which 97 percent was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity
lines of credit, 2 percent were in amortizing status and 1 percent were closed-end home equity loans. Of the $1.8 billion of home equity loans outstanding, $15
million were on nonaccrual status at December 31, 2022. A majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens at December 31, 2022.

Energy Lending

The  Corporation  has  a  portfolio  of  Energy  loans  that  are  included  entirely  in  commercial  loans  in  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  Customers  in  the
Corporation's Energy business line (approximately 120 relationships) are engaged in three segments of the oil and gas business: exploration and production (E&P),
midstream and energy services. E&P generally includes such activities as searching for potential oil and gas fields, drilling exploratory wells and operating active
wells.  Commitments  to  E&P  borrowers  are  generally  subject  to  semi-annual  borrowing  base  re-determinations  based  on  a  variety  of  factors  including  updated
prices (reflecting market and competitive conditions), energy reserve levels and the impact of

hedging. The midstream sector is generally involved in the transportation, storage and marketing of crude and/or refined oil and gas products. The Corporation's
energy services customers provide products and services primarily to the E&P segment.

Loans  in  the  Energy  business  line  totaled  $1.4  billion,  or  3  percent  of  total  loans,  at  December  31,  2022,  an  increase  of  $211  million  compared  to
December 31, 2021. Total exposure, including unused commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, was $3.4 billion (a utilization rate of 43 percent) and $2.9
billion at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

Net  credit-related  Energy  charge-offs  were  $3  million  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022,  compared  to  net  recoveries  of  $48  million  for  the  year
ended December 31, 2021. Nonaccrual Energy loans decreased by $7 million to $7 million at December 31, 2022, compared to $14 million at December 31, 2021.
Criticized loans decreased $46 million to $12 million, or 1 percent of total criticized loans, at December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021.

Leveraged Loans

Certain loans in the Corporation's commercial portfolio are considered leveraged transactions. These loans are typically used for mergers, acquisitions,
business  recapitalizations,  refinancing  and  equity  buyouts.  To  help  mitigate  the  risk  associated  with  these  loans,  the  Corporation  focuses  on  middle  market
companies with highly capable management teams, strong sponsors and solid track records of financial performance. Industries prone to cyclical downturns and
acquisitions  with  a  high  degree  of  integration  risk  are  generally  avoided.  Other  considerations  include  the  sufficiency  of  collateral,  the  level  of  balance  sheet
leverage  and  the  adequacy  of  financial  covenants.  During  the  underwriting  process,  cash  flows  are  stress-tested  to  evaluate  the  borrowers'  abilities  to  handle
economic downturns and an increase in interest rates.

The FDIC defines higher-risk commercial and industrial (HR C&I) loans for assessment purposes as loans generally with leverage of four times total debt

to earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation (EBITDA) as well as three times senior debt to EBITDA, excluding certain collateralized loans.

The  following  table  summarizes  information  about  HR  C&I  loans,  which  represented  6  percent  of  total  loans  at  both  December  31,  2022  and

Market and Liquidity Risk

Market risk represents the risk of loss due to adverse movement in prices, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and equity
prices. Liquidity risk represents the risk that the Corporation does not have sufficient access to funds to maintain its normal operations at all times, or does not
have the ability to raise or borrow funds at a reasonable cost at all times.

The Asset and Liability Policy Committee (ALCO) of the Corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to
market and liquidity risk management activities. ALCO meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies and consists of
executive and senior management from various areas of the Corporation, including treasury, finance, economics, lending, deposit gathering and risk management.
Corporate Treasury mitigates market and liquidity risk under the direction of ALCO through the actions it takes to manage the Corporation's market, liquidity and
capital positions.

The  Corporation  performs  monthly  liquidity  stress  testing  to  evaluate  its  ability  to  meet  funding  needs  in  hypothetical  stressed  environments.  Such
environments cover a series of scenarios, including both idiosyncratic and market-wide in nature, which vary in terms of duration and severity. The evaluation as
of December 31, 2022 projected that sufficient sources of liquidity were available under each series of events.

In  addition  to  assessing  liquidity  risk  on  a  consolidated  basis,  Corporate  Treasury  also  monitors  the  parent  company's  liquidity  and  has  established
liquidity coverage requirements for meeting expected obligations without the support of additional dividends from subsidiaries. ALCO's policy on liquidity risk
management  requires  the  parent  company  to  maintain  sufficient  liquidity  to  meet  expected  cash  obligations  over  a  period  of  no  less  than  12  months.  The
Corporation had liquid assets of $1.8 billion on an unconsolidated basis at December 31, 2022.

Corporate Treasury and the Enterprise Risk Division support ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market
risks. Key activities encompass: (i) providing information and analyses of the Corporation's balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate and all other
market  risks;  (ii)  monitoring  and  reporting  of  the  Corporation's  positions  relative  to  established  policy  limits  and  guidelines;  (iii)  developing  and  presenting
analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions; (iv) reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval; and (v) monitoring of industry trends and
analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market and liquidity risks.

Interest Rate Risk

Net interest income is the primary source of revenue for the Corporation. Interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the
repricing  and  cash  flow  characteristics  of  assets  and  liabilities,  primarily  through  the  Corporation's  core  business  activities  of  extending  loans  and  acquiring
deposits. The Corporation's balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating-rate loans funded by core deposits. Including the impact of interest rate swaps
converting  floating-rate  loans  to  fixed,  the  Corporation's  loan  composition  at  December  31,  2022  was  50  percent  fixed-rate,  39  percent  30-day  rate  (primarily
BSBY,  LIBOR  and  SOFR),  6  percent  90-day  and  greater  rate  and  5  percent  prime.  The  composition  of  the  loan  portfolio  creates  sensitivity  to  interest  rate
movements due to the imbalance between the faster repricing of the floating-rate loan portfolio versus deposit products. In addition, the growth and/or contraction
in the Corporation's loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions. Examples of such actions
are  purchasing  fixed-rate  investment  securities,  which  provide  liquidity  to  the  balance  sheet  and  act  to  mitigate  the  inherent  interest  rate  sensitivity,  as  well  as
hedging with interest rate swaps and options. Other mitigating factors include interest rate floors on a portion of the loan portfolio.

The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value

of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.

Since  no  single  measurement  system  satisfies  all  management  objectives,  a  combination  of  techniques  is  used  to  manage  interest  rate  risk.  These
techniques  examine  the  impact  of  interest  rate  risk  on  net  interest  income  and  the  economic  value  of  equity  under  a  variety  of  alternative  scenarios,  including
changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve utilizing multiple simulation analyses. Simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income as
the  assumptions  used  are  inherently  uncertain.  Actual  results  may  differ  from  simulated  results  due  to  many  factors,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  the  timing,
magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions, regulatory impacts and management strategies.

Sensitivity of Net Interest Income to Changes in Interest Rates

The  analysis  of  the  impact  of  changes  in  interest  rates  on  net  interest  income  under  various  interest  rate  scenarios  is  management's  principal  risk
management  technique.  Management  models  a  base-case  net  interest  income  under  an  unchanged  interest  rate  environment  using  a  static  balance  sheet  and
generates sensitivity scenarios by changing certain model

F-24

Table of Contents

assumptions. Each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth, investment security prepayment levels, depositor behavior and overall balance sheet mix
and growth which are in line with historical patterns. Changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a
balance  sheet  structure  that  is  different  from  the  changes  management  included  in  its  simulation  analysis.  Model  assumptions  in  the  sensitivity  scenarios  at
December 31, 2022 included for the rising rate scenario, a modest increase in loan balances and a moderate decrease in deposit balances, and for the declining rate
scenario, a modest decrease in loan balances and a moderate increase in deposit balances. In addition, both scenarios assumed loan spreads held at current levels,
an incremental interest-bearing deposit beta of approximately 30%, no reinvestment of securities portfolio cash flows and no additions to interest rate swaps.

The average balance of the securities portfolio included in the analysis was $19.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 with an average yield of

1.97% and effective duration of 5.3 years.

Includes forward starting swaps of $2.6 billion starting in 2023 and $2.0 billion starting in 2024. Excluding forward starting swaps, the weighted average yield was 2.35%.

The  analysis  also  includes  interest  rate  swaps  that  convert  $3.2  billion  of  fixed-rate  medium-  and  long-term  debt  to  variable  rates  through  fair  value
hedges. Additionally, included in this analysis are $14.7 billion of loans that were subject to an average interest rate floor of 52 basis points at December 31, 2022.
This base-case net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which short-term rates rise or decline 100 basis points (with a floor of zero
percent) in a linear, parallel fashion from the base case over 12 months, resulting in an average change of 50 basis points over the period.

The table below, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the base

case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above.

Overall  sensitivity  to  interest  rate  movements  declined  from  December  31,  2021  to  December  31,  2022  resulting  from  an  increase  in  fixed-rate  loans
(including the impact of interest rate swaps) from 22 percent of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2021 to 50 percent at December 31, 2022, as well as from a
decrease in non-maturity deposits. The impact on a dollar basis to declining interest rates increased primarily due to an increase in the federal funds rate, allowing
for a full 100 basis point repricing of the balance sheet in the 2022 scenario, compared to 25 basis points in the 2021 scenario, as well as an increase in modeled
base case net interest income. Sensitivity to rising interest rates decreased due to increased cash flow hedges and non-maturity deposit runoff but was partially
offset by the increased repricing potential of floating-rate loans as they moved above their contractual floor rates.

Sensitivity of Economic Value of Equity to Changes in Interest Rates

In addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income, an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk
position. The economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the Corporation's financial assets, liabilities and off-balance
sheet  instruments,  derived  through  discounting  cash  flows  based  on  actual  rates  at  the  end  of  the  period,  and  the  estimated  economic  value  after  applying  the
estimated impact of rate movements. The Corporation primarily monitors the percentage change on the base-case economic value of equity. The economic value of
equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel 100 basis point shock with a floor of zero percent.

The table below, as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate

scenario described above.

The sensitivity of the economic value of equity to rising rates changed from an increase as of December 31, 2021 to a reduction as of December 31, 2022
due to additional receive-fixed cash flow swaps, growth of fixed-rate securities and deposit runoff. Sensitivity to declining rates now increases economic value of
equity due to the same factors.

The Corporation uses investment securities and derivative instruments as asset and liability management tools with the overall objective of managing the

volatility of net interest income from changes in interest rates. These tools assist management in achieving the desired interest rate risk management objectives.
Activity related to derivative instruments currently involves interest rate swaps effectively converting fixed-rate medium- and long-term debt to a floating rate as
well as variable rate loans to a fixed rate.

Includes $4.6 billion of forward starting receive fixed interest rate swaps that will become effective on their contractual start dates in 2023 and 2024.

The notional amount of risk management interest rate swaps totaled $29.8 billion at December 31, 2022, which included cash flow hedging strategies that
convert $26.6 billion of variable-rate loans to a fixed rate as well as fair value hedging strategies that convert $3.2 billion of fixed-rate medium- and long-term debt
to a floating rate. Risk management interest rate swaps generated no net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $163 million of net
interest income generated for the year ended December 31, 2021.

In addition to interest rate swaps, the Corporation employs various other types of derivative instruments as offsetting positions to mitigate exposures to
foreign currency risks associated with specific assets and liabilities (e.g., customer loans or deposits denominated in foreign currencies). Such instruments may
include foreign exchange spot and forward contracts as well as foreign exchange swap agreements.

Further information regarding risk management derivative instruments is provided in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.

The Corporation sells and purchases interest rate caps and floors and enters into foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and energy derivative
contracts to accommodate the needs of customers requesting such services. Changes in the fair value of customer-initiated and other derivatives are recognized in
earnings  as  they  occur.  To  limit  the  market  risk  of  these  activities,  the  Corporation  generally  takes  offsetting  positions  with  dealers.  The  notional  amounts  of
offsetting  positions  are  included  in  the  table  above.  Customer-initiated  and  other  notional  activity  represented  55  percent  and  73  percent  of  total  interest  rate,
energy and foreign exchange contracts at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Further information regarding customer-initiated and other derivative instruments is provided in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.

LIBOR Transition

On  July  27,  2017,  the  United  Kingdom’s  Financial  Conduct  Authority  (FCA),  which  regulates  LIBOR,  publicly  announced  that  it  intends  to  stop
persuading  or  compelling  banks  to  submit  LIBOR  rates  after  2021.  Effective  March  2021,  the  FCA  confirmed  that  certain  LIBOR  tenors  will  no  longer  be
supported after December 31, 2021 and that the remaining tenors, including those most commonly used by the Corporation, will cease to be supported after June
30,  2023.  The  Corporation  has  substantial  exposure  to  LIBOR-based  products,  including  loans  and  derivatives,  and  is  preparing  for  a  transition  from  LIBOR
toward alternative rates.

The Corporation ceased originating LIBOR-based products in the fourth quarter of 2021 and has since reduced total LIBOR exposure by approximately

50 percent to $31.5 billion. Substantially all of the Corporation’s LIBOR exposure is

F-27

 
 
 
 
 
 
Table of Contents

comprised of loans, swaps and options. Of the remaining LIBOR-based products, 82 percent required no further remediation because the instruments mature prior
to cessation or include fallback language.

As  of  December  31,  2022,  there  was  approximately  $16.0 billion  of  LIBOR-based  loans,  compared  to  $40.3  billion  at  December  31,  2021.  Of  these,
approximately 18 percent have maturity dates prior to cessation, 46 percent mature after cessation but have fallback language and the remaining 36 percent are in
process of remediation. The Corporation is confident it will complete its remediation efforts in a timely manner.

In  addition  to  remediation  activity  on  LIBOR-based  loans,  the  Corporation  has  enacted  the  International  Swaps  and  Derivatives  Association  (ISDA)
protocols which relates to $15.5 billion of derivatives. Once events occur that trigger a fallback, the reference rate for the variable leg of the swap will fall back
from LIBOR to the ISDA Fallback Rate, which is the daily SOFR plus a spread.

The Corporation's enterprise transition timelines are closely aligned with recommendations from the Alternative Reference Rates Committee for both best
practices and recommended objectives. The Corporation will continue to align with industry and regulatory guidelines regarding the cessation of LIBOR as well as
monitor market developments for transitioning to alternative reference rates. For a discussion of the various risks facing the Corporation in relation to the transition
away from LIBOR, see the market risk discussion within “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

Sources of Liquidity

The  Corporation  maintains  a  liquidity  position  that  it  believes  will  adequately  satisfy  its  financial  obligations  while  taking  into  account  potential
commitment draws and deposit run-off that may occur in the normal course of business. The majority of the Corporation's balance sheet is funded by customer
deposits.  Cash  flows  from  loan  repayments,  increases  in  deposit  accounts,  activity  in  the  securities  portfolio  and  the  purchased  funds  market  serve  as  the
Corporation's primary liquidity sources.

The Corporation satisfies incremental liquidity needs with either liquid assets or external funding sources. The Corporation had access to liquid assets of
$20.0  billion  and  $35.3  billion  at  December  31,  2022  and  December  31,  2021,  respectively,  which  included  cash  on  deposit  with  the  Federal  Reserve  and  the
portion of the investment securities portfolio that the Corporation can sell without third-party consent.

In  addition,  the  Corporation  may  access  external  funding  sources  when  necessary,  which  include  FHLB  advances,  federal  funds,  reverse  repurchase
agreements,  brokered  deposits  and  Corporation-issued  bonds.  The  Corporation  maintains  a  shelf  registration  statement  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange
Commission from which it may issue debt and equity securities.

Purchased  funds  increased  to  $3.4  billion  at  December  31,  2022,  compared  to  $50  million  at  December  31,  2021,  reflecting  an  increase  in  short-term
FHLB  advances.  At  December  31,  2022,  the  Bank  had  pledged  loans  totaling  $24.5  billion  which  provided  for  up  to  $19.6  billion  of  available  collateralized
borrowing with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB). The Bank is also a member of the FHLB of Dallas, Texas, which provides short- and long-term funding to its
members  through  advances  collateralized  by  real  estate-related  loans,  certain  government  agency-backed  securities  and  other  eligible  assets.  Actual  borrowing
capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral pledged to the FHLB. At December 31, 2022, $9.5 billion of real estate-related loans were pledged to the FHLB
as collateral for $3.2 billion in short-term advances and providing an additional $7.2 billion for potential future borrowings.

The ability of the Corporation and the Bank to raise funds at competitive rates is impacted by rating agencies' views of the credit quality, liquidity, capital,
earnings and other relevant factors related to the Corporation and the Bank. As of December 31, 2022, the three major rating agencies had assigned the following
ratings to long-term senior unsecured obligations of the Corporation and the Bank. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and
may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

Since many of these commitments expire without being fully drawn, and each customer must continue to meet the conditions established in the contract,
the  total  amount  of  these  commercial  commitments  does  not  necessarily  represent  the  future  cash  requirements  of  the  Corporation.  Refer  to  Note  8  to  the
consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of these commercial commitments.

Other Market Risks

Market risk related to the Corporation's trading instruments is not significant, as trading activities are limited. Certain components of the Corporation's
noninterest income, primarily fiduciary income, are at risk to fluctuations in the market values of underlying assets, particularly equity and debt securities. Other
components of noninterest income, primarily brokerage fees, are at risk to changes in the volume of market activity.

Operational Risk

Operational risk represents the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes and people, or from external events, excluding in most
cases  those  driven  by  technology  (see  Technology  Risk  below).  The  Corporation's  definition  of  operational  risk  includes  fraud;  employment  practice  and
workplace safety; clients, products and business practice; business continuity or disaster recovery; execution, delivery, and process management; third party and
model risks. The definition does not include strategic or reputational risks. Although operational losses are experienced by all companies and are routinely incurred
in business operations, the Corporation recognizes the need to identify and control operational losses and seeks to limit losses to a level deemed appropriate by
management,  as  outlined  in  the  Corporation’s  risk  appetite  statement.  The  appropriate  risk  level  is  determined  through  consideration  of  the  nature  of  the
Corporation's  business  and  the  environment  in  which  it  operates,  in  combination  with  the  impact  from,  and  the  possible  impact  on,  other  risks  faced  by  the
Corporation. Operational risk is mitigated through a system of internal controls that are designed to keep operating risks at appropriate levels. The Operational
Risk  Management  Committee  monitors  risk  management  techniques  and  systems.  The  Corporation  has  developed  a  framework  that  includes  a  centralized
operational risk reporting function in the Enterprise Risk Division and business/support unit risk liaisons responsible for managing operational risk specific to the
respective business lines.

F-29

 
Table of Contents

Technology Risk

Technology  risk  represents  the  risk  of  loss  or  adverse  outcomes  arising  from  the  people,  processes,  applications  and  infrastructure  that  support  the
technology  environment.  The  Corporation's  definition  of  technology  risk  includes  technology  delivery  risk,  technology  investment  risk,  cybersecurity  risk,
information security risk and information management risk. Technology risk is inclusive of the risks associated with the execution of technology processes and
activities by third-party contractors and suppliers to the Corporation. Other risk types may materialize in the event of a technology risk event, such as the risk of a
financial reporting error or regulatory non-compliance, and the impact of such risks are highly interdependent with operational risk.

The Technology Risk Committee, comprising senior and executive business unit managers, as well as managers responsible for technology, cybersecurity,
information  security  and  enterprise  risk  management,  oversees  technology  risk.  The  Technology  Risk  Committee  also  ensures  that  appropriate  actions  are
implemented in business units to mitigate risk to an acceptable level.

Compliance Risk

Compliance risk represents the risk of sanctions or financial loss resulting from the Corporation's failure to comply with all applicable laws, regulations
and standards of good banking practice. The impact of such risks is highly interdependent with strategic risk, as the reputational impact from compliance breaches
can  be  severe.  Activities  which  may  expose  the  Corporation  to  compliance  risk  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  those  dealing  with  the  prevention  of  money
laundering,  privacy  and  data  protection,  community  reinvestment  initiatives,  fair  lending,  consumer  protection,  employment  and  tax  matters,  over-the-counter
derivative activities and other regulated activities.

The Enterprise-Wide Compliance Committee, comprising senior and executive business unit managers, as well as managers responsible for compliance,
audit and overall risk, oversees compliance risk. This enterprise-wide approach provides a consistent view of compliance across the organization. The Enterprise-
Wide Compliance Committee also ensures that appropriate actions are implemented in business units to mitigate risk to an acceptable level.

Strategic Risk

Strategic risk represents the risk of inadequate returns or possible losses due to impairment of reputation, failure to fully develop and execute business
plans, failure to assess current and new opportunities in business, markets and products, failure to determine appropriate consideration for risks accepted, and any
other event not identified in the defined risk categories of credit, market and liquidity, operational, technology or compliance risks. Mitigation of the various risk
elements that represent strategic risk is achieved through numerous metrics and initiatives to help the Corporation better understand, measure and report on such
risks.  The  Executive  Strategy  and  Pricing  Committee,  comprised  of  senior  managers,  oversees  strategic  risk  and  ensures  that  strategic  risk  is  mitigated  to
appropriate levels.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The  Corporation’s  consolidated  financial  statements  are  prepared  based  on  the  application  of  accounting  policies,  the  most  significant  of  which  are
described  in  Note  1.  These  policies  require  numerous  estimates  and  strategic  or  economic  assumptions,  which  may  prove  inaccurate  or  subject  to  variations.
Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporation’s future financial condition and results of operations. At
December 31, 2022, the most critical of these estimates related to the allowance for credit losses, fair value measurement, pension plan accounting and income
taxes. These estimates were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporation’s Board of Directors and are discussed more fully below.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

In  accordance  with  CECL,  the  allowance  for  credit  losses,  which  includes  both  the  allowance  for  loan  losses  and  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  on
lending-related commitments, is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve for current expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life of the
portfolio. The Corporation uses loss factors, based on estimated probability of default for internal risk ratings and loss given default, to determine the allowance for
credit losses for the majority of its portfolio. Management applies loss factors to pools of loans and lending-related commitments with similar risk characteristics,
calibrates these factors using economic forecasts and incorporates qualitative adjustments. For further discussion of the methodology used in the determination of
the allowance for credit losses, refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. For further discussion on the economic forecast incorporated into the 2022
model, refer to the “Risk Management” section of this financial review.

Management's determination of the appropriateness of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio, lending-related commitments,
current  as  well  as  forecasted  economic  factors  and  other  relevant  information.  The  calculation  is  inherently  subjective  and  requires  management  to  exercise
significant judgment in developing assumptions for the estimate, the most significant of which are the loan risk rating process, development of economic forecasts
and application of qualitative adjustments. Sensitivities are disclosed to demonstrate how changes in loan risk ratings and economic forecast scenarios may impact
the allowance for credit losses. Sensitivities only consider changes to each specific assumption in isolation and their impact to the quantitative modeled results.
They do not contemplate impacts to the qualitative framework.

Loan Risk Rating Process

Reserve factors are applied to pools of loans based on risk characteristics, including the Corporation's internal risk rating system; therefore, loss estimates
are  highly  dependent  on  the  accuracy  of  the  risk  rating  assigned  to  each  loan.  The  inherent  imprecision  in  the  risk  rating  system  resulting  from  inaccuracy  in
assigning  and/or  entering  risk  ratings  in  the  loan  accounting  system  is  monitored  by  the  Corporation's  asset  quality  review  function.  Changes  to  internal  risk
ratings, beyond the forecasted migration inherent in the credit models, would result in a different estimated allowance for credit losses. To illustrate, if 5 percent of
the  individual  risk  ratings  were  adjusted  down  by  one  rating  across  all  pools,  the  allowance  for  loan  losses  as  of  December  31,  2022  would  change  by
approximately $3 million.

Forecasted Economic Variables

Management selects models through which historical reserve factor estimates are calibrated to economic forecasts over the reasonable and supportable
forecast period based on the projected performance of specific economic variables that statistically correlate with the probability of default and loss given default
pools. Loss estimates revert to historical loss experience for contractual lives beyond the forecast period. Management selects economic variables it believes to be
most relevant based on the composition of the loan portfolio and customer base, including forecasted levels of employment, gross domestic product, corporate
bond and treasury spreads, industrial production levels, consumer and commercial real estate price indices as well as housing statistics.

The allowance for credit losses is highly sensitive to the economic forecasts used to develop the estimate. Due to the high level of uncertainty regarding
significant assumptions, the Corporation evaluated a range of economic scenarios, including a more severe economic forecast scenario, with varying responses to
current economic risks. The following table summarizes the more severe forecast scenario for the economic variables that are most impactful.

More Severe Forecast
Contracts through first quarter 2024, peaking at a decline of 6.6 percent annualized in
second quarter 2023, subsequently improving to a 2 percent annual growth rate by the
end of the forecast period.
Increases to almost 9 percent by fourth quarter 2024.
Spreads widen to a peak of over 5.5 percent before gradually narrowing to 2.5 percent
by the end of the forecast period.
Decline  to  $39  per  barrel  by  mid-2024  before  improving  to  $46  per  barrel  by  fourth
quarter 2024.

Selecting a different forecast in the current environment could result in a significantly different estimated allowance for credit losses. To illustrate, absent
model overlays and other qualitative adjustments that are part of the quarterly reserving process, if the Corporation selected the more severe scenario to inform its
models,  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  as  of  December  31,  2022  would  increase  by  approximately  $308  million.  However,  factoring  in  model  overlays  and
qualitative adjustments could result in a materially different estimate under a more severe scenario.

Qualitative Adjustments and Model Overlays

The Corporation includes qualitative adjustments, as appropriate, intended to capture the impact of uncertainties not reflected in the quantitative estimate,
including  foresight  risk,  model  imprecisions  and  input  imprecisions.  Qualitative  adjustments  for  foresight  risk  reflect  the  inherent  imprecision  in  economic
forecasts and may be included based on management’s evaluation of different forecast scenarios, ranging from more benign to more severe, and known recent
events impacting the Corporation’s portfolio. Model imprecision adjustments and model overlays may be included to mitigate known limitations in the quantitative
models. Input imprecision includes adjustments for portfolios where recent historical losses exceed expected losses or known recent events are expected to alter
risk ratings once evidence is acquired, as well as a qualitative assessment of the lending environment, including underwriting standards, current economic and
political conditions, and other factors affecting credit quality. Qualitative reserves at December 31, 2022 primarily included adjustments for uncertainties related to
forecasted economic variables.

Other Considerations

To  the  extent  actual  outcomes  differ  from  management  estimates,  additional  provision  for  credit  losses  may  be  required  that  would  adversely  impact
earnings in future periods. The allowance is assigned to business segments, and any earnings impact resulting from actual outcomes differing from management
estimates would primarily affect the Commercial Bank segment.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

Investment  securities  available-for-sale,  derivatives  and  deferred  compensation  plan  assets  and  associated  liabilities  are  recorded  at  fair  value  on  a
recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, other assets and liabilities may be recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, such as impaired loans that have
been measured based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, other real estate (primarily foreclosed property), nonmarketable equity securities and certain
other  assets  and  liabilities.  Nonrecurring  fair  value  adjustments  typically  involve  write-downs  of  individual  assets  or  application  of  lower  of  cost  or  fair  value
accounting.

Fair value is an estimate of the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction (i.e., not a
forced  transaction,  such  as  a  liquidation  or  distressed  sale)  between  market  participants  at  the  measurement  date  and  is  based  on  the  assumptions  market
participants  would  use  when  pricing  an  asset  or  liability.  Fair  value  measurement  and  disclosure  guidance  establishes  a  three-level  hierarchy  for  disclosure  of
assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements include information about the fair value hierarchy, the extent to
which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities, as well as the valuation methodologies and key inputs used.

At December 31, 2022, assets and liabilities measured using observable inputs that are classified as Level 1 or Level 2 represented close to 100 percent
and 99 percent of total assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, respectively. Valuations generated from model-based techniques that use at least one significant
assumption not observable in the market are considered Level 3 and reflect estimates of assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
The valuation of Level 3 assets and liabilities are considered critical accounting estimates.

PENSION PLAN ACCOUNTING

The Corporation has a qualified and a non-qualified defined benefit pension plan. Effective January 1, 2017, benefits are calculated using a cash balance
formula based on years of service, age, compensation and an interest credit based on the 30-year Treasury rate. Participants under age 60 as of December 31, 2016
are eligible to receive a frozen final average pay benefit in addition to amounts earned under the cash balance formula. Participants age 60 or older as of December
31, 2016 continue to be eligible for a final average pay benefit. The Corporation makes assumptions concerning future events that will determine the amount and
timing of required benefit payments, funding requirements and defined benefit pension expense. The major assumptions are the discount rate used in determining
the current benefit obligation, the long-term rate of return expected on plan assets, mix of assets within the portfolio and the projected mortality rate.

The  discount  rate  is  determined  by  matching  the  expected  cash  flows  of  the  pension  plans  to  a  portfolio  of  high  quality  corporate  bonds  as  of  the
measurement date, December 31. The long-term rate of return expected on plan assets is set after considering both long-term returns in the general market and
long-term returns experienced by the assets in the plan. The current target asset allocation model for the plans is provided in Note 17 to the consolidated financial
statements.  The  expected  returns  on  these  various  asset  categories  are  blended  to  derive  one  long-term  return  assumption.  The  assets  are  primarily  invested  in
certain collective investment funds, common stocks, U.S. Treasury and other U.S. government agency securities, as well as corporate and municipal bonds and
notes. Mortality rate assumptions are based on mortality tables published by third-parties such as the Society of Actuaries, considering other available information
including historical data as well as studies and publications from reputable sources.

The Corporation reviews its pension plan assumptions on an annual basis with its actuarial consultants to determine if the assumptions are reasonable and
adjusts the assumptions to reflect changes in future expectations. The major assumptions used to calculate 2023 and 2022 defined benefit plan pension expense
(benefit) were as follows:

Long-term rate of return on plan assets

Defined benefit plan benefit is expected to decrease $64 million to approximately $25 million in 2023, compared to a benefit of $89 million in 2022. This
includes service cost expense of $34 million and a benefit from other components of $59 million. Service costs are included in salaries and benefits expense, while
the benefit from other components are included in other noninterest expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

The  Corporation’s  pension  plan  is  most  sensitive  to  changes  in  discount  rate  and  long-term  rate  of  return.  A  change  to  the  discount  rate  implies  a
corresponding change in interest rates that affect the value of the plan’s fixed income assets. An increase of 25 basis points to the discount rate, including the effect
of higher interest rates on the plan’s fixed income assets, would result in a net increase to pension expense of $11 million, while a decrease of 25 basis points
would reduce pension expense by $11 million. Increasing the long-term rate of return by 25 basis points would reduce pension expense by $6 million, while a
decrease of 25 basis points would increase pension expense by $6 million.

Due to the long-term nature of pension plan assumptions, actual results may differ significantly from the actuarial-based estimates. Differences resulting
in actuarial gains or losses are required to be recorded in shareholders' equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss and amortized to defined benefit
pension expense in future years. Refer to Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.

INCOME TAXES

The provision for income taxes is the sum of income taxes due for the current year and deferred taxes. Deferred taxes arise from temporary differences
between the income tax basis and financial accounting basis of assets and liabilities. Accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received
from  taxing  jurisdictions,  currently  or  in  the  future,  and  are  included  in  accrued  income  and  other  assets  or  accrued  expenses  and  other  liabilities  on  the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Included in net deferred taxes are deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for realization based on available evidence of projected future
reversals  of  existing  taxable  temporary  differences,  assumptions  made  regarding  future  events  and,  when  applicable,  state  loss  carryback  capacity.  A  valuation
allowance is provided when it is more-likely-than-not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Determining whether deferred tax assets are
realizable is subjective and requires the use of significant judgment.

The Corporation assesses the relative risks and merits of tax positions for various transactions after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent
and other available information and maintains tax accruals consistent with these assessments. This assessment is complex and requires judgment. The Corporation
is subject to audit by taxing authorities that could question and/or challenge the tax positions taken by the Corporation. Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes
occur  due  to  changes  in  tax  law,  interpretations  of  existing  tax  laws,  new  judicial  or  regulatory  guidance,  and  the  status  of  examinations  conducted  by  taxing
authorities that impact the relative risks and merits of tax positions taken by the Corporation. These changes, when they occur, impact the estimate of accrued taxes
and  could  be  significant  to  the  operating  results  of  the  Corporation.  For  further  information  on  tax  accruals  and  related  risks,  see  Note  18  to  the  consolidated
financial statements.

SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATA

The Corporation believes non-GAAP measures are meaningful because they reflect adjustments commonly made by management, investors, regulators

and analysts to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and our performance trends.

Pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) is a measure that the Corporation uses to understand fundamental operating performance before credit-related

and tax expenses.

Tangible common equity is used by the Corporation to measure the quality of capital and the return relative to balance sheet risk.

Common equity tier 1 capital ratio removes preferred stock from the Tier 1 capital ratio as defined by and calculated in conformity with bank regulations.
The  tangible  common  equity  ratio  removes  the  effect  of  intangible  assets  from  capital  and  total  assets.  Tangible  common  equity  per  share  of  common  stock
removes the effect of intangible assets from common shareholders' equity per share of common stock. The Corporation believes that the presentation of tangible
common  equity  adjusted  for  the  impact  of  accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss  provides  a  greater  understanding  of  ongoing  operations  and  enhances
comparability with prior periods.

The following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and regulatory ratios used in this financial review with financial measures

defined by GAAP.
