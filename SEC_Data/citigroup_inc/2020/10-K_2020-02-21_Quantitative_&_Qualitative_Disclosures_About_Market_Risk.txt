OVERVIEW

Citigroup’s history dates back to the founding of the City 
Bank of New York in 1812.

Citigroup is a global diversified financial services holding 

company whose businesses provide consumers, corporations, 
governments and institutions with a broad, yet focused, range 
of financial products and services, including consumer 
banking and credit, corporate and investment banking, 
securities brokerage, trade and securities services and wealth 
management. Citi has approximately 200 million customer 
accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and 
jurisdictions.

At December 31, 2020, Citi had approximately 210,000 

full-time employees, compared to approximately 200,000 full-
time employees at December 31, 2019. For additional 
information, see “Human Capital Resources and 
Management” below.

Citigroup currently operates, for management reporting 

purposes, via two primary business segments: Global 
Consumer Banking (GCB) and Institutional Clients Group 
(ICG), with the remaining operations in Corporate/Other. For 
a further description of the business segments and the products 
and services they provide, see “Citigroup Segments” below,

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
As described further throughout this Executive Summary, 
during 2020, Citi demonstrated solid performance as well as 
financial strength and operational resilience, despite a 
significant deterioration in public health and economic 
conditions during the year due to the COVID-19 pandemic:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

Citi’s earnings were substantially reduced by a higher 
allowance for credit loss (ACL) build (approximately $9.8 
billion) during the year under the CECL standard (see 
“Cost of Credit” below).
Despite the challenging environment, Citi’s revenues 
were largely unchanged from the prior year, as strong 
performance in fixed income markets, equity markets, 
investment banking and the private bank in Institutional 
Clients Group (ICG) offset the impact of lower interest 
rates across the Company, as well as the impact of lower 
customer activity in Global Consumer Banking (GCB), 
reflecting declines across all regions, and lower revenues 
in Corporate/Other.
Citi’s expenses reflected continued investments in its 
transformation, including infrastructure supporting its risk 
and control environment, as well as a $400 million civil 
money penalty in the third quarter of 2020 in connection 
with a consent order Citibank entered into with the Office 
of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) (for additional 
information on this consent order and the Citigroup 
consent order with the Federal Reserve Board, see “Citi’s 
Consent Order Compliance” below).
Citi had broad-based deposit growth across ICG and 
GCB, reflecting strong client engagement, as well as an 
elevated level of liquidity in the financial system, while 
loans declined reflecting lower levels of consumer and 
corporate activity.
Citi returned $7.2 billion of capital to its common 
shareholders in the form of dividends and common share 
repurchases.
The Federal Reserve Board authorized Citi to take certain 
capital actions during the first quarter of 2021, which 
allows Citi to return capital to common shareholders of up 
to $2.8 billion, including the previously announced 
common dividends of $0.51 per share in the quarter. Citi 
commenced share repurchases in February 2021.
Citi continued to support its colleagues, customers, clients 
and communities as well as the broader economy during 
this challenging time (see “COVID-19 Pandemic 
Overview” below), while maintaining a strong balance 
sheet.

The economic outlook for 2021 reflects continued 

challenges and uncertainties related to the pandemic, 
including, among others, the duration and severity of the 
public health crisis and associated economic impacts, which 
have created a more volatile operating environment that will 
continue to negatively impact Citi’s businesses and results. 

As a result of new information Citi received subsequent to 
December 31, 2020, Citi adjusted downward its fourth quarter 

6

of 2020 financial results from those previously reported on 
January 15, 2021 (and filed on a Form 8-K with the SEC on 
such date), due to a $390 million increase in operating 
expenses ($323 million after-tax) recorded within ICG, 
resulting from operational losses related to certain legal 
matters. For additional information on the impact to fourth 
quarter of 2020 financial results, see Note 30 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements. Citi’s results of operations 
and financial condition for the full year 2020, as reported in 
this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended 
December 31, 2020, reflect the impact of this adjustment. 
For a discussion of risks and uncertainties that will or 

could impact Citi’s businesses, results of operations and 
financial condition during 2021, see “COVID-19 Pandemic 
Overview,” “Risk Factors,” each respective business’s results 
of operations and “Managing Global Risk” below. 

2020 Results Summary

Citigroup
Citigroup reported net income of $11.0 billion, or $4.72 per 
share, compared to net income of $19.4 billion, or $8.04 per 
share, in the prior year. Net income declined 43%, driven by 
significantly higher credit costs and higher expenses, while 
revenues remained largely unchanged. Earnings per share 
decreased 41%, primarily driven by the decline in net income. 

Citigroup revenues of $74.3 billion were largely 
unchanged from the prior year, as higher revenues in ICG 
offset lower revenues in GCB and Corporate/Other.

Citigroup’s end-of-period loans decreased 3% from the 

prior year to $676 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign 
currency translation into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes 
(FX translation), Citigroup’s end-of-period loans declined 4%, 
driven by a 4% aggregate decline in GCB and ICG, reflecting 
lower spend activity in GCB as well as a higher level of 
repayments in both GCB and ICG. Citigroup’s end-of-period 
deposits increased 20% to $1.3 trillion. Excluding the impact 
of FX translation, Citigroup’s end-of-period deposits increased 
19%, primarily driven by 18% growth in GCB and 19% 
growth in ICG. (Citi’s results of operations excluding the 
impact of FX translation are non-GAAP financial measures. 
Citi believes the presentation of its results of operations and 
financial condition excluding the impact of FX translation 
provides a meaningful depiction of the underlying 
fundamentals of its businesses for investors, industry analysts 
and others.)

Expenses
Citigroup operating expenses of $43.2 billion increased 3% 
versus the prior year, primarily driven by investments in Citi’s 
transformation, including infrastructure supporting its risk and 
control environment, higher compensation, the civil money 
penalty, operational losses related to certain legal matters and 
pandemic-related expenses, partially offset by efficiency 
savings and reductions in marketing and other discretionary 
spending. Operating expenses in GCB declined 2%, while ICG 

expenses increased 6% and Corporate/Other expenses 
increased 16%.

Cost of Credit
Citi’s total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and 
claims of $17.5 billion increased significantly from $8.4 
billion in the prior year, reflecting ACL reserve increases 
across GCB, ICG and Corporate/Other. Citi’s ACL build of 
$9.8 billion was largely driven by builds during the first half 
of 2020. The reserve build in 2020 primarily reflected the 
impact of a deterioration in Citi’s macroeconomic outlook 
under the CECL standard and downgrades in the corporate 
loan portfolio, partially offset by lower loan volumes in GCB, 
all driven by the pandemic. The reserve build included an 
additional qualitative management adjustment to reflect the 
potential for a higher level of stress and a slower economic 
recovery. For further information on the drivers of Citi’s ACL 
build, see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant 
Estimates—Allowance for Credit Losses” below. For 
information on the transition impact of the adoption of the 
CECL standard, see “COVID-19 Pandemic Overview” below.
Net credit losses of $7.6 billion declined 2% from the 

prior year. Consumer net credit losses of $6.6 billion 
decreased 10%, primarily reflecting lower loan volumes given 
lower spending activity and higher payment rates, as well as 
the benefits of consumer relief programs (see “COVID-19 
Pandemic Overview” below). Corporate net credit losses 
increased from $392 million to $1.0 billion, primarily driven 
by write-offs across various sectors, which were partially 
offset by the release of previously established ACL reserves. 
For additional information on Citi’s consumer and 

corporate credit costs and ACL, see each respective business’s 
results of operations and “Credit Risk” below.

Capital
Citigroup’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio was 11.7% as 
of December 31, 2020, based on the Basel III Advanced 
Approaches framework for determining risk-weighted assets, 
compared to 11.8% as of December 31, 2019, based on the 
Basel III Standardized Approach for determining risk-
weighted assets. The decline in the ratio primarily reflected an 
increase in risk-weighted assets and the return of capital to 
common shareholders, partially offset by net income and 
beneficial net movements in Accumulated other 
comprehensive income (AOCI). 

Citigroup’s Supplementary Leverage ratio was 7.0% as of 

December 31, 2020, compared to 6.2% as of December 31, 
2019. The increase was primarily driven by a decrease in Total 
Leverage Exposure, reflecting the benefit of temporary relief 
granted by the Federal Reserve Board. For additional 
information on Citi’s capital ratios and related components, 
see “Capital Resources” below.

Global Consumer Banking
GCB net income of $878 million declined 85% from the prior 
year. Excluding the impact of FX translation, net income 
declined 84%, reflecting lower revenues and higher cost of 
credit, partially offset by lower expenses. GCB operating 
expenses of $17.2 billion decreased 2%. Excluding the impact 
of FX translation, expenses decreased 1%, as lower volume-

7

related expenses, reductions in marketing and other 
discretionary spending and efficiency savings were partially 
offset by increases in pandemic-related expenses and higher 
repositioning costs. 

GCB revenues of $30.0 billion decreased 9%. Excluding 

the impact of FX translation, revenues decreased 8%, as strong 
deposit growth and momentum in wealth management were 
more than offset by lower card volumes and lower interest 
rates across all regions, reflecting the impact of the pandemic. 
North America GCB revenues of $19.1 billion decreased 
6%, with lower revenues across Citi-branded cards, Citi retail 
services and retail banking. Citi-branded cards revenues of 
$8.8 billion decreased 4%, reflecting lower purchase sales and 
higher payment rates driving lower average loans. Citi retail 
services revenues of $5.9 billion decreased 12%, reflecting 
lower average loans as well as higher partner payments. Retail 
banking revenues of $4.5 billion decreased 2%, as the benefit 
of stronger deposit volumes and an improvement in mortgage 
revenues were more than offset by lower deposit spreads.
North America GCB average deposits of $176 billion 
increased 15% year-over-year, average retail banking loans of 
$52 billion increased 8% year-over-year and assets under 
management of $80 billion increased 11%. Average Citi-
branded cards loans of $85 billion decreased 6% and Citi-
branded cards purchase sales of $338 billion decreased 8%, 
while average Citi retail services loans of $47 billion 
decreased 7% and Citi retail services purchase sales of $78 
billion decreased 11%. The decline in Citi-branded cards and
retail services loans and purchase sales were all driven by
reduced customer activity related to the pandemic. For 
additional information on the results of operations of North 
America GCB in 2020, see “Global Consumer Banking—
North America GCB” below.

International GCB revenues (consisting of Latin America 
GCB and Asia GCB (which includes the results of operations 
in certain EMEA countries)) of $10.8 billion declined 14% 
versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of FX translation, 
international GCB revenues declined 10%, largely reflecting 
the impact of the pandemic. On this basis, Latin America GCB 
revenues decreased 8%, driven by lower average loans and 
lower interest rates, partially offset by strong deposit growth. 
Asia GCB revenues decreased 11%, as lower card revenues 
and the impact of lower interest rates were partially offset by 
strong investment revenues and strong deposit growth. For 
additional information on the results of operations of Latin 
America GCB and Asia GCB in 2020, including the impact of 
FX translation, see “Global Consumer Banking—Latin 
America GCB” and “Global Consumer Banking—Asia GCB” 
below.

Year-over-year, excluding the impact of FX translation, 
international GCB average deposits of $135 billion increased 
11%, average retail banking loans of $72 billion increased 3% 
and assets under management of $141 billion increased 8%. 
On this basis, international GCB average card loans of $22 
billion decreased 8% and card purchase sales of $88 billion 
decreased 16%, both driven by reduced customer activity 
related to the pandemic.

$2.5 billion increased significantly, as the wind-down of 
legacy assets was more than offset by investments in 
infrastructure, risk management and controls, the civil money 
penalty and incremental costs associated with the pandemic. 

Corporate/Other revenues of $54 million compared to 
$2.0 billion in the prior year, reflecting the impact of lower 
interest rates, episodic gains in the prior year, the wind-down 
of legacy assets and marks on securities. For additional 
information on the results of operations of Corporate/Other in 
2020, see “Corporate/Other” below.

CITI’S CONSENT ORDER COMPLIANCE
As previously disclosed, Citi is embarking on a multiyear 
transformation, with the target outcome to change Citi’s 
business and operating models such that they simultaneously 
strengthen risk and controls and improve Citi’s value to 
customers, clients and shareholders. 

One part of the broader transformation effort involves 

Citi’s compliance with the Federal Reserve Board and OCC 
consent orders issued with Citigroup and Citibank, 
respectively, in October 2020. The consent orders require that 
Citigroup and Citibank submit acceptable plans to the Federal 
Reserve Board and the OCC, on various timelines, relating 
principally to various aspects of risk management, 
compliance, data quality management and governance, and 
internal controls. The consent order with the OCC also 
required Citibank to pay a $400 million civil money penalty. 
As a part of its compliance actions, Citi has centralized its 
program management under the leadership of a Chief 
Administrative Officer organization and is making the 
strengthening of its risk and control environment a further 
strategic priority for the Company. The Citigroup and Citibank 
Boards of Directors each formed a Transformation Oversight 
Committee, an ad hoc committee of each Board, to provide 
oversight of management’s remediation efforts under the 
consent orders.

For additional information about the consent orders, see 
“Risk Factors—Compliance Risks” below and Citi’s Current 
Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 7, 2020. 

Institutional Clients Group
ICG net income of $11.7 billion decreased 9%, as revenue 
growth was more than offset by higher cost of credit and 
higher expenses. ICG operating expenses increased 6% to 
$23.5 billion, largely driven by investments in infrastructure 
and risk management and controls, higher compensation costs, 
operational losses related to certain legal matters and volume-
driven growth, partially offset by efficiency savings.

ICG revenues of $44.3 billion increased 13%, reflecting a 

29% increase in Markets and securities services revenues, 
partially offset by a 1% decline in Banking revenues. The 
decrease in Banking revenues included the impact of $51 
million of losses on loan hedges related to corporate lending 
and the private bank, compared to losses of $432 million 
related to corporate lending in the prior year.

Banking revenues of $21.2 billion (excluding the impact 

of losses on loan hedges) decreased 3%, as increases in 
investment banking and the private bank were more than 
offset by declines in treasury and trade solutions and corporate 
lending. Investment banking revenues of $5.8 billion increased 
11%, reflecting solid growth in capital markets, particularly in 
equity underwriting. Advisory revenues decreased 20% to 
$1.0 billion, while equity underwriting revenues increased 
64% to $1.6 billion and debt underwriting revenues increased 
7% to $3.2 billion.

Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $9.5 billion 
declined 7%, and 5% excluding the impact of FX translation, 
as strong client engagement and growth in deposits were more 
than offset by lower interest rates and reduced commercial 
card spend largely driven by the pandemic. Private bank 
revenues of $3.8 billion increased 9%. Excluding the impact 
of gains on loan hedges, private bank revenues of $3.7 billion, 
increased 8%, driven by increased capital markets activity and 
improved managed investments revenues, as well as higher 
lending and deposit volumes, partially offset by lower deposit 
spreads. Corporate lending revenues of $2.1 billion declined 
15%. Excluding the impact of losses on loan hedges, corporate 
lending revenues of $2.2 billion declined 25%, as higher 
average loan volumes were more than offset by lower spreads, 
higher hedging costs and an adjustment to the residual value of 
a lease financing asset.

Markets and securities services revenues of $23.1 billion 

increased 29%. Fixed income markets revenues of $17.3 
billion increased 34%, reflecting strength in rates and 
currencies, spread products and commodities. Equity markets 
revenues of $3.6 billion increased 25%, as solid performance 
in cash equities and derivatives was partially offset by lower 
revenues in prime finance. Securities services revenues of $2.5 
billion decreased 3%, and 1% excluding the impact of FX 
translation, as higher deposit volumes were more than offset 
by lower spreads. For additional information on the results of 
operations of ICG in 2020, see “Institutional Clients Group” 
below.

Corporate/Other
Corporate/Other net loss was $1.6 billion, compared to net 
income of $801 million in the prior year, reflecting lower 
revenues, increased expenses, higher cost of credit, driven by 
an ACL build on Citi’s residual legacy portfolio under the 
CECL standard, and lower tax benefits. Operating expenses of

COVID-19 PANDEMIC OVERVIEW
In addition to the widespread public health implications, the 
COVID-19 pandemic has had an extraordinary impact on 
macroeconomic conditions in the U.S. and around the world. 
As discussed below and elsewhere throughout this Form 10-K, 
Citi’s businesses, results of operations and financial condition 
have been impacted by economic dislocations and trends 
caused by the pandemic. Citi had builds to its allowance for 
credit losses (ACL) of approximately $9.8 billion during 2020, 
bringing its total ACL to approximately $27.8 billion at 
December 31, 2020, with an allowance for credit losses on 
loans (ACLL) reserve ratio of 3.73% on funded loans. For 
additional information, see “Impact of CECL on Citi’s 
Allowance for Credit Losses” below.

Despite these impacts, Citi has maintained strong capital 

and liquidity positions with consistently strong business 
operations. At December 31, 2020, Citi had a Common Equity 
Tier 1 Capital ratio of 11.7%, a Supplementary Leverage ratio 
of 7.0% and a Liquidity Coverage ratio of 118%, each well 
above regulatory minimums, with approximately $972 billion 
of available liquidity resources (see “Capital Resources” and 
“Managing Global Risk—Liquidity Risk” below). 

Governments and central banks globally have taken a 
series of aggressive actions to support their economies and 
mitigate the systemic impacts of the pandemic, and Citi 
continues to proactively assess and utilize these measures 
where appropriate.

Citi’s COVID-19 Pandemic Response—Supporting 
Colleagues, Customers and Communities
The health and safety of Citi’s employees and their families, 
as well as Citi’s customers, clients and the communities it 
serves, are of the utmost importance. As the public health 
crisis has unfolded, Citi has continued to take proactive 
measures to support colleagues’ well-being while maintaining 
its ability to serve customers and clients.

Citi Colleagues
•

The majority of Citi colleagues—roughly 80%—around 
the world are working remotely, however this varies by 
country.
Citi is pursuing a slow and measured return in locations 
where local guidelines permit, beginning with only a 
small number of colleagues.
Citi’s response teams continue to consult with health 
experts and follow local government guidelines in 
determining the safest return to office for each location. 
Citi has reconfigured its sites and implemented new 
protocols to make work environments as safe as possible 
in offices, branches and ATMs. 
Citi continues to provide additional health and well-being 
resources for colleagues, plus enhanced flexibility and 
paid time off for those impacted by COVID-19.
The company continues to monitor the situation as it 
evolves and will review and update operations as needed.

Citi Communities
In addition to its business activities, including the consumer 
relief programs discussed below, Citi is supporting those 
immediately impacted by the pandemic through philanthropic 
efforts around the world. Citi and the Citi Foundation have 
committed more than $100 million to date in support of 
COVID-19-related community relief and economic recovery 
efforts globally. These contributions include over $4 million 
raised through an employee donation matching program to 
further global relief efforts. Additionally, Citi has donated $50 
million in proceeds from its participation in the U.S. Small 
Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program 
(PPP) to the Citi Foundation, which deployed those proceeds 
to support Community Development Financial Institutions 
(CDFIs) across the U.S. 

Citi Consumer Loan Relief Programs
As previously disclosed, Citi was one of the first banks in the 
U.S. to announce temporary assistance measures for 
pandemic-impacted consumer customers. In addition, Citi has 
offered a wide array of short- and medium-term relief 
programs to customers across regions and products as a result 
of the pandemic. The relief has primarily been in the form of 
payment deferrals and fee waivers. These consumer relief 
programs have mainly been provided to GCB customers, with 
a small portion reported within Corporate/Other. To date, Citi 
has provided assistance to approximately three million U.S. 
consumers and small businesses impacted by the pandemic. 

In the fourth quarter of 2020, Citi experienced a decline in 

enrollment of approximately 21% quarter-over-quarter in its 
formal COVID-19 assistance programs. As a result of the 
significant and steady decline in enrollment, Citi ended the 
programs as of December 31, 2020 for the majority of 
countries and products. Continued COVID-19 assistance 
programs through Citi’s subservicer include extended 
mortgage payment deferrals through 2021 and suspended 
foreclosures into the first quarter of 2021 for U.S. mortgages. 
Citi remains committed to discussing assistance options with 
customers that continue to experience financial hardship on a 
case-by-case basis.

The table below provides information on the number of 

loan modifications, the associated enrollment and outstanding 
balances as of December 31, 2020, for Citi’s pandemic-related 
relief programs, excluding troubled debt restructurings (for 
additional information, see “Troubled Debt Restructuring 
(TDR) Relief” below).

Citi’s Management of COVID-19 Pandemic Risks
Citi has responded on multiple fronts to the challenges of the 
pandemic to support the ongoing needs of its customers and 
clients, while concurrently maintaining safety and soundness 
standards.

Citi’s dedicated continuity of business and crisis 

management groups are managing Citi’s protocols in response 
to the pandemic. These protocols provide for the safety and 
well-being of Citi’s staff, while continuing to maintain high 
levels of client servicing across all of the markets in which 
Citi operates. These protocols address the prioritization of 
critical processing; ability of staff and third parties to support 
these processes from remote work locations; deployment of 
new hardware to support technology needs; and ongoing 
monitoring to assess controls and service levels. Planning for 
Citi’s return-to-office strategy is ongoing.

Citi’s organizational response to the pandemic has been 
governed by Citi’s Executive Management Team, consisting 
of the Citigroup CEO and certain direct reports of the CEO, 
and driven through regional task forces that were deployed in 
Asia, EMEA, North America and Latin America. Led by 
regional CEOs and their management teams, these groups 
focused on, and continue to manage, the pandemic responses, 
implementation of continuity of business plans, locational and 
staffing strategies and responses to customer and client needs.
Throughout the crisis, Citi has also worked closely with 

U.S. authorities and host governments on implementing 
immediate policy responses and financial assistance structures 
to mitigate the systemic impacts of the pandemic. Citi also 
continues to engage closely with customers and clients, 
regulators and other relevant stakeholders to assure alignment 
on all pandemic-related matters.

Citi’s North America credit card programs had the largest 

number of loan modifications in 2020. As these credit card 
relief programs were introduced during the first half of 2020 
and offered a deferral of minimum payments for two to four 
payment cycles, nearly all of the customers had rolled off the 
programs by year-end, of whom approximately 86% have 
continued to make payments. 

For customers enrolled in mortgage forbearance programs 
in North America, Citi’s subservicer offered payment deferrals 
and suspended foreclosures, and by the end of 2020, 
approximately 63% of mortgage customers had rolled off the 
program, of whom approximately 72% have continued to 
make payments. As of December 31, 2020, Citi had 
approximately $1.3 billion of mortgage loan balances 
outstanding under the programs. 

As of December 31, 2020, Citi had approximately $0.8 

billion of loan balances outstanding under Asia consumer 
relief programs. In Asia, approximately 96% of customers had 
rolled off the consumer relief programs as of December 31, 
2020, of whom approximately 83% have continued to make 
payments. 

As of December 31, 2020, Citi had no loan balances 

outstanding under the Latin America consumer relief 
programs, as all the customers had rolled off the programs, of 
whom approximately 78% have continued to make payments. 

Citi Corporate Loan Relief Programs
Citi has modified the contractual terms of corporate loans to 
certain borrowers impacted by the pandemic, primarily 
commercial banking (small business) and private bank 
customers. These modifications consist primarily of deferrals 
in the payment of principal and/or interest that Citi has 
provided during 2020 in response to borrower requests, as 
well as those provided pursuant to government-mandated 
relief programs. 

The table below summarizes Citi’s outstanding active 
loan modifications, excluding TDRs as of December 31, 2020.

Certain Key Government Actions in Support of the 
Economy

For additional information about Citi’s liquidity resources, see 
“Managing Global Risk—Liquidity Risk” below.

U.S. Government-Sponsored Liquidity Programs
During the first quarter of 2020, the Federal Reserve Board 
(FRB) introduced several liquidity facilities in response to the 
funding market volatility caused by the pandemic. Citi has 
participated in several of the U.S. government-sponsored 
liquidity programs, including the Money Market Mutual Fund 
Liquidity Facility (MMLF), the Primary Dealer Credit Facility 
(PDCF) and Discount Window (DW) in order to facilitate 
client activity and support the FRB actions to provide 
additional liquidity into the market. Citi has also participated 
in the Paycheck Protection Program Lending Facility 
(PPPLF), which was established to facilitate lending under the 
Small Business Administration’s (SBA’s) Paycheck Protection 
Program (see “Small Business Administration’s Paycheck 
Protection Program” below). The amounts Citi sourced from 
these facilities were not significant to Citi’s overall liquidity 
profile during 2020, which remains strong and highly liquid. 

U.S. Banking Agencies Regulatory Capital Relief 
In response to the pandemic, throughout 2020, the U.S. 
banking agencies issued several final rules and interim final 
rules revising the current regulatory capital standards, to 
provide banking organizations with additional flexibility to 
support consumers and businesses. Those rules applicable to 
Citi include:

•

Easing of capital distribution limits in the event of 
regulatory capital buffer breaches, which provides some 
flexibility to continue distributing capital under certain 
circumstances.

• Modification of the CECL transition provision to defer 

the January 1, 2020 capital impact to January 1, 2022 and 
to provide additional capital relief for ongoing increases 
in credit reserves. Citi’s reported Common Equity Tier 1 
Capital ratio at December 31, 2020, reflecting the 
modified CECL transition provision, was 39 basis points 

12

 
 
 
 
 
 
higher than Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio, 
reflecting the full impact of CECL on regulatory capital. 
Excluding the modified CECL transition provision, 
Citigroup’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio would 
have been 11.34%, compared with a 10.0% effective 
minimum requirement.
Temporary Supplementary Leverage ratio (SLR) relief for 
bank holding companies, commencing in the second 
quarter of 2020, allowing Citigroup to temporarily expand 
its balance sheet by excluding U.S. Treasury securities 
and deposits with the FRB from the SLR denominator. 
Citigroup’s reported Supplementary Leverage ratio of 
7.00% benefited by 109 basis points during the fourth 
quarter of 2020 as a result of the temporary relief. 
Excluding the temporary relief, Citigroup’s 
Supplementary Leverage ratio would have been 5.91%, 
compared with a 5.0% effective minimum requirement.
Assigning a 0% risk weight to loans originated under the 
Paycheck Protection Program.

•

Pandemic and Other Impacts
In 2021, Citi expects overall revenues to decline from 2020, 
largely driven by normalization in the ICG markets 
businesses. In addition, GCB, ICG and Corporate/Other 
revenues will likely continue to be adversely impacted by the 
lower global interest rate environment, and GCB and ICG 
revenues will be affected by the challenges and uncertainties 
in the macroeconomic and market environment, including as a 
result of the continued severity and duration of the pandemic. 
Each GCB region is also expected to continue to experience 
the adverse impacts the pandemic has had on customer 
activity, while Latin America GCB is also likely to continue to 
experience an impact from macroeconomic weakness in 
Mexico. 

Citi also expects to incur higher expenses, as it continues 

to accelerate the transformation of its infrastructure, risk 
management and controls, including its efforts to improve the 
risk and control environment, as well as to comply with the 
consent orders (see “Citi’s Consent Order Compliance” 
above).

For additional information about regulatory capital relief 

Moreover, based on its existing portfolios as of December 

31, 2020, Citi expects to experience higher net credit losses, 
which will vary by business and region and be dependent on 
future macroeconomic conditions. Citi believes that these 
losses are adequately reserved for under the CECL standard at 
December 31, 2020. Citi expects international consumer losses 
to peak during the first half of 2021, while in the U.S., losses 
could begin to rise in 2021 but peak afterward. If Citi’s fourth 
quarter of 2020 macroeconomic forecast assumptions are 
realized, Citi would not expect additional reserve builds on its 
existing portfolios (for additional information, see “Significant 
Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” below); 
however, the overall level of reserves remains dependent on 
the evolving economic and public health environments relative 
to this forecast, as well as new lending volumes. 

For additional information about material risks to Citi 
from the pandemic and other macroeconomic challenges and 
uncertainties, see “Risk Factors” below.

provided by the U.S. banking agencies, see “Capital 
Resources” below.

Troubled Debt Restructuring (TDR) Relief
Under U.S. GAAP, banks are required to assess modifications 
to a loan’s terms for potential classification as a TDR. A loan 
to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty is classified as 
a TDR when a lender grants a concession that it would 
otherwise not consider, such as a payment deferral or interest 
concession. 

In order to encourage banks to work with impacted 
borrowers, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic 
Security Act (CARES Act) and U.S. banking agencies have 
provided relief from TDR accounting. The main benefits of 
TDR relief include a capital benefit in the form of reduced 
risk-weighted assets, as TDRs are more heavily risk-weighted 
for capital purposes; aging of the loans is frozen, i.e., they will 
continue to be reported in the same delinquency bucket they 
were in at the time of modification; and the loans are generally 
not reported as non-accrual during the modification period. 
The loans included in Citi’s pandemic-related consumer relief 
programs are included in Citi’s reserving process under the 
CECL standard. 

Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection 
Program
The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) authorizes the 
origination of forgivable loans for small businesses to pay 
their employees during the pandemic. Loan terms are the same 
for all businesses. During the first round of PPP, which was 
launched in April 2020, Citi funded over 30,000 loans totaling 
$3.8 billion as of December 31, 2020, with approximately $3.4 
billion outstanding at December 31, 2020. The processing of 
loan forgiveness requests under PPP began during the third 
quarter of 2020 and Citi received approximately $314 million 
of funds from the SBA relating to forgiveness in the fourth 
quarter of 2020. Citi is currently participating in the relaunch 
of PPP and remains committed to supporting small businesses.

Global Consumer Banking (GCB) consists of consumer banking businesses in North America, Latin America (consisting of Citi’s 
consumer banking business in Mexico) and Asia. GCB provides traditional banking services to retail customers through retail banking, 
Citi-branded cards and, in the U.S., Citi retail services (for additional information on these businesses, see “Citigroup Segments” 
above). GCB is focused on its priority markets in the U.S., Mexico and Asia, with 2,303 branches in 19 countries and jurisdictions as

For additional information on North America GCB’s retail 

banking, and its Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services 
portfolios, see “Credit Risk—Consumer Credit” below.

For additional information about trends, uncertainties and 

risks related to North America GCB’s future results, see 
“COVID-19 Pandemic Overview” above and “Risk Factors” 
below.

2020 vs. 2019 
Net income decreased 98%, as significantly higher cost of 
credit and lower revenues were partially offset by lower 
expenses.

Revenues decreased 6%, reflecting lower revenues in Citi 
retail services, Citi-branded cards and retail banking, primarily 
due to the pandemic, including lower interest rates.

Retail banking revenues decreased 2%, as the benefit of 

stronger deposit volumes and an improvement in mortgage 
revenues were more than offset by lower deposit spreads, 
reflecting lower interest rates. 

Average deposits increased 15%, driven by a combination 

of factors, including government stimulus payments, a 
reduction in overall consumer spending related to the 
pandemic and strategic efforts to drive organic growth, 
including digital deposits which drove more than one-third of 
the year-over-year growth. 

Cards revenues decreased 7%. Citi-branded cards 
revenues decreased 4%, reflecting lower purchase sales and 
higher payment rates driving lower average loans. Average 
loans decreased 6% and purchase sales decreased 8%, both 
reflecting the impact of the pandemic on customer activity. 
Citi retail services revenues decreased 12%, primarily 
reflecting lower average loans and higher contractual partner 
payments. (For additional information on partner payments, 
see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) Average 
loans were down 7% and purchase sales declined 11%, both 
reflecting the impact of the pandemic on customer activity.
Expenses decreased 2%, as lower volume-related 
expenses, reductions in marketing and other discretionary 
expenses, as well as efficiency savings, more than offset 
higher pandemic-related expenses.

Provisions of $9.1 billion increased 50% from the prior 

year, driven by a higher allowance for credit losses (ACL) 
build, partially offset by lower net credit losses. Net credit 
losses decreased 11%, primarily driven by lower net credit 
losses in Citi retail services (down 16% to $2.2 billion) and 
Citi-branded cards (down 5% to $2.7 billion), primarily 
reflecting lower loan volumes as well as higher payment rates 
given high levels of liquidity, lower spending and the benefits 
of relief programs. 

The ACL build of $4.1 billion (compared to a build of

$470 million in the prior year under prior accounting
standards) was driven by builds during the first half of 2020. 
The builds reflected the impact of a deterioration in Citi’s 
macroeconomic outlook under the CECL standard, including 
an increase in the qualitative management adjustment to 
reflect the potential for a higher level of stress and a slower 
economic recovery, partially offset by lower loan volumes, 
both primarily driven by the pandemic. For additional 
information on Citi’s ACL, see “Significant Accounting 
Policies and Significant Estimates” below and Notes 1 and 15 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The discussion of the results of operations for Latin America GCB below excludes the impact of FX translation for all periods 
presented. Presentations of the results of operations, excluding the impact of FX translation, are non-GAAP financial measures. For a 
reconciliation of certain of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.

2020 vs. 2019 
Net income decreased 66%, reflecting lower revenues, higher 
cost of credit and higher expenses.

Revenues decreased 8%, reflecting lower retail banking 
and cards revenues, largely due to the pandemic, including 
lower interest rates. Revenues also decreased due to the 
ongoing slowdown in overall economic growth and industry 
volumes in Mexico.

Retail banking revenues decreased 8%, driven by a 
decline in loan volumes and lower deposit spreads, partially 
offset by deposit growth and an increase in assets under 
management. Average deposits were up 10%, while average 
loans decreased 5%, reflecting the impact of the pandemic on 
customer activity, as well as the ongoing economic slowdown. 
Assets under management increased 12%, including the 
benefit of market movements.

Cards revenues decreased 10%, primarily driven by lower 

purchase sales (down 17%) and lower average loans (down 
8%), reflecting the impact of the pandemic on customer 
activity and the ongoing economic slowdown.

Expenses increased 4%, as efficiency savings were more 
than offset by repositioning costs, pandemic-related expenses, 
and ongoing investment spending.

Provisions of $1.3 billion increased 26% from the prior 

year, driven by a higher allowance for credit losses (ACL) 
build, partially offset by lower net credit losses. Net credit 
losses decreased 14%, primarily driven by lower average loans 
and the impact of consumer relief programs. 

The ACL build of $316 million (compared to a net 
reserve release of $35 million in the prior year under prior 
accounting standards) was driven by builds during the first 
half of 2020. The builds reflected the impact of a deterioration 
in Citi’s macroeconomic outlook under the CECL standard, 
including an increase in the qualitative management 
adjustment to reflect the potential for a higher level of stress 
and a slower economic recovery, partially offset by lower loan 
volumes, both primarily driven by the pandemic. For 
additional information on Citi’s ACL, see “Significant 
Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” below and 
Notes 1 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

ASIA GCB

Asia GCB provides traditional retail banking and Citi-branded card products to retail and small business customers. During 2020, Asia 
GCB’s most significant revenues in Asia were from Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, India, Australia, Thailand, the 
Philippines, China and Indonesia. Included within Asia GCB, traditional retail banking and Citi-branded card products are also 
provided to retail customers in certain EMEA countries, primarily the United Arab Emirates, Poland and Russia. 

At December 31, 2020, on a combined basis, the businesses had 224 retail branches, $66.5 billion in retail banking loans and 

$123.9 billion in deposits. In addition, the businesses had $17.9 billion in outstanding card loan balances.

The discussion of the results of operations for Asia GCB below excludes the impact of FX translation for all periods presented. 
Presentations of the results of operations, excluding the impact of FX translation, are non-GAAP financial measures. For a 
reconciliation of certain of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.

2020 vs. 2019
Net income decreased 66%, as lower revenues and 
significantly higher cost of credit were partially offset by 
lower expenses.

Revenues decreased 11%, reflecting lower cards and retail 

banking revenues, largely due to the pandemic, including 
lower interest rates.

Retail banking revenues decreased 3%, as growth in 
deposits and higher fees on investments and foreign currency 
transactions due to higher volumes and volatility were more 
than offset by lower deposit spreads and lower insurance 
revenues. Average deposits increased 11% and average loans 
increased 5%. Assets under management increased 5% and 
investment sales increased 43%. Retail lending revenues 
increased 4%, largely reflecting growth in mortgages and 
personal loans, partially offset by spread compression in 
personal loans.

Cards revenues decreased 24%, primarily driven by lower 

purchase sales (down 16%) and lower average loans (down 
8%), reflecting the impact of the pandemic on customer 
activity, including from lower travel spend in the region given 
Citi’s skew to an affluent client base and a greater proportion 
of fee revenues coming from travel-related interchange and 
foreign transaction fees.

Expenses decreased 1%, as lower discretionary expenses 
and volume-related costs, as well as efficiency savings, were 
partially offset by ongoing investment spending.

Provisions of $1.3 billion increased 90%, driven by a 
higher allowance for credit losses (ACL) build as well as 
higher net credit losses. Net credit losses increased 16%, as 
pandemic lockdowns and the deterioration in the macro-
environment impacted credit performance. 

The ACL build of $520 million (compared to a build of 

$7 million in the prior year under prior accounting standards) 
was driven by builds during the first three quarters of 2020. 
The builds reflected the impact of a deterioration in Citi’s 
macroeconomic outlook under the CECL standard, including 
an increase in the qualitative management adjustment to 
reflect the potential for a higher level of stress and a slower 
economic recovery, partially offset by lower loan volumes, 
both primarily driven by the pandemic. For additional

market liquidity may increase bid/offer spreads, decrease 
client activity levels and widen credit spreads on product 
inventory positions. 

ICG’s management of the Markets businesses involves 
daily monitoring and evaluation of the above factors at the 
trading desk as well as the country level. ICG does not 
separately track the impact on total Markets revenues of the 
volume of transactions, bid/offer spreads, fair value changes of 
product inventory positions and economic hedges because, as 
noted above, these components are interrelated and are not 
deemed useful or necessary to manage the Markets businesses 
at an aggregate level.

In the Markets businesses, client revenues are those 
revenues directly attributable to client transactions at the time 
of inception, including commissions, interest or fees earned. 
Client revenues do not include the results of client facilitation 
activities (e.g., holding product inventory in anticipation of 
client demand) or the results of certain economic hedging 
activities.

ICG’s international presence is supported by trading 
floors in approximately 80 countries and a proprietary network 
in 96 countries and jurisdictions. At December 31, 2020, ICG 
had $1.7 trillion in assets and $924 billion in deposits, while 
two of its businesses—securities services and issuer services
—managed $24.0 trillion and $20.3 trillion in assets under 
custody as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For 
additional information on these operations, see 
“Administration and Other Fiduciary Fees” in Note 5 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS GROUP

Institutional Clients Group (ICG) includes Banking and 
Markets and securities services (for additional information on 
these businesses, see “Citigroup Segments” above). ICG 
provides corporate, institutional, public sector and high-net-
worth clients around the world with a full range of wholesale 
banking products and services, including fixed income and 
equity sales and trading, foreign exchange, prime brokerage, 
derivative services, equity and fixed income research, 
corporate lending, investment banking and advisory services, 
private banking, cash management, trade finance and 
securities services. ICG transacts with clients in both cash 
instruments and derivatives, including fixed income, foreign 
currency, equity and commodity products.

ICG revenue is generated primarily from fees and spreads 

associated with these activities. ICG earns fee income for 
assisting clients with transactional services and clearing and 
providing brokerage and investment banking services and 
other such activities. Such fees are recognized at the point in 
time when Citigroup’s performance under the terms of a 
contractual arrangement is completed, which is typically at the 
trade/execution date or closing of a transaction. Revenue 
generated from these activities is recorded in Commissions 
and fees and Investment banking. Revenue is also generated 
from assets under custody and administration, which is 
recognized as/when the associated promised service is 
satisfied, which normally occurs at the point in time the 
service is requested by the customer and provided by Citi. 
Revenue generated from these activities is primarily recorded 
in Administration and other fiduciary fees. For additional 
information on these various types of revenues, see Note 5 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In addition, as a market maker, ICG facilitates 
transactions, including holding product inventory to meet 
client demand, and earns the differential between the price at 
which it buys and sells the products. These price differentials 
and the unrealized gains and losses on the inventory are 
recorded in Principal transactions. Mark-to-market gains and 
losses on certain credit derivatives (used to hedge the 
corporate loan portfolio) are also recorded in Principal 
transactions, (for additional information on Principal 
transactions revenue, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements). Other primarily includes realized gains and losses 
on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, gains and losses on 
equity securities not held in trading accounts and other non-
recurring gains and losses. Interest income earned on assets 
held, less interest paid on long- and short-term debt and to 
customers on deposits, is recorded as Net interest revenue.

The amount and types of Markets revenues are impacted 
by a variety of interrelated factors, including market liquidity; 
changes in market variables such as interest rates, foreign 
exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit 
spreads, as well as their implied volatilities; investor 
confidence and other macroeconomic conditions. Assuming 
all other market conditions do not change, increases in client 
activity levels or bid/offer spreads generally result in increases 
in revenues. However, changes in market conditions can 
significantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads and 
the fair value of product inventory. For example, a decrease in

(1)  Credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion of the private bank and corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans and loans at fair value. 

Gains (losses) on loan hedges include the mark-to-market on the credit derivatives and the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. The 
fixed premium costs of these hedges are netted against the private bank and corporate lending revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection. Gains (losses) on 
loan hedges include $(74) million related to the corporate loan portfolio and $23 million related to the private bank for the year ended December 31, 2020. All of 
gains (losses) on loan hedges are related to the corporate loan portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Citigroup’s results of operations 
excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures.

(2)  2019 includes an approximate $350 million gain on Citi’s investment in Tradeweb. 
(3)  Excludes principal transactions revenues of ICG businesses other than Markets, primarily treasury and trade solutions and the private bank.
(4)  Citi assesses its Markets business performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items. For example, securities that generate Net 

interest revenue may be risk managed by derivatives that are recorded in Principal transactions revenue. For a description of the composition of these revenue 
line items, see Notes 4, 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The discussion of the results of operations for ICG below excludes (where noted) the impact of gains (losses) on hedges of accrual 
loans, which are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.

2020 vs. 2019
Net income decreased 9%, as higher revenues were more than 
offset by significantly higher credit costs and higher expenses.
Revenues increased 13%, driven by a 29% increase in 
Markets and securities services revenues, partially offset by a 
1% decrease in Banking revenues (including the impact of 
gains (losses) on loan hedges). Excluding the impact of gains 
(losses) on loan hedges, Banking revenues declined 3%, as 
growth in investment banking and the private bank was more 
than offset by a decrease in treasury and trade solutions and 
corporate lending. Excluding the pretax gain of approximately 
$350 million on Citi’s investment in Tradeweb in the prior 
year, Markets and securities services revenues increased 32%, 
primarily driven by growth in both fixed income markets and 
equity markets, partially offset by a decline in securities 
services.

Within Banking:

•

•

•

Investment banking revenues were up 11%, reflecting 
growth in overall market wallet as well as gains in wallet 
share. Advisory revenues decreased 20%, primarily 
reflecting a decline in the market wallet largely due to the 
pandemic and a decline in wallet share. Equity 
underwriting revenues increased 64%, reflecting growth 
in North America, EMEA and Asia, driven by continued 
strength in the market wallet, reflecting improved market 
liquidity and investor sentiment as well as wallet share 
gains. Debt underwriting revenues increased 7%, 
reflecting particular strength in North America, partially 
offset by Latin America, primarily driven by an increase 
in the second quarter of 2020, as the business assisted 
clients with sourcing liquidity. The increase in revenues 
was largely driven by a higher market wallet in 
investment grade debt underwriting, as well as an increase 
in overall wallet share.
Treasury and trade solutions revenues decreased 7%. 
Excluding the impact of FX translation, revenues 
decreased 5%, primarily driven by declines in EMEA and 
Asia. The decline in revenues was driven by both the cash 
and trade businesses. In the cash business, the decline in 
revenues reflected lower interest rates and a slowdown in 
commercial cards spend driven by the pandemic, partially 
offset by strong deposit volumes. Average deposit 
balances increased 23% (22% excluding the impact of FX 
translation), reflecting strong client engagement and solid 
growth across all regions. In trade, revenues were 
impacted by a decline in trade fees and trade loans, 
reflecting a slowdown in underlying trade flows related to 
the pandemic, partially offset by improved trade spreads.
Corporate lending revenues decreased 15%, including 
lower losses on loan hedges. Excluding the impact of 
losses on loan hedges, revenues decreased 25%, driven by 
lower loan spreads, an adjustment to the residual value of 
a lease financing asset and higher hedging costs, partially 
offset by higher average loan volumes. Average loans 
were up 4%, reflecting higher volumes as the business 

29

•

assisted clients with sourcing liquidity in the evolving 
environment, primarily in the first half of 2020. End-of-
period loans declined 9% in the current year, primarily 
reflecting repayments, as Citi’s clients accessed the 
capital markets, as well as lower loan demand in the 
second half of 2020, given more muted economic activity. 
Private bank revenues increased 9%. Excluding the 
impact of gains on loan hedges, revenues increased 8%, 
reflecting strength across all regions, driven by continued 
solid client engagement, in particular in capital markets, 
higher managed investments revenues and higher loan and 
deposit volumes, partially offset by lower deposit spreads 
due to the low interest rate environment.

Within Markets and securities services:

•

•

Fixed income markets revenues increased 34%. Excluding 
the Tradeweb gain in the prior year, revenues increased 
38%, reflecting strength across all regions, driven by 
strong client activity in rates and currencies, spread 
products and commodities, due to the impact of market 
conditions, including elevated volatility related to the 
pandemic primarily in the first half of the year, and 
developments related to vaccines and the U.S. elections in 
the second half of the year. Non-interest revenues 
increased, reflecting higher corporate and investor 
activity, given elevated volumes, spreads and volatility, 
primarily in the first half the year. Net interest revenues 
also increased, largely reflecting a change in the mix of 
trading positions in support of client activity, as well as 
lower funding costs. 

Rates and currencies revenues increased 32%, 

primarily driven by higher G10 rates and currencies 
revenues in North America and EMEA, as Citi helped 
corporate and investor clients reposition their portfolios in 
a volatile market environment driven by the pandemic 
largely in the first half of 2020. Spread products and other 
fixed income revenues increased 40%, reflecting strong 
client activity following robust primary issuance, 
particularly in flow trading, as well as a more favorable 
market making environment, as evidenced by spread 
tightening. Commodities revenues increased, reflecting a 
more favorable market making environment, as volatility 
remained elevated, particularly in gold and oil. 
Equity markets revenues increased 25%, driven by higher 
revenues in cash equities and derivatives, partially offset 
by a modest decline in prime finance revenues. Cash 
equities revenues increased driven by elevated levels of 
client activity. Equity derivatives revenues increased, 
reflecting strong client activity and continued market 
volatility, particularly in North America. The decline in 
prime finance revenues was largely due to lower 
financing spreads. Non-interest revenues increased, 
primarily driven by higher principal transactions and 
commissions and fee revenues, due to higher client 
activity and a more favorable trading environment due to 
volatility related to the pandemic and developments 

•

related to vaccines and U.S. elections, as well as a change 
in the mix of trading positions in support of client activity.
Securities services revenues decreased 3%. Excluding the 
impact of FX translation, revenues decreased 1%, as 
higher deposit volumes were more than offset by lower 
deposit spreads due to the low interest rate environment.

For additional information on trends in ICG’s deposits 

and trade loans, see “Managing Global Risk—Liquidity Risk
—Loans” and “—Deposits” below. 

Expenses increased 6%, reflecting investments in 

infrastructure, risk management and controls, higher 
compensation costs, operational losses related to certain legal 
matters and volume-driven growth, partially offset by 
efficiency savings. 

Provisions increased to $5.6 billion, driven by net credit 
losses of $987 million (compared to $394 million in the prior 
year), and an ACL build of $4.6 billion (compared to a modest 
build in the prior year under prior accounting standards). The 
increase in net credit losses was largely driven by write-offs 
across various sectors in both North America and EMEA, 
primarily reflecting energy and energy-related exposures. The 
net credit losses were partially offset by the release of 
previously established ACL reserves. 

The increase in the ACL build was driven by builds 
during the first half of 2020. The builds reflected the impact of 
a deterioration in Citi’s macroeconomic outlook under the 
CECL standard, driven by the impact of the pandemic across 
multiple sectors, as well as downgrades in the corporate 
portfolios. Sectors significantly impacted by the pandemic 
(including transportation; commercial real estate; energy and 
energy-related; and consumer retail) drove approximately half 
of the ACL reserve build during 2020. The reserve build also 
included an increase in the qualitative management adjustment 
to reflect the potential for a higher level of stress and a slower 
economic recovery. For additional information on Citi’s ACL 
accounting, see “Significant Accounting Policies and 
Significant Estimates” below and Notes 1 and 15 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

As of December 31, 2020, reserves held on Citi’s balance 
sheet represented 1.4% of funded loans, compared to 0.7% as 
of December 31, 2019, including 4.4% of reserves held against 
the non-investment grade portion.

CORPORATE/OTHER

Corporate/Other includes certain unallocated costs of global staff functions (including finance, risk, human resources, legal and 
compliance), other corporate expenses and unallocated global operations and technology expenses and income taxes, as well as 
Corporate Treasury, certain North America legacy consumer loan portfolios, other legacy assets and discontinued operations (for 
additional information on Corporate/Other, see “Citigroup Segments” above). At December 31, 2020, Corporate/Other had $96 
billion in assets.

“COVID-19 Pandemic Overview” above and “Risk Factors” 
below.

2020 vs. 2019 
Net loss was $1.6 billion, compared to net income of $801 
million in the prior year, largely driven by lower revenues, 
higher expenses, higher cost of credit and higher tax benefits 
in the prior year. The higher tax benefits in the prior year were 
primarily due to higher valuation allowance adjustments on 
Citi’s deferred tax assets. 

Revenues of $54 million decreased $2.0 billion, reflecting 

the impact of lower interest rates, episodic gains in the prior 
year, the wind-down of legacy assets and marks on securities.
Expenses increased 16%, as the wind-down of legacy 
assets was more than offset by investments in infrastructure, 
risk management and controls, the $400 million civil money 
penalty (for additional information, see “Executive Summary” 
and “Citi’s Consent Order Compliance” above) and 
incremental costs associated with the pandemic.

Provisions increased $253 million to $178 million, 
primarily driven by ACL builds of $199 million on legacy 
assets (versus a $67 million release in the prior year under 
prior accounting standards).

The ACL build was driven by builds during the first half 

of 2020 and primarily reflected the impact of a deterioration in 
Citi’s macroeconomic outlook under the CECL standard, 
primarily due to the pandemic. For additional information on 
Citi’s ACL, see “Significant Accounting Policies and

CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Overview
Capital is used principally to support assets in Citi’s 
businesses and to absorb credit, market and operational losses. 
Citi primarily generates capital through earnings from its 
operating businesses. Citi may augment its capital through 
issuances of common stock and noncumulative perpetual 
preferred stock, among other issuances. Further, Citi’s capital 
levels may also be affected by changes in accounting and 
regulatory standards, as well as U.S. corporate tax laws and 
the impact of future events on Citi’s business results, such as 
changes in interest and foreign exchange rates, as well as 
business and asset dispositions.

During 2020, Citi returned a total of $7.2 billion of capital 

to common shareholders in the form of share repurchases 
(approximately 41 million common shares) and dividends. On 
March 15, 2020, Citi announced it had joined other major U.S. 
banks in suspending share repurchases to support clients in 
light of the pandemic. Citi commenced share repurchases in 
February 2021. For additional information, see “Unregistered 
Sales of Equity Securities, Repurchases of Equity Securities 
and Dividends—Equity Security Repurchases” below.

Capital Management
Citi’s capital management framework is designed to ensure 
that Citigroup and its principal subsidiaries maintain sufficient 
capital consistent with each entity’s respective risk profile, 
management targets and all applicable regulatory standards 
and guidelines. Citi assesses its capital adequacy against a 
series of internal quantitative capital goals, designed to 
evaluate its capital levels in expected and stressed economic 
environments. Underlying these internal quantitative capital 
goals are strategic capital considerations, centered on 
preserving and building financial strength. 

The Citigroup Capital Committee, with oversight from the 

Risk Management Committee of Citigroup’s Board of 
Directors, has responsibility for Citi’s aggregate capital 
structure, including the capital assessment and planning 
process, which is integrated into Citi’s capital plan. Balance 
sheet management, including oversight of capital adequacy, 
for Citigroup’s subsidiaries is governed by each entity’s Asset 
and Liability Committee, where applicable. 

For additional information regarding Citi’s capital 

planning and stress testing exercises, see “Stress Testing 
Component of Capital Planning” below.

Current Regulatory Capital Standards
Citi is subject to regulatory capital standards issued by the 
Federal Reserve Board, which constitute the U.S. Basel III 
rules. These rules establish an integrated capital adequacy 
framework, encompassing both risk-based capital ratios and 
leverage ratios.

Risk-Based Capital Ratios
The U.S. Basel III rules set forth the composition of regulatory 
capital (including the application of regulatory capital 
adjustments and deductions), as well as two comprehensive 
methodologies (a Standardized Approach and Advanced 
Approaches) for measuring total risk-weighted assets. Total 
risk-weighted assets under the Advanced Approaches, which 
are primarily models based, include credit, market and 
operational risk-weighted assets. The Standardized Approach 
generally applies prescribed supervisory risk weights to broad 
categories of credit risk exposures. As a result, credit risk-
weighted assets calculated under the Advanced Approaches 
are more risk sensitive than those calculated under the 
Standardized Approach. Market risk-weighted assets are 
currently calculated on a generally consistent basis under both 
approaches. The Standardized Approach excludes operational 
risk-weighted assets.

Under the U.S. Basel III rules, both Citi and Citibank, 

N.A. (Citibank) are required to maintain stated minimum 
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total 
Capital ratios of 4.5%, 6.0% and 8.0%, respectively. Further, 
the U.S. Basel III rules implement the “capital floor provision” 
of the so-called “Collins Amendment” of the Dodd-Frank Act, 
which requires Advanced Approaches banking organizations 
to calculate each of the three risk-based capital ratios 
(Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total 
Capital) under both the U.S. Basel III Standardized Approach 
and the Advanced Approaches and comply with the lower of 
each of the resulting risk-based capital ratios.

Tier 1 Leverage Ratio
Under the U.S. Basel III rules, Citi is also required to maintain 
a minimum Tier 1 Leverage ratio of 4.0%. The Tier 1 
Leverage ratio, a non-risk-based measure of capital adequacy, 
is defined as Tier 1 Capital as a percentage of quarterly 
adjusted average total assets less amounts deducted from Tier 
1 Capital. 

32

Supplementary Leverage Ratio
Citi is also required to calculate a Supplementary Leverage 
ratio, which differs from the Tier 1 Leverage ratio by also 
including certain off-balance sheet exposures within the 
denominator of the ratio (Total Leverage Exposure). The 
Supplementary Leverage ratio represents end of period Tier 1 
Capital to Total Leverage Exposure, with the latter defined as 
the sum of the daily average of on-balance sheet assets for the 
quarter and the average of certain off-balance sheet exposures 
calculated as of the last day of each month in the quarter, less 
applicable Tier 1 Capital deductions. Advanced Approaches 
banking organizations are required to maintain a stated 
minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio of 3.0%.

Further, U.S. GSIBs, including Citi, are subject to 
enhanced Supplementary Leverage ratio standards. The 
enhanced Supplementary Leverage ratio standards establish a 
2.0% leverage buffer in addition to the stated 3.0% minimum 
Supplementary Leverage ratio requirement, for a total 
effective minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio requirement 
of 5.0%. If a U.S. GSIB fails to exceed the 5.0% effective 
minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio requirement, it will 
be subject to increasingly onerous restrictions (depending 
upon the extent of the shortfall) regarding capital distributions 
and discretionary executive bonus payments. 

Temporary Supplementary Leverage Ratio Relief
In April 2020, the Federal Reserve Board issued an interim 
final rule that temporarily changes the calculation of the 
Supplementary Leverage ratio for bank holding companies, 
including Citigroup, by excluding U.S. Treasuries and 
deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from Total Leverage 
Exposure. Repo-style transactions on U.S. Treasuries are not 
in scope for this relief. The Supplementary Leverage ratio is a 
non-risk-sensitive measure, and the temporary exclusion 
allows banking organizations to expand their balance sheet, as 
appropriate, to continue to serve as financial intermediaries 
and to provide credit to households and businesses during the 
pandemic. 

Exposure. Accordingly, the calculation methodology of 
Citibank’s Supplementary Leverage ratio was unchanged.

Regulatory Capital Treatment—Modified Transition of the 
Current Expected Credit Losses Methodology
In September 2020, the U.S. banking agencies issued a final 
rule (substantially unchanged from a March 2020 interim final 
rule) that modifies the regulatory capital transition provision 
related to the current expected credit losses (CECL) 
methodology.

The final rule permits banks to delay for two years the 
“Day One” adverse regulatory capital effects resulting from 
adoption of the CECL methodology on January 1, 2020 until 
January 1, 2022, followed by a three-year transition to phase 
out the regulatory capital benefit provided by the delay.

In addition, for the ongoing impact of CECL, the agencies 

utilize a 25% scaling factor as an approximation of the 
increased reserve build under CECL compared to the previous 
incurred loss model and, therefore, allows banks to add back 
to Common Equity Tier 1 Capital an amount equal to 25% of 
the change in CECL-based allowances recognized through 
earnings in each quarter between January 1, 2020 and 
December 31, 2021. Beginning January 1, 2022, the 
cumulative 25% change in CECL-based allowances 
recognized through earnings between January 1, 2020 and 
December 31, 2021 will be phased in to regulatory capital at 
25% per year on January 1 of each year over the three-year 
transition period, along with the delayed “Day One” impact.

Citigroup and Citibank have elected the modified CECL 
transition provision provided by the rule beginning with the 
quarter ended March 31, 2020. Accordingly, the Day One 
regulatory capital effects resulting from adoption of the CECL 
methodology, as well as the ongoing adjustments for 25% of 
the change in CECL-based allowances recognized through 
earnings in each quarter between January 1, 2020 and 
December 31, 2021, will now commence phase-in on January 
1, 2022 and will be fully reflected in Citi’s regulatory capital 
as of January 1, 2025.

The interim final rule became effective for Citigroup’s 

For additional information on the U.S. banking agencies’ 

original regulatory capital transition provision related to the 
“Day One” adverse regulatory capital effects resulting from 
adoption of the CECL methodology, see “Capital Resources—

Transition of the Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) 
Methodology” in Citi’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

guidance has any impact on U.S. GAAP accounting. 

Supplementary Leverage ratio, as well as for Citigroup’s 
leverage-based Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) and 
Long-Term Debt (LTD) requirements, beginning with the 
quarter ended June 30, 2020, and will continue through March 
31, 2021. Citigroup’s reported Supplementary Leverage ratio 
of 7.0% benefited 109 basis points during the fourth quarter of 
2020 as a result of the temporary relief. Excluding the 
temporary relief, Citigroup’s Supplementary Leverage ratio 
would have been 5.9%, compared with a 5.0% effective 
minimum requirement.

In June 2020, the U.S. banking agencies issued an interim 

final rule permitting depository institutions, including 
Citibank, to elect to temporarily exclude U.S. Treasuries and 
deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from Total Leverage 
Exposure, subject to the condition that the depository 
institution receive approval from its primary federal banking 
regulator prior to paying dividends or making certain other 
capital distributions while the exclusion is in effect. Citibank 
did not elect to temporarily exclude U.S. Treasuries and 
deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from Total Leverage

Regulatory Capital Buffers
Citi and Citibank are required to maintain several regulatory 
capital buffers above stated minimum capital requirements. 
These capital buffers would be available to absorb losses in 
advance of any potential impairment of regulatory capital 
below the stated minimum risk-based capital ratio 
requirements. Any breach of the buffers to absorb losses 
during periods of financial or economic stress would result in 
restrictions on earnings distributions (e.g., dividends, share 
repurchases and discretionary executive bonuses), with the 
degree of such restrictions based upon the extent to which the 
buffers are breached. For additional information regarding 
limitations on capital distributions, see “Use of Regulatory 
Capital Buffers” below. 

Stress Capital Buffer
In March 2020, the Federal Reserve Board issued the final 
Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) rule, integrating the annual stress 
testing requirements with ongoing regulatory capital 
requirements. 

For Citigroup only, the SCB replaces the fixed 2.5% 

Capital Conservation Buffer under the Standardized 
Approach, and equals the peak-to-trough Common Equity Tier 
1 Capital ratio decline under the Supervisory Severely 
Adverse scenario used in the Comprehensive Capital Analysis 
and Review (CCAR) and Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing 
(DFAST), plus four quarters of planned common stock 
dividends, subject to a floor of 2.5%. The fixed 2.5% Capital 
Conservation Buffer will continue to apply under the 
Advanced Approaches. SCB-based minimum capital 
requirements will generally be updated once per year as part of 
the CCAR process. For additional information regarding 
CCAR and DFAST, see “Stress Testing Component of Capital 
Planning” below.

In August 2020, the Federal Reserve Board finalized and 

announced Citi’s SCB requirement of 2.5%. Accordingly, 
effective October 1, 2020, Citigroup is required to maintain a 
10.0% effective minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital 
ratio under the Standardized Approach, which is unchanged 
from Citi’s previous effective minimum requirement Common 
Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio under the Standardized Approach 
inclusive of the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer. 

The Federal Reserve Board may, but is not required to, 

recalculate Citi’s SCB as a result of the capital plan 
resubmission, and has deferred such a decision through March 
31, 2021. For additional information on the capital plan 
resubmission, which the Federal Reserve Board required for 
each firm subject to its capital plan rule, see “Capital Plan 
Resubmission and Related Limitations on Capital 
Distributions” below. 

The SCB applies to Citigroup only. The regulatory capital 

framework applicable to Citibank, including the Capital 
Conservation Buffer, is unchanged by the SCB final rule.

Capital Conservation Buffer and Countercyclical Capital 
Buffer
Citigroup is subject to a fixed 2.5% Capital Conservation 
Buffer under the Advanced Approaches and, prior to the 
October 1, 2020 effective date of the SCB, under the 
Standardized Approach as well. Citibank is subject to the fixed 
2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer under both the Advanced 
Approaches and the Standardized Approach. 

Additionally, Advanced Approaches banking 
organizations, such as Citi and Citibank, are subject to a 
discretionary Countercyclical Capital Buffer. The Federal 
Reserve Board last voted to affirm the Countercyclical Capital 
Buffer amount at the current level of 0% in December 2020.

GSIB Surcharge
The Federal Reserve Board imposes a risk-based capital 
surcharge upon U.S. bank holding companies that are 
identified as global systemically important bank holding 
companies (GSIBs), including Citi. The GSIB surcharge 
augments the SCB, Capital Conservation Buffer and, if 
invoked, any Countercyclical Capital Buffer.

A U.S. bank holding company that is designated a GSIB 
is required, on an annual basis, to calculate a surcharge using 
two methods and is subject to the higher of the resulting two 
surcharges. The first method (“method 1”) is based on the 
Basel Committee’s GSIB methodology. Under the second 
method (“method 2”), the substitutability category under the 
Basel Committee’s GSIB methodology is replaced with a 
quantitative measure intended to assess a GSIB’s reliance on 
short-term wholesale funding. In addition, method 1 
incorporates relative measures of systemic importance across 
certain global banking organizations and a year-end spot 
foreign exchange rate, whereas method 2 uses fixed measures 
of systemic importance and application of an average foreign 
exchange rate over a three-year period. The GSIB surcharges 
calculated under both method 1 and method 2 are based on 
measures of systemic importance from the year immediately 
preceding that in which the GSIB surcharge calculations are 
being performed (e.g., the method 1 and method 2 GSIB 
surcharges to be calculated by December 31, 2021 will be 
based on 2020 systemic indicator data). Generally, Citi’s 
surcharge determined under method 2 will result in a higher 
surcharge than its surcharge determined under method 1.

Should a GSIB’s systemic importance change year-over-

year such that it becomes subject to a higher surcharge, the 
higher surcharge would not become effective for a full year 
(e.g., a higher surcharge calculated by December 31, 2021 
would not become effective until January 1, 2023). However, 
if a GSIB’s systemic importance changes such that the GSIB 
would be subject to a lower surcharge, the GSIB would be 
subject to the lower surcharge beginning with the next 
calendar year (e.g., a lower surcharge calculated by December 
31, 2021 would become effective January 1, 2022).

34

The following table sets forth Citi’s effective GSIB 
surcharge as determined under method 1 and method 2 for 
2020 and 2019:

Method 1

Method 2

2020

2019

 2.0 %

 3.0 

 2.0 %

 3.0 

Citi’s GSIB surcharge effective for both 2020 and 2019 
was 3.0%, as derived under the higher method 2 result. Citi’s 
GSIB surcharge effective for 2021 will remain unchanged at 
3.0%, as derived under the higher method 2 result. Citi expects 
that its method 2 GSIB surcharge will continue to remain 
higher than its method 1 GSIB surcharge. Accordingly, Citi’s 
GSIB surcharge effective for 2022 will not exceed 3.0%. 
Citi’s GSIB surcharge effective for 2023 will likely be based 
on the lower of its method 2 scores for year-end 2020 and 
2021, and could increase to 3.5%.

Use of Regulatory Capital Buffers
In March 2020, the U.S. banking agencies issued a statement 
encouraging banking organizations to use their regulatory 
capital buffers as they respond to the challenges presented by 
the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Consistent with the statement, in October 2020, the U.S. 
banking agencies issued a final rule (substantially unchanged 
from two previous interim final rules in March 2020) that 
eases capital distribution limitations in the original U.S. Basel 
III rules, in an effort to reduce the impact of using regulatory 
capital buffers. The changes in the rule have the potential to 
prevent a complete and sudden cessation of capital 
distributions due to a breach of regulatory capital buffers, 
which include the SCB, Capital Conservation Buffer, GSIB 
surcharge, and any Countercyclical Capital Buffer (currently 
0%). 

The rule became effective in March 2020, and applies to 

risk-based capital ratios, the Supplementary Leverage ratio, 
and RWA-based or leverage-based external TLAC buffers. 
External Long-Term Debt requirements do not include any 
buffers and are, therefore, unaffected by the final rule. For 
additional information on Citi’s TLAC-related requirements, 
see “Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)” and “Risk 
Factors—Compliance, Conduct and Legal Risks” below.

More specifically, under the U.S. Basel III rules, banking 

organizations that fall below their regulatory capital buffers 
are subject to limitations on capital distributions and 
discretionary bonus payments to executive officers based on a 
percentage of “Eligible Retained Income” (ERI), with 
increasing restrictions based upon the severity of the breach. 
The original definition of ERI in the U.S. Basel III rules was 
equal to the bank’s net income for the four calendar quarters 
preceding the current calendar quarter, net of any distributions 
and tax effects not already reflected in net income. The final 
rule revises the definition of ERI to equal the greater of: (i) the 
bank’s net income for the four calendar quarters preceding the 
current calendar quarter, net of any distributions and tax 
effects not already reflected in net income, and (ii) the average 
of the bank’s net income for the four calendar quarters 
preceding the current calendar quarter.

35

As of December 31, 2020, Citi’s regulatory capital ratios 
exceeded effective regulatory minimum requirements. Citi is 
not subject to payout limitations as a result of Basel III 
requirements. For information related to capital distribution 
limitations that are currently in effect for large banks, see 
“Capital Plan Resubmission and Related Limitations on 
Capital Distributions” below.

The impact of the final rule on Citibank is limited, 
because the minimum requirements to be considered “well-
capitalized” under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) 
framework are unchanged.

Prompt Corrective Action Framework
In general, the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) regulations 
direct the U.S. banking agencies to enforce increasingly strict 
limitations on the activities of insured depository institutions 
that fail to meet certain regulatory capital thresholds. The PCA 
framework contains five categories of capital adequacy as 
measured by risk-based capital and leverage ratios: (i) “well 
capitalized,” (ii) “adequately capitalized,” (iii) 
“undercapitalized,” (iv) “significantly undercapitalized” and 
(v) “critically undercapitalized.”

Accordingly, an insured depository institution, such as 
Citibank, must maintain minimum Common Equity Tier 1 
Capital, Tier 1 Capital, Total Capital and Tier 1 Leverage 
ratios of 6.5%, 8.0%, 10.0% and 5.0%, respectively, to be 
considered “well capitalized.” In addition, insured depository 
institution subsidiaries of U.S. GSIBs, including Citibank, 
must maintain a minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio of 
6.0% to be considered “well capitalized.” Citibank was “well 
capitalized” as of December 31, 2020.

Stress Testing Component of Capital Planning
Citi is subject to an annual assessment by the Federal Reserve 
Board as to whether Citigroup has effective capital planning 
processes as well as sufficient regulatory capital to absorb 
losses during stressful economic and financial conditions, 
while also meeting obligations to creditors and counterparties 
and continuing to serve as a credit intermediary. This annual 
assessment includes two related programs: the Comprehensive 
Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and Dodd-Frank Act 
Stress Testing (DFAST).

For the largest and most complex firms, such as Citi, 
CCAR includes a qualitative evaluation of a firm’s abilities to 
determine its capital needs on a forward-looking basis. In 
conducting the qualitative assessment, the Federal Reserve 
Board evaluates firms’ capital planning practices, focusing on 
six areas of capital planning—namely, governance, risk 
management, internal controls, capital policies, incorporating 
stressful conditions and events, and estimating impact on 
capital positions. As part of the CCAR process, the Federal 
Reserve Board evaluates Citi’s capital adequacy, capital 
adequacy process and its planned capital distributions, such as 
dividend payments and common share repurchases. The 
Federal Reserve Board assesses whether Citi has sufficient 
capital to continue operations throughout times of economic 
and financial market stress and whether Citi has robust, 
forward-looking capital planning processes that account for its 
unique risks. 

 
Since firms are now required to maintain risk-based 
capital ratio minimum requirements that integrate stress test 
results, the Federal Reserve Board’s SCB final rule eliminated 
a number of previous CCAR requirements, including the once-
a-year quantitative objection, the pre-approval requirement 
from the Federal Reserve Board for making distributions in 
excess of planned capital actions, and the 30% dividend 
payout ratio as a criterion for heightened supervisory scrutiny.
All CCAR firms, including Citi, are subject to a rigorous 
evaluation of their capital planning process. Firms with weak 
practices may be subject to a deficient supervisory rating, and 
potentially an enforcement action, for failing to meet 
supervisory expectations. For additional information regarding 
CCAR, see “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” below. 

DFAST is a forward-looking quantitative evaluation of 

the impact of stressful economic and financial market 
conditions on Citi’s regulatory capital. This program serves to 
inform the Federal Reserve Board and the general public as to 
how Citi’s regulatory capital ratios might change using a 
hypothetical set of adverse economic conditions as designed 
by the Federal Reserve Board. In addition to the annual 
supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve 
Board, Citi is required to conduct annual company-run stress 
tests under the same adverse economic conditions designed by 
the Federal Reserve Board.

Both CCAR and DFAST include an estimate of projected 
revenues, losses, reserves, pro forma regulatory capital ratios, 
and any other additional capital measures deemed relevant by 
Citi. Projections are required over a nine-quarter planning 
horizon under two supervisory scenarios (baseline and 
severely adverse conditions). All risk-based capital ratios 
reflect application of the Standardized Approach framework 
under the U.S. Basel III rules. Moreover, the Federal Reserve 
Board has deferred the use of the Advanced Approaches 
framework indefinitely.

In addition, Citibank is required to conduct the annual 
Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test. The annual stress test consists of 
a forward-looking quantitative evaluation of the impact of 
stressful economic and financial market conditions under 
several scenarios on Citibank’s regulatory capital. This 
program serves to inform the Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency as to how Citibank’s regulatory capital ratios might 
change during a hypothetical set of adverse economic 
conditions and to ultimately evaluate the reliability of 
Citibank’s capital planning process.

Capital Plan Resubmission and Related Limitations on 
Capital Distributions
In June 2020, the Federal Reserve Board determined that 
changes in financial markets and macroeconomic outlooks 
related to the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material 
effect on the risk profile and financial condition of each firm 
subject to its capital plan rule and, therefore, required updated 
capital plans. Citigroup resubmitted its capital plan in 
November 2020.

In December 2020, the Federal Reserve Board announced
that it was modifying and extending for an additional quarter 
several measures that were previously announced for the third 
and fourth quarters of 2020 to ensure that large banks maintain 
a high level of capital resilience. Through the end of the first 
quarter of 2021, the Federal Reserve Board has authorized 
firms, including Citi, to pay common stock dividends and 
make share repurchases that, in the aggregate, do not exceed 
an amount equal to the average of the firm’s net income for 
the four preceding calendar quarters, unless otherwise 
specified by the Federal Reserve Board, provided that the firm 
does not exceed the amount of common stock dividends paid 
in the second quarter of 2020. Additionally, through the end of 
the first quarter of 2021, the Federal Reserve Board has 
authorized firms to make share repurchases relating to 
issuances of common stock related to employee stock 
ownership plans, and to redeem and make scheduled payments 
on Additional Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital instruments. 
These limitations on capital distributions may be extended or 
modified by the Federal Reserve Board.

On June 29, 2020, Citi announced its planned capital 
actions including common dividends. Citi is permitted to 
return capital to common shareholders of up $2.8 billion 
during the first quarter of 2021, including the previously 
announced common dividends of $0.51 per share in the 
quarter, consistent with the Federal Reserve Board’s income-
based formula for temporary limitations on common dividends 
and common share repurchases announced in December 2020. 
Citi commenced share repurchases in February 2021.

The Federal Reserve Board may, but is not required to, 

recalculate Citi’s SCB as a result of the capital plan 
resubmission, and has deferred such a decision up to March 
31, 2021.

36

Citigroup’s Capital Resources 
Citi is required to maintain stated minimum Common Equity 
Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios of 4.5%, 
6.0% and 8.0%, respectively. Citi’s effective minimum capital 
requirements are presented in the table below.

Furthermore, to be “well capitalized” under current 
federal bank regulatory agency definitions, a bank holding 
company must have a Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 6.0%, a 
Total Capital ratio of at least 10.0% and not be subject to a 
Federal Reserve Board directive to maintain higher capital 
levels.

(1) Beginning October 1, 2020, Citi’s effective minimum risk-based capital requirements include the 2.5% SCB and 3.0% GSIB surcharge under the Standardized 
Approach, and the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer and 3.0% GSIB surcharge under the Advanced Approaches (all of which must be composed of Common 
Equity Tier 1 Capital). For prior periods presented, Citi’s effective minimum risk-based capital requirements include the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer and the 
3.0% GSIB surcharge under both Approaches.

(2) Citi has elected to apply the modified transition provision related to the impact of the CECL accounting standard on regulatory capital, as provided by the U.S. 

banking agencies’ September 2020 final rule. Under the modified CECL transition provision, the changes in retained earnings (after-tax), deferred tax assets 
(DTAs) arising from temporary differences, and the ACL upon the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date have been deferred and will phase in to regulatory capital 
at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022. For the ongoing impact of CECL, Citigroup is allowed to adjust retained earnings and the ACL in an amount equal 
to 25% of the change in the ACL recognized through earnings (pretax) for each period between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021. The cumulative 
adjustments to retained earnings and the ACL between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021 will also phase in to regulatory capital at 25% per year 
commencing January 1, 2022, along with the deferred impacts related to the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date. Corresponding adjustments to average on-
balance sheet assets are reflected in quarterly adjusted average total assets and Total Leverage Exposure. Additionally, the increase in DTAs arising from 
temporary differences upon the January 1, 2020 adoption date has been deducted from risk-weighted assets (RWA) and will phase in to RWA at 25% per year 
commencing January 1, 2022.

(3) Citi’s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios were derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework as of December 31, 
2020 and September 30, 2020, and the Basel III Standardized Approach as of December 31, 2019, whereas Citi’s reportable Total Capital ratio was the lower 
derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework for all periods presented.

(4) Tier 1 Leverage ratio denominator. Represents quarterly average total assets less amounts deducted from Tier 1 Capital. 
(5) Supplementary Leverage ratio denominator. Commencing with the second quarter of 2020, Citigroup’s Total Leverage Exposure temporarily excludes U.S. 

Treasuries and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. For additional information, see “Temporary Supplementary Leverage Ratio Relief” above.

Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio 
Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio was 11.7% at 
December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2020, both under the 
Basel III Advanced Approaches framework. Citi’s reportable 
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio was 11.8% at December 
31, 2019 under the Basel III Standardized Approach. Citi’s 
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio remained unchanged 
from September 30, 2020, as a net increase in risk-weighted 
assets and the return of $1.1 billion capital to common 

shareholders in the form of dividends were offset by quarter-
to-date net income of $4.3 billion. Citi’s Common Equity Tier 
1 Capital ratio decreased from year-end 2019, largely driven 
by a net increase in risk-weighted assets and the return of $7.2 
billion of capital to common shareholders in the form of share 
repurchases and dividends, partially offset by year-to-date net 
income of $11.0 billion, beneficial net movements in AOCI, 
and the relief of the modified CECL transition provision.

(1)

Issuance costs of $156 million and $152 million related to noncumulative perpetual preferred stock outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, are 
excluded from common stockholders’ equity and netted against such preferred stock in accordance with Federal Reserve Board regulatory reporting requirements, 
which differ from those under U.S. GAAP. 

(2) Citi has elected to apply the modified transition provision related to the impact of the CECL accounting standard on regulatory capital, as provided by the U.S. 
banking agencies’ September 2020 final rule. Under the modified CECL transition provision, the changes in retained earnings (after-tax) and the ACL upon the 
January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date have been deferred and will phase in to regulatory capital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022. For the ongoing 
impact of CECL, Citigroup is allowed to adjust retained earnings and the ACL in an amount equal to 25% of the change in the ACL recognized through earnings 
(pretax) for each period between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021. The cumulative adjustments to retained earnings and the ACL between January 1, 2020 
and December 31, 2021 will also phase in to regulatory capital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022, along with the deferred impacts related to the 
January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date.
Includes goodwill “embedded” in the valuation of significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions. 

(3)
(4) Of Citi's $24.8 billion of net DTAs at December 31, 2020, $15.3 billion was includable in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital pursuant to the U.S. Basel III rules, 

while $9.5 billion was excluded. Excluded from Citi's Common Equity Tier 1 Capital as of December 31, 2020 was $11.6 billion of net DTAs arising from net 
operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit tax carry-forwards. The amount excluded was reduced by $2.1 billion of net DTLs primarily 
associated with goodwill and certain other intangible assets that are separately deducted from capital. DTAs arising from tax carry-forwards are required to be 
entirely deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules. DTAs arising from temporary differences are required to be deducted from 
capital only if these DTAs exceed a 10% limitation under the U.S. Basel III rules. Citi’s DTAs do not currently exceed this limitation and, therefore, are not 
subject to deduction from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, but are subject to risk weighting at 250%. 

(5) Represents Citigroup Capital XIII trust preferred securities, which are permanently grandfathered as Tier 1 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules. 
(6) Banking entities are required to be in compliance with the Volcker Rule of the Dodd-Frank Act, which prohibits conducting certain proprietary investment 
activities and limits their ownership of, and relationships with, covered funds. The U.S. agencies issued a revised Volcker Rule 2.0 in November 2019 that 
removes permitted investments in third-party covered funds from capital deduction requirements, among other changes. Upon the removal of the capital 
deduction, permitted investments in third-party covered funds will be included in risk-weighted assets. Mandatory compliance with the revised Volcker Rule 2.0 is 
required by January 1, 2021, with early adoption permitted, in whole or in part, beginning January 1, 2020. Additionally, the U.S. agencies issued a revised 
Volcker Rule 2.1 in July 2020 that improves and streamlines several “covered funds” requirements, with an effective date of October 1, 2020. Citi continues to 
deduct from Tier 1 Capital all permitted ownership interests in covered funds for all periods presented. 

(7) Represents the amount of non-grandfathered trust preferred securities eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules, which will be fully 

phased out of Tier 2 Capital by January 1, 2022.

(8) Under the Advanced Approaches framework, eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent that 
the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets, which differs from the Standardized Approach, in which the ACL is eligible for inclusion in 
Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of credit risk-weighted assets, with any excess ACL being deducted in arriving at credit risk-weighted assets. The total amount of ACL 
that was eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital, subject to limitation, under the Standardized Approach framework was $14.0 billion and $13.9 billion at 
December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 respectively.

(1) Retail exposures decreased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by lower consumer activity in 2020 due to the pandemic.
(2) Wholesale exposures decreased during the three months ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to reductions in commercial loans partially offset by an increase 

in investment securities. Wholesale exposures increased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to increases in investment securities and 
rating downgrades partially offset by annual model parameter updates reflecting Citi’s loss experiences.

(3) Repo-style transactions include repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions as well as securities borrowing and securities lending transactions. Repo-style 

transactions increased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2020, mainly driven by market volatility and volume increases.

(4) OTC derivatives increased during the three months ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in mark-to-market gains for bilateral derivatives. OTC 

derivatives increased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to increases in mark-to-market gains and notional for bilateral derivatives. 

(5) Derivatives CVA increased during the three months ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to new trades with higher credit spreads and sensitivity. Derivatives 

CVA increased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to widening credit spreads and market volatility.

(6) Other exposures include cleared transactions, unsettled transactions, assets other than those reportable in specific exposure categories and non-material portfolios. 
Other exposures increased during the three months and 12 months ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to increases in centrally cleared transactions and 
various other assets. 

(7) Market risk-weighted assets increased during the three months ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to changes in exposures impacting Stressed Value at Risk 
and Securitization charges. Market risk-weighted assets increased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2020 primarily driven by increases in market 
volatility due to the pandemic.

(8) Operational risk-weighted assets increased during the three months December 31, 2020, primarily due to changes in operational loss frequency. Operational risk-

weighted assets decreased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to changes in operational loss severity and frequency.

(1) General credit risk exposures include cash and balances due from depository institutions, securities, and loans and leases. General credit risk exposures increased 
during the three months ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to new accounts and holiday spending for qualifying revolving exposures (cards) partially offset 
by reductions in commercial loans. General credit risk exposures decreased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to lesser spending for 
qualifying revolving (cards) exposures due to the pandemic. 

(2) Repo-style transactions include repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions as well as securities borrowing and securities lending transactions. Repo-style 

transactions increased during the three months and 12 months ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to increases in exposure and volume. 

(3) OTC derivatives increased during the three months ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to an increases in mark-to-market gains for bilateral derivatives. OTC 
derivatives increased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to increases in mark-to-market gains and notional for bilateral derivatives.

(4) Other exposures include cleared transactions, unsettled transactions, and other assets. Other exposures increased during three months ended December 31, 2020 

primarily due to increases in other assets and centrally cleared transactions. Other exposures decreased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2020 primarily 
due to decreases in notional for centrally cleared derivatives and excess of credit reserves not included in Tier 2 capital eligible for RWA reduction.

(5) Off-balance sheet exposures increased during the three months ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to an increase in loan commitments. Off-balance sheet 

exposures decreased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to a decrease in loan commitments.

(6) Market risk-weighted assets increased during the three months ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to changes in exposures impacting Stressed Value at Risk

(1) Represents the daily average of on-balance sheet assets for the quarter.
(2) Citi has elected to apply the modified transition provision related to the impact of the CECL accounting standard on regulatory capital, as provided by the U.S. 
banking agencies’ September 2020 final rule. Under the modified CECL transition provision, the changes in DTAs arising from temporary differences and the 
ACL upon the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date have been deferred and will phase in to regulatory capital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022. For 
the ongoing impact of CECL, Citigroup is allowed to adjust the ACL in an amount equal to 25% of the change in the ACL recognized through earnings (pretax) 
for each period between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021. The cumulative adjustments to the ACL between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021 will 
also phase in to regulatory capital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022, along with the deferred impacts related to the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption 
date. Corresponding adjustments to average on-balance sheet assets are reflected in Total Leverage Exposure.

(3) Commencing with the second quarter of 2020, Citigroup’s Total Leverage Exposure temporarily excludes U.S. Treasuries and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. 

For additional information, see “Temporary Supplementary Leverage Ratio Relief” above. 

(4) Represents the average of certain off-balance sheet exposures calculated as of the last day of each month in the quarter. 
(5) Under the U.S. Basel III rules, banking organizations are required to include in Total Leverage Exposure the effective notional amount of sold credit derivatives, 

with netting of exposures permitted if certain conditions are met. 

(6) Repo-style transactions include repurchase or reverse repurchase transactions as well as securities borrowing or securities lending transactions.

As set forth in the table above, Citigroup’s Supplementary 

Leverage ratio was 7.0% at December 31, 2020, compared to 
6.8% at September 30, 2020 and 6.2% at December 31, 2019. 
The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily driven by an 
increase in Tier 1 Capital resulting from net income and 
beneficial net movements in AOCI, partially offset by an 
increase in both average on-balance sheet assets and average 
off-balance sheet exposures. The year-over-year increase was 
primarily driven by a decrease in Total Leverage Exposure 
mainly attributable to the 109 basis point benefit resulting 
from the Federal Reserve Board’s temporary Supplementary 
Leverage ratio relief.

(1) Citibank’s effective minimum risk-based capital requirements are inclusive of the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer (all of which must be composed of Common 

Equity Tier 1 Capital).

(2) Citibank has elected to apply the modified transition provision related to the impact of the CECL accounting standard on regulatory capital, as provided by the 

U.S. banking agencies’ September 2020 final rule. Under the modified CECL transition provision, the changes in retained earnings (after-tax), deferred tax assets 
(DTAs) arising from temporary differences, and the ACL upon the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date have been deferred and will phase in to regulatory capital 
at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022. For the ongoing impact of CECL, Citibank is allowed to adjust retained earnings and the ACL in an amount equal 
to 25% of the change in the ACL recognized through earnings (pretax) for each period between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021. The cumulative 
adjustments to retained earnings and the ACL between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021 will also phase in to regulatory capital at 25% per year 
commencing January 1, 2022, along with the deferred impacts related to the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date. Corresponding adjustments to average on-
balance sheet assets are reflected in quarterly adjusted average total assets and Total Leverage Exposure. Additionally, the increase in DTAs arising from 
temporary differences upon the January 1, 2020 adoption date has been deducted from risk-weighted assets (RWA) and will phase in to RWA at 25% per year 
commencing January 1, 2022.

(3) Under the Advanced Approaches framework, eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent that 
the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets, which differs from the Standardized Approach in which the ACL is eligible for inclusion in 
Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of credit risk-weighted assets, with any excess ACL being deducted in arriving at credit risk-weighted assets.

(4) Citibank’s reportable Total Capital ratio was derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework as of December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2020, and 
the Basel III Standardized Approach as of December 31, 2019, whereas Citibank’s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios were the 
lower derived under the Basel III Standardized Approach framework for all periods presented.

(5) Citibank must maintain minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital, Total Capital and Tier 1 Leverage ratios of 6.5%, 8.0%, 10.0% and 5.0%, 

respectively, to be considered “well capitalized” under the revised Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) regulations applicable to insured depository institutions as 
established by the U.S. Basel III rules. Citibank must also maintain a minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio of 6.0% to be considered “well capitalized.” 

(6) Tier 1 Leverage ratio denominator. Represents quarterly average total assets less amounts deducted from Tier 1 Capital.
(7) Supplementary Leverage ratio denominator. Citibank did not elect to temporarily exclude U.S. Treasuries and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from Total 

Leverage Exposure. For additional information, see “Temporary Supplementary Leverage Ratio Relief” above.

As indicated in the table above, Citibank’s capital ratios at 

December 31, 2020 were in excess of the stated and effective 
minimum requirements under the U.S. Basel III rules. In 
addition, Citibank was also “well capitalized” as of December 
31, 2020.

Impact of Changes on Citigroup and Citibank Capital Ratios 
The following tables present the estimated sensitivity of 
Citigroup’s and Citibank’s capital ratios to changes of $100 
million in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and 
Total Capital (numerator), and changes of $1 billion in 
Advanced Approaches and Standardized Approach risk-
weighted assets and quarterly adjusted average total assets, as 
well as Total Leverage Exposure (denominator), as of 
December 31, 2020. This information is provided for the 

purpose of analyzing the impact that a change in Citigroup’s 
or Citibank’s financial position or results of operations could 
have on these ratios. These sensitivities only consider a single 
change to either a component of capital, risk-weighted assets, 
quarterly adjusted average total assets or Total Leverage 
Exposure. Accordingly, an event that affects more than one 
factor may have a larger basis point impact than is reflected in 
these tables.

Citigroup Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries
At December 31, 2020, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., a U.S. 
broker-dealer registered with the SEC that is an indirect 
wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, had net capital, 
computed in accordance with the SEC’s net capital rule, of 
$12.7 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement by 
$9.2 billion. 

Moreover, Citigroup Global Markets Limited, a broker-

dealer registered with the United Kingdom’s Prudential 
Regulation Authority (PRA) that is also an indirect wholly 
owned subsidiary of Citigroup, had total capital of $23.5 
billion at December 31, 2020, which exceeded the PRA’s 
minimum regulatory capital requirements. 

In addition, certain of Citi’s other broker-dealer 

subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the countries in which 
they do business, including requirements to maintain specified 
levels of net capital or its equivalent. Citigroup’s other 
principal broker-dealer subsidiaries were in compliance with 
their regulatory capital requirements at December 31, 2020.

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) 
U.S. GSIBs, including Citi, are required to maintain minimum
levels of TLAC and eligible long-term debt (LTD), each set by
reference to the GSIB’s consolidated risk-weighted assets
(RWA) and total leverage exposure.

Minimum External TLAC Requirement
The minimum external TLAC requirement is the greater of (i) 
18% of the GSIB’s RWA plus the then-applicable RWA-based 
TLAC buffer (see below) and (ii) 7.5% of the GSIB’s total 
leverage exposure plus a leverage-based TLAC buffer of 2% 
(i.e., 9.5%).

The RWA-based TLAC buffer equals the 2.5% capital

conservation buffer, plus any applicable countercyclical
capital buffer (currently 0%), plus the GSIB’s capital
surcharge as determined under method 1 of the GSIB
surcharge rule (2.0% for Citi for 2020). Accordingly, Citi’s
total current minimum TLAC requirement was 22.5% of 
RWA for 2020.

Minimum LTD Requirement
The minimum LTD requirement is the greater of (i) 6% of the 
GSIB’s RWA plus its capital surcharge as determined under 
method 2 of the GSIB surcharge rule (3.0% for Citi for 2020), 
for a total current requirement of 9% of RWA for Citi, and (ii) 
4.5% of the GSIB’s total leverage exposure.

The table below details Citi’s eligible external TLAC and
LTD amounts and ratios, and each effective minimum TLAC 
and LTD ratio requirement, as well as the surplus amount in 
dollars in excess of each requirement.

(3)  Commencing with the second quarter of 2020, Citigroup’s Total 

Leverage Exposure temporarily excludes U.S. Treasuries and deposits at 
Federal Reserve Banks. 

As of December 31, 2020, Citi exceeded each of the
minimum TLAC and LTD requirements, resulting in a $27
billion surplus above its binding TLAC requirement of LTD as
a percentage of Advanced Approaches risk-weighted assets.

Regulatory Capital Standards Developments

U.S. Banking Agencies

TLAC Holdings
In January 2021, the U.S. banking agencies issued a final rule 
that creates a new regulatory capital deduction applicable to 
Advanced Approaches banking organizations for certain 
investments in covered debt instruments issued by GSIBs. The 
final rule is substantially consistent with an April 2019 
proposal, and is intended to reduce interconnectedness and 
systemic risk by creating an incentive for Advanced 
Approaches banking organizations to limit their exposure to 
GSIBs.

Under the U.S. Basel III rules, non-significant 
investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial 
institutions are subject to deduction from regulatory capital 
using the corresponding deduction approach if, in the 
aggregate, they exceed 10% of the banking organization’s 
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. Non-significant investments 
in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions that are 
not deducted from regulatory capital are risk weighted in the 
usual manner.

Under the final rule, an investment in a “covered debt 
instrument” will be treated as an investment in a Tier 2 Capital 
instrument and, therefore, will be subject to deduction from 
the Advanced Approaches banking organization’s own Tier 2 
Capital in accordance with the existing rules for non-
significant investments in unconsolidated financial 
institutions. Covered debt instruments include unsecured debt 
instruments that are “eligible debt securities” for purposes of 
the TLAC rule, or that are pari passu or subordinated to such 
securities, in addition to certain unsecured debt instruments 
issued by foreign GSIBs. 

To support a deep and liquid market for covered debt 
instruments, the rule provides an exception from the approach 
described above for covered debt instruments held for market-
making activities for 30 days or less (or longer, for synthetic 
exposures only), if the aggregate amount of such debt 
instruments does not exceed 5% of the banking organization’s 
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. 

Additionally, the final rule requires banking organizations 
to deduct from Tier 2 Capital investments in their own covered 
debt instruments.

The final rule will become effective for Citigroup and 
Citibank on April 1, 2021. Citi estimates that the final rule will 
not significantly impact Citigroup or Citibank’s regulatory 
capital upon adoption.

Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk
In January 2020, the U.S. banking agencies issued a final
rule to introduce the Standardized Approach for
Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR) in the U.S. The
mandatory compliance date of the SA-CCR final rule is
January 1, 2022, and early adoption was originally
permitted beginning April 1, 2020. For additional
information on the SA-CCR final rule, see “Capital
Resources—Regulatory Capital Standards Developments”
in Citi’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In March 2020, the U.S. banking agencies issued an
interim final rule permitting banks to early adopt the SA-CCR 
final rule beginning with the quarter ended March 31,
2020.

Citi has not early adopted the SA-CCR final rule. Citi 

intends to implement SA-CCR upon the mandatory 
compliance date of January 1, 2022.

Basel Committee 

Deferral of Basel III Revisions
In April 2020, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel
Committee) announced that the implementation date of the
Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms finalized in
December 2017 has been deferred by one year to January 1,
2023. The reforms relate to the methodologies in deriving
credit and operational risk-weighted assets, the imposition
of a new aggregate output floor for risk-weighted assets,
and revisions to the leverage ratio framework. The Basel 
Committee also announced that the implementation date of
the revised market risk framework finalized in January
2019 has been deferred by one year to January 1, 2023.

The U.S. banking agencies may revise the U.S. Basel

III rules in the future, in response to the Basel Committee’s
Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms and revised market
risk framework.

Targeted Revisions to the Credit Valuation Adjustment
Framework
In July 2020, the Basel Committee issued a standard with 
targeted revisions to the credit valuation adjustment (CVA) 
risk framework, which was previously finalized in December 
2017 and will become effective on January 1, 2023. The 
revisions align the revised CVA risk framework, in part, with 
the revised market risk capital framework that was finalized in 
January 2019. The Basel Committee also adjusted the overall 
calibration of capital requirements calculated under their CVA 
risk framework.

The U.S. agencies may consider revisions to the CVA risk

framework under the U.S. Basel III rules in the future, based
upon the revisions adopted by the Basel Committee.

Tangible Common Equity, Book Value Per Share, 
Tangible Book Value Per Share and Returns on Equity
Tangible common equity (TCE), as defined by Citi, represents 
common stockholders’ equity less goodwill and identifiable 
intangible assets (other than MSRs). Other companies may 
calculate TCE in a different manner. TCE, tangible book value 
(TBV) per share and returns on average TCE are non-GAAP 
financial measures. Citi believes the presentation of TCE, 
TBV per share and returns on average TCE provides alternate 
measures of capital strength and performance for investors, 
industry analysts and others.

RISK FACTORS

The following discussion sets forth what management 
currently believes could be the material risks and uncertainties 
that could impact Citi’s businesses, results of operations and 
financial condition. Other risks and uncertainties, including 
those not currently known to Citi or its management, could 
also negatively impact Citi’s businesses, results of operations 
and financial condition. Thus, the following should not be 
considered a complete discussion of all of the risks and 
uncertainties Citi may face.

STRATEGIC RISKS
Rapidly Evolving Challenges and Uncertainties Related to 
the COVID-19 Pandemic Will Likely Continue to Have 
Negative Impacts on Citi’s Businesses and Results of 
Operations and Financial Condition. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has become global, affecting all of 
the countries and jurisdictions where Citi operates. The 
pandemic and responses to it have had, and will likely 
continue to have, severe impacts on global health and 
economic conditions. These impacts will continue to evolve 
by region, country or state, largely depending on the duration 
and severity of the public health consequences, including the 
duration and further spread of the coronavirus; the potential 
for new variants of the virus; timely development, production 
and distribution of effective vaccines; availability of 
therapeutics; public response; and government actions. The 
impacts to global economic conditions include, among others: 

•

•

•

•
•
•

the institution of social distancing and restrictions on 
businesses and the movement of the public in and among 
the U.S. and other countries;
closures, reduced activity and failures of many businesses, 
leading to loss of revenues and net losses; 
sharply reduced U.S. and global economic output, 
resulting in significant losses of employment and lower 
consumer spending, cards purchase sales and loan 
volumes; 
lower interest rates; 
disruption of global supply chains; and
significant disruption and volatility in financial markets. 

The pandemic has had, and will likely continue to have, 

negative impacts on Citi’s businesses and overall results of 
operations and financial condition, which could be material. 
The extent of the impact on Citi’s operations and financial 
performance, including its ability to execute its business 
strategies and initiatives, will continue to depend significantly 
on future developments in the U.S. and globally, which are 
uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the course of the 
virus, as well as any delay or weakness in the economic 
recovery or further economic downturn. 

Ongoing legislative and regulatory changes in the U.S. 

and globally to address the economic impact from the 
pandemic, such as consumer and corporate relief measures and 
continued lower interest rates, could further affect Citi’s 
businesses, operations and financial performance. Citi could 
also face challenges, including legal and reputational, and 
scrutiny in its implementation of and ongoing efforts to 

49

provide these relief measures. Such implementations and 
efforts have resulted in, and may continue to result in, 
litigation, including class actions, and regulatory and 
government actions and proceedings. Such actions may result 
in judgments, settlements, penalties and fines adverse to Citi. 
In addition, the different types of government actions could 
vary in scale and duration across jurisdictions and regions with 
varying degrees of effectiveness. 

The impact of the pandemic on Citi’s consumer and 
corporate borrowers will also vary by sector or industry, with 
some borrowers experiencing greater stress levels, which 
could lead to increased pressure on their results of operations 
and financial condition, increased borrowings or credit ratings 
downgrades, thus likely leading to higher credit costs for Citi. 
In addition, stress levels ultimately experienced by Citi’s 
borrowers may be different from and more intense than 
assumptions made in earlier estimates or models used by Citi, 
resulting in a further increase in Citi’s ACL or net credit 
losses, particularly as consumer and small business relief 
programs expire and the benefits of fiscal stimulus start to 
diminish. 

The pandemic may not be contained for an extended 
period of time. A prolonged health crisis could further reduce 
economic activity in the U.S. and other countries, resulting in 
additional declines in employment and business and consumer 
confidence. These factors could further negatively impact 
global economic activity and markets; cause a continued 
decline in the demand for Citi’s products and services and in 
its revenues; further increase Citi’s credit and other costs; and 
may result in impairment of long-lived assets or goodwill. 
These factors could also cause a continued increase in Citi’s 
balance sheet, risk-weighted assets and ACL, resulting in a 
decline in regulatory capital ratios or liquidity measures, as 
well as regulatory demands for higher capital levels and/or 
limitations or reductions in capital distributions (such as 
common share repurchases and dividends). Moreover, any 
disruption or failure of Citi’s performance of, or its ability to 
perform, key business functions, as a result of the continued 
spread of COVID-19 or otherwise, could adversely affect 
Citi’s operations. 

Any disruption to, breaches of or attacks on Citi’s 
information technology systems, including from cyber 
incidents, could have adverse effects on Citi’s businesses (see 
the operational processes and systems and cybersecurity risk 
factors below). These systems are supporting a substantial 
portion of Citi’s colleagues who have been affected by local 
pandemic restrictions and have been forced to work remotely. 
In addition, these systems interface with and depend on third-
party systems, and Citi could experience service denials or 
disruptions if demand for such systems were to exceed 
capacity or if a third-party system fails or experiences any 
interruptions. Citi has also taken measures to maintain the 
health and safety of its colleagues; however, these measures 
could result in increased expenses, and widespread illness 
could negatively affect staffing within certain functions, 
businesses or geographies. In addition, Citi’s ability to recruit, 
hire and onboard colleagues in key areas could be negatively 
impacted by global pandemic restrictions (see the qualified 
colleagues risk factor below). 

Further, it is unclear how the macroeconomic business 

environment or societal norms may be impacted after the 
pandemic. The post-pandemic environment may undergo 
unexpected developments or changes in financial markets, the 
fiscal, monetary, tax and regulatory environments and 
consumer customer and corporate client behavior. These 
developments and changes could have an adverse impact on 
Citi’s results of operations and financial condition. Ongoing 
business and regulatory uncertainties and changes may make 
Citi’s longer-term business, balance sheet and strategic and 
budget planning more difficult or costly. Citi and its 
management and businesses may also experience increased or 
different competitive and other challenges in this environment. 
To the extent that it is not able to adapt or compete effectively, 
Citi could experience loss of business and its results of 
operations and financial condition could suffer (see the 
competitive challenges risk factor below). 

For additional information about trends, uncertainties and 
risks related to the pandemic, as well as Citi’s management of 
pandemic-related risks, see “COVID-19 Pandemic Overview” 
above.

Citi’s Ability to Return Capital to Common Shareholders 
Consistent with Its Capital Planning Efforts and Targets 
Substantially Depends on Regulatory Capital Requirements, 
Including the Results of the CCAR Process and Regulatory 
Stress Tests. 
Citi’s ability to return capital to its common shareholders 
consistent with its capital planning efforts and targets, whether 
through its common stock dividend or through a share 
repurchase program, substantially depends, among other 
things, on regulatory capital requirements, including the Stress 
Capital Buffer (SCB), which is based upon the results of the 
CCAR process required by the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) 
as well as the supervisory stress tests required under the Dodd-
Frank Act (as described in more detail below). Citi’s ability to 
return capital also depends on its results of operations and 
financial condition, forecasts of macroeconomic conditions 
and effectiveness in managing its level of risk-weighted assets 
under both the Advanced Approaches and the Standardized 
Approach, Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) and global 
systemically important bank holding company (GSIB) 
surcharge, which has been made more challenging due to the 
pandemic-related elevated levels of liquidity in the financial 
system (see macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties risk 
factor below). 

Citi’s ability to accurately predict, interpret or explain to 

stakeholders the results of the CCAR process, and thus to 
address any market or investor perceptions, may be limited as 
the FRB’s assessment of Citi’s capital adequacy is conducted 
using the FRB’s proprietary stress test models. In addition, all 
CCAR firms, including Citi, will continue to be subject to a 
rigorous evaluation of their capital planning practices, 
including, but not limited to, governance, risk management 
and internal controls. For additional information on limitations 
on Citi’s ability to return capital to common shareholders, as 
well as the CCAR process, supervisory stress test 
requirements and GSIB surcharge, see “Capital Resources—
Overview” and “Capital Resources—Stress Testing 

Component of Capital Planning” above and the risk 
management risk factor below. 

The FRB has stated that it expects leading capital 
adequacy practices to continue to evolve and to likely be 
determined by the FRB each year as a result of its cross-firm 
review of capital plan submissions. Similarly, the FRB has 
indicated that, as part of its stated goal to continually evolve 
its annual stress testing requirements, several parameters of 
the annual stress testing process may continue to be altered, 
including the severity of the stress test scenario, the FRB 
modeling of Citi’s balance sheet pre-provision net revenue 
(PPNR) and stress losses, and the addition of components 
deemed important by the FRB. 

Beginning January 1, 2022, Citi will be required to phase 
into regulatory capital at 25% per year the changes in retained 
earnings, deferred tax assets and ACL determined upon the 
January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date as well as subsequent 
changes in the ACL between January 1, 2020 and December 
31, 2021. The FRB has stated that it plans to maintain its 
current framework for calculating allowances on loans in the 
supervisory stress test for the 2021 supervisory stress test 
cycle, and to evaluate appropriate future enhancements to this 
framework as best practices for implementing the current 
expected credit losses (CECL) methodology are developed. 
The impacts on Citi’s capital adequacy of the FRB’s 
incorporation of CECL in its supervisory stress tests on an 
ongoing basis, and of other potential regulatory changes in the 
FRB’s stress testing methodologies, remain unclear. For 
additional information regarding the CECL methodology, 
including the transition provisions related to the adverse 
regulatory capital effects resulting from adoption of the CECL 
methodology, see “Capital Resources—Current Regulatory 
Capital Standards—Regulatory Capital Treatment—Modified 
Transition of the Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) 
Methodology” above and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements. 

In addition, the FRB has integrated the annual stress 

testing requirements with ongoing regulatory capital 
requirements. For Citigroup, the SCB rule replaced the fixed 
2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer in Citi’s ongoing regulatory 
capital requirements for the Standardized Approach capital 
ratios. The SCB equals the maximum decline in Citi’s 
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio under a severely adverse 
scenario over a nine-quarter CCAR measurement period, plus 
four quarters of planned common stock dividends, subject to a 
minimum requirement of 2.5%. Effective October 1, 2020, 
Citi’s SCB was 2.5%. The SCB is calculated by the FRB using 
its proprietary data and modeling of each firm’s results. 
Accordingly, Citi’s SCB may change annually, or possibly 
more frequently, based on the supervisory stress test results, 
thus potentially resulting in volatility in the calculation of the 
SCB. Similar to the Capital Conservation Buffer, a breach of 
the SCB would result in graduated limitations on capital 
distributions. For additional information on the SCB, 
including its calculation, see “Capital Resources—Regulatory 
Capital Buffers” above. 

Although various uncertainties exist regarding the extent 
of, and the ultimate impact to Citi from, these changes to the 
FRB’s stress testing and CCAR regimes, these changes could 
increase the level of capital Citi is required or elects to hold, 

50

including as part of Citi’s management buffer, thus potentially 
impacting the extent to which Citi is able to return capital to 
shareholders. 

Citi, Its Management and Its Businesses Must Continually 
Review, Analyze and Successfully Adapt to Ongoing 
Regulatory and Legislative Uncertainties and Changes in the 
U.S. and Globally. 
Despite the adoption of final regulations and laws in numerous 
areas impacting Citi and its businesses over the past several 
years, Citi, its management and its businesses continually face 
ongoing regulatory and legislative uncertainties and changes, 
both in the U.S. and globally. While the areas of ongoing 
regulatory and legislative uncertainties and changes facing Citi 
are too numerous to list completely, various examples include, 
but are not limited to (i) potential fiscal, monetary, regulatory, 
tax and other changes arising from the U.S. federal 
government and other governments, including as a result of 
the new U.S. presidential administration, regulatory leadership 
and Congress or in response to the pandemic; (ii) potential 
changes to various aspects of the regulatory capital framework 
and requirements applicable to Citi (see the capital return risk 
factor and “Capital Resources—Regulatory Capital Standards 
Developments” above); and (iii) the future legislative and 
regulatory framework resulting from the U.K.’s exit from the 
European Union (EU), including, among others, with respect 
to financial services (see “Managing Global Risk—Strategic 
Risk—U.K.’s Future Relationship with the EU” below). When 
referring to “regulatory,” Citi is including both formal 
regulation and the views and expectations of its regulators in 
their supervisory roles. 

Ongoing regulatory and legislative uncertainties and 
changes make Citi’s and its management’s long-term business, 
balance sheet and strategic budget planning difficult, subject 
to change and potentially more costly. U.S. and other 
regulators globally have implemented and continue to discuss 
various changes to certain regulatory requirements, which 
would require ongoing assessment by management as to the 
impact to Citi, its businesses and business planning. For 
example, while the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms and 
revised market risk framework have been finalized at the 
international level, there remain significant uncertainties with 
respect to the integration of these revisions into the U.S. 
regulatory capital framework. Business planning is required to 
be based on possible or proposed rules or outcomes, which can 
change dramatically upon finalization, or upon 
implementation or interpretive guidance from numerous 
regulatory bodies worldwide, and such guidance can change. 

Moreover, U.S. and international regulatory and 
legislative initiatives have not always been undertaken or 
implemented on a coordinated basis, and areas of divergence 
have developed and continue to develop with respect to the 
scope, interpretation, timing, structure or approach, leading to 
inconsistent or even conflicting requirements, including within 
a single jurisdiction. For example, in May 2019, the European 
Commission adopted, as part of Capital Requirements 
Directive V (CRD V), a new requirement for major banking 
groups headquartered outside the EU (which would include 
Citi) to establish an intermediate EU holding company where 
the foreign bank has two or more institutions (broadly 

51

meaning banks, broker-dealers and similar financial firms) 
established in the EU. While in some respects the requirement 
mirrors an existing U.S. requirement for non-U.S. banking 
organizations to form U.S. intermediate holding companies, 
the implementation of the EU holding company requirement 
could lead to additional complexity with respect to Citi’s 
resolution planning, capital and liquidity allocation and 
efficiency in various jurisdictions.

Regulatory and legislative changes have also significantly 

increased Citi’s compliance risks and costs (see the 
implementation and interpretation of regulatory changes risk 
factor below). 

Citi’s Continued Investments and Efficiency Initiatives May 
Not Be as Successful as It Projects or Expects. 
Citi continues to leverage its scale and make incremental 
investments to deepen client relationships, increase revenues 
and lower expenses, as well as significant investments to 
transform its infrastructure, risk management and controls and 
further enhance safety and soundness (for additional 
information, see the legal and regulatory proceedings risk 
factor below). For example, Citi continues to make 
investments to enhance its digital capabilities across the 
franchise, including digital platforms and mobile and cloud-
based solutions. Citi also has been making investments across 
the firm, such as in the U.S. consumer franchise, Citi’s wealth 
management businesses and treasury and trade solutions, 
securities services and other businesses in ICG, including 
implementing new capabilities and partnerships. Further, Citi 
has been pursuing efficiency improvements through various 
technology and digital initiatives, organizational simplification 
and location strategies. 

Citi’s investments and efficiency initiatives are being 
undertaken as part of its overall strategy to meet operational 
and financial objectives, including, among others, those 
relating to shareholder returns. Additionally, in connection 
with Citi’s CEO transition, Citi is undergoing an evaluation of 
its strategy, which may result in, among other things, 
additional investments as well as changes in or exits of 
businesses. There is no guarantee that these or other initiatives 
Citi may pursue will be as productive or effective as Citi 
expects, or at all. Additionally, such initiatives could result in 
losses, charges or other negative financial impacts. Citi’s 
investment and efficiency initiatives may continue to evolve as 
its business strategies, the market environment and regulatory 
expectations change, which could make the initiatives more 
costly and more challenging to implement, and limit their 
effectiveness. Moreover, Citi’s ability to achieve expected 
returns on its investments and costs savings depends, in part, 
on factors that it cannot control, such as macroeconomic 
conditions, including the negative impacts related to the 
pandemic, customer, client and competitor actions and 
ongoing regulatory changes, among others. 

Uncertainties Regarding the Transition Away from or 
Discontinuance of the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate 
(LIBOR) or Any Other Interest Rate Benchmark Could 
Have Adverse Consequences for Market Participants, 
Including Citi.
LIBOR continues to be widely used as a “benchmark” or 
“reference rate” across financial products and markets 

globally. Based on statements from U.S. and U.K. authorities, 
it is expected, however, that all non-U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors 
and some USD LIBOR tenors will cease after December 31, 
2021, while most U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors will continue to be 
quoted through June 2023. As a result of LIBOR’s wide use, 
there can be no assurance that market participants, including 
Citi, will be able to successfully modify all outstanding 
LIBOR-based securities or products or be sufficiently 
prepared for all of the uncertainties resulting from LIBOR’s 
discontinuance. In addition, following guidance provided by 
the Financial Stability Board, regulators have suggested 
reforming or replacing other benchmark rates with alternative 
reference rates. The transition away from and discontinuance 
of LIBOR or any other benchmark rate presents various 
uncertainties, risks and challenges to holders of LIBOR-based 
securities and products as well as financial markets and 
institutions, including Citi. These include, among others, the 
pricing, liquidity, value of, return on and market for financial 
instruments and contracts that reference LIBOR or any other 
benchmark rate, including any alternative benchmark rate. 
Despite ongoing actions by Citi to prepare for the 
transition away from LIBOR (see “Managing Global Risk—
Strategic Risk—LIBOR Transition Risk” below), Citi has 
continued to meet market demand by trading, holding or 
otherwise using a substantial amount of securities or products 
that reference LIBOR, including, among others, derivatives, 
corporate loans, commercial and residential mortgages, credit 
cards, securitized products and other structured securities. The 
transition away from and discontinuation of LIBOR for these 
securities and products presents significant operational, legal, 
reputational or compliance, financial and other risks to Citi. 
For example, the LIBOR transition presents various 

challenges related to contractual mechanics of existing 
floating rate financial instruments and contracts that reference 
LIBOR and mature after discontinuance of the relevant 
LIBOR. Certain of these legacy instruments and contracts do 
not provide for alternative benchmark rates, which makes it 
unclear what the future benchmark rates would be after 
LIBOR’s cessation. Further, Citi may not be able to amend 
certain instruments and contracts due to an inability to obtain 
sufficient required consent from counterparties or security 
holders. Even if the instruments and contracts provide for a 
transition to alternative benchmark rates, the new benchmark 
rates may, particularly in times of financial stress, significantly 
differ from the prior rates. As a result, Citi may need to 
proactively address any contractual uncertainties or rate 
differences in such instruments and contracts, which would 
likely be both time consuming and costly, and may not 
ultimately be successful. 

In addition, the transition away from and discontinuance 

of LIBOR could result in disputes, including litigation, 
involving holders of outstanding instruments and contracts 
that reference LIBOR, whether or not the underlying 
documentation provides for alternative benchmark rates. Citi 
will also need to further invest in and develop significant 
internal systems and infrastructure to transition to alternative 
benchmark rates to manage its businesses and support its 
clients. 

Citi’s Ability to Utilize Its DTAs, and Thus Reduce the 
Negative Impact of the DTAs on Citi’s Regulatory Capital, 
Will Be Driven by Its Ability to Generate U.S. Taxable 
Income. 
At December 31, 2020, Citi’s net DTAs were $24.8 billion, 
net of a valuation allowance of $5.2 billion, of which $9.5 
billion was excluded from Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 
Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules, primarily relating to net 
operating losses, foreign tax credit and general business credit 
carry-forwards (for additional information, see “Capital 
Resources—Components of Citigroup Capital” above). Of the 
net DTAs at December 31, 2020, $4.4 billion related to 
foreign tax credit carry-forwards (FTCs), net of a valuation 
allowance. The carry-forward utilization period for FTCs is 
ten years and represents the most time-sensitive component of 
Citi’s DTAs. The FTC carry-forwards at December 31, 2020 
expire over the period of 2021–2029. Citi must utilize any 
FTCs generated in the then-current-year tax return prior to 
utilizing any carry-forward FTCs. 

The accounting treatment for realization of DTAs, 

including FTCs, is complex and requires significant judgment 
and estimates regarding future taxable earnings in the 
jurisdictions in which the DTAs arise and available tax 
planning strategies. Forecasts of future taxable earnings will 
depend upon various factors, including, among others, the 
continued impact of the pandemic and other macroeconomic 
conditions. In addition, any future increase in U.S. corporate 
tax rates could result in an increase in Citi’s DTA, which may 
subject more of Citi’s existing DTA to exclusion from 
regulatory capital while improving Citi’s ability to utilize its 
FTC carry-forwards. Citi’s overall ability to realize its DTAs 
will primarily be dependent upon its ability to generate U.S. 
taxable income in the relevant tax carry-forward periods. 
Although utilization of FTCs in any year is generally limited 
to 21% of foreign source taxable income in that year, overall 
domestic losses (ODL) that Citi has incurred in the past allow 
it to reclassify domestic source income as foreign source. 
Failure to realize any portion of the net DTAs would have a 
corresponding negative impact on Citi’s net income and 
financial returns. 

Citi does not expect to be subject to the Base Erosion 

Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT), which, if applicable to Citi in any 
given year, would have a significantly adverse effect on both 
Citi’s net income and regulatory capital. 

For additional information on Citi’s DTAs, including 

FTCs, see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant 
Estimates—Income Taxes” below and Notes 1 and 9 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Citi’s Interpretation or Application of the Complex Tax 
Laws to Which It Is Subject Could Differ from Those of the 
Relevant Governmental Authorities, Which Could Result in 
the Payment of Additional Taxes, Penalties or Interest. 
Citi is subject to various income-based tax laws of the U.S. 
and its states and municipalities, as well as the numerous non-
U.S. jurisdictions in which it operates. These tax laws are 
inherently complex and Citi must make judgments and 
interpretations about the application of these laws, including 
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform), to its entities, 
operations and businesses. In addition, Citi is subject to 

52

litigation or examinations with U.S. and non-U.S. tax 
authorities regarding non-income-based tax matters. Citi’s 
interpretations or application of the tax laws, including with 
respect to Tax Reform, withholding, stamp, service and other 
non-income taxes, could differ from that of the relevant 
governmental taxing authority, which could result in the 
requirement to pay additional taxes, penalties or interest, 
which could be material. For additional information on the 
litigation and examinations involving non-U.S. tax authorities, 
see Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Citi’s Presence in the Emerging Markets Subjects It to 
Various Risks as well as Increased Compliance and 
Regulatory Risks and Costs. 
During 2020, emerging markets revenues accounted for 
approximately 34% of Citi’s total revenues (Citi generally 
defines emerging markets as countries in Latin America, Asia 
(other than Japan, Australia and New Zealand), and central 
and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa in EMEA). 
Although Citi continues to pursue its target client strategy, 
Citi’s presence in the emerging markets subjects it to various 
risks, such as limitations of hedges on foreign investments; 
foreign currency volatility, including devaluations, sovereign 
volatility, election outcomes, regulatory changes and political 
events; foreign exchange controls; limitations on foreign 
investment; sociopolitical instability (including from 
hyperinflation); fraud; nationalization or loss of licenses; 
business restrictions; sanctions or asset freezes; potential 
criminal charges; closure of branches or subsidiaries; and 
confiscation of assets, and these risks can be exacerbated in 
the event of a deterioration in relationships between the U.S. 
and an emerging market country. For example, Citi operates in 
several countries that have, or have had in the past, strict 
capital and currency controls, such as Argentina, that limit its 
ability to convert local currency into U.S. dollars and/or 
transfer funds outside of those countries (for further 
information, see “Strategic Risk—Country Risk—Argentina” 
below). 

Moreover, if the economic situation in an emerging 
markets country where Citi operates were to deteriorate below 
a certain level, U.S. regulators may impose mandatory loan 
loss or other reserve requirements on Citi, which would 
increase its credit costs and decrease its earnings (for further 
information, see “Strategic Risk—Country Risk—Argentina” 
below). In addition, political turmoil and instability have 
occurred in certain regions and countries, including Asia, the 
Middle East and Latin America, which have required, and may 
continue to require, management time and attention and other 
resources (such as monitoring the impact of sanctions on 
certain emerging markets economies as well as impacting 
Citi’s businesses and results of operations in affected 
countries). 

Citi’s emerging markets presence also increases its 

compliance and regulatory risks and costs. For example, Citi’s 
operations in emerging markets, including facilitating cross-
border transactions on behalf of its clients, subject it to higher 
compliance risks under U.S. regulations that are primarily 
focused on various aspects of global corporate activities, such 
as anti-money laundering regulations and the Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act. These risks can be more acute in less developed 

53

markets and thus require substantial investment in compliance 
infrastructure or could result in a reduction in certain of Citi’s 
business activities. Any failure by Citi to comply with 
applicable U.S. regulations, as well as the regulations in the 
countries and markets in which it operates as a result of its 
global footprint, could result, even if the regulations require 
inconsistent results, in legal or regulatory proceedings, fines, 
penalties, injunctions or other similar restrictions, many of 
which could negatively impact Citi’s results of operations and 
reputation (see the implementation and interpretation of 
regulatory changes and legal and regulatory proceedings risk 
factors below). 

A Deterioration in or Failure to Maintain Citi’s Co- 
Branding or Private Label Credit Card Relationships, 
Including as a Result of Any Bankruptcy or Liquidation, 
Could Have a Negative Impact on Citi’s Results of 
Operations or Financial Condition. 
Citi has co-branding and private label relationships through its 
Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services credit card 
businesses with various retailers and merchants globally, 
whereby in the ordinary course of business Citi issues credit 
cards to customers of the retailers or merchants. Citi’s co-
branding and private label agreements provide for shared 
economics between the parties and generally have a fixed 
term. The five largest relationships across both businesses in 
North America GCB constituted an aggregate of 
approximately 10% of Citi’s revenues in 2020 (for additional 
information, see “Global Consumer Banking—North America 
GCB” above). 

Over the last several years, a number of U.S. retailers 

have continued to experience declining sales, which has 
resulted in significant numbers of store closures and, in a 
number of cases, bankruptcies, as retailers attempt to cut costs 
and reorganize. The pandemic has exacerbated these trends
and generally resulted in a challenging operating environment
for retailers and merchants. In addition, as has been widely 
reported, competition among card issuers, including Citi, for 
these relationships is significant, and it has become 
increasingly difficult in recent years to maintain such 
relationships on the same terms or at all. 

Citi’s co-branding and private label relationships could 
continue to be negatively impacted by, among other things, the 
general economic environment; declining sales and revenues, 
partner store closures, government imposed restrictions, 
reduced air and business travel, or other operational 
difficulties of the retailer or merchant; termination due to a 
contractual breach by Citi or by the retailer or merchant; or 
other factors, including bankruptcies, liquidations, 
restructurings, consolidations or other similar events, whether 
due to the ongoing impact of the pandemic or otherwise (see 
the pandemic-related risk factor above). 

While various mitigating factors could be available to Citi 
if any of the above events were to occur—such as by replacing 
the retailer or merchant or offering other card products—these 
events, particularly bankruptcies or liquidations, could 
negatively impact the results of operations or financial 
condition of Citi-branded cards, Citi retail services or Citi as a 
whole, including as a result of loss of revenues, increased 
expenses, higher cost of credit, impairment of purchased credit 

card relationships and contract-related intangibles or other 
losses (for information on Citi’s credit card related intangibles 
generally, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements). 

Citi’s Inability in Its Resolution Plan Submissions to 
Address Any Shortcomings or Deficiencies Identified or 
Guidance Provided by the FRB and FDIC Could Subject Citi 
to More Stringent Capital, Leverage or Liquidity 
Requirements, or Restrictions on Its Growth, Activities or 
Operations, and Could Eventually Require Citi to Divest 
Assets or Operations. 
Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act requires Citi to prepare and 
submit a plan to the FRB and the FDIC for the orderly 
resolution of Citigroup (the bank holding company) and its 
significant legal entities under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in 
the event of future material financial distress or failure. On 
December 17, 2019, the FRB and FDIC issued feedback on 
the resolution plans filed on July 1, 2019 by the eight U.S. 
GSIBs, including Citi. The FRB and FDIC identified one 
shortcoming, but no deficiencies, in Citi’s resolution plan 
relating to governance mechanisms. For additional 
information on Citi’s resolution plan submissions, see 
“Managing Global Risk—Liquidity Risk” below. 

Under Title I, if the FRB and the FDIC jointly determine 

that Citi’s resolution plan is not “credible” (which, although 
not defined, is generally believed to mean the regulators do 
not believe the plan is feasible or would otherwise allow Citi 
to be resolved in a way that protects systemically important 
functions without severe systemic disruption), or would not 
facilitate an orderly resolution of Citi under the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code, and Citi fails to resubmit a resolution plan 
that remedies any identified deficiencies, Citi could be 
subjected to more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity 
requirements, or restrictions on its growth, activities or 
operations. If within two years from the imposition of any 
such requirements or restrictions Citi has still not remediated 
any identified deficiencies, then Citi could eventually be 
required to divest certain assets or operations. Any such 
restrictions or actions would negatively impact Citi’s 
reputation, market and investor perception, operations and 
strategy. 

Citi’s Performance and the Performance of Its Individual 
Businesses Could Be Negatively Impacted if Citi Is Not Able 
to Effectively Compete for, Retain and Motivate Highly 
Qualified Colleagues. 
Citi’s performance and the performance of its individual 
businesses largely depend on the talents and efforts of its 
diverse and highly qualified colleagues. Specifically, Citi’s 
continued ability to compete in each of its lines of business, to 
manage its businesses effectively and to execute its global 
strategy depends on its ability to attract new colleagues and to 
retain and motivate its existing colleagues. If Citi is unable to 
continue to attract, retain and motivate the most highly 
qualified colleagues, Citi’s performance, including its 
competitive position, the execution of its strategy and its 
results of operations could be negatively impacted. 

Citi’s ability to attract, retain and motivate colleagues 
depends on numerous factors, some of which are outside of its 

54

control. For example, the banking industry generally is subject 
to more comprehensive regulation of employee compensation 
than other industries, including deferral and clawback 
requirements for incentive compensation. Citi often competes 
for talent with entities that are not subject to similar regulatory 
requirements, including, among others, technology companies. 
Other factors that could impact Citi’s ability to attract, retain 
and motivate colleagues include its reputation, culture and the 
management and leadership of the Company and each of its 
lines of business, presence in a particular market or region and 
the professional opportunities it offers. For information on
Citi’s colleagues and workforce management, see “Human
Capital Resources and Management” below.

Financial Services Companies and Others as well as 
Emerging Technologies Pose Increasingly Competitive 
Challenges to Citi. 
Citi operates in an increasingly competitive environment, 
which includes both financial and non-financial services firms, 
such as traditional banks, online banks, financial technology 
companies and others. These companies compete on the basis 
of, among other factors, size, reach, quality and type of 
products and services offered, price, technology and 
reputation. Emerging technologies have the potential to 
intensify competition and accelerate disruption in the financial 
services industry. 

Citi competes with financial services companies in the 
U.S. and globally that continue to develop and introduce new 
products and services. In recent years, non-financial services 
firms, such as financial technology companies, have begun to 
offer services traditionally provided by financial institutions, 
such as Citi, and have sought bank charters to provide these 
services. These firms attempt to use technology and mobile 
platforms to enhance the ability of companies and individuals 
to borrow, save and invest money. In addition, as discussed
above, it is unclear how the macroeconomic business
environment or societal norms may be impacted as a result of
the pandemic. Citi may experience increased or different
competitive and other challenges in a post-pandemic
environment. 

To the extent that Citi is not able to compete effectively 

with financial technology companies and other firms, Citi 
could be placed at a competitive disadvantage, which could 
result in loss of customers and market share, and its 
businesses, results of operations and financial condition could 
suffer. For additional information on Citi’s competitors, see 
the co-brand and private label cards risk factor above and 
“Supervision, Regulation and Other—Competition” below. 

Climate Change Could Have a Negative Impact on Citi’s 
Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
Citi operates globally, including in countries, states and 
regions where its businesses, and the activities of its consumer 
customers and corporate clients, could be negatively impacted 
by climate change. Climate change presents both immediate 
and long-term risks to Citi and its customers and clients, with 
the risks expected to increase over time. 

Climate risks can arise from physical risks (acute or 
chronic risks related to the physical effects of climate change) 
and transition risks (risks related to regulatory and legal, 

technological, market and reputational changes from a 
transition to a low-carbon economy). Physical risks could 
damage or destroy Citi’s or its customers’ and clients’ 
properties and other assets and disrupt their operations. For 
example, climate change may lead to more extreme weather 
events occurring more often which may result in physical 
damage and additional volatility within our trading and other 
businesses and potential counterparty exposures and other 
financial risks. Transition risks may result in changes in 
regulations or market preferences, which in turn could have 
negative impacts on asset values, results of operation or the 
reputation of Citi and its customers and clients. For example, 
Citi’s corporate credit portfolios include carbon-intensive 
industries like oil and gas and power that are exposed to 
climate risks, such as those risks related to the transition to a 
low-carbon economy, as well as low-carbon industries that 
may be subject to risks associated with new technologies. U.S. 
and non-U.S. banking regulators and others have increasingly 
viewed financial institutions as important in helping to address 
the risks related to climate change both directly and with 
respect to their customers. Ongoing legislative or regulatory 
uncertainties and changes regarding climate risk management 
and practices may result in higher regulatory, compliance, 
credit and reputational risks and costs. 

For information on Citi’s management of climate risk, see 

“Managing Global Risk—Strategic Risk—Climate Risk” 
below.

MARKET AND OTHER RISKS
Macroeconomic, Geopolitical and Other Challenges and 
Uncertainties Globally Could Have a Negative Impact on 
Citi’s Businesses and Results of Operations. 
In addition to the significant macroeconomic challenges posed 
by the pandemic (see the pandemic-related risk factor above), 
Citi has experienced, and could experience in the future, 
negative impacts to its businesses and results of operations as 
a result of other macroeconomic, geopolitical and other 
challenges, uncertainties and volatility. For example, 
governmental fiscal and monetary actions, or expected actions, 
such as changes in interest rate policies and any program 
implemented by a central bank to change the size of its 
balance sheet, could significantly impact interest rates, 
economic growth rates, the volatility of global financial 
markets, foreign exchange rates and global capital flows. 
Additional areas of uncertainty include, among others, 
geopolitical tensions and conflicts, protracted or widespread 
trade tensions, natural disasters, other pandemics and election 
outcomes. Moreover, adverse developments or downturns in 
one or more of the world’s larger economies would likely have 
a significant impact on the global economy or the economies 
of other countries because of global financial and economic 
linkages.

In 2020, due to the pandemic, the FRB and other central 
banks took numerous actions to support the global economy, 
including by further reducing their benchmark interest rates 
and in certain instances providing additional liquidity to the 
financial system. Interest rates on loans Citi makes to 
customers and clients are typically based off or set at a spread 
over a benchmark interest rate, including the U.S. benchmark 
interest rate, and are therefore likely to decline as benchmark 

55

rates decline. By contrast, the interest rates at which Citi pays 
depositors are already low and unlikely to decline much 
further. Consequently, declining or continued low interest 
rates for loans and largely unchanged deposit rates would 
likely further compress Citi’s net interest revenue. Citi’s net 
interest revenue could also be adversely affected due to a 
flattening of the interest rate yield curve (e.g., a lower spread 
between shorter-term versus longer-term interest rates), as 
Citi, similar to other banks, typically pays interest on deposits 
based on shorter-term interest rates and earns money on loans 
based on longer-term interest rates. For additional information 
on Citi’s interest rate risk, see “Managing Global Risk—
Market Risk—Net Interest Revenue at Risk” below. 

These and additional global macroeconomic, geopolitical 

and other challenges, uncertainties and volatilities have 
negatively impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, 
Citi’s businesses, results of operations and financial condition, 
including its credit costs, revenues across ICG and GCB and 
AOCI (which would in turn negatively impact Citi’s book and 
tangible book value). 

OPERATIONAL RISKS
A Failure in or Disruption of Citi’s Operational Processes or 
Systems Could Negatively Impact Citi’s Reputation, 
Customers, Clients, Businesses or Results of Operations and 
Financial Condition. 
Citi’s global operations rely heavily on the accurate, timely 
and secure processing, management, storage and transmission 
of confidential transactions, data and other information as well 
as the monitoring of a substantial amount of data and complex 
transactions in real time. For example, Citi obtains and stores 
an extensive amount of personal and client-specific 
information for its consumer and institutional customers and 
clients, and must accurately record and reflect their extensive 
account transactions. Citi’s operations must also comply with 
complex and evolving laws and regulations in the countries in 
which it operates. 

With the evolving proliferation of new technologies and 

the increasing use of the internet, mobile devices and cloud 
technologies to conduct financial transactions, large global 
financial institutions such as Citi have been, and will continue 
to be, subject to an ever-increasing risk of operational loss, 
failure or disruption, including as a result of cyber or 
information security incidents. These risks have been 
exacerbated during the pandemic, when a substantial portion 
of Citi’s colleagues have worked remotely and customers and 
clients have increased their use of online banking and other 
platforms (for additional information, see the cybersecurity 
risk factor below and pandemic-related risk factor above). 
Although Citi has continued to upgrade its operational 

systems to automate processes and enhance efficiencies, 
operational incidents are unpredictable and can arise from 
numerous sources, not all of which are within Citi’s control, 
including, among others, human error, such as processing 
errors, fraud or malice on the part of employees or third 
parties, accidental system or technological failure, electrical or 
telecommunication outages, failures of or cyber incidents 
involving computer servers or infrastructure or other similar 
losses or damage to Citi’s property or assets. Irrespective of 
the sophistication of the technology utilized by Citi, there will 

always be some room for human error. In view of the large 
transactions in which Citi engages, such errors could result in 
significant loss. Operational incidents can also arise as a result 
of failures by third parties with which Citi does business, such 
as failures by internet, mobile technology and cloud service 
providers or other vendors to adequately follow procedures or 
processes, safeguard their systems or prevent system 
disruptions or cyber attacks. 

Incidents that impact information security and/or 

technology operations may cause disruptions and/or 
malfunctions within Citi’s businesses (e.g., the temporary loss 
of availability of Citi’s online banking system or mobile 
banking platform), as well as the operations of its clients, 
customers or other third parties. In addition, operational 
incidents could involve the failure or ineffectiveness of 
internal processes or controls. Given Citi’s global footprint 
and the high volume of transactions processed by Citi, certain 
failures, errors or actions may be repeated or compounded 
before they are discovered and rectified, which would further 
increase the consequences and costs. Operational incidents 
could result in financial losses as well as misappropriation, 
corruption or loss of confidential and other information or 
assets, which could significantly negatively impact Citi’s 
reputation, customers, clients, businesses or results of 
operations and financial condition. Cyber-related and other 
operational incidents can also result in legal and regulatory 
proceedings, fines and other costs (see the legal and regulatory 
proceedings risk factor below). 

For information on Citi’s management of operational risk, 

see “Managing Global Risk—Operational Risk” below. 

Citi’s and Third Parties’ Computer Systems and Networks 
Have Been, and Will Continue to Be, Susceptible to an 
Increasing Risk of Continually Evolving, Sophisticated 
Cybersecurity Activities That Could Result in the Theft, Loss, 
Misuse or Disclosure of Confidential Client or Customer 
Information, Damage to Citi’s Reputation, Additional Costs 
to Citi, Regulatory Penalties, Legal Exposure and Financial 
Losses. 
Citi’s computer systems, software and networks are subject to 
ongoing cyber incidents such as unauthorized access, loss or 
destruction of data (including confidential client information), 
account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses 
or other malicious code, cyber attacks and other similar 
events. These threats can arise from external parties, including 
cyber criminals, cyber terrorists, hacktivists and nation state 
actors, as well as insiders who knowingly or unknowingly 
engage in or enable malicious cyber activities. 

Third parties with which Citi does business, as well as 
retailers and other third parties with which Citi’s customers do 
business, may also be sources of cybersecurity risks, 
particularly where activities of customers are beyond Citi’s 
security and control systems. For example, Citi outsources 
certain functions, such as processing customer credit card 
transactions, uploading content on customer-facing websites 
and developing software for new products and services. These 
relationships allow for the storage and processing of customer 
information by third-party hosting of or access to Citi 
websites, which could lead to compromise or the potential to 
introduce vulnerable or malicious code, resulting in security 

56

breaches impacting Citi customers. Furthermore, because 
financial institutions are becoming increasingly interconnected 
with central agents, exchanges and clearing houses, including 
as a result of derivatives reforms over the last few years, Citi 
has increased exposure to cyber attacks through third parties. 
While many of Citi’s agreements with third parties include 
indemnification provisions, Citi may not be able to recover 
sufficiently, or at all, under the provisions to adequately offset 
any losses Citi may incur from third-party cyber incidents. 
Citi has been subject to attempted and sometimes 
successful cyber attacks from external sources over the last 
several years, including (i) denial of service attacks, which 
attempt to interrupt service to clients and customers, (ii) 
hacking and malicious software installations, intended to gain 
unauthorized access to information systems or to disrupt those 
systems, (iii) data breaches due to unauthorized access to 
customer account data and (iv) malicious software attacks on 
client systems, in an attempt to gain unauthorized access to 
Citi systems or client data under the guise of normal client 
transactions. While Citi’s monitoring and protection services 
were able to detect and respond to the incidents targeting its 
systems before they became significant, they still resulted in 
limited losses in some instances as well as increases in 
expenditures to monitor against the threat of similar future 
cyber incidents. There can be no assurance that such cyber 
incidents will not occur again, and they could occur more 
frequently and on a more significant scale. 

Further, although Citi devotes significant resources to 

implement, maintain, monitor and regularly upgrade its 
systems and networks with measures such as intrusion 
detection and prevention and firewalls to safeguard critical 
business applications, there is no guarantee that these 
measures or any other measures can provide absolute security. 
Because the methods used to cause cyber attacks change 
frequently or, in some cases, are not recognized until launched 
or even later, Citi may be unable to implement effective 
preventive measures or proactively address these methods 
until they are discovered. In addition, given the evolving 
nature of cyber threat actors and the frequency and 
sophistication of the cyber activities they carry out, the 
determination of the severity and potential impact of a cyber 
incident may not become apparent for a substantial period of 
time following discovery of the incident. Also, while Citi 
engages in certain actions to reduce the exposure resulting 
from outsourcing, such as performing security control 
assessments of third-party vendors and limiting third-party 
access to the least privileged level necessary to perform job 
functions, these actions cannot prevent all third-party-related 
cyber attacks or data breaches. 

Cyber incidents can result in the disclosure of personal, 

confidential or proprietary customer or client information, 
damage to Citi’s reputation with its clients and the market, 
customer dissatisfaction and additional costs to Citi, including 
expenses such as repairing systems, replacing customer 
payment cards, credit monitoring or adding new personnel or 
protection technologies. Regulatory penalties, loss of 
revenues, exposure to litigation and other financial losses, 
including loss of funds, to both Citi and its clients and 
customers and disruption to Citi’s operational systems could 
also result from cyber incidents (for additional information on 

the potential impact of operational disruptions, see the 
operational processes and systems risk factor above). 
Moreover, the increasing risk of cyber incidents has resulted in 
increased legislative and regulatory scrutiny of firms’ 
cybersecurity protection services and calls for additional laws 
and regulations to further enhance protection of consumers’ 
personal data. 

While Citi maintains insurance coverage that may, subject 

to policy terms and conditions including significant self-
insured deductibles, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such 
insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses and 
may not take into account reputational harm, the cost of which 
could be immeasurable. 

For additional information about Citi’s management of 

cybersecurity risk, see “Managing Global Risk—Operational 
Risk—Cybersecurity Risk” below. 

Changes to or the Application of Incorrect Assumptions, 
Judgments or Estimates in Citi’s Financial Statements 
Could Cause Significant Unexpected Losses or Impacts in 
the Future. 
U.S. GAAP requires Citi to use certain assumptions, 
judgments and estimates in preparing its financial statements, 
including, among other items, the estimate of the ACL; 
reserves related to litigation, regulatory and tax matters 
exposures; valuation of DTAs; and the fair values of certain 
assets and liabilities, such as goodwill or any other asset for 
impairment. If Citi’s assumptions, judgments or estimates 
underlying its financial statements are incorrect or differ from 
actual or subsequent events, Citi could experience unexpected 
losses or other adverse impacts, some of which could be 
significant. 

For example, the CECL methodology, adopted as of 
January 1, 2020, requires that Citi provide reserves for a 
current estimate of lifetime expected credit losses for its loan 
portfolios and other financial assets, as applicable, at the time 
those assets are originated or acquired. This estimate is 
adjusted each period for changes in expected lifetime credit 
losses. Citi’s ACL estimate depends upon its CECL models 
and assumptions, forecasted macroeconomic conditions, 
including, among other things, the U.S. unemployment rate 
and the U.S. Real GDP, and the credit indicators, composition 
and other characteristics of Citi’s loan and other applicable 
portfolios. These model assumptions and forecasted 
macroeconomic conditions will change over time, whether due 
to the pandemic or otherwise, resulting in greater variability in 
Citi’s ACL compared to its provision for loan losses under the 
previous GAAP methodology, and, thus, impact its results of 
operations, as well as regulatory capital, including as the 
CECL phase-in begins as of January 1, 2022.

Moreover, Citi has incurred losses related to its foreign 
operations that are reported in the foreign currency translation 
adjustment (CTA) components of Accumulated other 
comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI). In accordance with U.S. 
GAAP, a sale or substantial liquidation of any foreign 
operations, such as those related to Citi’s legacy businesses, 
would result in reclassification of any foreign CTA component 
of AOCI related to that foreign operation, including related 
hedges and taxes, into Citi’s earnings. For additional 
information on Citi’s accounting policy for foreign currency 

57

translation and its foreign CTA components of AOCI, see 
Notes 1 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
For additional information on the key areas for which 
assumptions and estimates are used in preparing Citi’s 
financial statements, including those related to Citi’s ACL, see 
“Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” 
below and Notes 1 and 27 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements. 

Changes to Financial Accounting and Reporting Standards 
or Interpretations Could Have a Material Impact on How 
Citi Records and Reports Its Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations. 
Periodically, the Financial Accounting Standards Board 
(FASB) issues financial accounting and reporting standards 
that govern key aspects of Citi’s financial statements or 
interpretations thereof when those standards become effective, 
including those areas where Citi is required to make 
assumptions or estimates. Changes to financial accounting or 
reporting standards or interpretations, whether promulgated or 
required by the FASB or other regulators, could present 
operational challenges and could also require Citi to change 
certain of the assumptions or estimates it previously used in 
preparing its financial statements, which could negatively 
impact how it records and reports its financial condition and 
results of operations generally and/or with respect to particular 
businesses. For additional information on Citi’s accounting 
policies, including the expected impacts on Citi’s results of 
operations and financial condition, see Note 1 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements. 

If Citi’s Risk Management Processes, Strategies or Models 
Are Deficient or Ineffective, Citi May Incur Significant 
Losses and Its Regulatory Capital and Capital Ratios Could 
Be Negatively Impacted. 
Citi utilizes a broad and diversified set of risk management 
and mitigation processes and strategies, including the use of 
risk models in analyzing and monitoring the various risks Citi 
assumes in conducting its activities. For example, Citi uses 
models as part of its comprehensive stress testing initiatives 
across the Company. Citi also relies on data to aggregate, 
assess and manage various risk exposures. Management of 
these risks is made even more challenging within a global 
financial institution such as Citi, particularly given the 
complex, diverse and rapidly changing financial markets and 
conditions in which Citi operates as well as that losses can 
occur from untimely, inaccurate or incomplete processes 
caused by unintentional human error. 

In addition, in October 2020, Citigroup and Citibank 

entered into consent orders with the FRB and OCC that 
require Citigroup and Citibank to submit acceptable plans 
relating principally to making improvements in various 
aspects of enterprise-wide risk management, compliance, data 
quality management and governance and internal controls (see 
“Citi’s Consent Order Compliance” above and the legal and 
regulatory proceedings risk factor below).

Citi’s risk management processes, strategies and models 

are inherently limited because they involve techniques, 
including the use of historical data in many circumstances, 
assumptions and judgments that cannot anticipate every 

economic and financial outcome in the markets in which Citi 
operates, nor can they anticipate the specifics and timing of 
such outcomes. Citi could incur significant losses, and its 
regulatory capital and capital ratios could be negatively 
impacted, if Citi’s risk management processes, including its 
ability to manage and aggregate data in a timely and accurate 
manner, strategies or models are deficient or ineffective. Such 
deficiencies or ineffectiveness could also result in inaccurate 
financial, regulatory or risk reporting. 

Moreover, Citi’s Basel III regulatory capital models, 
including its credit, market and operational risk models, 
currently remain subject to ongoing regulatory review and 
approval, which may result in refinements, modifications or 
enhancements (required or otherwise) to these models. 
Modifications or requirements resulting from these ongoing 
reviews, as well as any future changes or guidance provided 
by the U.S. banking agencies regarding the regulatory capital 
framework applicable to Citi, have resulted in, and could 
continue to result in, significant changes to Citi’s risk-
weighted assets. These changes can negatively impact Citi’s 
capital ratios and its ability to achieve its regulatory capital 
requirements. 

CREDIT RISKS 
Credit Risk and Concentrations of Risk Can Increase the 
Potential for Citi to Incur Significant Losses. 
Credit risk primarily arises from Citi’s lending and other 
businesses in both GCB and ICG. Citi has credit exposures to 
consumer, corporate and public sector borrowers and other 
counterparties in the U.S. and various countries and 
jurisdictions globally, including end-of-period consumer loans 
of $289 billion and end-of-period corporate loans of $387 
billion at year-end 2020. 

A default by a borrower or other counterparty, or a 
decline in the credit quality or value of any underlying 
collateral, exposes Citi to credit risk. Despite Citi’s target 
client strategy, various pandemic-related, macroeconomic, 
geopolitical and other factors, among other things, can 
increase Citi’s credit risk and credit costs (for additional 
information, see the pandemic-related, co-branding and private 
label credit card, macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties 
and emerging markets risk factors above). 

While Citi provides reserves for expected losses for its 
credit exposures, as applicable, such reserves are subject to 
judgments and estimates that could be incorrect or differ from 
actual future events. Under the CECL accounting standard, the 
ACL reflects expected losses, rather than incurred losses, 
which has resulted in and could lead to additional volatility in 
the allowance and the provision for credit losses as forecasts 
of economic conditions change. In addition, Citi’s future 
allowance may be affected by seasonality of its cards 
portfolios based on historical evidence showing that (i) credit 
card balances typically decrease during the first and second 
quarters, as borrowers use tax refunds to pay down balances; 
and (ii) balances increase during the third and fourth quarters 
each year as payments are no longer impacted by tax refunds 
and the holiday season approaches. However these seasonal 
trends could be affected in 2021 due to the impacts of
the pandemic, government stimulus and expiration of

consumer and small business relief programs. For additional 
information, see the incorrect assumptions or estimates and 
changes to financial accounting and reporting standards risk 
factors above. For additional information on Citi’s ACL, see 
“Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” 
below and Notes 1 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements. For additional information on Citi’s credit and 
country risk, see each respective business’s results of 
operations above and “Managing Global Risk—Credit Risk” 
and “Managing Global Risk—Strategic Risk—Country Risk” 
below and Notes 14 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements. 

Concentrations of risk, particularly credit and market 
risks, can also increase Citi’s risk of significant losses. As of 
year-end 2020, Citi’s most significant concentration of credit 
risk was with the U.S. government and its agencies, which 
primarily results from trading assets and investments issued by 
the U.S. government and its agencies (for additional 
information, including concentrations of credit risk to other 
public sector entities, see Note 23 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements). In addition, Citi routinely executes a 
high volume of securities, trading, derivative and foreign 
exchange transactions with non-U.S. sovereigns and with 
counterparties in the financial services industry, including 
banks, insurance companies, investment banks, governments, 
central banks and other financial institutions. Moreover, Citi 
has indemnification obligations in connection with various 
transactions that expose it to concentrations of risk, including 
credit risk from hedging or reinsurance arrangements related 
to those obligations (for additional information about these 
exposures, see Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements). A rapid deterioration of a large borrower or other 
counterparty or within a sector or country where Citi has large 
exposures or guarantees or unexpected market dislocations 
could cause Citi to incur significant losses. 

LIQUIDITY RISKS 
The Maintenance of Adequate Liquidity and Funding 
Depends on Numerous Factors, Including Those Outside of 
Citi’s Control, Such as Market Disruptions and Increases in 
Citi’s Credit Spreads. 
As a large, global financial institution, adequate liquidity and 
sources of funding are essential to Citi’s businesses. Citi’s 
liquidity and sources of funding can be significantly and 
negatively impacted by factors it cannot control, such as 
general disruptions in the financial markets, governmental 
fiscal and monetary policies, regulatory changes or negative 
investor perceptions of Citi’s creditworthiness, unexpected 
increases in cash or collateral requirements and the inability to 
monetize available liquidity resources, whether due to the 
pandemic or otherwise. Citi competes with other banks and 
financial institutions for deposits, which represent Citi’s most 
stable and lowest cost source of long-term funding. The 
competition for retail banking deposits has increased in recent 
years as a result of online banks and digital banking, among 
others. Furthermore, although Citi’s has had robust deposit 
growth since the onset of the pandemic, it remains unclear 
how “sticky” (likely to remain at Citi) those deposits may be, 
particularly in a less accommodating environment. 

58

Moreover, Citi’s costs to obtain and access secured 
funding and long-term unsecured funding are directly related 
to its credit spreads. Changes in credit spreads are driven by 
both external market factors and factors specific to Citi, and 
can be highly volatile. For additional information on Citi’s 
primary sources of funding, see “Managing Global Risk—
Liquidity Risk” below. 

Citi’s ability to obtain funding may be impaired if other 
market participants are seeking to access the markets at the 
same time, or if market appetite declines, as is likely to occur 
in a liquidity stress event or other market crisis. A sudden drop 
in market liquidity could also cause a temporary or lengthier 
dislocation of underwriting and capital markets activity. In 
addition, clearing organizations, central banks, clients and 
financial institutions with which Citi interacts may exercise 
the right to require additional collateral based on their 
perceptions or the market conditions, which could further 
impair Citi’s access to and cost of funding. 

Additionally, as a holding company, Citi relies on interest, 

dividends, distributions and other payments from its 
subsidiaries to fund dividends as well as to satisfy its debt and 
other obligations. Several of Citi’s U.S. and non-U.S. 
subsidiaries are or may be subject to capital adequacy or other 
regulatory or contractual restrictions on their ability to provide 
such payments, including any local regulatory stress test 
requirements. Limitations on the payments that Citi receives 
from its subsidiaries could also impact its liquidity. 

The Credit Rating Agencies Continuously Review the Credit 
Ratings of Citi and Certain of Its Subsidiaries, and a Ratings 
Downgrade Could Have a Negative Impact on Citi’s 
Funding and Liquidity Due to Reduced Funding Capacity 
and Increased Funding Costs, Including Derivatives 
Triggers That Could Require Cash Obligations or Collateral 
Requirements. 
The credit rating agencies, such as Fitch, Moody’s and S&P, 
continuously evaluate Citi and certain of its subsidiaries. Their 
ratings of Citi and its more significant subsidiaries’ long-term/ 
senior debt and short-term/commercial paper are based on a 
number of factors, including standalone financial strength, as 
well as factors that are not entirely within the control of Citi 
and its subsidiaries, such as the agencies’ proprietary rating 
methodologies and assumptions, and conditions affecting the 
financial services industry and markets generally. 

Citi and its subsidiaries may not be able to maintain their 

current respective ratings. A ratings downgrade could 
negatively impact Citi’s ability to access the capital markets 
and other sources of funds as well as the costs of those funds, 
and its ability to maintain certain deposits. A ratings 
downgrade could also have a negative impact on Citi’s 
funding and liquidity due to reduced funding capacity and the 
impact from derivative triggers, which could require Citi to 
meet cash obligations and collateral requirements. In addition, 
a ratings downgrade could have a negative impact on other 
funding sources such as secured financing and other margined 
transactions for which there may be no explicit triggers, and 
on contractual provisions and other credit requirements of 
Citi’s counterparties and clients that may contain minimum 
ratings thresholds in order for Citi to hold third-party funds. 
Some entities could have ratings limitations on their 

59

permissible counterparties, of which Citi may or may not be 
aware. 

Furthermore, a credit ratings downgrade could have 

impacts that may not be currently known to Citi or are not 
possible to quantify. Certain of Citi’s corporate customers and 
trading counterparties, among other clients, could re-evaluate 
their business relationships with Citi and limit the trading of 
certain contracts or market instruments with Citi in response to 
ratings downgrades. Changes in customer and counterparty 
behavior could impact not only Citi’s funding and liquidity but 
also the results of operations of certain Citi businesses. For 
additional information on the potential impact of a reduction 
in Citi’s or Citibank’s credit ratings, see “Managing Global 
Risk—Liquidity Risk” below. 

COMPLIANCE RISKS 
Ongoing Interpretation and Implementation of Regulatory 
and Legislative Requirements and Changes in the U.S. and 
Globally Have Increased Citi’s Compliance, Regulatory and 
Other Risks and Costs. 
Citi is continually required to interpret and implement 
extensive and frequently changing regulatory and legislative 
requirements in the U.S. and other jurisdictions where it does 
business, resulting in substantial compliance, regulatory and 
other risks and costs. In addition, there are heightened 
regulatory scrutiny and expectations in the U.S. and globally 
for large financial institutions, as well as their employees and 
agents, with respect to, among other things, governance, 
infrastructure, data and risk management practices and 
controls. A failure to comply with these requirements and 
expectations or resolve any identified deficiencies could result 
in increased regulatory oversight and restrictions, enforcement 
proceedings, penalties and fines (for additional information, 
see the legal and regulatory proceedings risk factor below). 

Over the past several years, Citi has been required to 
implement a significant number of regulatory and legislative 
changes across all of its businesses and functions, and these 
changes continue. The changes themselves may be complex 
and subject to interpretation, and will require continued 
investments in Citi’s global operations and technology 
solutions. In some cases, Citi’s implementation of a regulatory 
or legislative requirement is occurring simultaneously with 
changing or conflicting regulatory guidance, legal challenges 
or legislative action to modify or repeal existing rules or enact 
new rules. Moreover, in some cases, there have been entirely 
new regulatory or legislative requirements or regimes, 
resulting in large volumes of regulation and potential 
uncertainty regarding regulatory expectations as to what is 
required in order to be in compliance. 

Examples of regulatory or legislative changes that have 
resulted in increased compliance risks and costs include (i) a 
proliferation of laws relating to the limitation of cross-border 
data movement and/or collection and use of customer 
information, including data localization and protection and 
privacy laws, which also can conflict with or increase 
compliance complexity with respect to other laws, including 
anti-money laundering laws; and (ii) the FRB’s “total loss 
absorbing capacity” (TLAC) requirements. Additionally, the 
banking industry generally is being called upon to do more on 
the issues of social, economic and racial justice. This could 

result in additional regulatory requirements regarding banking 
services for underserved communities and individuals.

Increased and ongoing compliance requirements and 
uncertainties have resulted in higher compliance costs for Citi, 
in part due to an increase in risk, regulatory and compliance 
staff over the last several years despite a reduction in the 
overall employee population. Extensive and changing 
compliance requirements can also result in increased 
reputational and legal risks for Citi, as failure to comply with 
regulations and requirements, or failure to comply with 
regulatory expectations, can result in enforcement and/or 
regulatory proceedings, penalties and fines. 

Citi Is Subject to Extensive Legal and Regulatory 
Proceedings, Examinations, Investigations, Consent Orders 
and Related Compliance Efforts and Other Inquiries That 
Could Result in Significant Monetary Penalties, Supervisory 
or Enforcement Orders, Business Restrictions, Limitations 
on Dividends, Changes to Directors and/or Officers and 
Collateral Consequences Arising from Such Outcomes.
At any given time, Citi is a party to a significant number of 
legal and regulatory proceedings and is subject to numerous 
governmental and regulatory examinations, investigations, 
consent orders and related compliance efforts, and other 
inquiries. Citi can also be subject to enforcement proceedings 
not only because of violations of laws and regulations, but also 
due to failures, as determined by its regulators, to have 
adequate policies and procedures, or to remedy deficiencies on 
a timely basis. 

The recent FRB and OCC consent orders require 

Citigroup and Citibank to submit acceptable plans to the FRB 
and OCC, on various timelines, relating principally to making 
improvements in various aspects of enterprise-wide risk 
management, compliance, data quality management and 
governance and internal controls. The consent orders require 
preparation of acceptable gap analyses that identify the 
required improvements and related root causes, as well as 
targeted action plans and quarterly progress reports detailing 
the results and status of the improvements. These 
improvements will result in significant investments by Citi 
during 2021 and afterwards, as an essential part of Citi’s 
broader transformation efforts to enhance its infrastructure, 
governance, processes and risk and controls. Although there 
are no restrictions on Citi’s ability to serve its clients, the 
Citibank consent order requires prior approval of any 
significant new acquisition, including any portfolio or business 
acquisition, excluding ordinary course transactions. Moreover, 
the Citibank consent order provides that the OCC has the right 
to assess future civil monetary penalties or take other 
supervisory and/or enforcement actions, including where the 
OCC determines Citibank has not made sufficient and 
sustainable progress to address the required improvements. 
Such actions by the OCC could include imposing business 
restrictions, including possible limitations on the declaration 
or payment of dividends and changes in directors and/or senior 
executive officers. More generally the OCC and/or the Federal 
Reserve could take additional enforcement or other actions if 
the regulatory agency believes that Citi has not met regulatory 
expectations regarding compliance with the consent orders. 

For additional information regarding the consent orders, see 
“Citi’s Consent Order Compliance” above.

The global judicial, regulatory and political environment 
has generally been challenging for large financial institutions. 
The complexity of the federal and state regulatory and 
enforcement regimes in the U.S., coupled with the global 
scope of Citi’s operations, also means that a single event or 
issue may give rise to a large number of overlapping 
investigations and regulatory proceedings, either by multiple 
federal and state agencies and authorities in the U.S. or by 
multiple regulators and other governmental entities in different 
jurisdictions, as well as multiple civil litigation claims in 
multiple jurisdictions. 

U.S. and non-U.S. regulators have been increasingly 
focused on “conduct risk,” a term used to describe the risks 
associated with behavior by employees and agents, including 
third parties, that could harm clients, customers, employees or 
the integrity of the markets, such as improperly creating, 
selling, marketing or managing products and services or 
improper incentive compensation programs with respect 
thereto, failures to safeguard a party’s personal information, or 
failures to identify and manage conflicts of interest. In 
addition to the greater focus on conduct risk, the general 
heightened scrutiny and expectations from regulators could 
lead to investigations and other inquiries, as well as 
remediation requirements, more regulatory or other 
enforcement proceedings, civil litigation and higher 
compliance and other risks and costs. 

Further, while Citi takes numerous steps to prevent and 
detect conduct by employees and agents that could potentially 
harm clients, customers, employees or the integrity of the 
markets, such behavior may not always be deterred or 
prevented. Banking regulators have also focused on the overall 
culture of financial services firms, including Citi. 

In addition to regulatory restrictions or structural changes 
that could result from perceived deficiencies in Citi’s culture, 
such focus could also lead to additional regulatory 
proceedings. Furthermore, the severity of the remedies sought 
in legal and regulatory proceedings to which Citi is subject has 
remained elevated. U.S. and certain international 
governmental entities have increasingly brought criminal 
actions against, or have sought criminal convictions from, 
financial institutions and individual employees, and criminal 
prosecutors in the U.S. have increasingly sought and obtained 
criminal guilty pleas or deferred prosecution agreements 
against corporate entities and individuals and other criminal 
sanctions for those institutions and individuals. These types of 
actions by U.S. and international governmental entities may, 
in the future, have significant collateral consequences for a 
financial institution, including loss of customers and business, 
and the inability to offer certain products or services and/or 
operate certain businesses. Citi may be required to accept or 
be subject to similar types of criminal remedies, consent 
orders, sanctions, substantial fines and penalties, remediation 
and other financial costs or other requirements in the future, 
including for matters or practices not yet known to Citi, any of 
which could materially and negatively affect Citi’s businesses, 
business practices, financial condition or results of operations, 
require material changes in Citi’s operations or cause Citi 
reputational harm.

Further, many large claims—both private civil and 
regulatory—asserted against Citi are highly complex, slow to 
develop and may involve novel or untested legal theories. The 
outcome of such proceedings is difficult to predict or estimate 
until late in the proceedings. Although Citi establishes 
accruals for its legal and regulatory matters according to 
accounting requirements, Citi’s estimates of, and changes to, 
these accruals involve significant judgment and may be 
subject to significant uncertainty, and the amount of loss 
ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be 
substantially higher than the amounts accrued. In addition, 
certain settlements are subject to court approval and may not 
be approved.

For additional information relating to Citi’s legal and 
regulatory proceedings and matters, including Citi’s policies 
on establishing legal accruals, see Note 27 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.

Workforce Management
Citi devotes substantial resources to managing its workforce. 
Citigroup’s Board of Directors provides strategic oversight 
and direction to management regarding workforce policies and 
practices, and includes many members with experience in 
overseeing workforce issues. The chair of the Personnel and 
Compensation Committee of the Board was formerly the 
global head of human resources for PIMCO, a leading global 
asset management firm, and later served as its president, with 
oversight responsibility for human resources. In addition, the 
Personnel and Compensation Committee regularly reviews 
management’s achievements against human capital 
management goals, such as addressing representation of 
women and U.S. minorities in senior roles at Citi, as well as 
talent recruitment and development initiatives. 

Diversity
Citigroup’s Board is committed to ensuring that it and Citi’s 
Executive Management Team are composed of individuals 
whose backgrounds reflect the diversity represented by Citi’s 
employees, customers and stakeholders. 

Additionally, over the past several years, Citi has 

increased its efforts to diversify its workforce. In furtherance 
of that goal, Citi has focused on measuring and addressing pay 
equity within the organization:

•

In 2018, Citi was the first major U.S. financial institution 
to publicly release the results of a pay equity review 
comparing compensation of women to men and U.S. 

minorities to U.S. non-minorities. Since then, Citi has 
continued to be transparent about pay equity, also 
disclosing its unadjusted or “raw” pay gap for both 
women and U.S. minorities since 2019. 
Citi’s 2020 results found that, on an adjusted basis, 
women globally are paid on average more than 99% of 
what men are paid at Citi, and there was no statistically 
significant difference in adjusted compensation for U.S. 
minorities and non-minorities. Following the review, 
appropriate pay adjustments were made as part of Citi’s 
2020 compensation cycle. 
Citi’s 2020 raw gap analysis showed that the median pay 
for women globally is better than 74% of the median for 
men, up from 73% in 2019 and 71% in 2018, and that the 
median pay for U.S. minorities is just under 94% of the 
median for non-minorities, which is similar to 2019 and 
up from 93% in 2018. 
To continue closing the pay gap, Citi has set goals to 
increase representation at the assistant vice president 
through managing director levels to at least 40% for 
women globally and 8% for Black colleagues in the U.S. 
by the end of 2021.

Citi also has a goal to:

expand the use of diverse slates across the firm in 2021 to 
include not one, but at least two women or racial/ethnic 
minorities in Citi’s interviews for U.S. hires and at least 
two women in interviews for global hires; and

•

increase the analyst and associate programs to 50% 
female colleagues globally and 30% Black and Hispanic/
Latino colleagues in the U.S.

In 2020, Citi also: 

expanded the standard for a diverse slate to include at 
least one woman globally and one woman and/or U.S. 
minority for U.S. hires at the assistant vice president, vice 
president and senior vice president levels, in addition to 
managing director and director level hires;
included a diverse slate of candidates, with at least one 
woman and/or U.S. minority, for 86% of roles that were 
posted globally with a qualified slate;
increased representation of underrepresented minorities in 
its full-time U.S. campus recruitment program from 18% 
in 2019 to 26% in 2020;
increased female representation in its full-time U.S. 
campus recruitment program from 45% in 2019 to 46% in 
2020; and
increased female representation in its summer internship 
program from 47% in 2019 to 52% in 2020 in the U.S. 
and from 48% in 2019 to 50% in 2020 globally, while 
Black and Hispanic/Latino representation in its summer 
class increased from 26% to 27% over the same 
timeframe. This was Citi’s most diverse intern class to 
date.

Workforce Development
Citi highly values a workplace environment where its 
colleagues can bring their whole selves to work and where 
diverse perspectives and ideas are embraced. Citi encourages 
career growth and development by offering broad and diverse 
opportunities to colleagues. Highlights of these opportunities 
include the following:

•

•

•

Citi provides a range of internal development and 
rotational programs to colleagues at all levels, including 
various training programs and events to assist high-
performing colleagues in building the skills needed to 
transition to manager and supervisory roles. 
Citi has a focus on internal talent development and aims 
to provide colleagues with career growth opportunities, 
with 33% of open positions filled internally. This 
emphasis is particularly important as Citi focuses on 
providing career paths for its diverse talent base as part of 
its efforts to increase diverse representation at more senior 
levels of the organization.
In order to assist colleagues in a rapidly changing world, 
Citi offers an online platform that delivers information on 
various topics of interest to colleagues, such as leadership, 
data analytics, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, 
among others.

MANAGING GLOBAL RISK

Overview
For Citi, effective risk management is of primary importance 
to its overall operations. Accordingly, Citi’s risk management 
process has been designed to monitor, evaluate and manage 
the principal risks it assumes in conducting its activities. 
Specifically, the activities that Citi engages in, and the risks 
those activities generate, must be consistent with Citi’s 
mission and value proposition, the key principles that guide it 
and Citi's risk appetite. As discussed above, Citi is continuing 
its efforts to comply with the Federal Reserve Board and OCC 
consent orders, relating principally to various aspects of risk 
management, compliance, data quality management and 
governance, and internal controls, see “Citi’s Consent Order 
Compliance” and “Risk Factors—Compliance Risks” above.

Risk management must be built on a foundation of ethical 

culture. Under Citi’s mission and value proposition, which 
was developed by its senior leadership and distributed 
throughout the Company, Citi strives to serve its clients as a 
trusted partner by responsibly providing financial services that 
enable growth and economic progress while earning and 
maintaining the public’s trust by constantly adhering to the 
highest ethical standards. As such, Citi asks all colleagues to 
ensure that their decisions pass three tests: they are in Citi’s 
clients’ interests, create economic value and are always 
systemically responsible. In addition, Citi evaluates 
colleagues’ performance against behavioral expectations set 
out in Citi’s leadership standards, which were designed in part 
to effectuate Citi’s mission and value proposition. Other 
culture-related efforts in connection with conduct risk, ethics 
and leadership, escalation and treating customers fairly help 
Citi to execute its mission and value proposition.

Citi’s Company-wide risk governance framework consists 

of the risk management practices that include a risk 
governance structure and the firm’s key policies, processes, 
personnel and control systems through which Citi identifies, 
measures, monitors, and controls risks such that the 
Company’s risk taking is consistent with its strategy and risk 
appetite. It also emphasizes Citi’s risk culture and lays out 
standards, procedures and programs that are designed to set, 
reinforce and enhance the Company’s risk culture, integrate its 
values and conduct expectations into the organization, 
providing colleagues with tools to assist them with making 
prudent and ethical risk decisions and to escalate issues 
appropriately. 

Citi selectively takes risks in support of its underlying 
customer-centric strategy. Citi’s objective is to ensure that 
those risks are consistent with its mission and value 
proposition, including its commitment to responsible finance. 
Citi’s risk mission is taking intelligent risk with shared 
responsibility, without forsaking individual accountability. 
Citi’s risk appetite framework sets boundaries for risk 
taking and consists of a set of risk appetite statements that 
articulate the aggregate level and types of risk that Citi is 
willing to accept in order to achieve its strategic objectives and 
business plan and includes governance processes through 
which the risk appetite is established, communicated and 
monitored, and its breaches are escalated and resolved. It is 
built on quantitative boundaries, which include goals, risk 

limits and thresholds, and on qualitative principles that guide 
behavior. Citi’s risk appetite framework is enterprise-wide and 
applicable across products, functions and geographies and 
comprehensively covers the major categories of risk facing the 
firm. 

Citi’s risks are generally categorized and summarized as 

follows:

•

•

•

Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the decline in 
credit quality (or downgrade risk) or failure of a borrower, 
counterparty, third party or issuer to honor its financial or 
contractual obligations.
Liquidity risk is the risk that the firm will not be able to 
efficiently meet both expected and unexpected current and 
future cash flow and collateral needs without adversely 
affecting either daily operations or financial conditions of 
the firm. This risk may be exacerbated by the inability of 
the firm to access funding sources or monetize assets and 
the composition of liability funding and liquid assets.
• Market risk (including price risk and interest rate risk) is 
the risk of loss arising from changes in the value of Citi’s 
assets and liabilities or reduced net interest revenues 
resulting from changes in market variables, such as 
interest rates, exchange rates, equity and commodity 
prices or credit spreads. Losses can be exacerbated by the 
negative convexity of positions, as well as the presence of 
basis or correlation risks.
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from 
inadequate or failed internal processes, people and 
systems, or from external events. It includes legal risk, 
which is the risk of loss (including litigation costs, 
settlements and regulatory fines) resulting from the failure 
of the firm to comply with laws, regulations, prudent 
ethical standards and contractual obligations in any aspect 
of the firm’s business, but excludes strategic and 
reputation risks (see below).
Compliance risk is the risk to current or projected 
financial conditions and resilience arising from violations 
of laws, rules or regulations, or from non-conformance 
with prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures 
or ethical standards. It also includes the exposure to 
litigation (known as legal risk) from all aspects of 
banking, traditional and non-traditional. 
Reputation risk is the risk to current or projected financial 
conditions and resilience arising from negative public 
opinion. This risk may impair Citi’s competitiveness by 
affecting its ability to establish new relationships or 
services or continue servicing existing relationships.
Strategic risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, 
capital, or franchise or enterprise value arising from poor, 
but authorized, business decisions (in compliance with 
regulations, policies and procedures), an inability to adapt 
to changes in the operating environment, or other external 
factors that may impair the ability to carry out a business 
strategy. Strategic risk also includes:

•

•

•

◦

Country risk, which is the risk that conditions in a 
country (which may be precipitated by developments 
within or external to a country) will impair the value 
of Citi’s franchise or will adversely affect the ability 
of obligors within that country to honor their 

66

obligations to Citi. Country risk includes sovereign 
defaults, banking crises, currency crises, currency 
convertibility and/or transferability restrictions or 
political developments.

Citi uses a lines of defense construct to manage its risks. 

The construct comprises units that create risks (first line of 
defense), those that independently assess risk (second line of 
defense), units that provide independent assurance (third line 
of defense) and units tasked with maintaining a strong control 
environment (control and support functions). The lines of 
defense, which include control and support functions, 
coordinate with each other in the risk management system in 
support of the common goal of identifying, measuring, 
monitoring and controlling risk-taking activities so they 
remain consistent with the firm’s strategy and risk appetite.

First Line of Defense: Front Line Units and Front Line 
Unit Activities
Citi’s first line of defense owns the risks inherent in or arising 
from their business and is responsible for identifying, 
assessing and controlling those risks so that they are within 
Citi’s risk appetite. 

Front line units are responsible and held accountable for 
managing the risks associated with their activities within the 
boundaries set by independent risk management. They are also 
responsible for designing and implementing effective internal 
controls and maintaining processes for managing their risk 
profile, including through risk mitigation, so that it remains 
consistent with Citi’s established risk appetite.

Front line unit activities are considered part of the first 

line of defense and are subject to the oversight and challenge 
of independent risk management, whether they are conducted 
by a front line unit or another line of defense designation. Note 
that front line units may also conduct control and support 
activities which are subject to the relevant firm-wide 
independent oversight processes specific to the risk category 
that they generate (e.g., operational risk, compliance risk, 
reputation risk).

The first line of defense is composed of Citi’s Business 
Management (Global Consumer Bank (GCB) and Institutional 
Clients Group (ICG)), Regional and Country Management, 
certain Corporate Functions (Enterprise Infrastructure, 
Operations and Technology (EIO&T) and Finance), as well as 
other front line unit activities.

Second Line of Defense: Independent risk management
Independent risk management units are independent of front 
line units. They are responsible for overseeing the risk-taking 
activities of the first line of defense and challenging the first 
line of defense in the execution of their risk management 
responsibilities. They are also responsible for independently 
identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling aggregate 
risks and for setting standards for the management and 
oversight of risk. At Citi, the second line of defense is defined 
to include Independent Risk Management and Independent 
Compliance Risk Management (ICRM). Independent Risk 
Management and ICRM report to Citi’s Chief Risk Officer 
and Chief Compliance Officer (CCO), respectively, both of 
whom report directly to the Citigroup CEO and have 

67

unrestricted access to the Citigroup Board of Directors or its 
committees.

Independent Risk Management
The Independent Risk Management organization sets risk and 
control standards for the first line of defense and actively 
manages and oversees aggregate credit, market (price and 
interest rate), liquidity, strategic, operational, compliance and 
reputation risks across the firm, including risks that span 
categories, such as concentration risk. 

Independent Risk Management is organized to align to 

businesses, regions, types of risk and to firm-wide, cross-risk 
functions or processes. There are teams that report to an 
independent Chief Risk Officer (CRO) for Citi’s businesses 
(Business CROs, including Finance Chief Risk Officers) and 
regions / legal entities (Regional / Legal Entity CROs). In 
addition, there are risk-category-aligned teams that report to a 
Risk Category Head (e.g., Market Risk, Operational Risk, 
Model Risk) and foundational teams that report to a 
Foundational Risk Management Head (e.g., Risk Governance, 
Enterprise Concentration Risk Management, Global Risk 
Review). All of the above Risk Heads, together with the 
Business and Regional / Legal Entity CROs, report to the 
Citigroup CRO.

Independent Compliance Risk Management 
The Independent Compliance Risk Management organization 
is designed to oversee and challenge products, functions, 
jurisdictional activities and legal entities in managing 
compliance risk, as well as promoting business conduct and 
activity that is consistent with Citi’s mission and value 
proposition and the compliance risk appetite. Citi’s objective 
is to embed an enterprise-wide compliance risk management 
framework and culture that identifies, measures, monitors, 
controls and escalates compliance risk across the firm. 

Product Line, Function and Country ICRM provide 
compliance risk management advice and credible challenge on 
day-to-day matters and strategic decision-making for key 
initiatives. Additionally, Country ICRM provides advisory and 
challenge on regulatory and enterprise wide matters such as 
regulatory changes in a country. ICRM has program-level 
Enterprise Compliance units whose Heads are responsible for 
coordinating and managing their respective horizontal, 
enterprise-wide compliance programs, setting standards and 
establishing priorities for program-related compliance efforts.

Third Line of Defense: Internal Audit
Internal audit is independent of front line units and 
independent risk management units. Internal audit provides 
independent assurance to the Citigroup Board of Directors on 
the effectiveness of governance, risk management and internal 
controls. Internal audit reports to a chief audit executive (i.e., 
Citi’s Chief Auditor) who has unrestricted access to the Board 
or its audit committee to facilitate the ability to execute 
specific responsibilities pertaining to escalation of risks and 
issues. 

The Internal Audit function has designated Chief Auditors 

responsible for assessing the design and effectiveness of 
controls within the various business units, functions, 
geographies and legal entities in which Citi operates.

The Citigroup Chief Auditor manages Internal Audit and 

maintains its independence from the front line units, 
Independent Risk Management, ICRM and control and 
support functions by reporting functionally to the Chairman of 
the Citigroup Audit Committee and administratively to the 
Citigroup CEO.

Control and Support Functions
Control and support functions do not meet the definition of 
front line unit, independent risk management or internal audit. 
While they do not report into the CRO or CCO, they are 
expected to design, implement and maintain an effective 
control environment with respect to the risks they generate, 
and also support safety and soundness. 

At Citi, the control and support functions are defined to 

include the following organizational units: Chief 
Administrative Office, Global Public Affairs, Human 
Resources, International Franchise Management, Legal 
(including Citi Security & Investigative Services) and the 
Office of the CBNA CEO.

Board and Executive Management
The Citigroup Board of Directors, both directly or through its 
committees, actively oversees Citi’s risk taking activities and 
holds management accountable for adhering to the risk 
governance framework. The primary responsibility of the 
Citigroup Board is to provide effective governance over Citi’s 
affairs for the benefit of its stakeholders. Directors have full 
and free access to management.

The standing committees of the Citigroup Board are the 
Risk Management Committee, Audit Committee, Personnel 
and Compensation Committee, Ethics, Conduct and Culture 
Committee and Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs 
Committee. 

The Board delegates authority to the Executive 

Management Team, which consists of the Citigroup CEO and
certain direct reports of the CEO, for directing and overseeing 
day-to-day management of the firm. The Executive 
Management Team is responsible for developing and 
implementing policies, procedures and processes that translate 
the Board’s goals, strategic objectives and risk appetite and 
limits into prudent standards for the safe and sound operation 
of the firm.

The Executive Management Team reports to the Board on 

the firm’s overall risk profile, including aggregate and 
emerging risks, and provides the Board with information about 
current and potential risk exposures and their potential impact 
on earnings, capital and strategic objectives.

Executive Management committees have been designed 

to cover all primary risks to which Citi is exposed. These 
Executive Management committees escalate to standing 
committees of the Board. The standing Executive 
Management committees are the Group Risk Management 
Committee, Group Strategic Risk Committee, Citigroup Asset 
& Liability Committee, Group Business, Risk and Control 
Committee and Group Reputation Risk Committee.

CREDIT RISK

Overview
Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the decline in 
credit quality of a client, customer or counterparty (or 
downgrade risk) or the failure of a borrower, counterparty, 
third party or issuer to honor its financial or contractual 
obligations. Credit risk arises in many of Citigroup’s business 
activities, including:

•
•
•
•

consumer, commercial and corporate lending; 
capital markets derivative transactions; 
structured finance; and 
securities financing transactions (repurchase and reverse 
repurchase agreements, and securities loaned and 
borrowed).

Credit risk also arises from clearing and settlement 
activities, when Citi transfers an asset in advance of receiving 
its counter-value or advances funds to settle a transaction on 
behalf of a client. Concentration risk, within credit risk, is the 
risk associated with having credit exposure concentrated 
within a specific client, industry, region or other category.

Credit risk is one of the most significant risks Citi faces as 

an institution. For additional information, see “Risk Factors—
Credit Risk” above. As a result, Citi has a well-established 
framework in place for managing credit risk across all 
businesses. This includes a defined risk appetite, credit limits 
and credit policies, both at the business level as well as at the 
Company-wide level. Citi’s credit risk management also 
includes processes and policies with respect to problem 
recognition, including “watch lists,” portfolio reviews, stress 
tests, updated risk ratings and classification triggers. 

With respect to Citi’s clearing and settlement activities, 

intraday client usage of clearing lines is monitored against 
limits, as well as against usage patterns with settlement 
activity monitored daily and intraday for select products. To 
the extent that a problem develops, Citi typically moves the 
client to a secured (collateralized) operating model. Generally, 
Citi’s intraday clearing and settlement lines are uncommitted 
and cancelable at any time.

To manage concentration of risk within credit risk, Citi 

has in place a framework consisting of industry limits, an 
idiosyncratic framework consisting of single name 
concentrations for each business and across Citigroup and a 
specialized framework consisting of product limits.

Credit exposures are generally reported in notional terms 

for accrual loans, reflecting the value at which the loans as 
well as other off-balance sheet commitments are carried on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Credit exposure arising from 
capital markets activities is generally expressed as the current 
mark-to-market, net of margin, reflecting the net value owed 
to Citi by a given counterparty. 

The credit risk associated with these credit exposures is a 
function of the idiosyncratic creditworthiness of the obligor, as 
well as the terms and conditions of the specific obligation. Citi 
assesses the credit risk associated with its credit exposures on 
a regular basis through its ACL process (see “Significant 
Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates—Allowance 
for Credit Losses” below and Notes 1 and 15 to the 

68

Consolidated Financial Statements), as well as through regular 
stress testing at the company, business, geography and product 
levels. These stress-testing processes typically estimate 
potential incremental credit costs that would occur as a result 
of either downgrades in the credit quality or defaults of the 
obligors or counterparties.

For additional information on Citi’s credit risk 
management, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements. 

CONSUMER CREDIT
Citi provides traditional retail banking, including small 
business banking, and credit card products in 19 countries and 
jurisdictions through North America GCB, Latin America 
GCB and Asia GCB. The retail banking products include 
consumer mortgages, home equity, personal and small 
business loans and lines of credit and similar related products 
with a focus on lending to prime customers. Citi uses its risk 
appetite framework to define its lending parameters. In 
addition, Citi uses proprietary and/or industry scoring models 
for new customer approvals. 

As stated in “Global Consumer Banking” above, GCB’s 

strategy is to leverage its global footprint and digital 
capabilities to develop multiproduct relationships with
customers, both in and out of Citi’s branch footprint.

Overall Consumer Credit Trends
The following charts show the quarterly trends in delinquency 
rates (90+ days past due (90+ DPD) ratio) and the net credit 
loss (NCL) rates across both retail banking and cards for total 
GCB and by region. 

Global Consumer Banking

North America GCB

As shown in the chart above, GCB’s net credit loss rates 

decreased significantly year-over-year and quarter-over-
quarter as of the fourth quarter of 2020, primarily due to the 
impacts of the consumer relief programs Citi implemented 
since the beginning of the pandemic, combined with the 
benefit of reduced customer spending and significant 
government stimulus and assistance, as well as other banks’ 
consumer relief programs. 

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased quarter-

over-quarter, largely due to the expiration of the pandemic 
relief programs in certain countries. The 90+ days past due 
delinquency rate was largely unchanged year-over-year. 
As discussed above, loans modified under Citi’s 

consumer relief programs continue to be reported in the same 
delinquency bucket they were in at the time of modification 
and, thus, would not be reported as 90+ days past due or 
written off for the duration of the programs (which have 
various durations, and certain of which may be renewed by the 
customer). As a result of the significant and steady decline in
program enrollment, Citi ended its consumer relief programs
as of December 31, 2020 for the majority of countries and
products.

Citi expects to experience higher consumer net credit loss 

and 90+ days past due delinquency rates across regions, with 
sharper losses in Latin America GCB and Asia GCB starting in 
the near term. The losses will likely vary by business and 
region and be dependent on evolving macroeconomic and 
market conditions. These conditions include the severity and 
duration of the impact from the pandemic and the impacts of 
government stimulus programs, as well as the timing of 
expiration of consumer relief programs and when loans move 
into later delinquency buckets. Citi believes that these losses 
are adequately reserved for under the CECL standard at 
December 31, 2020. For additional information, see 
“COVID-19 Pandemic Overview—Pandemic and Other 
Impacts” above.

North America GCB provides mortgage, home equity, 
small business and personal loans through Citi’s retail banking 
network and card products through Citi-branded cards and Citi 
retail services businesses. The retail bank is concentrated in 
six major metropolitan cities in the U.S. (for additional 
information on the U.S. retail bank, see “North America GCB” 
above).

As of December 31, 2020, approximately 71% of North 
America GCB consumer loans consisted of Citi-branded and 
Citi retail services cards, which generally drives the overall 
credit performance of North America GCB (for additional 
information on North America GCB’s cards portfolios, 
including delinquency and net credit loss rates, see “Credit 
Card Trends” below).

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 

North America GCB decreased significantly quarter-over-
quarter and year-over-year as of the fourth quarter of 2020, 
driven by the impacts of the consumer relief programs 
described above, unemployment benefits and government 
stimulus. 

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased quarter-

over-quarter, primarily due to seasonality in cards and the 
impact of customers rolling off the consumer relief programs. 

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate modestly 
decreased year-over-year, primarily driven by the impacts of 
the consumer relief programs described above, unemployment 
benefits and government stimulus.

Latin America GCB

Latin America GCB operates in Mexico through 
Citibanamex, one of Mexico’s largest banks, and provides 
credit cards, consumer mortgages and small business and 
personal loans. Latin America GCB serves a more mass-
market segment in Mexico and focuses on developing 
multiproduct relationships with customers.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 

Latin America GCB decreased significantly quarter-over-
quarter and year-over-year as of the fourth quarter of 2020, 
largely driven by the impact of the consumer relief programs 
described above. The 90+ days past due delinquency rate 
increased significantly quarter-over-quarter and year-over-
year, due to the adverse pandemic-related macroeconomic 
impacts, as well as the expiration of most consumer relief 
programs in Mexico by September 2020. 

Asia(1) GCB 

Credit Card Trends
The following charts show the quarterly trends in 
delinquencies and net credit losses for total GCB cards, North 
America Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services portfolios, 
as well as for Citi’s Latin America and Asia Citi-branded cards 
portfolios.

Global Cards

(1)  Asia includes GCB activities in certain EMEA countries for all periods 

presented.

North America Citi-Branded Cards

Asia GCB operates in 17 countries and jurisdictions in 

Asia and EMEA and provides credit cards, consumer 
mortgages and small business and personal loans.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss and 90+ 

days past due delinquency rates in Asia GCB increased 
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year as of the fourth 
quarter of 2020, driven by the adverse pandemic-related 
macroeconomic impacts in the region as well as the expiration 
of consumer relief programs, which generally have ended 
earlier than in Mexico and North America.

The performance of Asia GCB’s portfolios, with a 1.16% 

net credit loss rate, continues to reflect the strong credit 
profiles in the region’s target customer segments. Regulatory 
changes in many markets in Asia over the past few years have 
also resulted in improved credit quality.

For additional information on cost of credit, loan 
delinquency and other information for Citi’s consumer loan 
portfolios, see each respective business’s results of operations 
above and Notes 14 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.

North America GCB’s Citi-branded cards portfolio issues 

proprietary and co-branded cards. 

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 
Citi-branded cards decreased quarter-over-quarter and year-
over-year as of the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by the 
impact of the consumer relief programs described above, 
unemployment benefits and government stimulus. The 90+ 
days past due delinquency rate decreased year-over-year for 
the same reasons, while it increased quarter-over-quarter as a 
result of seasonality and the impact of customers rolling off 
the consumer relief programs described above.

(1) As discussed above, loans modified under Citi’s consumer relief programs continue to be reported in the same delinquency bucket they were in at the time of 

modification (which have various durations, and certain of which may be renewed by the customer).

(2) End-of-period (EOP) loans include interest and fees on credit cards.
(3) The ratios of 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due are calculated based on EOP loans, net of unearned income.
(4) The 90+ days past due balances for North America—Citi-branded and North America—Citi retail services are generally still accruing interest. Citigroup’s policy is 

generally to accrue interest on credit card loans until 180 days past due, unless notification of bankruptcy filing has been received earlier.

(5) The 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios for North America GCB exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are guaranteed by U.S. government-
sponsored agencies, since the potential loss predominantly resides within the agencies. The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past due and (EOP loans) were 
$171 million ($0.7 billion), $135 million ($0.5 billion) and $211 million ($0.7 billion) at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The amounts excluded 
for loans 30–89 days past due (the 30—89 days past due EOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP loans) were $98 million, $72 million 
and $86 million at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

(6) Asia includes delinquencies and loans in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.
(7) The 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies, since 
the potential loss predominantly resides within the agencies. The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past due and (EOP loans) were $183 million ($0.5 billion), 
$172 million ($0.4 billion) and $367 million ($.8 billion) at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The amounts excluded for loans 30–89 days past 
due (the 30—89 days past due EOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP loans) were $73 million, $55 million and $122 million at

management and trade services, foreign exchange, lending, 
capital markets and M&A advisory. Citi’s corporate credit
exposures also include exposures in the private bank,
excluding certain loans managed on a delinquency basis. 

Corporate Credit Portfolio

commodity prices. Facility risk ratings are assigned that reflect 
the probability of default of the obligor and factors that affect 
the loss given default of the facility, such as support or 
collateral. Internal obligor ratings that generally correspond to 
BBB and above are considered investment grade, while those 
below are considered non-investment grade.

The following table presents the corporate credit portfolio 

(excluding the delinquency-managed private bank portfolio) 
by facility risk rating as a percentage of the total corporate 
credit portfolio:

Note: Total exposure includes direct outstandings and unfunded lending 
commitments. 

The maintenance of accurate and consistent risk ratings 
across the corporate credit portfolio facilitates the comparison 
of credit exposure across all lines of business, geographic 
regions and products. Counterparty risk ratings reflect an 
estimated probability of default for a counterparty and are 
derived by leveraging validated statistical models, scorecard 
models and external agency ratings (under defined 
circumstances), in combination with consideration of factors 
specific to the obligor or market, such as management 
experience, competitive position, regulatory environment and

In addition to the obligor and facility risk ratings assigned 

to all exposures, Citi may classify exposures in the corporate 
credit portfolio. These classifications are consistent with Citi’s 
interpretation of the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of 
criticized exposures, which may categorize exposures as 
special mention, substandard, doubtful, or loss.

Risk ratings and classifications are reviewed regularly, 

and adjusted as appropriate. The credit review process 
incorporates quantitative and qualitative factors, including 
financial and non-financial disclosures or metrics, 
idiosyncratic events or changes to the competitive, regulatory 
or macroeconomic environment. This includes but is not 
limited to exposures in those sectors significantly impacted by 
the pandemic (including energy and energy-related, consumer 
retail, commercial real estate and transportation). 

Citigroup believes the corporate credit portfolio to be 

appropriately rated and classified as of December 31, 2020. 
During the year and since the onset of the COVID-19 
pandemic, Citigroup has taken action to adjust internal ratings 
and classifications of exposures as both the macroeconomic 
environment and obligor-specific factors have changed, 
particularly where additional stress has been seen. 

As obligor risk ratings are downgraded, the probability of 

default increases. Downgrades of obligor risk ratings tend to 
result in a higher provision for credit losses. In addition, 
downgrades may result in the purchase of additional credit 
derivatives or other risk mitigants to hedge the incremental 
credit risk, or may result in Citi seeking to reduce exposure to 
an obligor or an industry sector. Citi will continue to review 
exposures to ensure the appropriate probability of default is 
incorporated into all risk assessments.

For additional information on Citi’s corporate credit 

portfolio, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.

Exposure to Commercial Real Estate
As of December 31, 2020, ICG’s total corporate credit 
exposure to commercial real estate (CRE) was $58 billion, 
with $41 billion consisting of direct outstanding funded loans 
(mainly included in the real estate and private bank categories 
in the above table), or 6% of Citi’s total outstanding loans. In 
addition, as of December 31, 2020, more than 70% of ICG’s 
total corporate CRE exposure was to borrowers in the United 
States. Also as of December 31, 2020, approximately 77% of 
ICG’s total corporate CRE exposure was rated investment 
grade.

As of December 31, 2020, the ACLL was 1.8% of funded 

CRE exposure, including 5.1% of funded non-investment 
grade exposure.

Of the total CRE exposure:

•

•

$20 billion of the exposure ($13 billion of direct 
outstanding funded loans) relates to Community 
Reinvestment Act-related lending provided pursuant to 
Citi’s regulatory requirements to meet the credit needs of 
borrowers in low and moderate income neighborhoods.
$13 billion of the exposure ($12 billion of direct 
outstanding funded loans) relates to exposure secured by 
mortgages on underlying properties or in well-rated 
securitization exposures.
$13 billion of the exposure ($5 billion of direct 
outstanding funded loans) relates to unsecured loans to 
large REITs, with nearly 75% of the exposure rated 
investment grade.
$12 billion of the exposure ($11 billion of direct 
outstanding funded loans) relates to CRE exposure in the 
private bank, of which 100% is secured by mortgages. In 
addition, 45% of the exposure is also full recourse to the 
client. As of December 31, 2020, 77% of the exposure 
was rated investment grade.

Credit Risk Mitigation
As part of its overall risk management activities, Citigroup 
uses credit derivatives and other risk mitigants to hedge 
portions of the credit risk in its corporate credit portfolio, in 
addition to outright asset sales. Citi may enter into partial-term 
hedges as well as full-term hedges. In advance of the 
expiration of partial-term hedges, Citi will determine, among 
other factors, the economic feasibility of hedging the 
remaining life of the instrument. The results of the mark-to-
market and any realized gains or losses on credit derivatives 
are reflected primarily in Principal transactions in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income.

At December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020 and 

December 31, 2019, ICG (excluding the delinquency-managed 
private bank portfolio) had economic hedges on the corporate 
credit portfolio of $38.8 billion, $38.4 billion and 
$32.1 billion, respectively. Citigroup’s expected credit loss 
model used in the calculation of its ACL does not include the 
favorable impact of credit derivatives and other mitigants that 
are marked to market. In addition, the reported amounts of 
direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments in the 
tables above do not reflect the impact of these hedging 
transactions. The credit protection was economically hedging 
underlying ICG (excluding the delinquency-managed private 
bank portfolio) corporate credit portfolio exposures with the 
following risk rating distribution:

(1) North America includes the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Mexico is included in offices outside North America. The classification of corporate loans between 

offices in North America and outside North America is based on the domicile of the booking unit. The difference between the domicile of the booking unit and the 
domicile of the managing unit is not material.

(2) Loans secured primarily by real estate.
(3) Consumer loans are net of unearned income of $749 million, $783 million, $742 million, $768 million and $803 million at December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017 

and 2016, respectively. Unearned income on consumer loans primarily represents unamortized origination fees and costs, premiums and discounts. 

(4) Corporate loans include private bank loans and are net of unearned income of $(844) million, $(814) million, $(855) million, $(794) million and $(730) million at 
December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Unearned income on corporate loans primarily represents interest received in advance, but not yet 
earned, on loans originated on a discounted basis.

(5) Because loans carried at fair value do not have an ACLL, they are excluded from the ACLL ratio calculation.

(1) On January 1, 2020, Citi adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 326, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (CECL). The ASC introduces a new credit 
loss methodology requiring earlier recognition of credit losses while also providing additional disclosure about credit risk. On January 1, 2020, Citi recorded a 
$4.1 billion, or an approximate 29%, pretax increase in the Allowance for credit losses, along with a $3.1 billion after-tax decrease in Retained earnings and a 
deferred tax asset increase of $1.0 billion. This transition impact reflects (i) a $4.9 billion build to the Consumer ACL due to longer estimated tenors than under 
the incurred loss methodology under prior U.S. GAAP, net of recoveries; and (ii) a $0.8 billion decrease to the Corporate ACL due to shorter remaining tenors, 
incorporation of recoveries and use of more specific historical loss data based on an increase in portfolio segmentation across industries and geographies. See Note 
1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the impact of Citi’s adoption of CECL.

(2) Citi had a change in accounting related to its variable post-charge-off third-party collection costs which was recorded as an adjustment to its January 1, 2020 

(3)

opening allowance for credit losses on loans of $443 million. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Includes all adjustments to the ACL, such as changes in the allowance from acquisitions, dispositions, securitizations, FX translation, purchase accounting 
adjustments, etc.
2020 includes reductions of approximately $4 million related to the transfer to HFS of various real estate loan portfolios. In addition, 2020 includes an increase of 
approximately $97 million related to FX translation.
2019 includes reductions of approximately $42 million related to the transfer to HFS of various real estate loan portfolios. In addition, 2019 includes an increase 
of approximately $60 million related to FX translation.
2018 includes reductions of approximately $201 million related to the sale or transfer to HFS of various loan portfolios, which include approximately $91 million 
related to the transfer of various real estate loan portfolios to HFS. In addition, 2018 includes a reduction of approximately $60 million related to FX translation.
2017 includes reductions of approximately $261 million related to the sale or transfer to HFS of various loan portfolios, which include approximately $106 million 
related to the transfer of various real estate loan portfolios to HFS. In addition, 2017 includes an increase of approximately $115 million related to FX translation.
2016 includes reductions of approximately $574 million related to the sale or transfer to HFS of various loan portfolios, which include approximately $106 million 
related to the transfer of various real estate loan portfolios to HFS. In addition, 2016 includes a reduction of approximately $199 million related to FX translation.

(9) December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016 exclude $6.9 billion, $4.1 billion, $3.2 billion, $4.4 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively, of loans which are 

carried at fair value.

(10) 2020 corporate ACLUC includes a non-provision transfer of $68 million, representing reserves on performance guarantees. The reserves on these contracts were 

reclassified out of the ACL on unfunded lending commitments and into other liabilities.

(11) Represents additional credit reserves recorded as Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
(12) Beginning in 2020, under CECL, the ACLL represents management’s estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio.and troubled debt restructurings. See 
“Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements below. Attribution of the ACLL is made for 
analytical purposes only and the entire ACLL is available to absorb credit losses in the overall portfolio. Prior to 2020, the ACLL represented management’s 
estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio, as well as probable losses related to large individually evaluated impaired loans and TDRs. See “Superseded 
Accounting Principles” in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans (ACLL)
The following tables detail information on Citi’s ACLL, loans and coverage ratios. The December 31, 2020 table reflects the impact 
from the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption and the impact from the pandemic. The December 31, 2019 table is presented under the 
previous accounting standard (see “Superseded Accounting Principles” in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Non-Accrual Loans and Assets and Renegotiated Loans
There is a certain amount of overlap among non-accrual loans 
and assets and renegotiated loans. The following summary 
provides a general description of each category.

Non-Accrual Loans and Assets:

•

•

•

•

•

Corporate and consumer (including commercial banking) 
non-accrual status is based on the determination that 
payment of interest or principal is doubtful.
A corporate loan may be classified as non-accrual and still 
be performing under the terms of the loan structure. Non-
accrual loans may still be current on interest payments. 
Approximately 59%, 58% and 44% of Citi’s corporate 
non-accrual loans were performing at December 31, 2020, 
September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.
Consumer non-accrual status is generally based on aging, 
i.e., the borrower has fallen behind on payments.
Consumer mortgage loans, other than Federal Housing 
Administration (FHA) insured loans, are classified as 
non-accrual within 60 days of notification that the 
borrower has filed for bankruptcy. In addition, home 
equity loans are classified as non-accrual if the related 
residential first mortgage loan is 90 days or more past 
due.
North America Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services 
are not included because, under industry standards, credit 
card loans accrue interest until such loans are charged off, 
which typically occurs at 180 days of contractual 
delinquency.

Renegotiated Loans:

•

•

Includes both corporate and consumer loans whose terms 
have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring 
(TDR).
Includes both accrual and non-accrual TDRs.

87

Non-Accrual Loans
The table below summarizes Citigroup’s non-accrual loans as 
of the periods indicated. Non-accrual loans may still be current 
on interest payments. In situations where Citi reasonably 
expects that only a portion of the principal owed will 
ultimately be collected, all payments received are reflected as 
a reduction of principal and not as interest income. For all 
other non-accrual loans, cash interest receipts are generally 
recorded as revenue.

LIQUIDITY RISK

Overview
Adequate and diverse sources of funding and liquidity are 
essential to Citi’s businesses. Funding and liquidity risks arise 
from several factors, many of which are mostly or entirely 
outside Citi’s control, such as disruptions in the financial 
markets, changes in key funding sources, credit spreads, 
changes in Citi’s credit ratings and macroeconomic, 
geopolitical and other conditions. For additional information, 
see “Risk Factors—Liquidity Risks” above.

Citi’s funding and liquidity management objectives are 

aimed at (i) funding its existing asset base, (ii) growing its 
core businesses, (iii) maintaining sufficient liquidity, 
structured appropriately, so that Citi can operate under a 
variety of adverse circumstances, including potential 
Company-specific and/or market liquidity events in varying 
durations and severity, and (iv) satisfying regulatory 
requirements, including, among other things, those related to 
resolution planning (for additional information, see 
“Resolution Plan” and “Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity 
(TLAC)” below). Citigroup’s primary liquidity objectives are 
established by entity, and in aggregate, across two major 
categories:

•

•

Citibank (including Citibank Europe plc, Citibank 
Singapore Ltd. and Citibank (Hong Kong) Ltd.); and
Citi’s non-bank and other entities, including the parent 
holding company (Citigroup Inc.), Citi’s primary 
intermediate holding company (Citicorp LLC), Citi’s 
broker-dealer subsidiaries (including Citigroup Global 
Markets Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Ltd. and 
Citigroup Global Markets Japan Inc.) and other bank and 
non-bank subsidiaries that are consolidated into Citigroup 
(including Citibanamex).

At an aggregate Citigroup level, Citi’s goal is to maintain 
sufficient funding in amount and tenor to fully fund customer 
assets and to provide an appropriate amount of cash and high-
quality liquid assets (as discussed below), even in times of 
stress, in order to meet its payment obligations as they come 
due. The liquidity risk management framework provides that 
in addition to the aggregate requirements, certain entities be 
self-sufficient or net providers of liquidity, including in 
conditions established under their designated stress tests.

Citi’s primary sources of funding include (i) deposits via 

Citi’s bank subsidiaries, which are Citi’s most stable and 
lowest cost source of long-term funding, (ii) long-term debt 
(primarily senior and subordinated debt) primarily issued at 
the parent and certain bank subsidiaries, and (iii) stockholders’ 
equity. These sources may be supplemented by short-term 
borrowings, primarily in the form of secured funding 
transactions.

As referenced above, Citi’s funding and liquidity 

framework ensures that the tenor of these funding sources is of 
sufficient term in relation to the tenor of its asset base. The 
goal of Citi’s asset/liability management is to ensure that there 
is sufficient liquidity and tenor in the liability structure relative 
to the liquidity profile of the assets. This reduces the risk that 
liabilities will become due before assets mature or are 
monetized. This excess liquidity is held primarily in the form 
of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA), as set forth in the table 
below. 

Citi’s liquidity is managed via a centralized treasury 

model by Treasury, in conjunction with regional and in-
country treasurers with oversight provided by Independent 
Risk Management and various Asset & Liability Committees 
(ALCOs) at the Citigroup, region, country and business levels. 
Pursuant to this approach, Citi’s HQLA is managed with 
emphasis on asset-liability management and entity-level 
liquidity adequacy throughout Citi.

The Chief Risk Officer and Citi’s CFO co-chair 

Citigroup’s ALCO, which includes Citi’s Treasurer and other 
senior executives. ALCOs, among other things, set the 
strategy of the liquidity portfolio and monitor its performance. 
Significant changes to portfolio asset allocations need to be 
approved by the ALCOs.

Liquidity Monitoring and Measurement

Stress Testing 
Liquidity stress testing is performed for each of Citi’s major 
entities, operating subsidiaries and/or countries. Stress testing 
and scenario analyses are intended to quantify the potential 
impact of an adverse liquidity event on the balance sheet and 
liquidity position, and to identify viable funding alternatives 
that can be utilized. These scenarios include assumptions 
about significant changes in key funding sources, market 
triggers (such as credit ratings), potential uses of funding and 
macroeconomic, geopolitical and other conditions. These 
conditions include expected and stressed market conditions as 
well as Company-specific events.

Liquidity stress tests are performed to ascertain potential 
mismatches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety 
of time horizons and over different stressed conditions. To 
monitor the liquidity of an entity, these stress tests and 
potential mismatches are calculated with varying frequencies, 
with several tests performed daily.

Given the range of potential stresses, Citi maintains 

contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis and for 
individual entities. These plans specify a wide range of readily 
available actions for a variety of adverse market conditions or 
idiosyncratic stresses.

Note: The amounts set forth in the table above are presented on an average basis. For securities, the amounts represent the liquidity value that potentially could be 
realized and, therefore, exclude any securities that are encumbered and incorporate any haircuts applicable under the U.S. LCR rule. The table above incorporates 
various restrictions that could limit the transferability of liquidity between legal entities, including Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.
(1)   Foreign government debt includes securities issued or guaranteed by foreign sovereigns, agencies and multilateral development banks. Foreign government debt 
securities are held largely to support local liquidity requirements and Citi’s local franchises and principally include government bonds from Japan, Mexico, 
Singapore, South Korea and Hong Kong.

The table above includes average amounts of HQLA held at 
Citigroup’s operating entities that are eligible for inclusion in 
the calculation of Citigroup’s consolidated Liquidity Coverage 
ratio (LCR), pursuant to the U.S. LCR rules. These amounts 
include the HQLA needed to meet the minimum requirements 
at these entities and any amounts in excess of these minimums 
that are assumed to be transferable to other entities within 
Citigroup. 

Citigroup’s HQLA increased quarter-over-quarter as of 
the fourth quarter of 2020, primarily reflecting an increase in 
average long-term non-bank debt. While deposit growth and a 
decline in loans increased liquidity at Citibank, a significant 
amount of this liquidity was assumed not to be transferable to 
other entities within Citigroup and therefore not included in 
Citi’s consolidated HQLA. 

As of December 31, 2020, Citigroup had $972 billion of 

available liquidity resources to support client and business 
needs, including end-of-period HQLA assets; additional 
unencumbered securities, including excess liquidity held at 
bank entities that is non-transferable to other entities within 
Citigroup; and available assets not already accounted for 
within Citi’s HQLA to support Federal Home Loan Bank 
(FHLB) and Federal Reserve Bank discount window 
borrowing capacity.

Short-Term Liquidity Measurement: Liquidity Coverage 
Ratio (LCR)
In addition to internal 30-day liquidity stress testing performed 
for Citi’s major entities, operating subsidiaries and countries, 
Citi also monitors its liquidity by reference to the LCR.

Generally, the LCR is designed to ensure that banks 
maintain an adequate level of HQLA to meet liquidity needs 
under an acute 30-day stress scenario. The LCR is calculated 
by dividing HQLA by estimated net outflows over a stressed 
30-day period, with the net outflows determined by applying 
prescribed outflow factors to various categories of liabilities, 
such as deposits, unsecured and secured wholesale 
borrowings, unused lending commitments and derivatives-
related exposures, partially offset by inflows from assets 
maturing within 30 days. Banks are required to calculate an 
add-on to address potential maturity mismatches between 
contractual cash outflows and inflows within the 30-day 
period in determining the total amount of net outflows. The 
minimum LCR requirement is 100%.

 The table below details the components of Citi’s LCR 

calculation and HQLA in excess of net outflows for the 
periods indicated:

Long-Term Liquidity Measurement: Net Stable Funding 
Ratio (NSFR)
On October 20, 2020, the U.S. banking agencies adopted a 
final rule to assess the availability of a bank’s stable funding 
against a required level. The intended purpose of the final rule 
is to support the ability of financial institutions to provide 
financial intermediation to businesses and households across a 
range of market conditions and reduce the possibility of 
funding shocks compromising a financial institution’s liquidity 
position. 

In general, a bank’s available stable funding will include 

portions of equity, deposits and long-term debt, while its 
required stable funding will be based on the liquidity 
characteristics of its assets, derivatives and commitments. 
Standardized weightings will be required to be applied to the 
various asset and liabilities classes. The ratio of available 
stable funding to required stable funding will be required to be 
greater than 100%. 

The final rule becomes effective beginning July 1, 2021 
while public disclosure requirements to report the ratio will 
occur on a semi-annual basis beginning June 30, 2023. Citi 
expects to be in compliance with the final rule when the rule is 
effective.

Loans
As part of its funding and liquidity objectives, Citi seeks to 
fund its existing asset base appropriately as well as maintain 
sufficient liquidity to grow its GCB and ICG businesses, 
including its loan portfolio. Citi maintains a diversified 
portfolio of loans to its consumer and institutional clients. The 
table below details the average loans, by business and/or 
segment, and the total end-of-period loans for each of the

On an average basis, loans declined 4% year-over-year 

and 2% quarter-over-quarter. Excluding the impact of FX 
translation, average loans also declined 4% year-over-year and 
2% sequentially. On this basis, average GCB loans declined 
6% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the impact of lower 
consumer spending in Citi’s cards businesses and higher 
payments by customers given high levels of liquidity due to 
fiscal stimulus.

Excluding the impact of FX translation, average ICG 

loans declined 3% year-over-year. Treasury and trade 
solutions (TTS) loans declined 10% year-over-year, reflecting 
softness in underlying trade flows and the continued low level 
of spend in commercial cards driven by the impact of the 
pandemic. Average corporate lending loans declined 6%, 
reflecting net repayments as Citi continued to assist its clients 
in accessing the capital markets, as well as lower loan demand 
given more muted economic activity. Average private bank 
loans increased 6%, largely driven by secured lending to high-
net-worth clients, including residential real estate lending. 
Average Corporate/Other loans continued to decline 

(down 29%), driven by the wind-down of legacy assets.

Long-Term Debt 
Long-term debt (generally defined as debt with original 
maturities of one year or more) represents the most significant 
component of Citi’s funding for the Citigroup parent company 
and Citi’s non-bank subsidiaries and is a supplementary source 
of funding for the bank entities. 

Long-term debt is an important funding source due in part 

to its multiyear contractual maturity structure. The weighted-
average maturity of unsecured long-term debt issued by 
Citigroup and its affiliates (including Citibank) with a 
remaining life greater than one year was approximately 
8.6 years as of December 31, 2020, unchanged from 
September 30, 2020 and an increase from the prior year. The 
weighted-average maturity is calculated based on the 
contractual maturity of each security. For securities that are 
redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the holder, the 
weighted-average maturity is calculated based on the earliest 
date an option becomes exercisable.

Citi’s long-term debt outstanding at the Citigroup parent 

company includes benchmark senior and subordinated debt 
and what Citi refers to as customer-related debt, consisting of 
structured notes, such as equity- and credit-linked notes, as 
well as non-structured notes. Citi’s issuance of customer-
related debt is generally driven by customer demand and 
complements benchmark debt issuance as a source of funding 
for Citi’s non-bank entities. Citi’s long-term debt at the bank 
includes bank notes, FHLB advances and securitizations.

Note: Amounts represent the current value of long-term debt on Citi’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheet that, for certain debt instruments, includes 
consideration of fair value, hedging impacts and unamortized discounts and 
premiums.
(1) Non-bank includes long-term debt issued to third parties by the parent 

holding company (Citigroup) and Citi’s non-bank subsidiaries (including 
broker-dealer subsidiaries) that are consolidated into Citigroup. As of 
December 31, 2020, non-bank included $56.4 billion of long-term debt 
issued by Citi’s broker-dealer and other subsidiaries, as well as certain 
Citigroup consolidated hedging activities.

(2) Local country and other includes debt issued by Citi’s affiliates in 
support of their local operations. Within non-bank, certain secured 
financing is also included. Within bank, borrowings under certain U.S. 
government-sponsored liquidity programs are also included. 
(3) Predominantly credit card securitizations, primarily backed by Citi-

branded credit card receivables.

As of the fourth quarter of 2020, Citi’s total long-term 
debt outstanding increased year-over-year, primarily driven by 
the issuance of unsecured benchmark senior debt and 
customer-related debt at the non-bank entities, as well as an 
increase in FHLB borrowings at the bank, partially offset by 
declines in unsecured benchmark senior debt and 
securitizations at the bank. Sequentially, long-term debt 
outstanding decreased, driven primarily by a decline in FHLB 
borrowings at the bank and local country and other debt at the 
non-bank, partially offset by higher customer-related debt at 
the non-bank.

As part of its liability management, Citi has considered, 

and may continue to consider, opportunities to redeem or 
repurchase its long-term debt pursuant to open market 
purchases, tender offers or other means. Such redemptions and 
repurchases help reduce Citi’s overall funding costs. During 
2020, Citi redeemed or repurchased $28.9 billion of its 
outstanding long-term debt.

Citigroup will be obligated to continue to transfer 
Contributable Assets to Citicorp over time, subject 
to certain amounts retained by Citigroup to, among 
other things, meet Citigroup’s near-term cash 
needs; 
in the event of a Citigroup bankruptcy, Citigroup 
will be required to contribute most of its remaining 
assets to Citicorp; and

(iv)

the obligations of both Citigroup and Citicorp under the 
Citi Support Agreement, as well as the Contributable 
Assets, are secured pursuant to a security agreement.

The Citi Support Agreement provides two mechanisms, 
besides Citicorp’s issuing of dividends to Citigroup, pursuant 
to which Citicorp will be required to transfer cash to Citigroup 
during business as usual so that Citigroup can fund its debt 
service as well as other operating needs: (i) one or more 
funding notes issued by Citicorp to Citigroup and (ii) a 
committed line of credit under which Citicorp may make loans 
to Citigroup. 

On December 17, 2019, the FRB and FDIC issued 
feedback on the resolution plans filed on July 1, 2019 by the 
eight U.S. GSIBs, including Citi. The FRB and FDIC 
identified one shortcoming, but no deficiencies, in Citi’s 
resolution plan relating to governance mechanisms. On July 1, 
2020, the FRB and FDIC provided information to the eight 
largest domestic banking organizations, including Citi, 
required to be included in the targeted resolution plans due on 
July 1, 2021.

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)
U.S. GSIBs are required to maintain minimum levels of TLAC 
and eligible LTD, each set by reference to the GSIB’s 
consolidated risk-weighted assets (RWA) and total leverage 
exposure. The intended purpose of the requirements is to 
facilitate the orderly resolution of U.S. GSIBs under the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act. For 
additional information, including Citi’s TLAC and LTD 
amounts and ratios, see “Capital Resources—Current 
Regulatory Capital Standards” and “Risk Factors—
Compliance Risks” above. 

Resolution Plan
Citi is required under Title I of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street 
Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank 
Act) and the rules promulgated by the FDIC and FRB to 
periodically submit a plan for Citi’s rapid and orderly 
resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of 
material financial distress or failure. For additional 
information on Citi’s resolution plan submissions, see “Risk 
Factors—Strategic Risks” above. Citigroup’s preferred 
resolution strategy is “single point of entry” under the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code. 

Under Citi’s preferred “single point of entry” resolution 

plan strategy, only Citigroup, the parent holding company, 
would enter into bankruptcy, while Citigroup’s material legal 
entities (as defined in the public section of its 2019 resolution 
plan, which can be found on the FRB’s and FDIC’s websites) 
would remain operational outside of any resolution or 
insolvency proceedings. Citigroup’s resolution plan has been 
designed to minimize the risk of systemic impact to the U.S. 
and global financial systems, while maximizing the value of 
the bankruptcy estate for the benefit of Citigroup’s creditors, 
including its unsecured long-term debt holders. 

In addition, in line with the Federal Reserve’s final total 

loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) rule, Citigroup believes it has 
developed the resolution plan so that Citigroup’s shareholders 
and unsecured creditors—including its unsecured long-term 
debt holders—bear any losses resulting from Citigroup’s 
bankruptcy. Accordingly, any value realized by holders of its 
unsecured long-term debt may not be sufficient to repay the 
amounts owed to such debt holders in the event of a 
bankruptcy or other resolution proceeding of Citigroup.

The FDIC has also indicated that it was developing a 

single point of entry strategy to implement the Orderly 
Liquidation Authority under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act, 
which provides the FDIC with the ability to resolve a firm 
when it is determined that bankruptcy would have serious 
adverse effects on financial stability in the U.S.

As previously disclosed, in response to feedback received 

from the Federal Reserve and FDIC, Citigroup took the 
following actions:

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

Citicorp LLC (Citicorp), an existing wholly owned 
subsidiary of Citigroup, was established as an 
intermediate holding company (an IHC) for certain of 
Citigroup’s operating material legal entities;
Citigroup executed an inter-affiliate agreement with 
Citicorp, Citigroup’s operating material legal entities 
and certain other affiliated entities pursuant to which 
Citicorp is required to provide liquidity and capital 
support to Citigroup’s operating material legal entities 
in the event Citigroup were to enter bankruptcy 
proceedings (Citi Support Agreement); 
pursuant to the Citi Support Agreement:

•

Citigroup made an initial contribution of assets, 
including certain high-quality liquid assets and 
inter-affiliate loans (Contributable Assets), to 
Citicorp, and Citicorp became the business-as-
usual funding vehicle for Citigroup’s operating 
material legal entities;

SECURED FUNDING TRANSACTIONS AND SHORT-
TERM BORROWINGS
Citi supplements its primary sources of funding with short-
term financings that generally include (i) secured funding 
transactions consisting of securities loaned or sold under 
agreements to repurchase, i.e., repos, and (ii) to a lesser extent, 
short-term borrowings consisting of commercial paper and 
borrowings from the FHLB and other market participants. 

Secured Funding Transactions
Secured funding is primarily accessed through Citi’s broker-
dealer subsidiaries to fund efficiently both (i) secured lending 
activity and (ii) a portion of the securities inventory held in the 
context of market making and customer activities. Citi also 
executes a smaller portion of its secured funding transactions 
through its bank entities, which are typically collateralized by 
government debt securities. Generally, daily changes in the 
level of Citi’s secured funding are primarily due to 
fluctuations in secured lending activity in the matched book 
(as described below) and securities inventory. 

Secured funding of $200 billion as of December 31, 2020 

increased 20% from the prior year and declined 4% from the 
prior quarter. Excluding the impact of FX translation, secured 
funding decreased 16% from the prior year and declined 7% 
sequentially, both driven by normal business activity. Average 
balances for secured funding were $227 billion for the quarter 
ended December 31, 2020.

The portion of secured funding in the broker-dealer 
subsidiaries that funds secured lending is commonly referred 
to as “matched book” activity. The majority of this activity is 
secured by high-quality liquid securities such as U.S. Treasury 

securities, U.S. agency securities and foreign government debt 
securities. Other secured funding is secured by less liquid 
securities, including equity securities, corporate bonds and 
asset-backed securities, the tenor of which is generally equal 
to or longer than the tenor of the corresponding matched book 
assets.

The remainder of the secured funding activity in the 
broker-dealer subsidiaries serves to fund securities inventory 
held in the context of market making and customer activities. 
To maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market 
conditions, including under periods of stress, Citi manages 
these activities by taking into consideration the quality of the 
underlying collateral and establishing minimum required 
funding tenors. The weighted average maturity of Citi’s 
secured funding of less liquid securities inventory was greater 
than 110 days as of December 31, 2020.

Citi manages the risks in its secured funding by 

conducting daily stress tests to account for changes in 
capacity, tenor, haircut, collateral profile and client actions. In 
addition, Citi maintains counterparty diversification by 
establishing concentration triggers and assessing counterparty 
reliability and stability under stress. Citi generally sources 
secured funding from more than 150 counterparties.

Short-Term Borrowings
Citi’s short-term borrowings of $30 billion as of the fourth 
quarter of 2020 decreased 34% year-over-year and 21% 
sequentially, primarily driven by a decline in FHLB advances 
(see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for 
further information on Citigroup’s and its affiliates’ 
outstanding short-term borrowings).

CREDIT RATINGS
Citigroup’s funding and liquidity, funding capacity, ability to 
access capital markets and other sources of funds, the cost of 
these funds and its ability to maintain certain deposits are 
partially dependent on its credit ratings. 

The table below shows the ratings for Citigroup and 
Citibank as of December 31, 2020. While not included in the 
table below, the long-term and short-term ratings of Citigroup 
Global Markets Holding Inc. (CGMHI) were BBB+/A-2 at 
Standard & Poor’s and A/F1 at Fitch as of December 31, 
2020.

Potential Impacts of Ratings Downgrades
Ratings downgrades by Moody’s, Fitch or S&P could 
negatively impact Citigroup’s and/or Citibank’s funding and 
liquidity due to reduced funding capacity, including derivative 
triggers, which could take the form of cash obligations and 
collateral requirements.

The following information is provided for the purpose of 

analyzing the potential funding and liquidity impact to 
Citigroup and Citibank of a hypothetical simultaneous 
ratings downgrade across all three major rating agencies. This 
analysis is subject to certain estimates, estimation 
methodologies, judgments and uncertainties. Uncertainties 
include potential ratings limitations that certain entities may 
have with respect to permissible counterparties, as well as 
general subjective counterparty behavior. For example, certain 
corporate customers and markets counterparties could re-
evaluate their business relationships with Citi and limit 
transactions in certain contracts or market instruments with 
Citi. Changes in counterparty behavior could impact Citi’s 
funding and liquidity, as well as the results of operations of 
certain of its businesses. The actual impact to Citigroup or 
Citibank is unpredictable and may differ materially from the 
potential funding and liquidity impacts described below. For 
additional information on the impact of credit rating changes 
on Citi and its applicable subsidiaries, see “Risk Factors—
Liquidity Risks” above.

Citigroup Inc. and Citibank—Potential Derivative Triggers
As of December 31, 2020, Citi estimates that a hypothetical 
one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of 
Citigroup Inc. across all three major rating agencies could 
impact Citigroup’s funding and liquidity due to derivative 
triggers by approximately $0.6 billion, unchanged from 
September 30, 2020. Other funding sources, such as secured 
financing transactions and other margin requirements, for 
which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely 
affected.

As of December 31, 2020, Citi estimates that a 
hypothetical one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-
term rating of Citibank across all three major rating agencies 
could impact Citibank’s funding and liquidity due to 
derivative triggers by approximately $0.4 billion, unchanged 
from September 30, 2020. Other funding sources, such as 
secured financing transactions and other margin requirements, 
for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be 
adversely affected.

In total, as of December 31, 2020, Citi estimates that a 
one-notch downgrade of Citigroup and Citibank across all 
three major rating agencies could result in increased aggregate 
cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately 
$1.0 billion, unchanged from September 30, 2020 (see also 
Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). As detailed 
under “High-Quality Liquid Assets” above, Citigroup has 
various liquidity resources available to its bank and non-bank 
entities in part as a contingency for the potential events 
described above.

In addition, a broad range of mitigating actions are 
currently included in Citigroup’s and Citibank’s contingency 
funding plans. For Citigroup, these mitigating factors include, 
but are not limited to, accessing surplus funding capacity from 
existing clients, tailoring levels of secured lending and 
adjusting the size of select trading books and collateralized 
borrowings at certain Citibank subsidiaries. Mitigating actions 
available to Citibank include, but are not limited to, selling or 
financing highly liquid government securities, tailoring levels 
of secured lending, adjusting the size of select trading assets, 
reducing loan originations and renewals, raising additional 
deposits or borrowing from the FHLB or central banks. Citi 
believes these mitigating actions could substantially reduce the 
funding and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades 
described above.

98

 
Citibank—Additional Potential Impacts
In addition to the above derivative triggers, Citi believes that a 
potential downgrade of Citibank’s senior debt/long-term rating 
across any of the three major rating agencies could also have 
an adverse impact on the commercial paper/short-term rating 
of Citibank. Citibank has provided liquidity commitments to 
consolidated asset-backed commercial paper conduits, 
primarily in the form of asset purchase agreements. As of 
December 31, 2020, Citibank had liquidity commitments of 
approximately $10.0 billion to consolidated asset-backed 
commercial paper conduits, compared to $11.4 billion as of 
September 30, 2020 (for additional information, see Note 21 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

In addition to the above-referenced liquidity resources of 

certain Citibank entities, Citibank could reduce the funding 
and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades 
described above through mitigating actions, including 
repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial 
paper conduits. In the event of the potential downgrades 
described above, Citi believes that certain corporate customers 
could re-evaluate their deposit relationships with Citibank. 
This re-evaluation could result in clients adjusting their 
discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository 
institution, which could potentially reduce certain deposit 
levels at Citibank. However, Citi could choose to adjust 
pricing, offer alternative deposit products to its existing 
customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers, in 
addition to the mitigating actions referenced above.

99

these and other strategies to reduce its interest rate risks and 
implements such strategies when it believes those actions are 
prudent. 

Citi manages interest rate risk as a consolidated 

Company-wide position. Citi’s client-facing businesses create 
interest rate-sensitive positions, including loans and deposits, 
as part of their ongoing activities. Citi Treasury aggregates 
these risk positions and manages them centrally. Operating 
within established limits, Citi Treasury makes positioning 
decisions and uses tools, such as Citi’s investment securities 
portfolio, company-issued debt and interest rate derivatives, to 
target the desired risk profile. Changes in Citi’s interest rate 
risk position reflect the accumulated changes in all non-trading 
assets and liabilities, with potentially large and offsetting 
impacts, as well as in Citi Treasury’s positioning decisions.
Citigroup employs additional measurements, including 
stress testing the impact of non-linear interest rate movements 
on the value of the balance sheet, and the analysis of portfolio 
duration and volatility, particularly as they relate to mortgage 
loans and mortgage-backed securities and the potential impact 
of the change in the spread between different market indices.

Interest Rate Risk of Investment Portfolios—Impact 
on AOCI
Citi also measures the potential impacts of changes in interest 
rates on the value of its AOCI, which can in turn impact Citi’s 
common equity and tangible common equity. This will impact 
Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 and other regulatory capital 
ratios. Citi’s goal is to benefit from an increase in the market 
level of interest rates, while limiting the impact of changes in 
AOCI on its regulatory capital position.

AOCI at risk is managed as part of the Company-wide 
interest rate risk position. AOCI at risk considers potential 
changes in AOCI (and the corresponding impact on the 
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio) relative to Citi’s capital 
generation capacity.

MARKET RISK

OVERVIEW
Market risk is the potential for losses arising from changes in 
the value of Citi’s assets and liabilities resulting from changes 
in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange 
rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit spreads, as 
well as their implied volatilities. Market risk emanates from 
both Citi’s trading and non-trading portfolios. For additional 
information on market risk and market risk management, see 
“Risk Factors” above.

Each business is required to establish, with approval from 
Citi’s market risk management, a market risk limit framework 
for identified risk factors that clearly defines approved risk 
profiles and is within the parameters of Citi’s overall risk 
appetite. These limits are monitored by the Risk organization, 
including various regional, legal entity and business Risk 
Management committees, Citi’s country and business Asset & 
Liability Committees and the Citigroup Risk Management and 
Asset & Liability Committees. In all cases, the businesses are 
ultimately responsible for the market risks taken and for 
remaining within their defined limits.

MARKET RISK OF NON-TRADING PORTFOLIOS 
Market risk from non-trading portfolios stems from the 
potential impact of changes in interest rates and foreign 
exchange rates on Citi’s net interest revenues, the changes in 
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) from 
its debt securities portfolios and capital invested in foreign 
currencies. 

Net Interest Revenue at Risk
Net interest revenue, for interest rate exposure purposes, is the 
difference between the yield earned on the non-trading 
portfolio assets (including customer loans) and the rate paid on 
the liabilities (including customer deposits or company 
borrowings). Net interest revenue is affected by changes in the 
level of interest rates, as well as the amounts and mix of assets 
and liabilities, and the timing of contractual and assumed 
repricing of assets and liabilities to reflect market rates.

Citi’s principal measure of risk to net interest revenue is 

interest rate exposure (IRE). IRE measures the change in 
expected net interest revenue in each currency resulting solely 
from unanticipated changes in forward interest rates. 

Citi’s estimated IRE incorporates various assumptions 

including prepayment rates on loans, customer behavior and 
the impact of pricing decisions. For example, in rising interest 
rate scenarios, portions of the deposit portfolio may be 
assumed to experience rate increases that are less than the 
change in market interest rates. In declining interest rate 
scenarios, it is assumed that mortgage portfolios experience 
higher prepayment rates. Citi’s estimated IRE below assumes 
that its businesses and/or Citi Treasury make no additional 
changes in balances or positioning in response to the 
unanticipated rate changes.

In order to manage changes in interest rates effectively, 

Citi may modify pricing on new customer loans and deposits, 
purchase fixed-rate securities, issue debt that is either fixed or 
floating or enter into derivative transactions that have the 
opposite risk exposures. Citi regularly assesses the viability of

(1) Certain trading-oriented businesses within Citi have accrual-accounted positions that are excluded from the estimated impact to net interest revenue in the table, 
since these exposures are managed economically in combination with mark-to-market positions. The U.S. dollar interest rate exposure associated with these 
businesses was $(89) million for a 100 bps instantaneous increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2020.
Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments.

(2)

The year-over-year increase in the estimated impact to net 

interest revenue primarily reflected changes in Citi’s balance 
sheet composition and Citi Treasury positioning. The year-
over-year changes in the estimated impact to AOCI and the 
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio primarily reflected the 
impact of the composition of Citi Treasury’s investment and 
derivatives portfolio.

In the event of a parallel instantaneous 100 bps increase in 

interest rates, Citi expects that the negative impact to AOCI 
would be offset in shareholders’ equity through the expected 
recovery of the impact on AOCI through accretion of Citi’s 
investment portfolio over a period of time. As of 
December 31, 2020, Citi expects that the negative $5.6 billion 
impact to AOCI in such a scenario could potentially be offset 
over approximately 31 months.

The following table sets forth the estimated impact to 
Citi’s net interest revenue, AOCI and the Common Equity 

Tier 1 Capital ratio (on a fully implemented basis) under five 
different changes in interest rate scenarios for the U.S. dollar 
and Citi’s other currencies. The 100 bps downward rate 
scenarios are impacted by the low level of interest rates in 
several countries and the assumption that market interest rates, 
as well as rates paid to depositors and charged to borrowers, 
do not fall below zero (i.e., the “flooring assumption”). The 
rate scenarios are also impacted by convexity related to 
mortgage products.

In addition, in the table below, the magnitude of the 
impact to Citi’s net interest revenue and AOCI is greater under 
Scenario 2 as compared to Scenario 3. This is because the 
combination of changes to Citi’s investment portfolio, 
partially offset by changes related to Citi’s pension liabilities, 
results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at 
shorter- and intermediate-term maturities.

Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates—Impacts on AOCI 
and Capital
As of December 31, 2020, Citi estimates that an unanticipated 
parallel instantaneous 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar 
against all of the other currencies in which Citi has invested 
capital could reduce Citi’s tangible common equity (TCE) by 
approximately $1.7 billion, or 1.0%, as a result of changes to 
Citi’s foreign currency translation adjustment in AOCI, net of 
hedges. This impact would be primarily due to changes in the 
value of the Mexican peso, Euro, Australian dollar and 
Singapore dollar.

This impact is also before any mitigating actions Citi may 

take, including ongoing management of its foreign currency 
translation exposure. Specifically, as currency movements 
change the value of Citi’s net investments in foreign currency-
denominated capital, these movements also change the value 
of Citi’s risk-weighted assets denominated in those currencies. 
This, coupled with Citi’s foreign currency hedging strategies, 
such as foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency 
forwards and other currency hedging instruments, lessens the 
impact of foreign currency movements on Citi’s Common 
Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio. Changes in these hedging 
strategies, as well as hedging costs, divestitures and tax 
impacts, can further affect the actual impact of changes in 
foreign exchange rates on Citi’s capital as compared to an 
unanticipated parallel shock, as described above.

The effect of Citi’s ongoing management strategies with 

respect to changes in foreign exchange rates, and the impact of 
these changes on Citi’s TCE and Common Equity Tier 1 
Capital ratio, are shown in the table below. For additional 
information on the changes in AOCI, see Note 19 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

$196 million, $208 million and $254 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

Citi’s net interest revenue (NIR) in the fourth quarter of 2020 
decreased 13% to $10.5 billion (also $10.5 billion on a taxable 
equivalent basis) versus the prior-year period. Excluding the 
impact of FX translation, NIR decreased year-over-year by 
approximately $1.3 billion. The decrease was primarily related 
to a decline of approximately $1.5 billion in non-ICG Markets 
NIR, partially offset by an approximate $130 million increase 
in ICG Markets (fixed income markets and equity markets) 
NIR. The decrease in non-ICG Markets NIR primarily 
reflected lower interest rates and lower loan balances across 
institutional and consumer businesses (for additional 
information, see “Liquidity Risk—Loans” above). Citi’s NIM 
was 2.00% on a taxable equivalent basis in the fourth quarter 
of 2020, a decrease of three basis points from the prior quarter, 
reflecting lower NIR and balance sheet expansion due to 
strong deposit growth. 

Citi’s NIR for the full year 2020 decreased 8% to $43.5 

billion ($43.7 billion on a taxable equivalent basis) versus the 
prior year. Excluding the impact of FX translation, NIR 
decreased 6%, or approximately $3.0 billion. The decrease 
was primarily related to a decline of $4.1 billion in non-ICG 
Markets NIR, partially offset by an increase of $1.1 billion in 
ICG Markets NIR. The decrease in non-ICG Markets NIR was 
primarily driven by lower interest rates, as well as lower loan 
balances. On a full-year basis, Citi’s NIM was 2.16% on a 
taxable equivalent basis, compared to 2.65% in 2019. 

Citi’s ICG Markets NIR and non-ICG Markets NIR are 
non-GAAP financial measures. Citi believes presentation of 
these measures provides a meaningful depiction of the 
underlying fundamentals of its lending, investing and deposit-
raising businesses.

Market Risk of Trading Portfolios
Trading portfolios include positions resulting from market-
making activities, hedges of certain available-for-sale (AFS) 
debt securities, the CVA relating to derivative counterparties 
and all associated hedges, fair value option loans and hedges 
of the loan portfolio within capital markets origination within 
ICG.

The market risk of Citi’s trading portfolios is monitored 
using a combination of quantitative and qualitative measures, 
including, but not limited to:

•
•
•

factor sensitivities; 
value at risk (VAR); and 
stress testing.

Each trading portfolio across Citi’s businesses has its own 
market risk limit framework encompassing these measures and 
other controls, including trading mandates, new product 
approval, permitted product lists and pre-trade approval for 
larger, more complex and less liquid transactions.

The following chart of total daily trading-related revenue 
(loss) captures trading volatility and shows the number of days 
in which revenues for Citi’s trading businesses fell within 
particular ranges. Trading-related revenue includes trading, net 
interest and other revenue associated with Citi’s trading 
businesses. It excludes DVA, FVA and CVA adjustments 
incurred due to changes in the credit quality of counterparties, 
as well as any associated hedges of that CVA. In addition, it 
excludes fees and other revenue associated with capital 
markets origination activities. Trading-related revenues are 
driven by both customer flows and the changes in valuation of 
the trading inventory. As shown in the chart below, positive 
trading-related revenue was achieved for 97.7% of the trading 
days in 2020.

Daily Trading-Related Revenue (Loss)(1)—Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2020
In millions of dollars

(1)  Reflects the effects of asymmetrical accounting for economic hedges of certain AFS debt securities. Specifically, the change in the fair value of hedging 

derivatives is included in trading-related revenue, while the offsetting change in the fair value of hedged AFS debt securities is included in AOCI and not reflected 
above.

110

Factor Sensitivities
Factor sensitivities are expressed as the change in the value of 
a position for a defined change in a market risk factor, such as 
a change in the value of a U.S. Treasury bill for a one-basis-
point change in interest rates. Citi’s market risk management, 
within the Risk organization, works to ensure that factor 
sensitivities are calculated, monitored and limited for all 
material risks taken in the trading portfolios.

Value at Risk (VAR)
VAR estimates, at a 99% confidence level, the potential 
decline in the value of a position or a portfolio under normal 
market conditions assuming a one-day holding period. VAR 
statistics, which are based on historical data, can be materially 
different across firms due to differences in portfolio 
composition, differences in VAR methodologies and 
differences in model parameters. As a result, Citi believes 
VAR statistics can be used more effectively as indicators of 
trends in risk-taking within a firm, rather than as a basis for 
inferring differences in risk-taking across firms.

Citi uses a single, independently approved Monte Carlo 

simulation VAR model (see “VAR Model Review and 
Validation” below), which has been designed to capture 
material risk sensitivities (such as first- and second-order 
sensitivities of positions to changes in market prices) of 
various asset classes/risk types (such as interest rate, credit 

spread, foreign exchange, equity and commodity risks). Citi’s 
VAR includes positions that are measured at fair value; it does 
not include investment securities classified as AFS or HTM. 
For information on these securities, see Note 13 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Citi believes its VAR model is conservatively calibrated 

to incorporate fat-tail scaling and the greater of short-term 
(approximately the most recent month) and long-term (three 
years) market volatility. The Monte Carlo simulation involves 
approximately 450,000 market factors, making use of 
approximately 350,000 time series, with sensitivities updated 
daily, volatility parameters updated intra-monthly and 
correlation parameters updated monthly. The conservative 
features of the VAR calibration contribute an approximate 
32% add-on to what would be a VAR estimated under the 
assumption of stable and perfectly, normally distributed 
markets. 

As set forth in the table below, Citi’s average trading 
VAR increased from 2019 to 2020, mainly due to significant 
market volatility during the first half of 2020 across all asset 
classes, driven by macroeconomic challenges and 
uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Citi’s 
average trading and credit portfolio VAR also increased in 
2020, primarily due to the higher market volatility, increased 
hedging activity and changes in portfolio composition.

(1) Covariance adjustment (also known as diversification benefit) equals the difference between the total VAR and the sum of the VARs tied to each risk type. The 
benefit reflects the fact that the risks within individual and across risk types are not perfectly correlated and, consequently, the total VAR on a given day will be 
lower than the sum of the VARs relating to each risk type. The determination of the primary drivers of changes to the covariance adjustment is made by an 
examination of the impact of both model parameter and position changes. 

(2)  The total trading VAR includes mark-to-market and certain fair value option trading positions in ICG, with the exception of hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value 

option loans and all CVA exposures. Available-for-sale and accrual exposures are not included.

(3)   The specific risk-only component represents the level of equity and fixed income issuer-specific risk embedded in VAR. 
(4)   The credit portfolio is composed of mark-to-market positions associated with non-trading business units including Citi Treasury, the CVA relating to derivative 
counterparties and all associated CVA hedges. FVA and DVA are not included. The credit portfolio also includes hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value option 
loans and hedges to the leveraged finance pipeline within capital markets origination in ICG.

VAR Model Review and Validation
Generally, Citi’s VAR review and model validation process 
entails reviewing the model framework, major assumptions 
and implementation of the mathematical algorithm. In 
addition, product specific back-testing on portfolios is
periodically completed as part of the ongoing model 
performance monitoring process and reviewed with Citi’s U.S. 
banking regulators. Furthermore, Regulatory VAR back-
testing (as described below) is performed against buy-and-
hold profit and loss on a monthly basis for multiple sub-
portfolios across the organization (trading desk level, ICG 
business segment and Citigroup) and the results are shared 
with U.S. banking regulators.

Material VAR model and assumption changes must be 

independently validated within Citi’s risk management 
organization. All model changes, including those for the VAR 
model, are validated by the model validation group within 
Citi’s Model Risk Management. In the event of significant 
model changes, parallel model runs are undertaken prior to 
implementation. In addition, significant model and assumption 
changes are subject to the periodic reviews and approval by 
Citi’s U.S. banking regulators.

Citi uses the same independently validated VAR model 
for both Regulatory VAR and Risk Management VAR (i.e., 
total trading and total trading and credit portfolios VARs) and, 
as such, the model review and validation process for both 
purposes is as described above.

Regulatory VAR, which is calculated in accordance with 
Basel III, differs from Risk Management VAR due to the fact 
that certain positions included in Risk Management VAR are 
not eligible for market risk treatment in Regulatory VAR. The 
composition of Risk Management VAR is discussed under 

112

“Value at Risk” above. The applicability of the VAR model 
for positions eligible for market risk treatment under U.S. 
regulatory capital rules is periodically reviewed and approved 
by Citi’s U.S. banking regulators.

In accordance with Basel III, Regulatory VAR includes 
all trading book-covered positions and all foreign exchange 
and commodity exposures. Pursuant to Basel III, Regulatory 
VAR excludes positions that fail to meet the intent and ability 
to trade requirements and are therefore classified as non-
trading book and categories of exposures that are specifically 
excluded as covered positions. Regulatory VAR excludes 
CVA on derivative instruments and DVA on Citi’s own fair 
value option liabilities. CVA hedges are excluded from 
Regulatory VAR and included in credit risk-weighted assets as 
computed under the Advanced Approaches for determining 
risk-weighted assets.

Regulatory VAR Back-Testing
In accordance with Basel III, Citi is required to perform back-
testing to evaluate the effectiveness of its Regulatory VAR 
model. Regulatory VAR back-testing is the process in which 
the daily one-day VAR, at a 99% confidence interval, is 
compared to the buy-and-hold profit and loss (i.e., the profit 
and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of 
the day and re-priced the following day). Buy-and-hold profit 
and loss represents the daily mark-to-market profit and loss 
attributable to price movements in covered positions from the 
close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and 
loss excludes realized trading revenue, net interest, fees and 
commissions, intra-day trading profit and loss and changes in 
reserves.

Based on a 99% confidence level, Citi would expect two 

to three days in any one year when buy-and-hold losses exceed 
the Regulatory VAR. Given the conservative calibration of 
Citi’s VAR model (as a result of taking the greater of short- 
and long-term volatilities and fat-tail scaling of volatilities), 
Citi would expect fewer exceptions under normal and stable 
market conditions. Periods of unstable market conditions 
could increase the number of back-testing exceptions.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The following graph shows the daily buy-and-hold profit 
and loss associated with Citi’s covered positions compared to 
Citi’s one-day Regulatory VAR during 2020. As of December 
31, 2020, four back-testing exceptions were observed at the 
Citigroup level. These exceptions occurred in March and were 
due to losses across multiple businesses during the onset of the 
pandemic-related volatility.

The difference between the 65.26% of days with buy-and-
hold gains for Regulatory VAR back-testing and the 97.7% of 
days with trading, net interest and other revenue associated 
with Citi’s trading businesses, shown in the histogram of daily 
trading-related revenue below, reflects, among other things, 
that a significant portion of Citi’s trading-related revenue is 
not generated from daily price movements on these positions 
and exposures, as well as differences in the portfolio 
composition of Regulatory VAR and Risk Management VAR.

Regulatory Trading VAR and Associated Buy-and-Hold Profit and Loss(1)—12 Months ended December 31, 2020
In millions of dollars

(1)   Buy-and-hold profit and loss, as defined by the banking regulators under Basel III, represents the daily mark-to-market revenue movement attributable to the 
trading position from the close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue and net interest intra-day trading 
profit and loss on new and terminated trades, as well as changes in reserves. Therefore, it is not comparable to the trading-related revenue presented in the chart of 
daily trading-related revenue above.

113

Stress Testing
Citi performs market risk stress testing on a regular basis to 
estimate the impact of extreme market movements. It is 
performed on individual positions and trading portfolios, as 
well as in aggregate, inclusive of multiple trading portfolios. 
Citi’s market risk management, after consultations with the 
businesses, develops both systemic and specific stress 
scenarios, reviews the output of periodic stress testing 
exercises and uses the information to assess the ongoing 
appropriateness of exposure levels and limits. Citi uses two 
complementary approaches to market risk stress testing across 
all major risk factors (i.e., equity, foreign exchange, 
commodity, interest rate and credit spreads): top-down 
systemic stresses and bottom-up business-specific stresses. 
Systemic stresses are designed to quantify the potential impact 
of extreme market movements on an institution-wide basis, 
and are constructed using both historical periods of market 
stress and projections of adverse economic scenarios. 
Business-specific stresses are designed to probe the risks of 
particular portfolios and market segments, especially those 
risks that are not fully captured in VAR and systemic stresses.
The systemic stress scenarios and business-specific stress 
scenarios at Citi are used in several reports reviewed by senior 
management and also to calculate internal risk capital for 
trading market risk. In general, changes in market values are 
defined over a one-year horizon. For the most liquid positions 
and market factors, changes in market values are defined over 
a shorter two-month horizon. The limited set of positions and 
market factors whose market value changes are defined over a 
two-month horizon are those that in management’s judgment 
have historically remained very liquid during financial crises, 
even as the trading liquidity of most other positions and 
market factors materially declined.

114

OPERATIONAL RISK

Overview
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or 
failed internal processes, people and systems or from external 
events. This includes legal risk, which is the risk of loss 
(including litigation costs, settlements, and regulatory fines) 
resulting from the failure of Citi to comply with laws, 
regulations, prudent ethical standards, and contractual 
obligations in any aspect of its businesses, but excludes 
strategic and reputation risks. Citi also recognizes the impact 
of operational risk on the reputation risk associated with Citi’s 
business activities. 

Operational risk is inherent in Citi’s global business 
activities, as well as related support functions, and can result 
in losses. Citi maintains a comprehensive firm-wide risk 
taxonomy to classify operational risks that it faces using 
standardized definitions across the firm’s Operational Risk 
Management Framework (see discussion below). This 
taxonomy also supports regulatory requirements and 
expectations inclusive of those related to U.S. Basel III capital 
requirements, CCAR process and heightened standards under 
U.S. banking requirements. 

Citi manages operational risk consistent with the overall 
framework described in “Managing Global Risk—Overview” 
above. Citi’s goal is to keep operational risk at appropriate 
levels relative to the characteristics of its businesses, the 
markets in which it operates, its capital and liquidity and the 
competitive, economic and regulatory environment. This 
includes effectively managing operational risk and 
maintaining or reducing operational risk exposures within 
Citi’s operational risk appetite.

To anticipate, mitigate and control operational risk, Citi’s 

Independent Operational Risk Management group has 
established a global-Operational Risk Management 
Framework with policies and practices for identification, 
measurement, monitoring, mitigating, and reporting 
operational risks and the overall operating effectiveness of the 
internal control environment. As part of this framework, Citi 
has defined its operational risk appetite and established a 
manager’s control assessment (MCA) process for self-
identification of significant operational risks, assessment of 
the performance of key controls and mitigation of residual risk 
above acceptable levels. 

Each major business segment must implement operational 

risk processes consistent with the requirements of this 
framework. This includes:

Understanding the operational risks they are exposed to;
designing controls to mitigate identified risks;
establishing key indicators;

•
•
•
• monitoring and reporting whether the operational risk 

•

•

•

exposures are in or out of their operational risk appetite;
having processes in place to bring operational risk 
exposures within acceptable levels; 
periodically estimate and aggregate the operational risks 
they are exposed to; and
ensuring that sufficient resources are available to 
actively improve the operational risk environment and 
mitigate emerging risks.

Citi considers operational risks that result from the 
introduction of new or changes to existing products, or result 
from significant changes in its organizational structures, 
systems, processes and personnel. 

Citi has a governance structure for the oversight of 

operational risk exposures through Business Risk and Controls 
Committees (BRCCs), which include a Citigroup BRCC as 
well as business, functions, regional and country BRCCs. 
BRCCs are chaired by the individuals in the first line of 
defense and provide escalation channels for senior 
management to review operational risk exposures including 
breaches of operational risk appetite, key indicators, 
operational risk events, and control issues. Membership 
includes senior business and functions leadership as well as 
members of the second line of defense.

Citi also has an Operational Risk Management Committee 
that provides senior management of the second line of defense 
risk organizations with a platform to assess Citi’s operational 
risk profile and to review that actions are taken to bring Citi’s 
operational risk exposures within operational risk appetite. 
Members include Citi’s Chief Risk Officer and Citi’s Head of 
Operational Risk Management and senior members of their 
organizations. These members cover multiple dimensions of 
risk management and include business and regional Chief Risk 
Officers and senior operational risk managers.

In addition, Independent Risk Management, including the 
Operational Risk Management group, works proactively with 
Citi’s businesses and functions to drive a strong and embedded 
operational risk management culture and framework across 
Citi. The Operational Risk Management group actively 
challenges business and functions implementation of the 
Operational Risk Management Framework requirements and 
the quality of operational risk management practices and 
outcomes.

Information about businesses’ key operational risks, 
historical operational risk losses and the control environment 
is reported by each major business segment and functional 
area. Citi’s operational risk profile and related information is 
summarized and reported to senior management, as well as to 
the Audit and Risk Committees of Citi’s Board of Directors by 
the Head of Operational Risk Management.
Operational risk is measured through 

Operational Risk Capital and Operational Risk Regulatory 
Capital for the Advanced Approaches under Basel III. 
Projected operational risk losses under stress scenarios are 
estimated as a required part of the Federal Reserve Board’s 
CCAR process. 

For additional information on Citi’s operational risks, see 

“Risk Factors—Operational Risk” above.

Erroneous Revlon-Related Payment
In August 2020, Citi, as administrative agent for a Revlon 
credit facility, in addition to making an interest payment, 
erroneously paid the lenders under the facility an aggregate of 
approximately $894 million, which is an amount equal to the 
principal balance of the loan at that time. Human error at Citi 
and at a third-party vendor, and limitations in Citi’s loan 

115

processing systems, were the main contributing factors. After 
a careful assessment of the incident, Citi immediately put in 
additional controls to prevent similar loan disbursement errors 
in the future, while also embarking on a major upgrade of the 
loan infrastructure and controls.

As of February 26, 2021, $389.8 million has been repaid 

to Citi. In August 2020, Citi commenced litigation against 
certain fund managers of lenders that have not returned the 
remaining $504.2 million of erroneously transferred funds, 
and obtained a temporary restraining order against the fund 
managers and those acting with them, freezing the funds from 
transfer or disbursement. On February 16, 2021, the court 
issued a judgment in favor of the defendants, which Citi 
intends to appeal. As a result of the court’s decision, Citi now 
has rights as a creditor related to the Revlon loan. For 
additional information, see Notes 27, 29 and 30 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Cybersecurity Risk
Cybersecurity risk is the business risk associated with the 
threat posed by a cyber attack, cyber breach or the failure to 
protect Citi’s most vital business information assets or 
operations, resulting in a financial or reputational loss	(for 
additional information, see the operational systems and 
cybersecurity risk factors in “Risk Factors—Operational 
Risks” above). With an evolving threat landscape, ever-
increasing sophistication of cybersecurity attacks and use of 
new technologies to conduct financial transactions, Citi and its 
clients, customers and third parties are and will continue to be 
at risk for cyber attacks and information security incidents. 
Citi recognizes the significance of these risks and, therefore, 
employs an intelligence-led strategy to protect against, detect, 
respond to and recover from cyber attacks. Further, Citi 
actively participates in financial industry, government and 
cross-sector knowledge-sharing groups to enhance individual 
and collective cyber resilience. 

Citi’s technology and cybersecurity risk management 
program is built on three lines of defense. Citi’s first line of 
defense under the Office of the Chief Information Security 
Officer provides frontline business, operational and technical 
controls and capabilities to protect against cybersecurity risks, 
and to respond to cyber incidents and data breaches. Citi 
manages these threats through state-of-the-art Fusion Centers, 
which serve as central command for monitoring and 
coordinating responses to cyber threats. The enterprise 
information security team is responsible for infrastructure 
defense and security controls, performing vulnerability 
assessments and third-party information security assessments, 
employee awareness and training programs and security 
incident management, in each case working in coordination 
with a network of information security officers who are 
embedded within the businesses and functions on a global 
basis. 

Citi’s Operational Risk Management-Technology and 

Cyber (ORM-T/C) and Independent Compliance Risk 
Management-Technology and Information Security (ICRM-T) 
groups serve as the second line of defense, and actively 
evaluate, anticipate and challenge Citi’s risk mitigation 
practices and capabilities. Internal audit serves as the third line 
of defense and independently provides assurance on how 

116

effectively the organization as a whole manages cybersecurity 
risk. Citi also has multiple senior committees such as the 
Information Security Risk Committee (ISRC), which governs 
enterprise-level risk tolerance inclusive of cybersecurity risk.

Citi seeks to proactively identify and remediate 

technology and cybersecurity risks before they materialize as 
incidents that negatively affect business operations. 
Accordingly, the ORM-T/C team independently challenges 
and monitors capabilities in accordance with Citi’s defined 
Technology and Cyber Risk Appetite statements. To address 
evolving cybersecurity risks and corresponding regulations, 
ORM-T/C and ICRM-T team collectively also monitor cyber 
legal and regulatory requirements, identify and define 
emerging risks, execute strategic cyber threat assessments, 
perform new products and initiative reviews, perform data 
management risk oversight and conduct cyber risk assurance 
reviews (inclusive of third-party assessments). In addition, 
ORM-T/C employs tools and oversees and challenges metrics 
that are both tailored to cybersecurity and technology and 
aligned with Citi’s overall operational risk management 
framework to effectively track, identify and manage risk.

COMPLIANCE RISK
Compliance risk is the risk to current or projected financial 
condition and resilience arising from violations of laws, rules, 
or regulations, or from non-conformance with prescribed 
practices, internal policies and procedures or ethical standards. 
Compliance risk exposes Citi to fines, civil money penalties, 
payment of damages and the voiding of contracts. Compliance 
risk can result in diminished reputation, harm to the firm’s 
customers, limited business opportunities and lessened 
expansion potential. It encompasses the risk of noncompliance 
with all laws and regulations, as well as prudent ethical 
standards and some contractual obligations. It could also 
include exposure to litigation (known as legal risk) from all 
aspects of traditional and non-traditional banking.

Citi seeks to operate with integrity, maintain strong 

ethical standards and adhere to applicable policies and 
regulatory and legal requirements. Citi must maintain and 
execute a proactive Compliance Risk Management (CRM) 
Policy that is designed to manage compliance risk effectively 
across Citi, with a view to fundamentally strengthen the 
compliance risk management culture across the lines of 
defense taking into account Citi’s risk governance framework 
and regulatory requirements. Independent Compliance Risk 
Management’s (ICRM) primary objectives are to:

•

Drive and embed a culture of compliance and control 
throughout Citi;

• Maintain and oversee an integrated CRM Policy and 

Compliance Risk Framework that facilitates enterprise-
wide compliance with local, national or cross-border laws, 
rules or regulations, Citi’s internal policies, standards and 
procedures and relevant standards of conduct;
Assess compliance risks and issues across product lines, 
functions and geographies, supported by globally 
consistent systems and compliance risk management 
processes; and
Provide compliance risk data aggregation and reporting 
capabilities.

•

•

To anticipate, control and mitigate compliance risk, Citi 
has established the CRM Policy to achieve standardization and 
centralization of methodologies and processes, and to enable 
more consistent and comprehensive execution of compliance 
risk management. 

Citi has a commitment, as well as an obligation, to 
identify, assess and mitigate compliance risks associated with 
its businesses and functions. ICRM is responsible for 
oversight of Citi’s CRM Policy, while all businesses and 
global control functions are responsible for managing their 
compliance risks and operating within the Compliance Risk 
Appetite. 

Citi carries out its objectives and fulfills its 

responsibilities through the Compliance Risk Framework, 
which is composed of the following integrated key activities, 
to holistically manage compliance risk:

• Management of Citi’s compliance with laws, rules and 
regulations by identifying and analyzing changes, 
assessing the impact, and implementing appropriate 
policies, processes and controls.
Developing and providing compliance training to ensure 
colleagues are aware of and understand the key laws, 
rules and regulations.

•

• Monitoring compliance risk appetite, which is articulated 
through qualitative compliance risk statements describing 
Citi’s appetite for certain types of risk and quantitative 
measures to monitor the Company’s compliance risk 
exposure.

• Monitoring and testing of compliance risks and controls 

•

in assessing conformance with laws, rules, regulations and 
internal policies.
Issue identification, escalation and remediation to drive 
accountability, including measurement and reporting of 
compliance risk metrics against established thresholds in 
support of the CRM Policy and Compliance Risk 
Appetite.

As discussed above, Citi is working to address the FRB 

and OCC consent orders, which include improvements to 
Citi’s Compliance Risk Framework and its Enterprise-wide 
application (for additional information regarding the consent 
orders, see “Citi’s Consent Order Compliance” above).

REPUTATION RISK
Citi’s reputation is a vital asset in building trust with its 
stakeholders and Citi is diligent in communicating its 
corporate values to its colleagues, customers, investors and 
regulators. To support this, Citi has defined a reputation risk 
appetite approach. Under this approach, each major business 
segment has implemented a risk appetite statement and related 
key indicators to monitor and address weaknesses that may 
result in significant reputation risks. The approach requires 
that each business segment or region escalates significant 
reputation risks that require review or mitigation through its 
Reputation Risk Committee or equivalent. 

The Reputation Risk Committees are part of the 

governance infrastructure that Citi has in place to review the 
reputation risk posed by business activities, sales practices, 
product design, or perceived conflicts of interest. These 
committees may also raise potential reputation risks for due 

consideration by the Reputation Risk Committee at the 
corporate level. The Citigroup Reputation Risk Committee
may escalate reputation risks to the Nomination, Governance
and Public Affairs Committee or other appropriate committee
of the Citigroup Board of Directors. The Reputation Risk 
Committees, which are composed of Citi’s most senior 
executives, govern the process by which material reputation 
risks are identified, monitored, reported, managed and 
escalated, and appropriate actions are taken in line with 
Company-wide strategic objectives, risk appetite thresholds 
and regulatory expectations, while promoting the culture of 
risk awareness and high standards of integrity and ethical 
behavior across the Company, consistent with Citi’s mission 
and value proposition. 

Further, the responsibility for maintaining Citi’s 

reputation is shared by all colleagues, who are guided by Citi’s 
Code of Conduct. Colleagues are expected to exercise sound 
judgment and common sense in decisions and actions. They 
are also expected to promptly and appropriately escalate all 
issues that present potential reputation risk.

STRATEGIC RISK

Overview
Citi’s Executive Management Team, led by Citi’s CEO, is 
responsible for the development and execution of Citi’s 
strategy. This strategy is translated into forward-looking plans 
that are then cascaded across the organization. Strategic risk is 
monitored through a range of practices: regular Citigroup 
Board of Director meetings provide strategic checkpoints 
where management’s progress is assessed and where decisions 
to refine the strategic direction of the Company are evaluated; 
Citi’s Executive Management Team assesses progress against 
executing the defined plans; CEO reviews, which include a 
risk assessment of the plans, occur across products, regions 
and functions to focus on progress against executing the plans; 
products, regions and functions have internal reviews to assess 
performance at lower levels across the organization; and 
specific forums exist to focus on key areas that drive strategic 
risk such as balance sheet management, the introduction of 
new or modified products and services and country 
management, among others. In addition to these day-to-day 
practices, significant strategic actions, such as mergers, 
acquisitions or capital expenditures, are reviewed and 
approved by, or notified to, the Citigroup Board of Directors.

U.K.’s Future Relationship with the EU
As previously disclosed, the U.K. formally left the European 
Union (EU) on January 31, 2020. Subsequently, the U.K. and 
the EU entered into a Trade and Cooperation Agreement 
(TCA) that set out preferential arrangements in areas such as 
trade in goods and in services that became effective on 
January 1, 2021. While entering into the TCA avoided a “no 
deal” exit scenario, many questions remain as to the future 
relationship between the U.K. and the EU. For example, the 
TCA minimally covers financial services. The U.K. and the 
EU have committed under the TCA to negotiate further details 
regarding financial services, but there can be no assurance as 
to the successful completion or ultimate outcome of those 
negotiations. Citi planned extensively for the U.K. exit from 

117

the EU and successfully implemented its transition plans to 
date. However, future legislative and regulatory developments 
in the U.K. and the EU as a result of the exit may negatively 
impact Citi. For additional information, see “Risk Factors—
Strategic Risks” above.

LIBOR Transition Risk
The ICE Benchmark Administration concluded the 
consultation on its intent to cease publication of one week and 
two month USD LIBOR on December 31, 2021 and to extend 
the publication of all remaining USD LIBORs until June 30, 
2023 for legacy contracts. In addition, it is expected that all 
non USD LIBOR tenors will cease after December 31, 2021. 
Citi recognizes that a transition away from and discontinuance 
of LIBOR presents various risks and challenges that could 
significantly impact financial markets and market participants, 
including Citi (for information about Citi’s risks from a 
transition away from and discontinuation of LIBOR or any 
other interest rate benchmark, see “Risk Factors—Strategic 
Risks” above). Accordingly, Citi has continued its efforts to 
identify and manage its LIBOR transition risks. Citi is also 
closely monitoring legislative, regulatory and other 
developments related to LIBOR transition matters and relief.

Citi has established a LIBOR governance and 

implementation program focused on identifying and 
addressing the LIBOR transition impacts to Citi’s clients, 
operational capabilities and legal and financial contracts, 
among others. The program operates globally across Citi’s 
businesses and functions and includes active involvement of 
senior management, oversight by Citi’s Asset & Liability 
Committee and reporting to the Risk Management Committee 
of Citigroup’s Board of Directors. As part of the program, Citi 
has continued to implement its LIBOR transition action plans 
and associated roadmaps under the following key 
workstreams: program management; transition strategy and 
risk management; customer management, including internal 
communications and training, legal/contract management and 
product management; financial exposures and risk 
management; regulatory and industry engagement; operations 
and technology; and finance, risk, tax and treasury.

During 2020, Citi continued to participate in a number of 

working groups formed by global regulators, including the 
Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) convened by 
the Federal Reserve Board. These working groups promote 
and advance development of alternative reference rates and 
seek to identify and address potential challenges from any 
transition to such rates. Citi also continued to engage with 
regulators, financial accounting bodies and others on LIBOR 
transition matters.

Moreover, Citi has continued to identify its LIBOR 
transition exposures, including financial instruments that do 
not contain contract provisions that adequately contemplate 
the discontinuance of reference rates and that would require 
additional negotiation with counterparties. Citi’s LIBOR 
transition efforts include, among other things, using alternative 
reference rates in certain newly issued financial instruments 
and products. Since 2019, Citi has issued preferred stock and 
benchmark debt referencing the Secured Overnight Financing 
Rate (SOFR) as well as updated the LIBOR determination 
method in its debt documentation with the ARRC 

118

recommended fallback language. In addition, in 2020, Citi 
transitioned the discounting of centrally cleared EUR and 
USD interest rate derivatives to the Euro Short-Term Rate 
(ESTR) and SOFR, respectively; announced the adoption of 
the newly published Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) Fallbacks 
Protocol of the International Swaps and Derivatives 
Association (ISDA) for existing IBOR derivatives 
transactions; and increased Citi’s virtual client communication 
efforts, including outreach regarding these new industry-led 
protocols and solutions. Further, Citi has also been investing 
in its systems and infrastructure, as client activity moves away 
from LIBOR to alternative reference rates.

Climate Risk 
Climate change presents immediate and long-term risks to Citi 
and to its clients and customers, with the risks expected to 
increase over time. Climate risk refers to the risk of loss 
arising from climate change and is divided into physical risk 
and transition risk. Physical risk considers how chronic and 
acute climate change (e.g., increased storms, drought, fires, 
floods) can directly damage physical assets (e.g., real estate, 
crops) or otherwise impact their value or productivity. 
Transition risk considers how changes in policy, technology 
and market preference to address climate change (e.g., carbon 
price policies, power generation shifts from fossil fuels to 
renewable energy) can lead to changes in the value of assets, 
commodities and companies. 

Climate risk is an overarching risk that can act as a driver 
of other types of risk in the Citi risk taxonomy, such as credit 
risk from obligors exposed to high climate risk, reputational 
risk from increased stakeholder concerns about financing high 
carbon industries and operational risk from physical climate 
risks to Citi’s facilities.

Citi currently identifies climate risk as an “emerging risk” 
within its risk governance framework. Emerging risks are risks 
or thematic issues that are either new to the landscape, or in 
the case of climate risk, existing risks that are rapidly 
changing or evolving in an escalating fashion, which are 
difficult to assess due to limited data or other uncertainties. 
For additional information on climate risk, see “Risk Factors
—Strategic Risk” above.

With the increased importance and focus on climate risk, 

Citi has continued to expand its governance of climate risk and 
integrate climate considerations into the priorities of 
Citigroup’s Board of Directors and senior management. In 
particular, Citi has:

•
•

•

•

appointed a Chief Sustainability Officer;
appointed a Head of Climate Risk to partner with the 
Head of Environmental and Social Risk Management to 
deliver a Company-wide strategy concerning climate risk; 
formed a global, cross-functional senior-executive level 
Climate Risk Advisory Council to provide oversight of 
and guidance to Citi’s climate risk integration efforts; and
increased the frequency and depth of Board and senior-
level review of climate-related matters.

Citi manages and mitigates the credit and reputational 

risks from climate change through a number of internal 
initiatives, including Citi’s Environmental and Social Risk 

Management (ESRM) Policy. First established in 2003, the 
ESRM Policy is part of Citi’s broader credit risk management 
policy and is applicable to all Citi entities globally. The ESRM 
Policy provides the framework for how Citi identifies, 
mitigates and manages the potential environmental and social 
risks (including climate risks) associated with clients’ 
activities that could lead to credit or reputation risks to the 
Company. It guides how Citi evaluates lending, underwriting 
and advisory in environmentally sensitive and/or high-carbon 
sectors, and presents opportunities for Citi to engage clients on 
solutions to thematic risks. 

In project-related lending, Citi’s ESRM Policy 
incorporates the updates from the fourth iteration of the 
Equator Principles, which Citi helped shape, that expands 
climate risk requirements to include physical risk as well as 
transition risk. Citi’s ESRM Policy covers lending and 
underwriting with identified use of proceeds directed to 
physical assets and activities, as well as sector standards for 
corporate relationships in higher-risk sectors, including 
carbon-intensive sectors. In 2020, Citi updated its sector 
standards for thermal and coal mining, coal-fired power and 
Arctic oil and gas.

Citi has also made climate risk one of the three key pillars 

of its 2025 Sustainable Progress Strategy. Under this pillar, 
Citi intends to measure, manage and reduce the climate risk 
and impact of its client portfolios and enhance its Taskforce on 
Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) 
implementation and disclosure through policy development, 
portfolio analysis and client engagement. In December 2020, 
Citi released its second report detailing its implementation of 
the TCFD recommendations: Finance for a Climate-Resilient 
Future II. In this report, Citi discusses its implementation of 
the TCFD recommendations, and Citi’s recent pilot testing of 
climate scenario analyses to assess climate-related impacts and 
risks in specific sectors, spanning both transition and physical 
climate risks. Climate data is still improving in terms of its 
accessibility and reliability, and the industry and Citi continue 
to develop better methodological approaches toward assessing 
climate change impacts. Nonetheless, Citi expects to integrate 
more quantitative analysis of climate risks into credit 
assessments in the future and to quantify the carbon emissions 
associated with its client portfolios. Citi will continue to 
disclose its progress in this area in its annual Environmental, 
Social, and Governance (ESG) Report and TCFD reporting. 
In addition, Citi continues to participate in financial 

industry collaborations to develop and pilot new 
methodologies and approaches for measuring and assessing 
the potential financial risks of climate change. Citi is also 
closely monitoring regulatory developments on climate risk 
and sustainable finance, and actively engaging with regulators 
on these topics.

Country Risk

Top 25 Country Exposures 
The following table presents Citi’s top 25 exposures by 
country, excluding the U.S., as of December 31, 2020. 
(Including the U.S., the total exposure as of December 31, 
2020 would represent approximately 96% of Citi’s exposure 
to all countries.) 

For purposes of the table, loan amounts are reflected in 
the country where the loan is booked, which is generally based 
on the domicile of the borrower. For example, a loan to a 
Chinese subsidiary of a Switzerland-based corporation will 
generally be categorized as a loan in China. In addition, Citi 
has developed regional booking centers in certain countries, 
most significantly in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Ireland, 

in order to more efficiently serve its corporate customers. As 
an example, with respect to the U.K., only 37% of corporate 
loans presented in the table below are to U.K. domiciled 
entities (42% for unfunded commitments), with the balance of 
the loans predominately to European domiciled counterparties. 
Approximately 80% of the total U.K. funded loans and 86% of 
the total U.K. unfunded commitments were investment grade 
as of December 31, 2020. 

Trading account assets and investment securities are 
generally categorized based on the domicile of the issuer of 
the security of the underlying reference entity. For additional 
information on the assets included in the table, see the 
footnotes to the table below.

ICG loans reflect funded corporate loans and private bank loans, net of unearned income. As of December 31, 2020, private bank loans in the table above totaled 
$30.1 billion, concentrated in Hong Kong ($8.2 billion), the United Kingdom ($7.9 billion) and Singapore ($7 billion).

(2)  Other funded includes other direct exposures such as accounts receivable, loans HFS, other loans in Corporate/Other and investments accounted for under the 

equity method.

(3)  Unfunded exposure includes unfunded corporate lending commitments, letters of credit and other contingencies.
(4)  Net mark-to-market counterparty risk on OTC derivatives and securities lending/borrowing transactions (repos). Exposures are shown net of collateral and 

inclusive of CVA. Includes margin loans.
(5) 
Investment securities include debt securities available-for-sale, recorded at fair market value, and debt securities held-to-maturity, recorded at historical cost.
(6)  Trading account assets are shown on a net basis and include issuer risk on cash products and derivative exposure where the underlying reference entity/issuer is 

located in that country.

Argentina
As previously disclosed, Citi operates in Argentina through its 
ICG businesses. As of December 31, 2020, Citi’s net 
investment in its Argentine operations was approximately $1.0 
billion. Citi uses the U.S. dollar as the functional currency for 
its operations in Argentina because the Argentine economy is 
considered highly inflationary under U.S. GAAP. 

During August 2020, the Argentine government 
announced the successful restructuring of almost all of its 
foreign currency debt issued under foreign law, for which it 
had previously postponed principal and interest payments. 
However, during September 2020, the Argentine government 
tightened its existing capital and currency controls, which 
continue to restrict Citi’s ability to access U.S. dollars in 
Argentina and remit earnings from its Argentine operations. 
Citi’s net investment in its Argentine operations is likely
to increase as Citi generates net income in its Argentine
franchise and its earnings are unable to be remitted.

Citi economically hedges the foreign currency risk in its 
net Argentine peso-denominated assets to the extent possible 
and prudent using non-deliverable forward (NDF) derivative 
instruments that are primarily executed outside of Argentina. 
As of December 31, 2020, the international NDF market had 
very limited liquidity, resulting in Citi’s being unable to 
economically hedge nearly all of its Argentine peso exposure. 
As a result, and to the extent that Citi does not execute NDF 
contracts for this unhedged exposure in the future, Citi would 
record devaluations on its net Argentine peso‑denominated 
assets in earnings, without any benefit from a change in the 
fair value of derivative positions used to economically hedge 
the exposure. 

Citi continually evaluates its economic exposure to its 
Argentine counterparties and reserves for changes in credit 
risk and sovereign risk associated with its Argentine assets. 
Citi believes it has established appropriate allowances for 
credit losses on its Argentine loans, and appropriate fair value 
adjustments on Argentine assets and liabilities measured at fair 
value, for such risks under U.S. GAAP as of December 31, 
2020. However, U.S. regulatory agencies may require Citi to 
record additional reserves in the future, increasing ICG’s cost 
of credit, based on the perceived country risk associated with 
its Argentine exposures. For additional information on 
emerging markets risks, see “Risk Factors” above.

FFIEC—Cross-Border Claims on Third Parties and Local 
Country Assets
Citi’s cross-border disclosures are based on the country 
exposure bank regulatory reporting guidelines of the Federal 
Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC). The 
following summarizes some of the FFIEC key reporting 
guidelines:

•

•

•

•

•

Amounts are based on the domicile of the ultimate 
obligor, counterparty, collateral (only including qualifying 
liquid collateral), issuer or guarantor, as applicable (e.g., a 
security recorded by a Citi U.S. entity but issued by the 
U.K. government is considered U.K. exposure; a loan 
recorded by a Citi Mexico entity to a customer domiciled 
in Mexico where the underlying collateral is held in 
Germany is considered German exposure). 
Amounts do not consider the benefit of collateral received 
for secured financing transactions (i.e., repurchase 
agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and securities 
loaned and borrowed) and are reported based on notional 
amounts. 
Netting of derivative receivables and payables, reported at 
fair value, is permitted, but only under a legally binding 
netting agreement with the same specific counterparty, 
and does not include the benefit of margin received or 
hedges.
Credit default swaps (CDS) are included based on the 
gross notional amount sold and purchased and do not 
include any offsetting CDS on the same underlying entity. 
Loans are reported without the benefit of hedges.

Given the requirements noted above, Citi’s FFIEC cross-
border exposures and total outstandings tend to fluctuate, in 
some cases significantly, from period to period. As an 
example, because total outstandings under FFIEC guidelines 
do not include the benefit of margin or hedges, market 
volatility in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and credit 
spreads may cause significant fluctuations in the level of total 
outstandings, all else being equal.

121

The tables below show each country whose total outstandings exceeded 0.75% of total Citigroup assets:
