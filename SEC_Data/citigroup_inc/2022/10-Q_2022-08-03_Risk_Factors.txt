MANAGING GLOBAL RISK

For Citi, effective risk management is of primary importance 
to its overall operations. Accordingly, Citi’s risk management 
process has been designed to monitor, evaluate and manage 
the principal risks it assumes in conducting its activities. 
Specifically, the activities that Citi engages in, and the risks 
those activities generate, must be consistent with Citi’s 
mission, strategy, value proposition, key guiding principles 
and risk appetite.

The maintenance of accurate and consistent risk ratings 
across the corporate credit portfolio facilitates the comparison 
of credit exposure across all lines of business, geographic 
regions and products. Counterparty risk ratings reflect an 
estimated probability of default for a counterparty and are 
derived by leveraging validated statistical models, scorecard 
models and external agency ratings (under defined 
circumstances), in combination with consideration of factors 
specific to the obligor or market, such as management 
experience, competitive position, regulatory environment and 
commodity prices. Facility risk ratings are assigned that reflect 
the probability of default of the obligor and factors that affect 
the loss given default of the facility, such as support or 
collateral. Internal obligor ratings that generally correspond to 
BBB and above are considered investment grade, while those 
below are considered non-investment grade.

Note: Total exposure includes direct outstandings and unfunded lending 
commitments. 

In addition to the obligor and facility risk ratings assigned 

to all exposures, Citi may classify exposures in the corporate 
credit portfolio. These classifications are consistent with Citi’s 
interpretation of the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of 
criticized exposures, which may categorize exposures as 
special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss.

Risk ratings and classifications are reviewed regularly, 

and adjusted as appropriate. The credit review process 
incorporates quantitative and qualitative factors, including 
financial and non-financial disclosures or metrics, 
idiosyncratic events or changes to the competitive, regulatory 
or macroeconomic environment. 

Citigroup believes the corporate credit portfolio to be 

appropriately rated and classified as of June 30, 2022. 
Citigroup has taken action to adjust internal ratings and 
classifications of exposures as both the macroeconomic 
environment and obligor-specific factors have changed, 
particularly where additional stress has been seen. 

As obligor risk ratings are downgraded, the probability of 

default increases. Downgrades of obligor risk ratings tend to 
result in a higher provision for credit losses. In addition, 
downgrades may result in the purchase of additional credit 
derivatives or other risk mitigants to hedge the incremental 
credit risk, or may result in Citi’s seeking to reduce exposure 
to an obligor or an industry sector. Citi will continue to review 
exposures to ensure that the appropriate probability of default 
is incorporated into all risk assessments.

See Note 13 for additional information on Citi’s corporate 

credit portfolio.

Credit Risk Mitigation
As part of its overall risk management activities, Citigroup 
uses credit derivatives and other risk mitigants to hedge 
portions of the credit risk in its corporate credit portfolio, in 
addition to outright asset sales. Citi may enter into partial-term 
hedges as well as full-term hedges. In advance of the 
expiration of partial-term hedges, Citi will determine, among 
other factors, the economic feasibility of hedging the 
remaining life of the instrument. The results of the mark-to-
market and any realized gains or losses on credit derivatives 
are reflected primarily in Principal transactions in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income.

At June 30, 2022, March 31, 2022 and December 31, 

2021, ICG had economic hedges on the corporate credit 
portfolio of $36.8 billion, $37.9 billion and $39.3 billion, 
respectively. Citigroup’s expected credit loss model used in 
the calculation of its ACL does not include the favorable 
impact of credit derivatives and other mitigants that are 
marked to market. In addition, the reported amounts of direct 
outstandings and unfunded lending commitments in the tables 
above do not reflect the impact of these hedging transactions. 
The credit protection was economically hedging underlying 
ICG corporate credit portfolio exposures with the following 
risk rating distribution:

(1) End-of-period loans include interest and fees on credit cards.
(2) Legacy Franchises—2Q22 Asia Consumer loan balances exclude approximately $19 billion of loans ($13 billion of retail banking loans and $6 billion of credit 

card loan balances) reclassified to held-for-sale (HFS) (Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet) as a result of Citi’s signed agreements to sell its consumer 
banking businesses in eight countries (see Legacy Franchises above and Note 2 for additional information). The Philippines consumer banking business was 
reclassified to HFS starting 4Q21. The Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan, India and Bahrain consumer banking businesses were reclassified to HFS 
starting 1Q22. In addition, the Australia consumer banking business was also reclassified to HFS starting from 3Q21 until the closing of its sale June 1, 2022. 
Accordingly, loans from these businesses are excluded from the Asia Consumer loan balances as of such periods.

(3) Consists of $94.6 billion, $94.1 billion, $92.7 billion, $92.0 billion and $91.7 billion of loans in North America as of June 30, 2022, March 31, 2022, December 
31, 2021, September 30, 2021 and June 30, 2021, respectively. For additional information on the credit quality of the Global Wealth portfolio, see Note 13.

(4) Consists of $54.2 billion, $56.1 billion, $58.6 billion, $58.3 billion and $58.0 billion of loans outside of North America as of June 30, 2022, March 31, 2022, 

December 31, 2021, September 30, 2021 and June 30, 2021, respectively.

(5) See Note 13 for details on loan-to-value ratios for the portfolios, and FICO scores for the U.S. portfolio.
(6) At June 30, 2022, includes approximately $55 billion of classifiably managed loans. Over 90% of these loans are fully collateralized (consisting primarily of 
marketable investment securities, commercial real estate and limited partner capital commitments in private equity) and have experienced very low NCLs. As 
discussed below, approximately 94% of the classifiably managed portion of these loans are investment grade. See “Consumer Loan Delinquencies Amounts and 
Ratios” below for details on the delinquency-managed portfolio.

(7) Asia Consumer also includes loans and leases in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.
(8) Primarily consists of certain North America consumer mortgages.

Consumer Credit Trends

Personal Banking and Wealth Management (PBWM)

Personal Banking and Wealth Management

As indicated above, PBWM consists of U.S. Personal Banking 
and Global Wealth Management (Global Wealth). U.S. 
Personal Banking provides cards products through Branded 
cards and Retail services, and mortgages and home equity, 
small business and personal consumer loans through Citi’s 
Retail banking network. The Retail bank is concentrated in six 
major metropolitan cities in the U.S. Global Wealth provides 
cards, mortgages and personal, small business and other 
consumer loans through the Private bank, as well as Citigold 
loans in Asia and the U.S. 

As of June 30, 2022, approximately 43% of PBWM 
consumer loans consisted of Branded cards and Retail services 
card loans, which generally drives the overall credit 
performance of PBWM. 

As shown in the chart above, the second quarter of 2022 
net credit loss rate in PBWM was broadly stable quarter-over-
quarter and decreased year-over-year, primarily reflecting high 
payment rates in Branded cards and Retail services, driven by 
the continued impact of government stimulus, unemployment 
benefits and consumer relief programs.

PBWM’s 90+ days past due delinquency rate remained 
broadly stable quarter-over-quarter. The 90+ days past due 
delinquency rate decreased year-over-year, primarily due to 
the continued impacts of government stimulus, unemployment 
benefits and consumer relief programs.

Branded Cards

U.S. Personal Banking’s Branded cards portfolio includes 

proprietary and co-branded cards. 

As shown in the chart above, the second quarter of 2022 

net credit loss rate in Branded cards increased quarter-over-
quarter, driven by a modest increase in net flow rates, and 
decreased year-over-year, primarily reflecting the continued 
impact of high payment rates, driven by government stimulus, 
unemployment benefits and consumer relief programs.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate remained broadly 

stable quarter-over-quarter, as the increase in net flow rates 
was offset by higher volumes, and decreased year-over year, 
primarily reflecting the continued impact of high payment 
rates, driven by government stimulus, unemployment benefits 
and consumer relief programs.

Retail Services

U.S. Personal Banking’s Retail services partners directly 

with more than 20 retailers and dealers to offer private label 
and co-branded cards. Retail services’ target market focuses 
on select industry segments such as home improvement, 
specialty retail, consumer electronics and fuel.

Retail services continually evaluates opportunities to add 

partners within target industries that have strong loyalty, 
lending or payment programs and growth potential.

As shown in the chart above, the second quarter of 2022 

net credit loss rate in Retail services increased quarter-over-
quarter, driven by a modest increase in net flow rates, and 
decreased year-over-year, primarily reflecting the continued 
impact of high payment rates, driven by government stimulus, 
unemployment benefits and consumer relief programs.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate remained broadly 

stable quarter-over-quarter and increased year-over-year, 
driven by a modest increase in net flow rates. 

For additional information on cost of credit, delinquency 

and other information for Citi’s cards portfolios, see each 
respective business’s results of operations above and Note 13.

Retail Banking

The Retail banking portfolio (within U.S. Personal 
Banking) consists primarily of consumer mortgages and other 
secured lending products such as small business loans, and 
personal loans. The portfolio is generally delinquency 
managed, where Citi evaluates credit risk based on FICO 
scores, delinquencies and the value of underlying collateral. 
The mortgages in this portfolio have historically been 
extended to high credit quality customers, generally with loan-
to-value ratios that are less than 80% on first and second 
mortgages. For additional information, see “Loan-to-Value 
(LTV) Ratios” in Note 13.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 

Retail banking for the second quarter of 2022 decreased 
quarter-over-quarter, due to industry-wide episodic overdraft 
losses in the prior quarter and early in the second quarter, and 
increased year-over-year, primarily driven by the episodic 
losses.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate declined quarter-

over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily reflecting the 
continued impacts of government stimulus, unemployment 
benefits and consumer relief programs.

Global Wealth

The Global Wealth credit portfolio primarily consists of 

consumer mortgages, cards and other lending products 
extended to customer segments that range from the affluent to 
ultra-high-net-worth through both the Private bank and 
Citigold. These customer segments represent a target market 
that is characterized by historically low default rates and 
delinquencies. 

As of June 30, 2022, $54.8 billion, or 37%, of the 

portfolio was classifiably managed and primarily consisted of 
margin lending, commercial real estate, subscription credit 
finance and other lending programs. These classifiably 

40

managed loans are primarily evaluated for credit risk based on 
their internal risk rating, of which 94% is rated investment 
grade. In the chart above, while the delinquency rate is 
calculated only for the delinquency-managed portfolio, the net 
credit loss rate is calculated using net credit losses for both the 
delinquency and classifiably managed portfolios.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate for 
the second quarter of 2022 was largely stable quarter-over-
quarter and declined year-over-year, primarily driven by the 
impact of the charge-off of peak delinquent loans in Asia in 
early 2021, resulting in lower delinquencies that led to lower 
net credit losses. The 90+ days past due delinquency rate 
declined quarter-over-quarter, and was unchanged year-over-
year.

Legacy Franchises
Legacy Franchises provides traditional retail banking and 
branded card products to retail and small business customers 
in Asia Consumer and Mexico Consumer.

Asia(1) Consumer

(1) Asia Consumer includes Legacy Franchises activities in certain EMEA 

countries for all periods presented.

As of June 30, 2022, Asia Consumer operated in the 
remaining 12 countries in Asia and EMEA (Australia was 
included until its sale on June 1, 2022) and provides credit 
cards, consumer mortgages and small business and personal 
loans.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 

Asia Consumer for the second quarter of 2022 decreased 
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, driven by the impact 
of the charge-off of peak delinquent loans in early 2021, 
resulting in lower delinquencies that led to lower net credit 
losses in the current quarter. The decrease was also driven by 
the reclassification of approximately $19 billion of loans ($13 
billion of retail banking loans and $6 billion of credit card loan 
balances) to held-for-sale as a result of Citi’s agreements to 
sell its consumer banking businesses in the Philippines, 
Bahrain, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand and 
Vietnam (Asia HFS reclass).

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate remained broadly 

stable quarter-over-quarter and decreased year-over-year, 
mainly driven by the impact of the Asia HFS reclass and the 
charge-off of peak delinquencies.

The performance of Asia Consumer’s portfolios continues 

to reflect the strong credit profiles in the region’s target 
customer segments. Regulatory changes in many markets in 

 
Asia over the past few years have also resulted in improved 
credit quality. 

Mexico Consumer

Mexico Consumer operates in Mexico through 

Citibanamex and provides credit cards, consumer mortgages 
and small business and personal loans. Mexico Consumer 
serves a more mass-market segment in Mexico and focuses on 
developing multiproduct relationships with customers.

As shown in the chart above, the second quarter of 2022 

net credit loss rate in Mexico Consumer decreased quarter-
over-quarter and year-over-year, driven by the impact of the 
charge-off of peak delinquencies in early 2021, resulting in 
lower delinquencies that led to lower net credit losses in the 
current quarter. The decline was also driven by growth in card 
balances.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate decreased 
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, driven by the impact 
of the charge-off of peak delinquencies and high payment 
rates.

For additional information on cost of credit, loan delinquency 
and other information for Citi’s consumer loan portfolios, see 
PBWM and Legacy Franchises results of operations above and 
Note 13.

U.S. Cards FICO Distribution
The following tables show the current FICO score

(1)  The FICO bands in the tables are consistent with general industry peer 

presentations. 

The FICO distribution of both cards portfolios remained 

largely stable compared to the prior quarter and declined 
modestly compared to the prior year. The FICO distribution 
continues to reflect strong underlying credit quality and a 
benefit from the continued impacts of government stimulus, 
unemployment benefits and customer relief programs, as well 
as lower credit utilization primarily by customers with lower 
FICO scores. See Note 13 for additional information on FICO 
scores.

(1) End-of-period (EOP) loans include interest and fees on credit cards.
(2) The ratios of 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due are calculated based on EOP loans, net of unearned income.
(3) The 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios for Retail banking exclude loans guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies since the 

potential risk of loss predominantly resides with the U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past due and (EOP loans) 
were $119 million ($0.7 billion), $161 million ($0.9 billion) and $150 million ($0.7 billion) at June 30, 2022, March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2021, respectively. The 
amounts excluded for loans 30–89 days past due (the 30–89 days past due EOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP loans) were $72 
million, $62 million and $80 million at June 30, 2022, March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2021, respectively. The EOP loans in the table include the guaranteed loans.

(4) The 90+ days past due balances for Branded cards and Retail services are generally still accruing interest. Citigroup’s policy is generally to accrue interest on 

credit card loans until 180 days past due, unless a notification of bankruptcy filing has been received earlier.

(5) Excludes EOP classifiably managed Private bank loans. These loans are not included in the delinquency numerator, denominator and ratios. 
(6) These loans are evaluated for non-accrual status and write-off primarily based on their internal risk classification and not solely on their delinquency status, and 

therefore delinquency metrics are excluded from this table. As of June 30, 2022, March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2021, 94%, 92% and 95% of the Global Wealth 
classifiably managed loans were rated investment grade. For additional information on the credit quality of the Global Wealth portfolio, including classifiably 
managed portfolios, see “Consumer Credit Trends” above.

(7) Asia Consumer includes delinquencies and loans in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.

(8) Citi recently entered into agreements to sell certain Asia consumer banking businesses. Accordingly, the loans of these businesses have been reclassified as HFS 

in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and hence the loans and related delinquencies and ratios are not included in this table. The reclassifications 
commenced as follows: Australia (3Q21, and closed on June 1, 2022), the Philippines (4Q21) and Bahrain, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand and 
Vietnam (1Q22). See Note 2 for additional information.

(9) The 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are primarily related to U.S. mortgages guaranteed by U.S. 
government-sponsored agencies since the potential risk of loss predominantly resides with the U.S. agencies. The amounts excluded for 90+ days past due and 
(EOP loans) were $84 million ($0.2 billion), $124 million ($0.4 billion) and $125 million ($0.4 billion) at June 30, 2022, March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2021, 
respectively. The amounts excluded for loans 30–89 days past due (the 30–89 days past due EOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP 
loans) were $27 million, $34 million and $48 million at June 30, 2022, March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2021, respectively. The EOP loans in the table include the 
guaranteed loans.

(2) The ratios of net credit losses are calculated based on average loans, net of unearned income.
(3) Asia Consumer includes NCLs and average loans in certain EMEA countries (Russia, Poland and Bahrain) for all periods presented.
(4) Citi recently entered into agreements to sell certain Asia consumer banking businesses, which have been reclassified as HFS in Other assets and Other liabilities 

on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As a result, approximately $50 million and $53 million in related net credit losses (NCLs) were recorded as a reduction in 
revenue (Other revenue) in the second and first quarters of 2022, respectively. Accordingly, these NCLs are not included in this table. The reclassifications 
commenced as follows: Australia (3Q21, and closed on June 1, 2022), the Philippines (4Q21) and Bahrain, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand and 
Vietnam (1Q22). See Note 2 for additional information.

(1) North America includes the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Mexico is included in offices outside North America. The classification of corporate loans between 

offices in North America and outside North America is based on the domicile of the booking unit. The difference between the domicile of the booking unit and the 
domicile of the managing unit is not material. 

(2) Loans secured primarily by real estate.
(3) Consumer loans are net of unearned income of $631 million, $591 million, $629 million, $616 million and $633 million at June 30, 2022, March 31, 2022, 

December 31, 2021, September 30, 2021 and June 30, 2021, respectively. Unearned income on consumer loans primarily represents unamortized origination fees 
and costs, premiums and discounts. 

(4) Corporate loans include Mexico SBMM loans and are net of unearned income of $(759) million, $(766) million, $(770) million, $(798) million and $(798) million 
at June 30, 2022, March 31, 2022, December 31, 2021, September 30, 2021 and June 30, 2021, respectively. Unearned income on corporate loans primarily 
represents interest received in advance, but not yet earned, on loans originated on a discounted basis.

(5) Because loans carried at fair value do not have an ACLL, they are excluded from the ACLL ratio calculation.

Non-Accrual Loans and Assets and Renegotiated Loans
For additional information on Citi’s non-accrual loans and 
assets and renegotiated loans, see “Non-Accrual Loans and 
Assets and Renegotiated Loans” in Citi’s 2021 Form 10-K.

Non-Accrual Loans
The table below summarizes Citigroup’s non-accrual loans as 
of the periods indicated. Non-accrual loans may still be current 
on interest payments. In situations where Citi reasonably 
expects that only a portion of the principal owed will 
ultimately be collected, all payments received are reflected as 
a reduction of principal and not as interest income. For all 
other non-accrual loans, cash interest receipts are generally 
recorded as revenue.

(1) Corporate loans are placed on non-accrual status based upon a review by Citigroup’s risk officers. Corporate non-accrual loans may still be current on interest 

payments. With limited exceptions, the following practices are applied for consumer loans: consumer loans, excluding credit cards and mortgages, are placed on 
non-accrual status at 90 days past due and are charged off at 120 days past due; residential mortgage loans are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and 
written down to net realizable value at 180 days past due. Consistent with industry conventions, Citigroup generally accrues interest on credit card loans until such 
loans are charged off, which typically occurs at 180 days contractual delinquency. As such, the non-accrual loan disclosures do not include credit card loans. The 
balances above represent non-accrual loans within Corporate loans and Consumer loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. While corporate non-accrual loans 
are down year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, the increase from December 31, 2021 relates to Russia-related exposures, which are adequately reserved for.

(2) Approximately 52%, 66%, 56%, 58% and 55% of Citi’s corporate non-accrual loans were performing at June 30, 2022, March 31, 2022, December 31, 2021, 

September 30, 2021 and June 30, 2021, respectively.

(3) The June 30, 2022 total corporate non-accrual loans represented 0.55% of total corporate loans. 
(4)  Asia Consumer includes balances in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.

Note: The amounts shown in the table above are presented on an average basis. For securities, the amounts represent the liquidity value that potentially could be 
realized and, therefore, exclude any securities that are encumbered and incorporate any haircuts applicable under the U.S. LCR rule. The table above incorporates 
various restrictions that could limit the transferability of liquidity between legal entities, including Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.
(1)  Foreign government debt includes securities issued or guaranteed by foreign sovereigns, agencies and multilateral development banks. Foreign government debt 
securities are held largely to support local liquidity requirements and Citi’s local franchises and principally include government bonds from Japan, Mexico, 
Singapore, Hong Kong and India. 

The table above includes average amounts of HQLA held 
at Citigroup’s operating entities that are eligible for inclusion 
in the calculation of Citigroup’s consolidated Liquidity 
Coverage ratio (LCR), pursuant to the U.S. LCR rules. These 
amounts include the HQLA needed to meet the minimum 
requirements at these entities as well as any amounts in excess 
of these minimums that are available to be transferred to other 
entities within Citigroup. Citigroup’s average HQLA for the 
second quarter of 2022 decreased quarter-over-quarter, 
primarily driven by funding requirements at non-bank entities, 
partially offset by long-term debt issuances. 

As of June 30, 2022, Citigroup had approximately $964 
billion of available liquidity resources to support client and 
business needs, including end-of-period HQLA assets; 
additional unencumbered securities, including excess liquidity 
held at bank entities that is non-transferable to other entities 
within Citigroup; and available assets not already accounted 
for within Citi’s HQLA to support Federal Home Loan Bank 
(FHLB) and Federal Reserve Bank discount window 
borrowing capacity.

Short-Term Liquidity Measurement: Liquidity Coverage 
Ratio (LCR)
In addition to internal 30-day liquidity stress testing performed 
for Citi’s major entities, operating subsidiaries and countries, 
Citi also monitors its liquidity by reference to the LCR. The 
table below details the components of Citi’s LCR calculation 
and HQLA in excess of net outflows for the periods indicated:

primarily driven by a reduction in average HQLA, partially 
offset by a reduction in average net outflows.

End-of-period deposits increased 1% year-over-year, 
largely driven by growth in Treasury and trade solutions 
(TTS) and Global Wealth. End-of-period deposits decreased 
1% sequentially.

On an average basis, deposits were largely unchanged 
year-over-year and declined 1% sequentially. Year-over-year, 
average deposits reflected a decline in Legacy Franchises due 
to the impact of held-for-sale accounting as a result of the 
signing of sale agreements for consumer franchises in Asia 
and EMEA. The decline was largely offset by a 6% increase in 
PBWM, led by growth in both U.S. Personal Banking and 
Global Wealth. In addition, ICG average deposits grew 1% 
year-over-year, driven by an increase in TTS. 

Long-Term Liquidity Measurement: Net Stable Funding 
Ratio (NSFR)
As previously disclosed, the U.S. banking agencies adopted a 
final rule to assess the availability of a bank’s stable funding 
against a required level. 

The final rule became effective beginning July 1, 2021, 
while public disclosure requirements to report the ratio will 
occur on a semiannual basis beginning June 30, 2023. Citi was 
in compliance with the final rule as of June 30, 2022.

End-of-period loans decreased 3% year-over-year as 
growth in ICG and PBWM (up 2% and 4%, respectively) was 
more than offset by lower loans in Legacy Franchises. End-of-
period loans were largely unchanged sequentially.

On an average basis, loans declined 2% year-over-year 
and increased 1% sequentially. The year-over-year decline 
was primarily due to Legacy Franchises, which more than 
offset growth in both PBWM and ICG. The decline in Legacy 
Franchises primarily reflected the reclassification of loans to 
Other assets to reflect held-for-sale accounting as a result of 
the signing of sales agreements for consumer franchises in 
Asia and EMEA. PBWM average loans increased 4% year-
over-year, primarily driven by Branded cards, Retail services 
and Global Wealth. ICG average loans increased 3% year-
over-year driven by trade finance.

Long-Term Debt 
The weighted-average maturity of unsecured long-term debt 
issued by Citigroup and its affiliates (including Citibank) with 
a remaining life greater than one year was approximately 
8.0 years as of June 30, 2022, compared to 8.8 years as of the 
prior year and 8.5 years as of the prior quarter. The weighted-
average maturity is calculated based on the contractual 
maturity of each security. For securities that are redeemable 
prior to maturity at the option of the holder, the weighted-
average maturity is calculated based on the earliest date an 
option becomes exercisable.

Citi’s long-term debt outstanding at the Citigroup parent 

company includes benchmark senior and subordinated debt 
and what Citi refers to as customer-related debt, consisting of 
structured notes, such as equity- and credit-linked notes, as 
well as non-structured notes. Citi’s issuance of customer-
related debt is generally driven by customer demand and 
complements benchmark debt issuance as a source of funding 
for Citi’s non-bank entities. Citi’s long-term debt at the bank 
includes bank notes, FHLB advances and securitizations.

Note: Amounts represent the current value of long-term debt on Citi’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheet that, for certain debt instruments, includes 
consideration of fair value, hedging impacts and unamortized discounts and 
premiums.
(1) Non-bank includes long-term debt issued to third parties by the parent 

holding company (Citigroup) and Citi’s non-bank subsidiaries (including 
broker-dealer subsidiaries) that are consolidated into Citigroup. As of 
June 30, 2022, non-bank included $70.8 billion of long-term debt issued 
by Citi’s broker-dealer and other subsidiaries that are consolidated into 
Citigroup. Certain Citigroup consolidated hedging activities are also 
included in this line.

(2) Local country and other includes debt issued by Citi’s affiliates in 
support of their local operations. Within non-bank, certain secured 
financing is also included.

(3) Predominantly credit card securitizations, primarily backed by Branded 

cards receivables.

Citi’s total long-term debt outstanding declined 3% year-

over-year, as declines in FHLB borrowings at the bank and 
unsecured benchmark senior debt at the non-bank entities were 
partially offset by the issuance of customer-related debt at the 
non-bank entities. Sequentially, long-term debt outstanding 
increased 1%, largely driven by an increase in customer-
related debt at the non-bank entities, partially offset by a 
decline in long-term debt at the bank. 

As part of its liability management, Citi has considered, 

and may continue to consider, opportunities to redeem or 
repurchase its long-term debt pursuant to open market 
purchases, tender offers or other means. Such redemptions and 
repurchases help reduce Citi’s overall funding costs. During 
the second quarter of 2022, Citi redeemed or repurchased an 
aggregate of approximately $2.5 billion of its outstanding 
long-term debt.

Citi manages the risks in its secured funding by 

conducting daily stress tests to account for changes in 
capacity, tenor, haircut, collateral profile and client actions. In 
addition, Citi maintains counterparty diversification by 
establishing concentration triggers and assessing counterparty 
reliability and stability under stress. Citi generally sources 
secured funding from more than 150 counterparties.

Short-Term Borrowings
Citi’s short-term borrowings of $40 billion increased 27% 
year-over-year and 33% sequentially, reflecting an increase in 
FHLB advances and commercial paper issuance (see Note 16 
for further information on Citigroup’s and its affiliates’ 
outstanding short-term borrowings).

Secured Funding Transactions and Short-Term 
Borrowings
Citi supplements its primary sources of funding with short-
term financings that generally include (i) secured funding 
transactions consisting of securities loaned or sold under 
agreements to repurchase, i.e., repos, and (ii) to a lesser extent, 
short-term borrowings consisting of commercial paper and 
borrowings from the FHLB and other market participants. 

Secured Funding Transactions
Secured funding is primarily accessed through Citi’s broker-
dealer subsidiaries to fund efficiently both (i) secured lending 
activity and (ii) a portion of the securities inventory held in the 
context of market making and customer activities. Citi also 
executes a smaller portion of its secured funding transactions 
through its bank entities, which are typically collateralized by 
government debt securities. Generally, daily changes in the 
level of Citi’s secured funding are primarily due to 
fluctuations in secured lending activity in the matched book 
(as described below) and securities inventory. 

Secured funding of $198 billion as of June 30, 2022 
decreased 11% from the prior-year period and decreased 3% 
sequentially, driven by normal business activity. The average 
balance for secured funding was approximately $208 billion 
for the quarter ended June 30, 2022.

The portion of secured funding in the broker-dealer 
subsidiaries that funds secured lending is commonly referred 
to as “matched book” activity. The majority of this activity is 
secured by high-quality liquid securities such as U.S. Treasury 
securities, U.S. agency securities and foreign government debt 
securities. Other secured funding is secured by less liquid 
securities, including equity securities, corporate bonds and 
asset-backed securities, the tenor of which is generally equal 
to or longer than the tenor of the corresponding matched book 
assets.

The remainder of the secured funding activity in the 
broker-dealer subsidiaries serves to fund securities inventory 
held in the context of market making and customer activities. 
To maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market 
conditions, including under periods of stress, Citi manages 
these activities by taking into consideration the quality of the 
underlying collateral and establishing minimum required 
funding tenors. The weighted average maturity of Citi’s 
secured funding of less liquid securities inventory was greater 
than 110 days as of June 30, 2022.

Credit Ratings
While not included in the table below, the long-term and 
short-term ratings of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. 
(CGMHI) were A/A-1 at S&P Global Ratings and A+/F1 at 
Fitch as of June 30, 2022.

S&P Global Ratings (S&P)

Potential Impacts of Ratings Downgrades
Ratings downgrades by Moody’s, Fitch or S&P could 
negatively impact Citigroup’s and/or Citibank’s funding and 
liquidity due to reduced funding capacity, including derivative 
triggers, which could take the form of cash obligations and 
collateral requirements.

For additional information on the impact of credit rating 

changes on Citi and its applicable subsidiaries, see “Risk 
Factors—Liquidity Risks” and “Credit Ratings” in Citi’s 2021 
Form 10-K.

Citigroup Inc. and Citibank—Potential Derivative Triggers
As of June 30, 2022, Citi estimates that a hypothetical one-
notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of 
Citigroup Inc. across all three major rating agencies could 
impact Citigroup’s funding and liquidity due to derivative 
triggers by approximately $0.5 billion, compared to $1.1 
billion as of March 31, 2022. Other funding sources, such as 
secured financing transactions and other margin requirements, 
for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be 
adversely affected.

As of June 30, 2022, Citi estimates that a hypothetical 
one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of 
Citibank across all three major rating agencies could impact 
Citibank’s funding and liquidity due to derivative triggers by 
approximately $0.7 billion, compared to $0.6 billion as of 
March 31, 2022. Other funding sources, such as secured 
funding transactions and other margin requirements, for which 
there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely 
impacted.

In total, as of June 30, 2022, Citi estimates that a one-

notch downgrade of Citigroup and Citibank across all three 
major rating agencies could result in increased aggregate cash 
obligations and collateral requirements of approximately $1.2 
billion, compared to $1.7 billion as of March 31, 2022 (see 
also Note 19). As detailed under “High-Quality Liquid Assets 
(HQLA)” above, Citigroup has various liquidity resources 
available to its bank and non-bank entities in part as a 
contingency for the potential events described above.

Citibank—Additional Potential Impacts
In addition to the above derivative triggers, Citi believes that a 
potential downgrade of Citibank’s senior debt/long-term rating 
across any of the three major rating agencies could also have 
an adverse impact on the commercial paper/short-term rating 
of Citibank. As of June 30, 2022, Citibank had liquidity 
commitments of approximately $9.0 billion to consolidated 
asset-backed commercial paper conduits, compared to $9.1 
billion as of March 31, 2022 (see Note 18 for additional 
information).

In addition to the above-referenced liquidity resources of 

certain Citibank entities, Citibank could reduce the funding 
and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades 
described above through mitigating actions, including 
repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial 
paper conduits. In the event of the potential downgrades 
described above, Citi believes that certain corporate customers 
could re-evaluate their deposit relationships with Citibank. 
This re-evaluation could result in clients adjusting their 
discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository 
institution, which could potentially reduce certain deposit 
levels at Citibank. However, Citi could choose to adjust 
pricing, offer alternative deposit products to its existing 
customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers, in 
addition to the mitigating actions referenced above.

MARKET RISK

Market risk arises from both Citi’s trading and non-trading 
portfolios. For additional information on market risk and 
market risk management at Citi, see “Market Risk” and “Risk 
Factors” in Citi’s 2021 Form 10-K.

(1) Certain trading-oriented businesses within Citi have accrual-accounted positions that are excluded from the estimated impact to net interest income in the table, 
since these exposures are managed economically in combination with mark-to-market positions. The U.S. dollar interest rate exposure associated with these 
businesses was $(17) million for a 100 bps instantaneous increase in interest rates as of June 30, 2022.
Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments.

The estimated impact to Citi’s net interest income (IRE) 

Citi is planning to transition the sensitivity analysis for its 

declined from the first quarter of 2022, driven by lower 
expected gains due to U.S. dollar rate moves that have already 
been realized. At higher rate levels, Citi assumes it will pass 
on a larger share of rate changes to its depositors, further 
reducing Citi’s IRE sensitivity.

The decline in the estimated impact to AOCI primarily 
reflected a continuation of the positioning strategy of Citi’s 
investment securities and related interest rate derivatives 
portfolio.

In the event of a parallel instantaneous 100 bps increase in 

interest rates, as of June 30, 2022, Citi expects that the $2.5 
billion initial negative impact to AOCI would be offset in 
stockholders’ equity through the expected recovery of the 
impact on AOCI through accretion of Citi’s investment 
portfolio and expected NII benefit  over approximately 11 
months.

net interest income, employing enhanced methodologies and 
changes to certain assumptions. The changes include, among 
other things, assumptions around the projected balance sheet 
(holding it static), coupled with revisions to the treatment of 
certain business contributions to IRE. These changes will be 
implemented and disclosed before the end of 2022 and will 
result in a better reflection of the nature of the portfolios.
The following table presents the estimated impact to 
Citi’s net interest income, AOCI and the Common Equity 
Tier 1 Capital ratio (on a fully implemented basis) under five 
different changes in interest rate scenarios for the U.S. dollar 
and Citi’s other currencies. The 100 bps downward rate 
scenarios are impacted by the low level of interest rates in 
several countries and the assumption that market interest rates, 
as well as rates paid to depositors and charged to borrowers, 
do not fall below zero (i.e., the “flooring assumption”). The 
rate scenarios are also impacted by convexity related to 
mortgage products.

Note: Each scenario assumes that the rate change will occur instantaneously. Changes in interest rates for maturities between the overnight rate and the 10-year rate are 
interpolated. 
(1)

Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments.

As shown in the table above, the magnitude of the impact 

This impact is also before any mitigating actions Citi may 

to Citi’s net interest income and AOCI is greater under 
Scenario 2 as compared to Scenario 3. This is because the 
combination of changes to Citi’s investment portfolio, 
partially offset by changes related to Citi’s pension liabilities, 
results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at 
shorter- and intermediate-term maturities.

Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates—Impacts on AOCI 
and Capital
As of June 30, 2022, Citi estimates that an unanticipated 
parallel instantaneous 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar 
against all of the other currencies in which Citi has invested 
capital could reduce Citi’s tangible common equity (TCE) by 
approximately $1.6 billion, or 1.0%, as a result of changes to 
Citi’s foreign currency translation adjustment in AOCI, net of 
hedges. This impact would be primarily due to changes in the 
value of the Mexican peso, Euro and Indian rupee.

take, including ongoing management of its foreign currency 
translation exposure. Specifically, as currency movements 
change the value of Citi’s net investments in foreign currency-
denominated capital, these movements also change the value 
of Citi’s risk-weighted assets denominated in those currencies. 
This, coupled with Citi’s foreign currency hedging strategies, 
such as foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency 
forwards and other currency hedging instruments, lessens the 
impact of foreign currency movements on Citi’s Common 
Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio. Changes in these hedging 
strategies, as well as hedging costs, divestitures and tax 
impacts, can further affect the actual impact of changes in 
foreign exchange rates on Citi’s capital as compared to an 
unanticipated parallel shock, as described above.

The effect of Citi’s ongoing management strategies with 

respect to changes in foreign exchange rates, and the impact of 
these changes on Citi’s TCE and Common Equity Tier 1 
Capital ratio, are shown in the table below. See Note 17 for 
additional information on the changes in AOCI.

Interest revenue and Net interest income include the taxable equivalent adjustments primarily related to the tax-exempt bond portfolio and certain tax-advantaged 
loan programs (based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%) of $44 million, $42 million and $51 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022, 
March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2021, respectively. 
Interest expense associated with certain hybrid financial instruments, which are classified as Long-term debt and accounted for at fair value, is reported together 
with any changes in fair value as part of Principal transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income and is therefore not reflected in Interest expense in the 
table above.

(3) The average rate on interest revenue and net interest margin reflects the taxable equivalent gross-up adjustment. See footnote 1 above.

Interest revenue and Net interest income include the taxable equivalent adjustments discussed in the table above.

Citi’s NII in the second quarter of 2022 increased 14% to 
$12.0 billion versus the prior-year period. As presented in the 
table above, Citi’s NII on a taxable equivalent basis also 
increased 14% year-over-year, or $1.5 billion, driven by 
higher NII in non-ICG Markets, while NII in ICG Markets 
(Fixed income markets and Equity markets) was largely 
unchanged. The increase in non-ICG Markets NII primarily 
reflected higher interest income from cards, higher deposit 
volumes and deposit spreads in Services, and higher income 
from Citi’s investment portfolio. 

Citi’s NIM was 2.24% on a taxable equivalent basis in the 
second quarter of 2022, an increase of 19 basis points from the 
prior quarter, driven by the impact of higher interest rates, 
higher deposit spreads in Services, higher interest income 
from loans and higher NII in ICG Markets.

Market Risk of Trading Portfolios

Value at Risk (VAR)
Citi believes its VAR model is conservatively calibrated to incorporate fat-tail scaling and the greater of short-term (approximately the 
most recent month) and long-term (three years) market volatility. As of June 30, 2022, Citi estimates that the conservative features of 
the VAR calibration contribute an approximate 53% add-on to what would be a VAR estimated under the assumption of stable and 
perfectly, normally distributed markets. As of March 31, 2022, the add-on was 41%.

As presented in the table below, Citi’s average trading VAR for the second quarter of 2022 increased quarter-over-quarter, mainly 

due to higher volatilities and increased mark-to-market hedging in the ICG Markets businesses.

(1)  Covariance adjustment (also known as diversification benefit) equals the difference between the total VAR and the sum of the VARs tied to each risk type. The 
benefit reflects the fact that the risks within individual and across risk types are not perfectly correlated and, consequently, the total VAR on a given day will be 
lower than the sum of the VARs relating to each risk type. The determination of the primary drivers of changes to the covariance adjustment is made by an 
examination of the impact of both model parameter and position changes.

(2)  The total trading VAR includes mark-to-market and certain fair value option trading positions in ICG, with the exception of hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value 

option loans and all CVA exposures. Available-for-sale and accrual exposures are not included.

(3)  The specific risk-only component represents the level of equity and fixed income issuer-specific risk embedded in VAR. 
(4)  The credit portfolio is composed of mark-to-market positions associated with non-trading business units including Citi Treasury, the CVA relating to derivative 
counterparties and all associated CVA hedges. FVA and DVA are not included. The credit portfolio also includes hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value option 
loans and hedges to the leveraged finance pipeline within capital markets origination in ICG.

 OTHER RISKS
For additional information regarding other risks, including 
Citi’s management of other risks, see “Managing Global Risk
—Other Risks” in Citi’s 2021 Form 10-K.

LIBOR Transition Risk 
The Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the LIBOR Act), 
enacted earlier this year, provides for the use of a statutory 
replacement for the overnight, one-month, three-month, six-
month and 12-month tenors of USD LIBOR in all contracts 
governed by U.S. law that lack adequate fallback provisions. 
On July 28, 2022, the Federal Reserve Board published in the 
Federal Register its proposed rulemaking that implements the 
LIBOR Act. The proposal contains the Federal Reserve 
Board’s recommendation of benchmark replacements for 
various product types. As required by the LIBOR Act, each 
proposed replacement rate is based on the Secured Overnight 
Financing Rate (SOFR). Citi continues to review the effect of 
the LIBOR Act and the Federal Reserve Board’s proposal, 
which is expected to facilitate the transition to replacement 
rates for Citi’s USD LIBOR-linked securities, loans and 
contracts without fallbacks or fallbacks based on USD LIBOR 
that have not yet been remediated.

For additional information about Citi’s actions to address 

a transition away from and discontinuance of LIBOR, see 
“Managing Global Risk—Other Risks—LIBOR Transition 
Risk” in Citi’s 2021 Form 10-K. For information about Citi’s 
LIBOR transition risks, see “Risk Factors—Other Risks” in 
the 2021 Form 10-K.

Regulatory VAR Back-testing
In accordance with Basel III, Citi is required to perform back-
testing to evaluate the effectiveness of its Regulatory VAR 
model. Regulatory VAR back-testing is the process in which 
the daily one-day VAR, at a 99% confidence interval, is 
compared to the buy-and-hold profit and loss (i.e., the profit 
and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of 
the day and re-priced the following day). Buy-and-hold profit 
and loss represents the daily mark-to-market profit and loss 
attributable to price movements in covered positions from the 
close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and 
loss excludes realized trading revenue, net interest, fees and 
commissions, intra-day trading profit and loss and changes in 
reserves.

Based on a 99% confidence level, Citi would expect two 

to three days in any one year where buy-and-hold losses 
exceed the Regulatory VAR. Given the conservative 
calibration of Citi’s VAR model (as a result of taking the 
greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-tail scaling 
of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer exceptions under 
normal and stable market conditions. Periods of unstable 
market conditions could increase the number of back-testing 
exceptions.

As of June 30, 2022, there were two back-testing 

exceptions observed for Citi’s Regulatory VAR in the last 12 
months.

Country Risk

Top 25 Country Exposures
The following table presents Citi’s top 25 exposures by 
country (excluding the U.S.) as of June 30, 2022. (Including 
the U.S., the total exposure as of June 30, 2022 to the top 25 
countries would represent approximately 97% of Citi’s 
exposure to all countries.)

For purposes of the table, loan amounts are reflected in 
the country where the loan is booked, which is generally based 
on the domicile of the borrower. For example, a loan to a 
Chinese subsidiary of a Switzerland-based corporation will 
generally be categorized as a loan in China. In addition, Citi 
has developed regional booking centers in certain countries, 

most significantly in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Ireland, 
in order to more efficiently serve its corporate customers. As 
an example, with respect to the U.K., only 37% of corporate 
loans presented in the table below are to U.K. domiciled 
entities (37% for unfunded commitments), with the balance of 
the loans predominately to European domiciled counterparties. 
Approximately 88% of the total U.K. funded loans and 87% of 
the total U.K. unfunded commitments were investment grade 
as of June 30, 2022. 

Trading account assets and investment securities are 
generally categorized based on the domicile of the issuer of 
the security of the underlying reference entity. For additional 
information on the assets included in the table, see the 
footnotes to the table below.
