MANAGING GLOBAL RISK

For Citi, effective risk management is of primary importance 
to its overall operations. Accordingly, Citi’s risk management 
process has been designed to monitor, evaluate and manage 
the principal risks it assumes in conducting its activities. 
Specifically, the activities that Citi engages in, and the risks 
those activities generate, must be consistent with Citi’s 
mission, strategy, value proposition, key guiding principles 
and risk appetite.

The maintenance of accurate and consistent risk ratings 
across the corporate credit portfolio facilitates the comparison 
of credit exposure across all lines of business, geographic 
regions and products. Counterparty risk ratings reflect an 
estimated probability of default for a counterparty and are 
derived by leveraging validated statistical models, scorecard 
models and external agency ratings (under defined 
circumstances), in combination with consideration of factors 
specific to the obligor or market, such as management 
experience, competitive position, regulatory environment and 
commodity prices. Facility risk ratings are assigned that reflect 
the probability of default of the obligor and factors that affect 
the loss given default of the facility, such as support or 
collateral. Internal obligor ratings that generally correspond to 
BBB and above are considered investment grade, while those 
below are considered non-investment grade.

Note: Total exposure includes direct outstandings and unfunded lending 
commitments. 

In addition to the obligor and facility risk ratings assigned 

to all exposures, Citi may classify exposures in the corporate 
credit portfolio. These classifications are consistent with Citi’s 
interpretation of the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of 
criticized exposures, which may categorize exposures as 
special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss.

Risk ratings and classifications are reviewed regularly, 

and adjusted as appropriate. The credit review process 
incorporates quantitative and qualitative factors, including 
financial and non-financial disclosures or metrics, 
idiosyncratic events or changes to the competitive, regulatory 
or macroeconomic environment. 

Citigroup believes the corporate credit portfolio to be 

appropriately rated and classified as of March 31, 2022. 
Citigroup has taken action to adjust internal ratings and 
classifications of exposures as both the macroeconomic 
environment and obligor-specific factors have changed, 
particularly where additional stress has been seen. 

As obligor risk ratings are downgraded, the probability of 

default increases. Downgrades of obligor risk ratings tend to 
result in a higher provision for credit losses. In addition, 
downgrades may result in the purchase of additional credit 
derivatives or other risk mitigants to hedge the incremental 
credit risk, or may result in Citi’s seeking to reduce exposure 
to an obligor or an industry sector. Citi will continue to review 
exposures to ensure that the appropriate probability of default 
is incorporated into all risk assessments.

See Note 13 for additional information on Citi’s corporate 

credit portfolio.

Credit Risk Mitigation
As part of its overall risk management activities, Citigroup 
uses credit derivatives and other risk mitigants to hedge 
portions of the credit risk in its corporate credit portfolio, in 
addition to outright asset sales. Citi may enter into partial-term 
hedges as well as full-term hedges. In advance of the 
expiration of partial-term hedges, Citi will determine, among 
other factors, the economic feasibility of hedging the 
remaining life of the instrument. The results of the mark-to-
market and any realized gains or losses on credit derivatives 
are reflected primarily in Principal transactions in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income.

At March 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and March 31, 

2021, ICG had economic hedges on the corporate credit 
portfolio of $37.9 billion, $39.3 billion and $38.5 billion, 
respectively. Citigroup’s expected credit loss model used in 
the calculation of its ACL does not include the favorable 
impact of credit derivatives and other mitigants that are 
marked to market. In addition, the reported amounts of direct 
outstandings and unfunded lending commitments in the tables 
above do not reflect the impact of these hedging transactions. 
The credit protection was economically hedging underlying 
ICG corporate credit portfolio exposures with the following 
risk rating distribution:

(1) End-of-period loans include interest and fees on credit cards.
(2) Legacy Franchises—1Q22 Asia Consumer loan balances exclude approximately $29 billion of loans ($20 billion of retail banking loans and $9 billion of credit 

card loan balances) reclassified to held-for-sale (HFS) (Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet) as a result of Citi’s signed agreements to sell its consumer 
banking businesses in nine countries (see Legacy Franchises above and Note 2 for additional information). In addition, the Australia consumer banking business 
was also reclassified to HFS in 3Q21 and 4Q21, and the Philippines consumer banking business was reclassified to HFS in 4Q21, with loans from both businesses 
excluded from the Asia Consumer loan balances as of such periods.

Consumer Credit Trends

Personal Banking and Wealth Management (PBWM)

Personal Banking and Wealth Management

over-quarter, driven by seasonality, and decreased year-over-
year, primarily reflecting the continued impact of high 
payment rates, driven by government stimulus. Year-over-
year, the payment rates were also impacted by unemployment 
benefits and consumer relief programs.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased quarter-
over-quarter due to seasonality, and decreased year-over year, 
primarily reflecting the continued impact of high payment 
rates, driven by government stimulus. Year-over-year, the 
payment rates were also impacted by unemployment benefits 
and consumer relief programs.

Retail Services

PBWM provides mortgage, home equity, small business and 
personal loans through Citi’s Retail banking network; card 
products through Branded cards and Retail services 
businesses; and Private bank loans. The retail bank is 
concentrated in six major metropolitan cities in the U.S. 
As of March 31, 2022, approximately 80% of U.S. 
Personal Banking consumer loans consisted of Branded cards 
and Retail services cards, which generally drives the overall 
credit performance of U.S. Personal Banking. 

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 
PBWM for the first quarter of 2022 increased quarter-over-
quarter, primarily due to seasonality in U.S. Personal 
Banking’s cards portfolios, and decreased year-over-year, 
primarily reflecting the high payment rates in Branded cards 
and Retail services, driven by government stimulus, and 
unemployment benefits and consumer relief programs in U.S. 
Personal Banking.

PBWM’s 90+ days past due delinquency rate remained 
broadly stable quarter-over-quarter. The 90+ days past due 
delinquency rate decreased year-over-year, primarily due to 
the continued impacts of government stimulus, unemployment 
benefits and consumer relief programs in U.S. Personal 
Banking.

Branded Cards

U.S. Personal Banking’s Branded cards portfolio includes 

proprietary and co-branded cards. 

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 

Branded cards for the first quarter of 2022 increased quarter-

37

U.S. Personal Banking’s Retail services partners directly 

with more than 20 retailers and dealers to offer private label 
and co-branded cards. Retail services’ target market focuses 
on select industry segments such as home improvement, 
specialty retail, consumer electronics and fuel.

Retail services continually evaluates opportunities to add 

partners within target industries that have strong loyalty, 
lending or payment programs and growth potential.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 

Retail services for the first quarter of 2022 increased quarter-
over-quarter driven by seasonality, and decreased year-over-
year, primarily reflecting the continued impact of high 
payment rates, driven by government stimulus. Year-over-
year, the payment rates were also impacted by unemployment 
benefits and consumer relief programs.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased quarter-
over-quarter due to seasonality, and decreased year-over-year, 
primarily reflecting the continued impact of high payment 
rates, driven by government stimulus. Year-over-year, the 
payment rates were also impacted by unemployment benefits 
and consumer relief programs. For additional information on 
cost of credit, delinquency and other information for Citi’s 
cards portfolios, see each respective business’s results of 
operations above and Note 13.

Legacy Franchises
Legacy Franchises provides traditional retail banking and 
branded card products to retail and small business customers 
in Asia Consumer and Mexico Consumer.

Asia(1) Consumer

Mexico Consumer

Mexico Consumer operates in Mexico through 

Citibanamex and provides credit cards, consumer mortgages 
and small business and personal loans. Mexico Consumer 
serves a more mass-market segment in Mexico and focuses on 
developing multiproduct relationships with customers.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 

Mexico Consumer for the first quarter of 2022 decreased 
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. The impact of 
charge-offs of delinquent loans in prior quarters resulted in 
lower delinquencies that led to lower net credit losses in the 
current quarter.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate decreased 
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. The impact of 
charge-offs of delinquent loans in prior quarters and higher 
payment rates resulted in a lower 90+ days past due 
delinquency rate in the current quarter.

For additional information on cost of credit, loan delinquency 
and other information for Citi’s consumer loan portfolios, see 
PBWM and Legacy Franchises results of operations above and 
Note 13.

(1) Asia includes Legacy Franchises activities in certain EMEA countries 

for all periods presented.

Asia Consumer operates in 13 countries and jurisdictions 

in Asia and EMEA and provides credit cards, consumer 
mortgages and small business and personal loans.

As shown in the chart above, the first quarter of 2022 net 

credit loss rate in Asia Consumer decreased quarter-over-
quarter and year-over-year, driven by the impact of the charge-
off of peak delinquent loans in recent quarters, resulting in 
lower delinquencies that led to lower net credit losses in the 
current quarter. The decrease was also driven by the 
reclassification of approximately $29 billion of loans ($20 
billion of retail banking loans and $9 billion of credit card loan 
balances) to held-for-sale as a result of Citi’s agreements to 
sell its consumer banking businesses in Australia, the 
Philippines, Bahrain, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, 
Thailand and Vietnam (Asia HFS reclass).

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate decreased 

quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, mainly driven by the 
impact of the Asia HFS reclass and the charge-off of peak 
delinquencies in recent quarters, as elevated losses returned to 
pre-pandemic levels.

The performance of Asia Consumer’s portfolios continues 

to reflect the strong credit profiles in the region’s target 
customer segments. Regulatory changes in many markets in 
Asia over the past few years have also resulted in improved 
credit quality.

presentations. 

The FICO distribution of both cards portfolios remained 

largely stable compared to the prior quarter and improved 
compared to the prior year, demonstrating strong underlying 
credit quality and a benefit from the impacts of government 
stimulus, unemployment benefits and customer relief 
programs, as well as lower credit utilization. See Note 13 for 
additional information on FICO scores.

(1) End-of-period (EOP) loans include interest and fees on credit cards.
(2) The ratios of 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due are calculated based on EOP loans, net of unearned income.
(3) Excludes EOP classifiably managed Private bank loans. These loans are not included in the delinquency numerator, denominator and ratios.
(4) The 90+ days past due balances for Branded cards and Retail services are generally still accruing interest. Citigroup’s policy is generally to accrue interest on 

credit card loans until 180 days past due, unless notification of bankruptcy filing has been received earlier.

(5) The 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios for Retail banking exclude loans guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies since the 

potential loss predominantly resides with the U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past due and (EOP loans) were $161 
million ($0.9 billion), $185 million ($1.1 billion) and $176 million ($0.7 billion) at March 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2021, respectively. The 
amounts excluded for loans 30–89 days past due (the 30–89 days past due EOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP loans) were $62 
million, $74 million and $84 million at March 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2021, respectively. The EOP loans in the table include the guaranteed 
loans. 

(6) Asia Consumer includes delinquencies and loans in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.
(7) Citi recently entered into agreements to sell certain Asia consumer banking businesses. Accordingly, the loans of these businesses have been reclassified as HFS 

in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and hence the loans and related delinquencies and ratios are not included in this table. The reclassifications 
commenced as follows: Australia (3Q21), the Philippines (4Q21) and Bahrain, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam (1Q22). See Note 2 for 
additional information.

(8) The 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are primarily related to U.S. mortgages guaranteed by U.S. 
government-sponsored agencies since the potential loss predominantly resides with the U.S. agencies. The amounts excluded for 90+ days past due and (EOP 
loans) were $124 million ($0.4 billion), $138 million ($0.4 billion) and $169 million ($0.4 billion) at March 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2021, 
respectively. The amounts excluded for loans 30–89 days past due (the 30–89 days past due EOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP 
loans) were $34 million, $35 million and $55 million at March 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2021, respectively. The EOP loans in the table include 
the guaranteed loans.

(9) These loans are evaluated for non-accrual status and write-off based on their internal risk classification and not on their delinquency status.

(1) North America includes the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Mexico is included in offices outside North America. The classification of corporate loans between 

offices in North America and outside North America is based on the domicile of the booking unit. The difference between the domicile of the booking unit and the 
domicile of the managing unit is not material. 

(2) Loans secured primarily by real estate.
(3) Consumer loans are net of unearned income of $591 million, $629 million, $616 million, $633 million and $642 million at March 31, 2022, December 31, 2021, 

September 30, 2021, June 30, 2021 and March 31, 2021, respectively. Unearned income on consumer loans primarily represents unamortized origination fees and 
costs, premiums and discounts. 

(4) Corporate loans include Mexico SBMM loans and are net of unearned income of $(766) million, $(770) million, $(798) million, $(798) million and $(787) million 
at March 31, 2022, December 31, 2021, September 30, 2021, June 30, 2021 and March 31, 2021, respectively. Unearned income on corporate loans primarily 
represents interest received in advance, but not yet earned, on loans originated on a discounted basis.

(5) Because loans carried at fair value do not have an ACLL, they are excluded from the ACLL ratio calculation.

Non-Accrual Loans and Assets and Renegotiated Loans
For additional information on Citi’s non-accrual loans and 
assets and renegotiated loans, see “Non-Accrual Loans and 
Assets and Renegotiated Loans” in Citi’s 2021 Form 10-K.

Non-Accrual Loans
The table below summarizes Citigroup’s non-accrual loans as 
of the periods indicated. Non-accrual loans may still be current 
on interest payments. In situations where Citi reasonably 
expects that only a portion of the principal owed will 
ultimately be collected, all payments received are reflected as 
a reduction of principal and not as interest income. For all 
other non-accrual loans, cash interest receipts are generally 
recorded as revenue.

(1) Corporate loans are placed on non-accrual status based upon a review by Citigroup’s risk officers. Corporate non-accrual loans may still be current on interest 

payments. With limited exceptions, the following practices are applied for consumer loans: consumer loans, excluding credit cards and mortgages, are placed on 
non-accrual status at 90 days past due, and are charged off at 120 days past due; residential mortgage loans are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due 
and written down to net realizable value at 180 days past due. Consistent with industry conventions, Citigroup generally accrues interest on credit card loans until 
such loans are charged off, which typically occurs at 180 days contractual delinquency. As such, the non-accrual loan disclosures do not include credit card loans. 
The balances above represent non-accrual loans within Consumer loans and Corporate loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The increase in corporate non-
accrual loans relates to Russia exposures, which are adequately reserved for.

(2) Approximately 66%, 56%, 58%, 55% and 54% of Citi’s corporate non-accrual loans were performing at March 31, 2022, December 31, 2021, September 30, 

2021, June 30, 2021 and March 31, 2021, respectively.

(3) The March 31, 2022 total corporate non-accrual loans represented 0.60% of total corporate loans.

Note: The amounts set forth in the table above are presented on an average basis. For securities, the amounts represent the liquidity value that potentially could be 
realized and, therefore, exclude any securities that are encumbered and incorporate any haircuts applicable under the U.S. LCR rule. The table above incorporates 
various restrictions that could limit the transferability of liquidity between legal entities, including Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.
(1)  Foreign government debt includes securities issued or guaranteed by foreign sovereigns, agencies and multilateral development banks. Foreign government debt 
securities are held largely to support local liquidity requirements and Citi’s local franchises and principally include government bonds from Japan, Mexico, Hong 
Kong, South Korea and India. 

The table above includes average amounts of HQLA held 
at Citigroup’s operating entities that are eligible for inclusion 
in the calculation of Citigroup’s consolidated Liquidity 
Coverage ratio (LCR), pursuant to the U.S. LCR rules. These 
amounts include the HQLA needed to meet the minimum 
requirements at these entities and any amounts in excess of 
these minimums that are assumed to be transferable to other 
entities within Citigroup. Citigroup’s average HQLA for the 
first quarter of 2022 decreased quarter-over-quarter, primarily 
reflecting a reduction in average deposits, partially offset by 
an increase in unsecured benchmark senior debt. 

As of March 31, 2022, Citigroup had approximately $965 

billion of available liquidity resources to support client and 
business needs, including end-of-period HQLA assets; 
additional unencumbered securities, including excess liquidity 
held at bank entities that is non-transferable to other entities 
within Citigroup; and available assets not already accounted 
for within Citi’s HQLA to support Federal Home Loan Bank 
(FHLB) and Federal Reserve Bank discount window 
borrowing capacity.

Short-Term Liquidity Measurement: Liquidity Coverage 
Ratio (LCR)
In addition to internal 30-day liquidity stress testing performed 
for Citi’s major entities, operating subsidiaries and countries, 
Citi also monitors its liquidity by reference to the LCR. The 
table below details the components of Citi’s LCR calculation 
and HQLA in excess of net outflows for the periods indicated:

As of March 31, 2022, Citigroup’s average LCR

increase was primarily driven by a reduction in non-
operational deposit outflows, partially offset by a decrease in 
average HQLA.

End-of-period deposits increased 3% year-over-year and 

1% sequentially.

On an average basis, deposits increased 2% year-over-

year and declined 3% sequentially. The year-over-year 
increase in average deposits reflected a continuation of 
elevated levels of liquidity in the financial system as well as 
client engagement, partially offset by the impact of held-for-
sale accounting as a result of the entry into sale agreements for
consumer franchises in Asia and EMEA. Average deposits in 
PBWM increased 13%, led by growth in the Private bank. ICG 
average deposits grew 2% year-over-year, driven by an 
increase across both TTS and Securities services. 

Long-Term Liquidity Measurement: Net Stable Funding 
Ratio (NSFR)
As previously disclosed, in October 2020, the U.S. banking 
agencies adopted a final rule to assess the availability of a 
bank’s stable funding against a required level. 

The final rule became effective beginning July 1, 2021, 
while public disclosure requirements to report the ratio will 
occur on a semiannual basis beginning June 30, 2023. Citi was 
in compliance with the final rule as of March 31, 2022.

End-of-period loans decreased 1% year-over-year and

On an average basis, loans declined 3% both year-over-

year and sequentially, driven by lower loans in Legacy 
Franchises, primarily reflecting the impact of held-for-sale 
accounting as a result of the entry into sale agreements for 
consumer franchises in Asia and EMEA. PBWM average loans 
increased 3% year-over-year, primarily driven by secured 
lending in the Private bank, including residential real estate 
lending. ICG average loans increased 3% year-over-year as a 
result of growth in trade loans within TTS.

Long-Term Debt 
The weighted-average maturity of unsecured long-term debt 
issued by Citigroup and its affiliates (including Citibank) with 
a remaining life greater than one year was approximately 
8.5 years as of March 31, 2022, compared to 8.9 years as of 
the prior year and 8.6 years as of the prior quarter. The 
weighted-average maturity is calculated based on the 
contractual maturity of each security. For securities that are 
redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the holder, the 
weighted-average maturity is calculated based on the earliest 
date an option becomes exercisable.

Citi’s long-term debt outstanding at the Citigroup parent 

company includes benchmark senior and subordinated debt 
and what Citi refers to as customer-related debt, consisting of 
structured notes, such as equity- and credit-linked notes, as 
well as non-structured notes. Citi’s issuance of customer-
related debt is generally driven by customer demand and 
complements benchmark debt issuance as a source of funding 
for Citi’s non-bank entities. Citi’s long-term debt at the bank 
includes bank notes, FHLB advances and securitizations.

Note: Amounts represent the current value of long-term debt on Citi’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheet that, for certain debt instruments, includes 
consideration of fair value, hedging impacts and unamortized discounts and 
premiums.
(1) Non-bank includes long-term debt issued to third parties by the parent 

holding company (Citigroup) and Citi’s non-bank subsidiaries (including 
broker-dealer subsidiaries) that are consolidated into Citigroup. As of 
March 31, 2022, non-bank included $64.5 billion of long-term debt 
issued by Citi’s broker-dealer and other subsidiaries that are 
consolidated into Citigroup Inc., the parent holding company. Certain 
Citigroup consolidated hedging activities are also included in this line.

(2) Local country and other includes debt issued by Citi’s affiliates in 
support of their local operations. Within non-bank, certain secured 
financing is also included.

(3) Predominantly credit card securitizations, primarily backed by Branded 

cards receivables.

Citi’s total long-term debt outstanding was largely 
unchanged year-over-year, as declines in FHLB borrowings 
and unsecured benchmark senior debt at the bank were offset 
by the issuance of customer-related debt at the non-bank 
entities. Sequentially, long-term debt outstanding was largely 
unchanged as decreases in FHLB borrowings at the bank were 
mostly offset by an increase in unsecured benchmark senior 
debt at the non-bank entities.

As part of its liability management, Citi has considered, 

and may continue to consider, opportunities to redeem or 
repurchase its long-term debt pursuant to open market 
purchases, tender offers or other means. Such redemptions and 
repurchases help reduce Citi’s overall funding costs. During 
the first quarter of 2022, Citi redeemed or repurchased an 
aggregate of approximately $5.7 billion of its outstanding 
long-term debt.

Citi manages the risks in its secured funding by 

conducting daily stress tests to account for changes in 
capacity, tenor, haircut, collateral profile and client actions. In 
addition, Citi maintains counterparty diversification by 
establishing concentration triggers and assessing counterparty 
reliability and stability under stress. Citi generally sources 
secured funding from more than 150 counterparties.

Short-Term Borrowings
Citi’s short-term borrowings of $30 billion decreased 6% year-
over-year, reflecting a decline in FHLB advances, partially 
offset by commercial paper issuance. On a sequential basis, 
short-term borrowing increased 8%, driven primarily by 
commercial paper issuance (see Note 16 for further 
information on Citigroup’s and its affiliates’ outstanding 
short-term borrowings).

Secured Funding Transactions and Short-Term 
Borrowings
Citi supplements its primary sources of funding with short-
term financings that generally include (i) secured funding 
transactions consisting of securities loaned or sold under 
agreements to repurchase, i.e., repos, and (ii) to a lesser extent, 
short-term borrowings consisting of commercial paper and 
borrowings from the FHLB and other market participants. 

Secured Funding Transactions
Secured funding is primarily accessed through Citi’s broker-
dealer subsidiaries to fund efficiently both (i) secured lending 
activity and (ii) a portion of the securities inventory held in the 
context of market making and customer activities. Citi also 
executes a smaller portion of its secured funding transactions 
through its bank entities, which are typically collateralized by 
government debt securities. Generally, daily changes in the 
level of Citi’s secured funding are primarily due to 
fluctuations in secured lending activity in the matched book 
(as described below) and securities inventory. 

Secured funding of $204 billion as of March 31, 2022 
decreased 7% from the prior-year period and increased 7% 
sequentially, driven by normal business activity. The average 
balance for secured funding was approximately $210 billion 
for the quarter ended March 31, 2022.

The portion of secured funding in the broker-dealer 
subsidiaries that funds secured lending is commonly referred 
to as “matched book” activity. The majority of this activity is 
secured by high-quality liquid securities such as U.S. Treasury 
securities, U.S. agency securities and foreign government debt 
securities. Other secured funding is secured by less liquid 
securities, including equity securities, corporate bonds and 
asset-backed securities, the tenor of which is generally equal 
to or longer than the tenor of the corresponding matched book 
assets.

The remainder of the secured funding activity in the 
broker-dealer subsidiaries serves to fund securities inventory 
held in the context of market making and customer activities. 
To maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market 
conditions, including under periods of stress, Citi manages 
these activities by taking into consideration the quality of the 
underlying collateral and establishing minimum required 
funding tenors. The weighted average maturity of Citi’s 
secured funding of less liquid securities inventory was greater 
than 110 days as of March 31, 2022.

Credit Ratings
While not included in the table below, the long-term and 
short-term ratings of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. 
(CGMHI) were A/A-1 at S&P Global Ratings and A+/F1 at 
Fitch as of March 31, 2022.

Potential Impacts of Ratings Downgrades
Ratings downgrades by Moody’s, Fitch or S&P could 
negatively impact Citigroup’s and/or Citibank’s funding and 
liquidity due to reduced funding capacity, including derivative 
triggers, which could take the form of cash obligations and 
collateral requirements.

For additional information on the impact of credit rating 

changes on Citi and its applicable subsidiaries, see “Risk 
Factors—Liquidity Risks” and “Credit Ratings” in Citi’s 2021 
Form 10-K.

Citigroup Inc. and Citibank—Potential Derivative Triggers
As of March 31, 2022, Citi estimates that a hypothetical one-
notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of 
Citigroup Inc. across all three major rating agencies could 
impact Citigroup’s funding and liquidity due to derivative 
triggers by approximately $1.1 billion, compared to $0.8 
billion as of December 31, 2021. Other funding sources, such 
as secured financing transactions and other margin 
requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could 
also be adversely affected.

As of March 31, 2022, Citi estimates that a hypothetical 
one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of 
Citibank across all three major rating agencies could impact 
Citibank’s funding and liquidity due to derivative triggers by 
approximately $0.6 billion, unchanged from December 31, 
2021. Other funding sources, such as secured funding 
transactions and other margin requirements, for which there 
are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely impacted.

In total, as of March 31, 2022, Citi estimates that a one-
notch downgrade of Citigroup and Citibank across all three 
major rating agencies could result in increased aggregate cash 
obligations and collateral requirements of approximately $1.7 
billion, compared to $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2021 (see 
also Note 19). As detailed under “High-Quality Liquid Assets 
(HQLA)” above, Citigroup has various liquidity resources 
available to its bank and non-bank entities in part as a 
contingency for the potential events described above.

Citibank—Additional Potential Impacts
In addition to the above derivative triggers, Citi believes that a 
potential downgrade of Citibank’s senior debt/long-term rating 
across any of the three major rating agencies could also have 
an adverse impact on the commercial paper/short-term rating 
of Citibank. As of March 31, 2022, Citibank had liquidity 
commitments of approximately $9.1 billion to consolidated 
asset-backed commercial paper conduits, compared to $9.0 
billion as of December 31, 2021 (see Note 18 for additional 
information).

In addition to the above-referenced liquidity resources of 

certain Citibank entities, Citibank could reduce the funding 
and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades 
described above through mitigating actions, including 
repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial 
paper conduits. In the event of the potential downgrades 
described above, Citi believes that certain corporate customers 
could re-evaluate their deposit relationships with Citibank. 
This re-evaluation could result in clients’ adjusting their 
discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository 
institution, which could potentially reduce certain deposit 
levels at Citibank. However, Citi could choose to adjust 
pricing, offer alternative deposit products to its existing 
customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers, in 
addition to the mitigating actions referenced above.

MARKET RISK

Market risk arises from both Citi’s trading and non-trading 
portfolios. For additional information on market risk and 
market risk management at Citi, see “Market Risk” and “Risk 
Factors” in Citi’s 2021 Form 10-K.

Market Risk of Non-Trading Portfolios
The following table sets forth the estimated impact to Citi’s net interest income (referred to as interest rate exposure or IRE), AOCI 
and the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio (on a fully implemented basis), each assuming an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 100 
basis point (bps) increase in interest rates:

(1) Certain trading-oriented businesses within Citi have accrual-accounted positions that are excluded from the estimated impact to net interest income in the table, 
since these exposures are managed economically in combination with mark-to-market positions. The U.S. dollar interest rate exposure associated with these 
businesses was $(127) million for a 100 bps instantaneous increase in interest rates as of March 31, 2022.
Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments.

(2)

The estimated impact to Citi’s net interest income (IRE) 
was largely unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2021, with 
increased expected gains in non-USD currencies offset by 
decreased expected gains due to USD rate moves.

The decline in the estimated impact to AOCI primarily 
reflected a continuation of the positioning strategy of Citi’s 
investment securities and related interest rate derivatives 
portfolio.

In the event of a parallel instantaneous 100 bps increase in 

interest rates, as of March 31, 2022, Citi expects that the $3.4 
billion initial negative impact to AOCI would be offset in 
stockholders’ equity through the expected recovery of the 
impact on AOCI through accretion of Citi’s investment 
portfolio over approximately 15 months.

Citi is planning to transition the sensitivity analysis for its 

net interest income, employing enhanced methodologies and 
changes to certain assumptions. The changes include, among 
other things, assumptions around the projected balance sheet 
(holding it static), coupled with revisions to the treatment of 
certain business contributions to IRE. These changes will be 
implemented and disclosed before the end of 2022 and will 
result in a better reflection of the nature of the portfolios.

The following table sets forth the estimated impact to 
Citi’s net interest income, AOCI and the Common Equity 
Tier 1 Capital ratio (on a fully implemented basis) under five 
different changes in interest rate scenarios for the U.S. dollar 
and Citi’s other currencies. The 100 bps downward rate 
scenarios are impacted by the low level of interest rates in 
several countries and the assumption that market interest rates, 
as well as rates paid to depositors and charged to borrowers, 
do not fall below zero (i.e., the “flooring assumption”). The 
rate scenarios are also impacted by convexity related to 
mortgage products.

interpolated. 
(1)

Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments.

As shown in the table above, the magnitude of the impact 

This impact is also before any mitigating actions Citi may 

to Citi’s net interest income and AOCI is greater under 
Scenario 2 as compared to Scenario 3. This is because the 
combination of changes to Citi’s investment portfolio, 
partially offset by changes related to Citi’s pension liabilities, 
results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at 
shorter- and intermediate-term maturities.

Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates—Impacts on AOCI 
and Capital
As of March 31, 2022, Citi estimates that an unanticipated 
parallel instantaneous 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar 
against all of the other currencies in which Citi has invested 
capital could reduce Citi’s tangible common equity (TCE) by 
approximately $1.4 billion, or 0.9%, as a result of changes to 
Citi’s foreign currency translation adjustment in AOCI, net of 
hedges. This impact would be primarily due to changes in the 
value of the Mexican peso, Euro and Indian rupee.

In millions of dollars, except as otherwise noted

take, including ongoing management of its foreign currency 
translation exposure. Specifically, as currency movements 
change the value of Citi’s net investments in foreign currency-
denominated capital, these movements also change the value 
of Citi’s risk-weighted assets denominated in those currencies. 
This, coupled with Citi’s foreign currency hedging strategies, 
such as foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency 
forwards and other currency hedging instruments, lessens the 
impact of foreign currency movements on Citi’s Common 
Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio. Changes in these hedging 
strategies, as well as hedging costs, divestitures and tax 
impacts, can further affect the actual impact of changes in 
foreign exchange rates on Citi’s capital as compared to an 
unanticipated parallel shock, as described above.

The effect of Citi’s ongoing management strategies with 

respect to changes in foreign exchange rates, and the impact of 
these changes on Citi’s TCE and Common Equity Tier 1 
Capital ratio, are shown in the table below. See Note 17 for 
additional information on the changes in AOCI.

Interest revenue and Net interest income include the taxable equivalent adjustments primarily related to the tax-exempt bond portfolio and certain tax-advantaged 
loan programs (based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%) of $42 million, $42 million and $53 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, 
December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2021, respectively. 
Interest expense associated with certain hybrid financial instruments, which are classified as Long-term debt and accounted for at fair value, is reported together 
with any changes in fair value as part of Principal transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income and is therefore not reflected in Interest expense in the 
table above.

(3) The average rate on interest revenue and net interest margin reflects the taxable equivalent gross-up adjustment. See footnote 1 above.
(4) Citi’s net interest margin (NIM) is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets.

Interest revenue and Net interest income include the taxable equivalent adjustments discussed in the table above.

Citi’s NII in the first quarter of 2022 increased 3% to 
$10.9 billion versus the prior-year period. As set forth in the 
table above, Citi’s NII on a taxable equivalent basis also 
increased 3% year-over-year, or $354 million, driven by 
higher NII in non-ICG Markets, partially offset by lower NII 
in ICG Markets (Fixed income and Equity markets). The 
increase in non-ICG Markets NII primarily reflected higher 
interest income from cards, higher deposit volumes and 
spreads as well as income from Citi’s investment portfolio. 
The decrease in ICG Markets NII largely reflected a change in 
the mix of trading positions in support of client activity.

Citi’s NIM was 2.05% on a taxable equivalent basis in the 

first quarter of 2022, an increase of 7 basis points from the 
prior quarter, as higher interest income from loans and lower 
average deposits in Services were partially offset by balance 
sheet growth and the lower NII in ICG Markets.

Market Risk of Trading Portfolios

Value at Risk (VAR)
Citi believes its VAR model is conservatively calibrated to incorporate fat-tail scaling and the greater of short-term (approximately the 
most recent month) and long-term (three years) market volatility. As of March 31, 2022, Citi estimates that the conservative features 
of the VAR calibration contribute an approximate 41% add-on to what would be a VAR estimated under the assumption of stable and 
perfectly, normally distributed markets. As of December 31, 2021, the add-on was 33%.

As set forth in the table below, Citi’s average trading VAR for the first quarter of 2022 increased quarter-over-quarter, mainly due 
to higher volatilities in ICG Markets businesses. Citi’s average trading and credit portfolio VAR for the first quarter of 2022 increased 
quarter-over-quarter due to additional hedging and higher volatilities.

(1)  Covariance adjustment (also known as diversification benefit) equals the difference between the total VAR and the sum of the VARs tied to each risk type. The 
benefit reflects the fact that the risks within individual and across risk types are not perfectly correlated and, consequently, the total VAR on a given day will be 
lower than the sum of the VARs relating to each risk type. The determination of the primary drivers of changes to the covariance adjustment is made by an 
examination of the impact of both model parameter and position changes.

(2)  The total trading VAR includes mark-to-market and certain fair value option trading positions in ICG, with the exception of hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value 

option loans and all CVA exposures. Available-for-sale and accrual exposures are not included.

(3)  The specific risk-only component represents the level of equity and fixed income issuer-specific risk embedded in VAR.

 OTHER RISKS
For additional information regarding other risks, including 
Citi’s management of other risks, see “Managing Global Risk
—Other Risks” in Citi’s 2021 Form 10-K.

LIBOR Transition Risk 
In March 2022, U.S. federal legislation was signed into law 
that provides for the use of a statutory replacement for the 
overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and 12-month 
tenors of USD LIBOR in all contracts governed by U.S. law. 
The Federal Reserve Board is required to select a Secured 
Overnight Funding Rate (SOFR)-based replacement for USD 
LIBOR and issue rules to implement the legislation no later 
than 180 days after its enactment. Citi continues to review the 
effect of this legislation, which is expected to facilitate the 
transition to replacement rates for Citi’s USD LIBOR-linked 
securities, loans and contracts without fallbacks or fallbacks 
based on USD LIBOR that have not yet been remediated.

For additional information about Citi’s actions to address 

a transition away from and discontinuance of LIBOR, see 
“Managing Global Risk—Other Risks—LIBOR Transition 
Risk” in Citi’s 2021 Form 10-K. For information about Citi’s 
LIBOR transition risks, see “Risk Factors—Other Risks” in 
the 2021 Form 10-K.

Regulatory VAR Back-testing
In accordance with Basel III, Citi is required to perform back-
testing to evaluate the effectiveness of its Regulatory VAR 
model. Regulatory VAR back-testing is the process in which 
the daily one-day VAR, at a 99% confidence interval, is 
compared to the buy-and-hold profit and loss (i.e., the profit 
and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of 
the day and re-priced the following day). Buy-and-hold profit 
and loss represents the daily mark-to-market profit and loss 
attributable to price movements in covered positions from the 
close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and 
loss excludes realized trading revenue, net interest, fees and 
commissions, intra-day trading profit and loss and changes in 
reserves.

Based on a 99% confidence level, Citi would expect two 

to three days in any one year where buy-and-hold losses 
exceed the Regulatory VAR. Given the conservative 
calibration of Citi’s VAR model (as a result of taking the 
greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-tail scaling 
of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer exceptions under 
normal and stable market conditions. Periods of unstable 
market conditions could increase the number of back-testing 
exceptions.

As of March 31, 2022, there was one back-testing 

exception observed for Citi’s Regulatory VAR for the prior 12 
months.
