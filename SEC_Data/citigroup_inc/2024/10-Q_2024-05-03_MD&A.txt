MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

First Quarter of 2024 Results Summary

First Quarter of 2024—Results Demonstrated Improved 
Business Performance and Progress Toward Citi’s 
Priorities
As described further throughout this Executive Summary, 
during the first quarter of 2024:

•

•

•

•

•

•

Citi’s revenues decreased 2% versus the prior-year period 
on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts 
of approximately $1 billion, primarily consisting of a gain 
from the sale of the India consumer business in the prior-
year period, revenues increased 3%, driven by growth 
across Banking, U.S. Personal Banking (USPB) and 
Services, partially offset by declines in Markets and 
Wealth. 
Citi’s expenses increased 7% versus the prior-year period. 
The increase included repositioning costs of $258 million, 
an incremental FDIC special assessment of $251 million 
and net restructuring charges of $225 million. Excluding 
divestiture-related impacts in both the current quarter and 
the prior-year period and the incremental FDIC special 
assessment, expenses increased 5%, largely driven by 
inflation and volume-related expenses, partially offset by 
productivity savings (see “Expenses” below).
Citi’s cost of credit was approximately $2.4 billion versus 
$2.0 billion in the prior-year period. The increase was 
primarily driven by higher cards net credit losses in 
Branded Cards and Retail Services in USPB, largely 
reflecting the continued maturation of cards loan vintages 
originated during the pandemic, as well as the impact of 
the higher inflationary and interest rate environment, 
partially offset by a lower build in the allowance for credit 
losses (ACL) in the current quarter (see “Cost of Credit” 
below).
Citi returned $1.5 billion to common shareholders in the 
form of dividends ($1.0 billion) and share repurchases 
($0.5 billion).
Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio under 
the Basel III Standardized Approach was 13.5% as of 
March 31, 2024 (compared to 13.4% as of March 31, 
2023) (see “Capital Resources” below). This compares to 
Citi’s required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio of 12.3% as 
of March 31, 2024 and 12.0% as of March 31, 2023 under 
the Basel III Standardized Approach.
Citi continued to make progress with the wind-downs of 
the Korea and China consumer banking businesses and 
the Russia consumer, local commercial and institutional 
businesses, as well as the separation involving Citi’s 
consumer banking and small business and middle-market 
banking operations in Mexico in preparation for a planned 
initial public offering in 2025.

Citigroup
Citigroup reported net income of $3.4 billion, or $1.58 per 
share, compared to net income of $4.6 billion, or $2.19 per 
share in the prior-year period. Net income decreased 27% 
versus the prior-year period, driven by the higher expenses, 
the higher cost of credit and the lower revenues. Citigroup’s 
effective tax rate was approximately 25% in both the current 
and prior-year periods. Average diluted shares outstanding 
decreased 1%. 

Citigroup revenues of $21.1 billion in the first quarter of 
2024 decreased 2% versus the prior-year period on a reported 
basis. Excluding the divestiture-related impacts in both 
quarters, primarily consisting of the gain from the sale of the 
India consumer business in the prior-year period, revenues of 
$21.1 billion increased 3%, driven by growth across Banking, 
USPB and Services, partially offset by declines in Markets and 
Wealth. (For additional information on the divestiture-related 
impacts, see “All Other—Divestiture-Related Impacts 
(Reconciling Items)” below.) (As used throughout this Form 
10-Q, Citi’s results of operations and financial condition 
excluding divestiture-related impacts are non-GAAP financial 
measures.) Banking revenues reflected a recovery of the global 
investment banking wallet, Services revenues were driven by 
higher revenues in both Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS) 
and Securities Services and USPB revenues benefited from 
strong loan growth in cards. The decline in Markets revenues 
was primarily due to lower Fixed Income markets revenues, 
while Wealth revenues were largely impacted by higher 
mortgage funding costs and lower deposit spreads. 

Citigroup’s end-of-period loans were $675 billion, up 3% 

versus the prior-year period, largely reflecting the growth in 
cards and mortgages in USPB and higher loans in Markets. 
Citigroup’s end-of-period deposits were approximately 
$1.3 trillion, down 2% versus the prior-year period, largely 
due to a reduction in Services, reflecting quantitative 
tightening. For additional information about Citi’s deposits by 
business, including drivers and deposit trends, see each 
respective business’s results of operations and “Liquidity Risk
—Deposits” below.

Expenses
Citigroup’s operating expenses of $14.2 billion increased 7% 
from the prior-year period. As discussed above, results for the 
first quarter of 2024 included the following notable items 
recorded in operating expenses in Corporate/Other within All 
Other (managed basis):

•

•

$251 million charge to operating expenses related to the 
FDIC’s notification to Citi that it had increased its 
estimated loss attributable to the protection of uninsured 
depositors at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank 
(see Note 27)
$225 million of net restructuring charges related to 
actions taken as part of Citi’s organizational 
simplification initiatives (see Note 9)

4                                                                                                                                                                                                       

In the first quarter of 2024, expenses also included 
repositioning costs of $258 million and divestiture-related 
impacts of $110 million (compared to $73 million in the prior-
year period). Excluding divestiture-related impacts in both 
periods and the incremental FDIC special assessment, 
expenses increased 5% versus the prior-year period, driven by 
inflation and volume-related expenses, partially offset by 
productivity savings. (As used throughout this Form 10-Q, 
Citi’s results of operations and financial condition excluding 
divestiture-related impacts and the incremental FDIC special 
assessment are non-GAAP financial measures.)

As previously announced, Citi expects to incur additional 

repositioning costs during the remainder of 2024. 

Cost of Credit
Citi’s total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and 
claims was a cost of $2.4 billion, compared to $2.0 billion in 
the prior-year period. The increase was primarily driven by 
higher net credit losses in Branded Cards and Retail Services, 
largely reflecting continued maturation of cards loan vintages 
originated during the pandemic, with delayed losses due to 
unprecedented levels of government stimulus, as well as 
macroeconomic pressures related to the higher inflationary 
and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios, 
partially offset by a lower build in the allowance for credit 
losses (ACL). For additional information on Citi’s ACL, see 
“Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates—
Citi’s Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)” below. 

Net credit losses of $2.3 billion increased 77% from the 
prior-year period. Consumer net credit losses of $2.1 billion 
increased 67%, largely reflecting the rise in cards net credit 
loss rates. Corporate net credit losses increased to $164 
million from $22 million.

As previously announced, Citi expects full-year net credit 

loss rates for both Branded Cards and Retail Services to be 
higher in 2024. The higher net credit loss expectations are 
already reflected in the ACL on loans for outstanding balances 
at March 31, 2024.

For additional information on Citi’s consumer and 

corporate credit costs, see each respective business’s results of 
operations and “Credit Risk” below.

Capital
Citigroup’s CET1 Capital ratio increased modestly to 13.5% 
as of March 31, 2024, compared to 13.4% as of March 31, 
2023, based on the Basel III Standardized Approach for 
determining risk-weighted assets (RWA). The increase was 
primarily driven by net income, interest rate impacts on 
Citigroup’s investment portfolio, impacts from the sales of 
certain Asia consumer banking (Asia Consumer) businesses 
and a decrease in RWA, partially offset by the payment of 
common dividends and share repurchases and higher 
disallowed deferred tax assets.

In the first quarter of 2024, Citi repurchased $0.5 billion 

of common shares and paid $1.0 billion of common dividends 
(see “Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Repurchases of 
Equity Securities and Dividends” below). Citi will continue to 
assess common share repurchases on a quarterly basis given 
uncertainty regarding regulatory capital requirements. For 
additional information on capital-related risks, trends and 

uncertainties, see “Capital Resources—Regulatory Capital 
Standards and Developments” below and “Risk Factors—
Strategic Risks,” “—Operational Risks” and “—Compliance 
Risks” in Citi’s 2023 Form 10-K.

Citigroup’s Supplementary Leverage ratio as of March 

31, 2024 was 5.8%, compared to 6.0% as of March 31, 2023. 
The decrease was driven by a decrease in Tier 1 Capital and an 
increase in Total Leverage Exposure. For additional 
information on Citi’s capital ratios and related components, 
see “Capital Resources” below.

Services
Services net income of $1.5 billion increased 15% from the 
prior-year period, largely driven by higher revenues, partially 
offset by higher expenses and cost of credit. Services expenses 
of $2.7 billion increased 11%, largely driven by continued 
investments in technology, other risk and controls and product 
innovation. Cost of credit was $64 million, compared to a net 
benefit of $14 million in the prior-year period. 

Services revenues of $4.8 billion increased 8%, largely 
driven by continued momentum across TTS and Securities 
Services. Net interest income increased 6%, driven by higher 
deposit and trade loan spreads, and non-interest revenue 
increased 14%, largely driven by continued strength across 
underlying fee drivers. 

TTS revenues of $3.5 billion increased 5%, driven by a 
4% increase in net interest income, primarily driven by higher 
spreads, and a 9% increase in non-interest revenue, reflecting 
continued growth in underlying drivers, including cross-border 
volumes, U.S. dollar clearing volumes and commercial card 
spend.

Securities Services revenues of $1.3 billion increased 

18%, driven by a 16% increase in net interest income on 
higher deposit spreads, and a 21% increase in non-interest 
revenue, primarily driven by higher assets under custody and 
administration (AUC/AUA) balances from higher market 
valuations, as well as new client onboarding, and elevated 
corporate activity in Issuer Services.

For additional information on the results of operations of 

Services in the first quarter of 2024, see “Services” below.

Markets
Markets net income of $1.4 billion decreased 25% from the 
prior-year period, driven by lower revenues, higher expenses 
and higher cost of credit. Markets expenses of $3.4 billion 
increased 7%, largely driven by the absence of a legal reserve 
release in the prior-year period. Cost of credit increased to 
$200 million from $83 million in the prior-year period, 
reflecting a higher net ACL build, primarily driven by changes 
in macroeconomic variable assumptions related to loans in 
spread products, and higher net credit losses.

Markets revenues of $5.4 billion decreased 7%, driven by 
a 10% decrease in Fixed Income markets, partially offset by a 
5% increase in Equity markets. The decrease in Fixed Income 
markets was largely driven by a decline in rates and 
currencies, largely reflecting lower volatility, decreased 
institutional client activity and a strong prior-year comparison, 
partially offset by strength in spread products and other fixed 
income, up 26%, primarily reflecting an increase in client 

5                                                                                                                                                                                                       

activity. The increase in Equity markets was driven by growth 
in cash trading and higher equity derivatives revenues.

For additional information on the results of operations of 

Markets in the first quarter of 2024, see “Markets” below.

Banking
Banking net income was $536 million, compared to $55 
million in the prior-year period, driven by higher revenues and 
lower expenses, with cost of credit largely unchanged. 
Banking expenses of $1.2 billion decreased 4%, primarily 
driven by benefits from repositioning actions and other actions 
to lower the expense base, partially offset by business-led 
investments. 

Banking revenues of $1.7 billion increased 49%, driven 
by growth in Investment Banking and Corporate Lending, as 
well as lower losses on loan hedges. Excluding the losses on 
loan hedges, Banking revenues of $1.8 billion increased 35%. 
Investment Banking revenues increased 35%, driven by the 
Debt Capital Markets (DCM) and Equity Capital Markets 
(ECM) businesses, as improved market sentiment led to an 
increase in issuance activity. This increase in revenues was 
partially offset by lower Advisory revenues, reflecting the 
impact of lower merger activity announced in the second half 
of 2023. Corporate Lending revenues increased 68%, 
including the impact of losses on loan hedges. Excluding the 
losses on loan hedges, Corporate Lending revenues increased 
34%, largely driven by higher revenue share. (As used 
throughout this Form 10-Q, Citi’s results of operations and 
financial condition excluding the impact of the losses on loan 
hedges are non-GAAP financial measures.) 

For additional information on the results of operations of 

Banking in the first quarter of 2024, see “Banking” below.

U.S. Personal Banking
USPB net income of $347 million decreased 14% from the 
prior-year period, driven by higher cost of credit, partially 
offset by higher revenues. USPB expenses of $2.5 billion were 
largely unchanged, as lower compensation costs were offset 
by higher repositioning costs and volume-related expenses. 
Cost of credit increased to $2.2 billion, compared to $1.6 
billion in the prior-year period. Net credit losses increased 
74%, reflecting the continued maturation of cards loan 
vintages originated during the pandemic, with delayed losses 
due to unprecedented levels of government stimulus, as well 
as macroeconomic pressures related to the higher inflationary 
and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios.
USPB revenues of $5.2 billion increased 10%, driven by 

higher net interest income due to loan growth in cards and 
higher non-interest revenue due to lower partner payments. 
Branded Cards revenues of $2.6 billion increased 7%, 
primarily driven by the higher net interest income, reflecting 
the strong loan growth. Retail Services revenues of $1.9 
billion increased 18%, primarily driven by the lower partner 
payments due to higher net credit losses, as well as higher net 
interest income on higher loan balances. Retail Banking 
revenues of $638 million increased 1%, driven by higher 
deposit spreads, loan growth and improved mortgage margins, 
largely offset by the impact of the transfer of certain 
relationships and the associated deposit balances to Wealth.

For additional information on the results of operations of 

USPB in the first quarter of 2024, see “U.S. Personal 
Banking” below.

Wealth
Wealth net income was $150 million, compared to $159 
million in the prior-year period, as lower revenues and higher 
expenses were largely offset by lower cost of credit. Wealth 
expenses increased 3% to $1.7 billion, driven by technology 
investments focused on risk and controls, as well as platform 
enhancements, partially offset by initial benefits from 
repositioning and restructuring actions. Cost of credit was a 
benefit of $170 million, compared to a benefit of $58 million 
in the prior-year period, as net credit losses were more than 
offset by a higher net ACL release, reflecting a change in ACL 
associated with the margin lending portfolio. 

Wealth revenues of $1.7 billion decreased 4%, largely 

driven by a 13% decrease in net interest income from higher 
mortgage funding costs and lower deposit spreads, partially 
offset by an 11% increase in non-interest revenue, largely 
reflecting higher investment fee revenues.

For additional information on the results of operations of 

Wealth in the first quarter of 2024, see “Wealth” below.

All Other (Managed Basis)
All Other (managed basis) net loss of $457 million, compared 
to net income of $198 million in the prior-year period, was 
primarily driven by higher expenses, lower revenues and 
lower income tax benefits, partially offset by lower cost of 
credit. All Other (managed basis) expenses of $2.7 billion 
increased 18%, driven by the incremental FDIC special 
assessment and the restructuring charges, partially offset by 
lower expenses from the closed exits and wind-downs. Cost of 
credit of $185 million decreased 59%, largely driven by the 
absence of a net ACL build in the prior-year period, partially 
offset by higher net credit losses in Mexico Consumer. 

All Other (managed basis) revenues decreased 9% from 
the prior-year period, primarily driven by higher funding costs 
in Corporate/Other. 

Legacy Franchises (managed basis) revenues of $1.8 
billion were largely unchanged from the prior-year period, as 
higher revenues in Mexico Consumer/SBMM (managed 
basis), mainly due to higher volumes and Mexican peso 
appreciation, were offset by lower revenues in Asia Consumer 
(managed basis), reflecting the impacts of the closed exits and 
wind-downs. 

For additional information on the results of operations of 
All Other (managed basis) in the first quarter of 2024, see “All 
Other—Divestiture-Related Impacts (Reconciling Items)” and 
“All Other (Managed Basis)” below. 

Macroeconomic and Other Risks and Uncertainties
Various geopolitical, macroeconomic and regulatory 
challenges and uncertainties continue to adversely affect 
economic conditions in the U.S. and globally, including, 
among others, continued elevated interest rates and inflation, 
and economic and geopolitical challenges related to China, the 
Russia–Ukraine war and escalating conflicts in the Middle 
East. These and other factors have negatively impacted global 
economic growth rates and consumer sentiment and have 

6                                                                                                                                                                                                       

resulted in a continued risk of recession in various regions and 
countries globally. In addition, these and other factors could 
adversely affect Citi’s customers, clients, businesses, funding 
costs, cost of credit and overall results of operations and 
financial condition during the remainder of 2024. 

For a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and risks 

that will or could impact Citi’s businesses, results of 
operations, capital and other financial condition during 2024,

respective business’s results of operations, “Managing Global 
Risk,” including “Managing Global Risk—Other Risks—

Looking Statements” below and “Risk Factors” in Citi’s 2023 
Form 10-K.

SERVICES

Services includes Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS) and Securities Services. TTS provides an integrated suite of tailored cash 
management, trade and working capital solutions to multinational corporations, financial institutions and public sector organizations. 
Securities Services provides cross-border support for clients, providing on-the-ground local market expertise, post-trade technologies, 
customized data solutions and a wide range of securities services solutions that can be tailored to meet clients’ needs.

Services revenue is generated primarily from fees and spreads associated with these activities. Services earns fee income for 
assisting clients with transactional services and clearing. Revenue generated from these activities is recorded in Commissions and fees. 
Revenue is also generated from assets under custody and administration and is recognized when the associated service is satisfied, 
which normally occurs at the point in time the service is requested by the client and provided by Citi. Revenue generated from these 
activities is primarily recorded in Administration and other fiduciary fees. For additional information on these various types of 
revenues, see Note 5. Services revenues also include revenues earned by Citi that are subject to a revenue sharing arrangement with 
Banking—Corporate Lending for Investment Banking, Markets and Services products sold to Corporate Lending clients.

At March 31, 2024, Services had $577 billion in assets and $787 billion in deposits. Securities Services managed $24.0 trillion in 

assets under custody and administration, of which Citi provided both custody and administrative services to certain clients related to 
$1.9 trillion of such assets.

1Q24 vs. 1Q23
Net income of $1.5 billion increased 15%, primarily driven by 
higher revenue, partially offset by higher expenses and cost of 
credit.

Revenues increased 8%, driven by higher revenues in both 

TTS and Securities Services, largely driven by both net 
interest income and non-interest revenue growth.

TTS revenues increased 5%, reflecting 4% growth in net 
interest income and 9% increase in non-interest revenue. The 
increase in net interest income was primarily driven by higher 
spreads, partially offset by lower deposits. The growth in non-
interest revenue was largely driven by continued strength 
across underlying fee drivers, including higher cross-border 
flows (up 9%), U.S. dollar clearing volumes (up 3%) and 
commercial card spend (up 5%). Average deposits were down 
3%, as the impact of quantitative tightening more than offset 
new client acquisitions and deepening with existing clients. 

Securities Services revenues increased 18%, due to 16% 

growth in net interest income, driven by higher deposit 
spreads, and 21% growth in non-interest revenue. The increase 
in non-interest revenue was driven by fee growth, primarily 
due to higher AUC/AUA balances from higher market 
valuations, as well as new client onboarding along with 
continued elevated levels of corporate activity in Issuer 
Services.

Expenses were up 11%, primarily driven by investments 
in technology, other risk and controls and product innovation. 
Provisions were $64 million, compared to $(14) million in 

the prior-year period, primarily driven by an ACL build for 
loans, compared to a release in the prior-year period.

The net ACL build was primarily due to changes in loan 
portfolio mix. For additional information on Citi’s ACL, see 
“Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” 
below.

MARKETS

Markets provides corporate, institutional and public sector clients around the world with a full range of sales and trading services 
across equities, foreign exchange, rates, spread products and commodities. The range of services includes market-making across asset 
classes, risk management solutions, financing, prime brokerage, research, securities clearing and settlement.

As a market maker, Markets facilitates transactions, including holding product inventory to meet client demand, and earns the 
differential between the price at which it buys and sells the products. These price differentials and the unrealized gains and losses on 
the inventory are recorded in Principal transactions. Other primarily includes realized gains and losses on available-for-sale (AFS) 
debt securities, gains and losses on equity securities not held in trading accounts and other non-recurring gains and losses. Interest 
income earned on assets held, less interest paid on long- and short-term debt, secured funding transactions and customer deposits, is 
recorded as Net interest income.

The amount and types of Markets revenues are impacted by a variety of interrelated factors, including market liquidity; changes in 

market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit spreads, as well as their 
implied volatilities; investor confidence; and other macroeconomic conditions. Markets revenues include revenues earned by Citi that 
are subject to a revenue sharing arrangement with Banking—Corporate Lending for Investment Banking, Markets and Services 
products sold to Corporate Lending clients. 

Assuming all other market conditions do not change, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads generally result in 
increases in revenues. However, changes in market conditions can significantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads and the 
fair value of product inventory. Management of the Markets businesses involves daily monitoring and evaluation of the above factors.
Markets international presence is supported by trading floors in approximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in 95 

countries and jurisdictions.

a decline in rates and currencies revenues, partially offset by 
higher revenues in spread products and other fixed income. 
Rates and currencies revenues decreased 21%, largely 
reflecting lower volatility, decreased institutional client 
activity and a strong prior-year performance. Spread products 
and other fixed income revenues increased 26%, driven by 
spread products, primarily due to increased client activity, 
particularly in asset-backed lending. The increase was partially 
offset by a decline in commodities revenues.

Equity markets revenues increased 5%, driven by growth 

in cash equity trading, due to higher volumes and increased 
trading activity, and higher equity derivatives revenues, due to 
increased corporate client activity. Equity markets also 
continued to experience an increase in prime balances. 

Expenses increased 7%, primarily driven by the absence 

of a legal reserve release in the prior-year period. 

Provisions were $200 million, compared to $83 million in 

the prior-year period, driven by a net ACL build of $122 
million, compared to $79 million in the prior-year period, and 
net credit losses of $78 million, compared to $4 million in the 
prior-year period. The net ACL build was primarily driven by 
changes in macroeconomic variable assumptions related to 
loans in spread products. For additional information on Citi’s 
ACL, see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant 
Estimates” below.

Investment banking fees are primarily composed of underwriting, advisory, loan syndication structuring and other related financing activity.
Includes revenues earned by Citi that are subject to a revenue sharing arrangement with Investment Banking, Markets and Services products sold to Corporate 
Lending clients.

(3)  Credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion of the corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans and loans at fair value. Gain (loss) on 

loan hedges includes the mark-to-market on the credit derivatives, partially offset by the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. Hedges 
on accrual loans reflect the mark-to-market on credit derivatives used to economically hedge the corporate loan accrual portfolio. The fixed premium costs of 
these hedges are netted against the corporate lending revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection. Citigroup’s results of operations excluding the impact of gain 
(loss) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures. 

(4)  Management uses this information in reviewing the segment’s results and believes it is useful to investors concerning underlying segment performance and trends.
(5)  Excludes loans that are carried at fair value for all periods.

The discussion of the results of operations for Banking below excludes (where noted) the impact of any gain (loss) on hedges of

1Q24 vs. 1Q23 
Net income was $536 million, compared to net income of $55 
million in the prior-year period, driven by higher revenues and 
lower expenses. 

Revenues increased 49% (including losses on loan 

hedges), primarily reflecting higher Investment Banking 
revenues, driven by recovery of the global investment banking 
wallet, higher revenues in Corporate Lending and lower losses 
on loan hedges ($104 million loss versus $199 million loss in 
the prior-year period). Excluding the impact of losses on loan 
hedges, Banking revenues increased 35%.

Investment Banking revenues increased 35%, driven by 
the DCM and ECM businesses, as improved market sentiment 
led to an increase in issuance activity. DCM underwriting fees 
increased 62%, driven by elevated debt issuance activity, 
particularly investment grade. ECM underwriting fees 
increased 57%, primarily driven by an increase in convertibles 
issuance. The increase in DCM and ECM underwriting fees 
was partially offset by lower Advisory fees (down 17%), 
driven by the impact of low merger activity announced in the 
second half of 2023.

Corporate Lending revenues increased 68%, including the 

impact of losses on loan hedges. Excluding the impact of 
losses on loan hedges, Corporate Lending revenues increased 
34%, largely driven by higher revenue share.

Expenses decreased 4%, primarily driven by benefits from 

repositioning actions and other actions to lower the expense 
base, partially offset by business-led investments. 

Provisions reflected a benefit of $129 million, compared 

to a benefit of $123 million in the prior-year period. Net credit 
losses increased to $66 million, compared to $12 million in the 
prior-year period. The net ACL release was $195 million, 
compared to a net release of $135 million in the prior-year

1Q24 vs. 1Q23 
Net income was $347 million, compared to $402 million in the 
prior-year period, reflecting higher cost of credit, partially 
offset by higher revenues.

Revenues increased 10%, due to higher net interest 
income (up 8%), largely driven by strong loan growth in 
cards, as well as higher non-interest revenue (up 66%). The 
increase in non-interest revenue was largely driven by lower 
partner payments in Retail Services, due to higher net credit 
losses.

Cards revenues increased 11%. Branded Cards revenues 

increased 7%, primarily driven by the higher net interest 
income, reflecting the strong loan growth. Branded Cards 
average loans increased 11%, reflecting the higher card spend 
volumes and lower card payment rates. Branded Cards card 
spend volumes increased 4%, driven by more affluent 
customers. 

Retail Services revenues increased 18%, primarily driven 

by higher non-interest revenue due to the lower partner 
payments, driven by higher net credit losses (see “Provisions” 
below and Note 5), as well as higher net interest income on 
higher loan balances. Retail Services average loans increased 
6%, largely reflecting lower card payment rates, and credit 
card spend volumes decreased 4%, primarily due to lower in-
store foot traffic.

Retail Banking revenues increased 1%, primarily driven 

by the higher deposit spreads, loan growth and improved 
mortgage margins, largely offset by the impact of the transfer 
of certain relationships and the associated deposit balances to 
Wealth. Average mortgage loans increased 18%, primarily 
driven by lower refinancings due to high interest rates and 
mortgage originations exceeding prepayments. Average 
deposits decreased 10%, largely reflecting the transfer of 
certain relationships and the associated deposit balances to 
Wealth ($16 billion over the last 12 months). 

Expenses were largely unchanged, as lower compensation 

costs were offset by higher repositioning costs and volume-
related expenses.

Provisions were $2.2 billion, compared to $1.6 billion in 

the prior-year period, largely driven by higher net credit 
losses, partially offset by a lower ACL build for loans. Net 
credit losses increased 74%, primarily reflecting the continued 
maturation of cards loan vintages originated during the 
pandemic, with delayed losses due to unprecedented levels of 
government stimulus, as well as macroeconomic pressures 
related to the higher inflationary and interest rate environment 
impacting both cards portfolios. Branded Cards net credit 
losses were up 87% to $1 billion and Retail Services net credit 
losses were up 65% to $0.8 billion.

The net ACL build was $0.3 billion, compared to $0.6 

billion in the prior-year period. The net ACL build in the 
current quarter primarily reflected the impact of 
macroeconomic pressures related to the higher inflationary 
and interest rate environment and the seasonal mix shift from 
transactors to revolvers, partially offset by lower end-of-period 
cards balances. For additional information on Citi’s ACL, see 
“Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” 
below.

1Q24 vs. 1Q23 
Net income of $150 million compared to $159 million in the 
prior-year period, as lower revenues and higher expenses were 
largely offset by lower cost of credit.

Revenues decreased 4%, largely driven by lower net 
interest income (down 13%), due to lower deposit spreads and 
higher mortgage funding costs. The decrease in revenues was 
partially offset by an increase in non-interest revenue (up 
11%), largely driven by higher investment fee revenues. 

Client balances increased 6%, primarily driven by higher 

client investment assets (up 12%) across regions, reflecting the 
benefit of higher market valuations and net new investment 
asset flows.

Average loans were largely unchanged, as the business 

continued to optimize regulatory capital usage. Average 
deposits decreased 1%, primarily reflecting lower deposits in 
Private Bank and Wealth at Work and the continued transfers 
to higher-yielding investments on Citi’s platform. This 
decrease in deposits was largely offset by the transfer of 
certain relationships and the associated deposit balances from 
USPB ($16 billion over the last 12 months). 

Private Bank revenues increased 1%, primarily driven by 
improved deposit spreads and investment fee revenues, largely 
offset by higher mortgage funding costs. 

Wealth at Work revenues decreased 6%, driven by the 
lower deposit spreads and the higher mortgage funding costs, 
partially offset by the higher investment fee revenues. 

Citigold revenues decreased 6%, driven by the lower 
deposit spreads, partially offset by the higher investment fee 
revenues and higher deposit volumes. 

Expenses increased 3%, primarily driven by technology 

investments focused on risk and controls and platform 
enhancements, partially offset by initial benefits from 
repositioning and restructuring actions. 

Provisions were a benefit of $170 million, compared to a 
benefit of $58 million in the prior-year period, largely driven 
by a higher net ACL release.

The higher net ACL release was primarily driven by a 
change in ACL associated with the margin lending portfolio.

All Other (managed basis) results exclude divestiture-related impacts (see the “Reconciling Items” column in the table below) 
related to (i) Citi’s divestitures of its Asia consumer banking businesses and (ii) the planned IPO of Mexico consumer banking and 
small business and middle-market banking, within Legacy Franchises. Legacy Franchises (managed basis) results also exclude these 
divestiture-related impacts. Certain of the results of operations of All Other (managed basis) and Legacy Franchises (managed basis) 
are non-GAAP financial measures (see “Overview—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” above).

The table below presents a reconciliation from All Other (U.S. GAAP) to All Other (managed basis). All Other (U.S. GAAP), less

ALL OTHER—Managed Basis

At March 31, 2024, All Other (managed basis) had $200 billion in assets, primarily related to Mexico Consumer/SBMM and Asia 
Consumer reported within Legacy Franchises (managed basis), as well as Corporate Treasury investment securities and the 
Company’s deferred tax assets (DTAs) reported within Corporate/Other.

Legacy Franchises (Managed Basis)
Legacy Franchises (managed basis) includes (i) Mexico Consumer Banking (Mexico Consumer) and Mexico Small Business and 
Middle-Market Banking (Mexico SBMM), collectively Mexico Consumer/SBMM, (ii) Asia Consumer Banking (Asia Consumer), 
representing the consumer banking operations of the remaining four exit countries (Korea, Poland, China and Russia), and (iii) Legacy 
Holdings Assets, primarily legacy consumer mortgage loans in North America that the Company continues to wind down. 

Mexico Consumer/SBMM operates in Mexico through Citibanamex and provides traditional retail banking and branded card 
products to consumers and small business customers and traditional middle-market banking products and services to commercial 
customers. As previously disclosed, Citi intends to pursue an IPO of its consumer, small business and middle-market banking 
operations in Mexico. Citi will retain its Services, Markets, Banking and Wealth businesses in Mexico. Citi currently expects that the 
separation of the businesses will be completed in the second half of 2024 and that the IPO will take place in 2025.

Legacy Franchises (managed basis) also included the following four Asia Consumer businesses prior to their sales: India and 
Vietnam, until their closings in March 2023; Taiwan, until its closing in August 2023; and Indonesia until its closing in November 
2023. 

Citi has continued to make progress on its wind-downs in China, Korea and Russia, including in October 2023, when Citi 
announced the signing of an agreement to sell its onshore consumer wealth business in China. In addition, Citi has restarted the sales 
process of its consumer banking business in Poland. See Note 2 for additional information on Legacy Franchises’ consumer banking 
business sales and wind-downs. For additional information about Citi’s continued efforts to reduce its operations and exposures in 
Russia, see “Managing Global Risk—Other Risks—Country Risk—Russia” below and “Risk Factors” in Citi’s 2023 Form 10-K.
At March 31, 2024, on a combined basis, Legacy Franchises (managed basis) had 1,343 retail branches, $20 billion in retail 
banking loans and $50 billion in deposits. In addition, Legacy Franchises (managed basis) had $9 billion in outstanding card loan 
balances, while Mexico SBMM had $6 billion in outstanding corporate loan balances. 

Corporate/Other
Corporate/Other includes certain unallocated costs of global staff functions (including finance, risk, human resources, legal and 
compliance-related costs), other corporate expenses and unallocated global operations and technology expenses and income taxes, as 
well as results of Corporate Treasury investment activities and discontinued operations.

1Q24 vs. 1Q23 
Net loss was $457 million, compared to net income of $198 
million in the prior-year period, driven by higher expenses, 
lower revenues and lower income tax benefits, partially offset 
by lower cost of credit. 

All Other (managed basis) revenues decreased 9%, driven 

by lower revenues in Corporate/Other.

Legacy Franchises (managed basis) revenues were largely 

unchanged, as higher revenues in Mexico Consumer/SBMM 
(managed basis) were offset by lower revenues in Asia 
Consumer (managed basis). 

Mexico Consumer/SBMM (managed basis) revenues 

increased 21%, as cards revenues in Mexico Consumer 
increased 27%, SBMM revenues increased 28% and retail 
banking revenues increased 18%, mainly due to higher deposit 
and loan volumes and Mexican peso appreciation.

Asia Consumer (managed basis) revenues decreased 50%, 

primarily driven by the closed exits and wind-downs. 

Corporate/Other revenues decreased to $571 million, 
compared to $812 million in the prior-year period, driven by 
higher cost of funds.

Expenses increased 18%, primarily driven by the 
incremental FDIC special assessment and the restructuring 
charges (see Note 9), partially offset by lower expenses from 
closed exits and wind-downs. 

Provisions were $185 million, compared to $446 million 
in the prior-year period, largely driven by the absence of a net 
ACL build in the prior-year period, partially offset by higher 
net credit losses. Net credit losses increased 26%, primarily 
driven by higher lending volumes in Mexico Consumer.

“Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” 
below.

For additional information about trends, uncertainties and 
risks related to All Other’s (managed basis) future results, see
