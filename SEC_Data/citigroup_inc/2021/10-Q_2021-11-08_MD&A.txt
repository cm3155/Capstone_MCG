MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Third Quarter of 2021&#8212;Results Demonstrated Continued Progress Across the Franchise 

As described further throughout this Executive Summary, during or since the third quarter of 2021: 

&#8226; Citi&#8217;s earnings increased significantly versus the prior-year period, largely reflecting an allowance for credit loss (ACL) release of $1.2 billion as a result of a continued improvement in portfolio credit quality, partially offset by higher expenses. 

&#8226; Citi&#8217;s revenues declined 1% versus the prior-year period. Excluding a pretax loss of approximately $680 million ($580 million after-tax) related to the sale of Citi&#8217;s Australia consumer banking business in Asia Global Consumer Banking ( GCB ) (see &#8220;Citigroup&#8221; below), revenues increased 3%, as strength in investment banking, equity markets and securities services in Institutional Clients Group ( ICG ) was partially offset by normalization in market activity in fixed income markets within ICG as well as lower card loans and deposit spreads across GCB. 

&#8226; Citi continued to invest in its transformation, including infrastructure supporting its risk and control environment, and make business-led investments. 

&#8226; Citi had deposit growth across ICG and GCB , reflecting continued engagement across both corporate clients and consumers. 

&#8226; Citi returned approximately $4 billion of capital to its common shareholders in the form of $1 billion in dividends and $3 billion in common share repurchases, totaling approximately 43 million common shares, while maintaining robust regulatory capital ratios. Year-to-date, Citi returned nearly $11 billion of capital to its common shareholders. 

&#8226; Citi submitted its plans to address the consent orders issued to Citigroup and Citibank by the Federal Reserve Board and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, respectively (for additional information, see &#8220;Citi&#8217;s Consent Order Compliance&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K). 

&#8226; On November 8, 2021, Citi filed an amended Current Report on Form 8-K/A with the SEC disclosing that, in connection with the previously disclosed wind-down plan of its Korea consumer banking business, Citi expects to incur total estimated cash charges ranging from approximately $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion, related to voluntary termination benefits and related costs. Citi does not expect to recognize these charges all at once, but over time through the remainder of 2021 and 2022, as voluntary retirements are phased and irrevocably accepted in order to minimize business and operational impacts. 

For a discussion of trends, uncertainties and risks that will or could impact Citi&#8217;s businesses, results of operations and financial condition during the remainder of 2021, see each respective business&#8217;s results of operations and &#8220;Forward- 

Looking Statements&#8221; below, and &#8220;COVID-19 Pandemic Overview,&#8221; &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;Managing Global Risk&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Third Quarter of 2021 Results Summary 

Citigroup 

Citigroup reported net income of $4.6 billion, or $2.15 per share, compared to net income of $3.1 billion, or $1.36 per share, in the prior-year period. The increase in net income was driven by lower cost of credit, partially offset by higher expenses and lower revenues. Citigroup&#8217;s effective tax rate was 20% in the current quarter, largely unchanged from the third quarter of 2020. Earnings per share increased 58%, reflecting the increase in net income, as well as a slight decline in average diluted shares outstanding. 

Citigroup revenues of $17.2 billion in the third quarter of 2021 decreased 1% from the prior-year period. Excluding the Australia loss on sale, Citigroup revenues increased 3%, as higher revenues in ICG , along with growth in Corporate/Other , were partially offset by lower revenues in GCB . 

As previously disclosed, the Australia loss on sale primarily reflects the impact of a currency translation adjustment (CTA) loss (net of hedges) already reflected in the Accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) component of equity. Upon closing, the CTA-related balance would be removed from the AOCI component of equity, resulting in a neutral impact from CTA to Citi&#8217;s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. Ultimately, the sale is expected to result in an improvement in Citi&#8217;s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio due to the reduction in associated risk-weighted assets. (As used throughout this Form 10-Q, Citi&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition excluding the impact of the Australia loss on sale are non-GAAP financial measures. Citi believes the presentation of its results of operations and financial condition excluding the impact of the Australia sale provides a meaningful depiction of the underlying fundamentals of its broader results and Asia GCB business&#8217;s results for investors, industry analysts and others.) 

Citigroup&#8217;s end-of-period loans were $665 billion, largely unchanged from the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes (FX translation), Citigroup&#8217;s end-of-period loans decreased 1%. On this basis and excluding the impact of held-for-sale accounting as a result of the Australia sale (totaling approximately $9 billion of loans), loans increased 1%, driven by active client engagement in treasury and trade solutions, the private bank and markets, partially offset by lower loans in GCB and Corporate/Other . Citigroup&#8217;s end-of-period deposits increased 7% to $1.3 trillion. Excluding the impact of FX translation, Citigroup&#8217;s end-of-period deposits increased 6%, primarily driven by growth across both ICG and GCB . (As used throughout this Form 10-Q, Citi&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition excluding the impact of FX translation are non-GAAP financial measures.) 

Expenses 

Citigroup operating expenses of $11.5 billion increased 5% from the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of FX translation, expenses increased 4%, reflecting continued investments in Citi&#8217;s transformation, as well as business-led investments and revenue-related expenses, partially offset by efficiency savings. 

Cost of Credit 

Citi&#8217;s total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims was a benefit of $0.2 billion, compared to a cost of $2.4 billion in the prior-year period, primarily driven by a net ACL reserve release of $1.2 billion (versus a build of $436 million in the prior-year period) as well as lower net credit losses. Citi&#8217;s net ACL release primarily reflected a continued improvement in portfolio credit quality. For additional information on Citi&#8217;s ACL, see &#8220;Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates&#8212;Citi&#8217;s Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)&#8221; below. 

Net credit losses of $1.0 billion decreased 50% from the prior-year period. Consumer net credit losses of $0.9 billion decreased 42%, primarily reflecting lower loan volumes and improved delinquencies in the North America cards portfolios. Corporate net credit losses decreased 88% to $39 million from $325 million in the prior-year period, driven by improvements in portfolio credit quality. 

For additional information on Citi&#8217;s consumer and corporate credit costs, see each respective business&#8217;s results of operations and &#8220;Credit Risk&#8221; below. 

Capital 

Citigroup&#8217;s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio was 11.7% as of September 30, 2021, based on the Basel III Standardized Approach for determining risk-weighted assets, unchanged from the prior-year period, based on the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework for determining risk-weighted assets. 

Citigroup&#8217;s Supplementary Leverage ratio as of September 30, 2021 was 5.8%, compared to 6.8% as of September 30, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by the expiration of temporary relief granted by the Federal Reserve Board. For additional information on Citi&#8217;s capital ratios, see &#8220;Capital Resources&#8221; below. 

Global Consumer Banking 

GCB net income of $1.3 billion compared to net income of $920 million in the prior-year period, reflecting lower cost of credit, partially offset by lower revenues and higher expenses. GCB operating expenses of $4.6 billion increased 7% from the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of FX translation, expenses increased 5%, reflecting continued investments in Citi&#8217;s transformation, as well as business-led investments and volume-related expenses, partially offset by efficiency savings. 

GCB revenues of $6.3 billion decreased 13%. Excluding the impact of FX translation and the Australia loss on sale, revenues decreased 5%, as continued solid deposit growth and momentum in investment management were more than offset by lower card loans and lower deposit spreads. 

North America GCB revenues of $4.3 billion decreased 4%, with lower revenues across Citi-branded cards, Citi retail services and retail banking. Citi-branded cards revenues of $2.0 billion decreased 1%, reflecting continued higher payment rates. Citi retail services revenues of $1.3 billion decreased 6%, reflecting lower average loans and continued higher payment rates. Retail banking revenues of $1.0 billion decreased 7%, as the benefit of stronger deposit growth was more than offset by lower deposit spreads, as well as lower mortgage revenues. 

Year-over-year, North America GCB average deposits of $208 billion increased 14%, assets under management of $85 billion increased 16% and average retail banking loans of $50 billion decreased 7%. Average Citi-branded card loans of $82 billion increased 1%, while average Citi retail services loans of $42 billion decreased 5%. Citi-branded card purchase sales of $106 billion increased 24% and Citi retail services purchase sales of $23 billion increased 14%, reflecting a continued recovery in sales activity from the pandemic-related low levels in the prior-year period. For additional information on the results of operations of North America GCB for the third quarter of 2021, see &#8220; Global Consumer Banking &#8212; North America GCB &#8221; below. 

International GCB revenues (consisting of Latin America GCB and Asia GCB (which includes the results of operations in certain EMEA countries)) of $1.9 billion decreased 27% versus the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of FX translation and the Australia loss on sale, international GCB revenues declined 5%. Excluding the impact of FX translation, Latin America GCB revenues declined 7%, driven by lower lending volumes and deposit spreads, partially offset by growth in assets under management. Excluding the impact of FX translation and the Australia loss on sale, Asia GCB revenues decreased 4%, reflecting lower loans and lower deposit spreads, partially offset by higher investment revenues. For additional information on the results of operations of Latin America GCB and Asia GCB for the third quarter of 2021, including the impact of FX translation, see &#8220; Global Consumer Banking &#8212; Latin America GCB &#8221; and &#8220; Global Consumer Banking &#8212; Asia GCB &#8221; below. For additional information on Citi&#8217;s consumer banking business in Australia, including the impact of the reclassification of 

deposits and loans to held-for-sale, see &#8220; Global Consumer Banking &#8212; Asia GCB &#8221; below and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Year-over-year, excluding the impact of FX translation, international GCB average deposits of $145 billion increased 3%, average retail banking loans of $71 billion decreased 5% (primarily reflecting the impact of held-for-sale accounting as a result of the Australia sale) and assets under management of $144 billion increased 10%. On this basis, international GCB average card loans of $19 billion decreased 15%, primarily reflecting the impact of held-for-sale accounting as a result of the Australia sale, as well as higher payment rates, while card purchase sales of $24 billion increased 8%, reflecting a continued recovery in purchase sales activity from the pandemic-related low levels in the prior-year period. 

Institutional Clients Group 

ICG net income of $3.4 billion increased 21%, as lower cost of credit and higher revenues more than offset higher expenses. ICG operating expenses increased 9% to $6.4 billion, reflecting continued investments in Citi&#8217;s transformation, business-led investments and higher revenue-related expenses, partially offset by efficiency savings. 

ICG revenues of $10.8 billion increased 4%, primarily reflecting a 12% increase in Banking revenues, partially offset by a 4% decrease in Markets and securities services revenues. The increase in Banking revenues included the impact of $47 million of losses on loan hedges related to corporate lending and the private bank, compared to losses of $124 million related to corporate lending and the private bank in the prior-year period. 

Excluding the impact of losses on loan hedges, Banking revenues of $5.8 billion increased 11%, as higher revenues in investment banking, corporate lending and the private bank were partially offset by lower revenues in treasury and trade solutions. Investment banking revenues of $1.9 billion increased 39%, reflecting strong growth across products. Advisory revenues increased significantly to $539 million, equity underwriting revenues increased 5% to $507 million and debt underwriting revenues increased 19% to $877 million. (As used throughout this Form 10-Q, Citi&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures.) 

Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $2.3 billion declined 4%, or 5% excluding the impact of FX translation, as higher fee revenues, including a recovery in commercial card revenues, as well as growth in trade were more than offset by the impact of lower deposit spreads. Private bank revenues increased 4% to $1.0 billion. Excluding the impact of losses on loan hedges, private bank revenues also increased 4%, driven by higher fees and lending volumes, reflecting momentum with both new and existing clients, partially offset by lower deposit spreads. Corporate lending revenues of $588 million increased 39%. Excluding the impact of losses on loan hedges, corporate lending revenues of $631 million increased 17%, primarily due to lower cost of funds and a modest gain on sale, partially offset by lower loan volumes. 

Markets and securities services revenues of $5.0 billion decreased 4%. Fixed income markets revenues of $3.2 billion decreased 16%, reflecting the continued normalization in market activity across rates and spread products. Equity markets revenues of $1.2 billion increased 40%, driven by growth in derivatives, prime finance and cash equities, reflecting solid client activity and favorable market conditions. Securities services revenues of $692 million increased 10%. Excluding the impact of FX translation, securities services revenues increased 9%, driven by strong growth in fee revenues with both new and existing clients, including growth in assets under custody and settlement volumes, partially offset by lower deposit spreads. For additional information on the results of operations of ICG for the third quarter of 2021, see &#8220; Institutional Clients Group &#8221; below. 

Corporate/Other 

Corporate/Other net loss was $111 million in the third quarter of 2021, compared to a net loss of $607 million in the prior-year period, primarily driven by higher revenues and lower expenses, partially offset by a lower net ACL release on Citi&#8217;s residual legacy portfolio. Operating expenses of $519 million decreased 37%, primarily driven by the absence of a prior-year period civil money penalty, partially offset by an increase in expenses related to Citi&#8217;s transformation. 

Corporate/Other revenues of $108 million increased from $(224) million in the prior-year period, largely reflecting higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. For additional information on the results of operations of Corporate/Other for the third quarter of 2021, see &#8220; Corporate/Other &#8221; below. 

COVID-19 PANDEMIC 

Although economic growth and employment rates have continued to recover from pandemic-related lows, particularly in the U.S., the pandemic has continued to adversely impact certain industries and regions. Notwithstanding these impacts, Citi has maintained strong capital and liquidity positions with consistently strong business operations. 

Following a U.S. presidential executive order issued in September 2021 mandating vaccination for government contractors that will apply to a significant number of Citi employees, Citi announced a requirement that U.S.-domiciled employees must be vaccinated, subject to legally required accommodations. 

For information on Citi&#8217;s support of its colleagues, customers and communities and its management of pandemic risks, see &#8220;COVID-19 Pandemic Overview&#8221; in Citigroup&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(1) In the fourth quarter of 2020, Citi revised the 2020 second quarter accounting conclusion for its variable post-charge-off third-party collection costs from a &#8220;change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle&#8221; to a &#8220;change in accounting principle,&#8221; which required an adjustment to January 1, 2020 opening retained earnings, rather than 2020 net income. As a result, Citi&#8217;s full-year and quarterly results for 2020 were revised to reflect this change as if it were effective as of January 1, 2020, as follows: an increase to beginning retained earnings on January 1, 2020 of $330 million and a decrease of $443 million in the allowance for credit losses on loans, as well as a $113 million decrease in other assets related to income taxes; a decrease of $18 million to provisions for credit losses on loans in the first quarter and increases of $339 million and $122 million to provisions for credit losses on loans in the second and third quarters, respectively; and increases in operating expenses of $49 million and $45 million with a corresponding decrease in net credit losses, in the first and second quarters, respectively. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

(2) Certain series of preferred stock have semiannual payment dates. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

(3) The return on average common stockholders&#8217; equity is calculated using net income less preferred stock dividends divided by average common stockholders&#8217; equity. The return on average total Citigroup stockholders&#8217; equity is calculated using net income divided by average Citigroup stockholders&#8217; equity. 

(4) RoTCE and TBV are non-GAAP financial measures. For information on RoTCE and TBV, see &#8220;Capital Resources&#8212;Tangible Common Equity, Book Value Per Share, Tangible Book Value Per Share and Return on Equity&#8221; below. 

(5) Citi&#8217;s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios were derived under the Basel III Standardized Approach framework as of September 30, 2021, and under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework as of September 30, 2020, whereas Citi&#8217;s reportable Total Capital ratio was derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework for both periods presented. 

(6) Dividend payout ratio is calculated as dividends declared per common share as a percentage of net income per diluted share. 

(7) Total payout ratio is calculated as total common dividends declared plus common share repurchases as a percentage of net income available to common shareholders ( Net income less preferred dividends). See &#8220;Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders&#8217; Equity,&#8221; Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and &#8220;Equity Security Repurchases&#8221; below for the component details.

This allocation change had no impact on Citi&#8217;s earnings before income taxes (EBIT) or Net income for any period. Prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period&#8217;s presentation. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

GLOBAL CONSUMER BANKING 

Global Consumer Banking ( GCB ) consists of consumer banking businesses in North America , Latin America (consisting of Citi&#8217;s consumer banking business in Mexico) and Asia . GCB provides traditional banking services to retail customers through retail banking, Citi-branded cards and, in the U.S., Citi retail services. GCB is focused on markets in the U.S., Mexico and Asia. As of September 30, 2021, GCB had 2,157 branches in 19 countries and jurisdictions with $442 billion in assets and $354 billion in retail banking deposits (excluding approximately $7 billion of deposits and $9 billion of loans reclassified to held-for-sale as a result of Citi&#8217;s agreement to sell its consumer banking business in Australia). 

GCB &#8217;s strategy is to leverage its global footprint and digital capabilities to develop multiproduct relationships with customers, both in and out of Citi&#8217;s branch footprint. To achieve this, GCB strives to optimize its clients&#8217; experiences across lending, payments and wealth management through continued digitization, new partnerships and innovation. For information on Citi&#8217;s previously announced strategic actions, including its pursuit of exits of its consumer franchises in 13 markets across Asia and EMEA , see &#8220;Executive Summary&#8221; above, &#8220; Asia GCB &#8221; below and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

3Q21 vs. 3Q20 

Net income was $1.4 billion, compared to $661 million in the prior-year period, reflecting significantly lower cost of credit, partially offset by a decline in revenues and higher expenses. 

Revenues decreased 4%, reflecting lower revenues in retail banking, Citi retail services and Citi-branded cards. 

Retail banking revenues decreased 7%, as the benefit of strong deposit growth and growth in assets under management (increase of 16%, reflecting favorable market conditions and strong client engagement) was more than offset by lower deposit spreads, as well as lower mortgage revenues. Average deposits increased 14%, driven by higher levels of consumer liquidity due to government stimulus, as well as continued strategic efforts to drive organic growth. 

Cards revenues decreased 3%. Citi-branded cards revenues decreased 1%, primarily driven by continued higher payment rates, reflecting increased customer liquidity from government stimulus and relief programs, largely offset by higher spending-related revenues. Purchase sales increased 24%, reflecting a continued recovery in sales activity from the pandemic-driven low levels in the prior-year period. 

Citi retail services revenues decreased 6%, primarily driven by lower average loans (down 5%) and continued higher payment rates from the increased customer liquidity from government stimulus and relief programs. Purchase sales increased 14%, reflecting a continued recovery in sales activity from the pandemic-driven low levels in the prior-year period. 

Expenses increased 7%, primarily driven by continued investments in Citi&#8217;s transformation, as well as business-led investments and higher volume-related expenses, partially offset by efficiency savings. 

Provisions reflected a benefit of $187 million, compared to costs of $1.2 billion in the prior-year period, primarily driven by a larger net ACL release in the current quarter, as well as lower net credit losses. Net credit losses decreased 48%, consisting of lower net credit losses in both Citi-branded cards (down 45% to $357 million) and Citi retail services (down 53% to $238 million), primarily driven by lower loan volumes and improved delinquencies, as a result of the higher payment rates. 

The net ACL release was $808 million, compared to a release of $5 million in the prior-year period, reflecting improvement in portfolio credit quality and the continued improvement in the macroeconomic outlook. For additional information on Citi&#8217;s ACL, see &#8220;Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates&#8221; below.

3Q21 YTD vs. 3Q20 YTD 

Year-to-date, North America GCB experienced similar trends to those described above. Net income was $4.6 billion, compared to a net loss of $1.0 billion in the prior-year period, as significantly lower cost of credit more than offset a decline in revenues and higher expenses. 

Revenues decreased 11%, reflecting lower revenues in retail banking, Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services. Retail banking revenues decreased 8%, primarily driven by the same factors described above. Cards revenues decreased 11%. In Citi-branded cards, revenues decreased 8%, driven by the same factors described above. Citi retail services revenues decreased 16%, driven by the same factors described above, as well as higher contractual partner payments reflecting higher income sharing as a result of lower forecasted losses. For additional information on partner payments, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Expenses increased 3%, driven by the same factors described above. 

Provisions reflected a benefit of $743 million, compared to costs of $8.3 billion in the prior-year period. Net credit losses decreased 42%, driven by the same factors described above. The ACL release was $3.1 billion, compared to a build of $4.2 billion in the prior-year period, driven by the same factors described above.

3Q21 vs. 3Q20 

Net income increased 90%, reflecting significantly lower cost of credit and lower expenses, partially offset by lower revenues. 

Revenues decreased 7%, reflecting lower cards and retail banking revenues, largely due to the continued impact of the pandemic. 

Retail banking revenues decreased 4%, primarily driven by continued lower loan volumes and deposit spreads, partially offset by growth in assets under management. Average loans decreased 13%, reflecting the impact of the pandemic on customer activity. Assets under management increased 6%, reflecting favorable market conditions, as well as strong client engagement. 

Cards revenues decreased 14%, primarily driven by lower average loans (down 10%), reflecting higher payment rates. Purchase sales increased 20%, reflecting a continued recovery in sales activity from the pandemic-driven low levels in the prior-year period. 

Expenses decreased 3%, as efficiency savings more than offset continued investments in Citi&#8217;s transformation, as well as business-led investments. 

Provisions of $16 million decreased 93%, reflecting a higher ACL release and lower net credit losses in the current period. Net credit losses decreased 29%, primarily reflecting lower cards loan volumes and improved delinquencies. 

The net ACL release was $178 million, compared to $77 million in the prior-year period. The release reflected an improvement in portfolio credit quality, as well as the continued improvement in the macroeconomic outlook and lower loan volumes. For additional information on Citi&#8217;s ACL, see &#8220;Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates&#8221; below.

Year-to-date, Latin America GCB experienced similar trends to those described above. Net income was $632 million, compared to $75 million in the prior-year period, as significantly lower cost of credit more than offset lower revenues. 

Revenues decreased 12%, reflecting lower revenues in both retail banking and cards. Retail banking revenues decreased 6%, driven by the same factors described above. Cards revenues decreased 24%, driven by the same factors described above. 

Expenses were largely unchanged, as efficiency savings were offset by the impact of continued investments in Citi&#8217;s transformation, as well as business-led investments. 

Provisions decreased 94%, driven by a net ACL release compared to a net ACL build in the prior-year period. The ACL release was $764 million, compared to a build of $426 million in the prior-year period, driven by the same factors described above. 

ASIA GCB 

Asia GCB provides traditional retail banking and Citi-branded card products to retail and small business customers. Included within Asia GCB are traditional retail banking and Citi-branded card products provided to retail customers in certain EMEA countries, primarily the UAE, Poland and Russia. 

Citi is pursuing exits of its consumer franchises in 13 markets across Asia and EMEA and will focus its consumer banking franchise in the two regions on four wealth centers: Singapore, Hong Kong, the UAE and London. As previously disclosed, Citi entered into an agreement to sell its consumer banking business in Australia and announced a decision to wind down and close its Korea consumer banking business (for additional information, including an estimated range of total cash charges expected to be incurred in connection with the Korea wind-down, see &#8220;Executive Summary&#8221; above and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). For additional information regarding risks related to Citi&#8217;s exits from the 13 markets, see &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; below. 

At September 30, 2021, on a combined basis, the businesses had 221 retail branches, $59.3 billion in retail banking loans and $119.7 billion in deposits. In addition, the businesses had $13.5 billion in outstanding card loan balances. These amounts exclude approximately $9 billion of loans ($6 billion of retail banking loans and $3 billion of credit card loan balances) and $7 billion of deposits reclassified to held-for-sale as a result of Citi&#8217;s agreement to sell its consumer banking business in Australia.

3Q21 vs. 3Q20 

Net loss was $340 million, including an approximate $680 million pretax loss ($580 million after-tax) related to the sale of the Australia consumer banking business. Excluding the loss on sale, net income was $240 million compared to $150 million in the prior-year period, reflecting significantly lower cost of credit, partially offset by higher expenses and lower revenues. 

Revenues decreased 46%, including the loss on sale. Excluding the loss on sale, the decline was 4%, reflecting lower retail banking and cards revenues, largely due to the continued impact of the pandemic, including lower interest rates. 

Retail banking revenues decreased 68%, including the loss on sale. Excluding the loss on sale, revenues decreased 4%, as growth in both investment revenues and deposits was more than offset by lower deposit spreads due to lower interest rates and lower FX and insurance revenues. Assets under management increased 13%, reflecting the impact of market conditions, as well as strong client engagement. Average deposits increased 4% and average loans decreased 4%. The decline in retail banking revenues was also impacted by a 3% decrease in retail lending revenues, reflecting a decline in personal loans driven by spread compression. 

Cards revenues decreased 3%, as lower average loans (down 16%, largely reflecting the reclassification to held-for-sale related to the Australia sale and higher payment rates) were partially offset by higher spending-related revenues (purchase sales up 6%), reflecting a continued recovery in sales activity from the pandemic-driven low levels in the prior-year period. 

Expenses increased 6%, primarily driven by continued investments in Citi&#8217;s transformation, as well as business-led investments, partially offset by efficiency savings. 

Provisions decreased 65%, primarily driven by a net ACL release compared to a net ACL build in the prior-year period, as well as lower net credit losses. Net credit losses decreased 20%, primarily reflecting lower cards loan volumes and improved delinquencies. 

The net ACL release was $44 million, compared to a build of $109 million in the prior-year period. The release reflected an improvement in portfolio credit quality, as well as the continued improvement in the macroeconomic outlook.

(1) Credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion of the private bank and corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans and loans at fair value. Gains (losses) on loan hedges include the mark-to-market on the credit derivatives and the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. The fixed premium costs of these hedges are netted against the private bank and corporate lending revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection. Gains (losses) on loan hedges include $(43) million and $(152) million related to the corporate loan portfolio and $(4) million and $(13) million related to the private bank for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively. Gains (losses) on loan hedges include $(117) million and $224 million related to the corporate loan portfolio and $(8) million and $37 million related to the private bank for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively. Citigroup&#8217;s results of operations excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures. 

(2) Excludes principal transactions revenues of ICG businesses other than Markets , primarily treasury and trade solutions and the private bank. 

(3) Citi assesses its Markets business performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items. For example, securities that generate Net interest revenue may be risk managed by derivatives that are recorded in Principal transactions revenue. For a description of the composition of these revenue line items, see Notes 4, 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

NM Not meaningful 

The discussion of the results of operations for ICG below excludes (where noted) the impact of gains (losses) on hedges of accrual loans, which are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above. 

3Q21 vs. 3Q20 

Net income of $3.4 billion increased 21% versus the prior-year period, primarily driven by lower cost of credit and higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses. 

Revenues increased 4%, reflecting higher Banking revenues (increase of 12% including the impact of losses on loan hedges), partially offset by lower Markets and securities services revenues. Excluding the impact of losses on loan hedges, Banking revenues were up 11%, driven by higher revenues in investment banking, corporate lending and the private bank, partially offset by lower revenues in treasury and trade solutions. Markets and securities services revenues were down 4%, primarily reflecting normalization in fixed income markets revenues, partially offset by growth in equity markets and securities services. 

Within Banking : 

&#8226; Investment banking revenues increased 39%, driven by higher revenues across advisory, equity underwriting and debt underwriting. Advisory revenues increased significantly from the prior-year period, reflecting strength in North America and EMEA , driven by growth in the market wallet as well as wallet share gains. Equity underwriting revenues increased modestly, as growth in North America and EMEA was largely offset by Asia . Debt underwriting revenues increased 19%, also reflecting strength in North America and EMEA , driven by growth in the market wallet and wallet share gains. 

&#8226; Treasury and trade solutions revenues decreased 4%. Excluding the impact of FX translation, revenues declined 5%, reflecting a decline in the cash business, partially offset by an increase in trade. Cash revenues decreased, as strong growth in fee revenues reflecting solid client engagement and growth in transaction volumes, including a continued recovery in commercial cards from low pandemic-related levels in the prior-year period, were more than offset by the impact of lower deposit spreads. The increase in trade revenues was driven by growth in loans compared to a low point in the prior-year period, reflecting an increase in trade flows and originations, primarily in EMEA and Asia . End-of-period trade loans grew 15% (both including and excluding the impact of FX translation). 

&#8226; Corporate lending revenues increased 39%, including the impact of losses on loan hedges. Excluding the impact of losses on loan hedges, revenues increased 17%, driven by 

lower cost of funds and a modest gain on sale, partially offset by lower loan volumes, reflecting muted demand given stronger client liquidity positions. 

&#8226; Private bank revenues increased 4% (both including and excluding the impact of losses on loan hedges), mainly due to strong performance in North America . The increase in revenues was driven by higher fees and lending volumes, reflecting continued client engagement, partially offset by lower deposit spreads and lower capital markets revenues. 

Within Markets and securities services : 

&#8226; Fixed income markets revenues decreased 16%, reflecting declines across North America , EMEA and Asia , largely driven by a comparison to a strong prior-year period in rates and spread products and a normalization in market activity. Non-interest revenues decreased, reflecting lower investor client activity across rates and currencies and spread products. Net interest revenues also decreased, largely reflecting a change in the mix of trading positions. 

Rates and currencies revenues decreased 16%, driven by the normalization in market activity, primarily in G10 rates and a comparison to a strong prior-year period that included elevated levels of volatility and higher spreads related to the pandemic. Spread products and other fixed income revenues decreased 17%, driven by a comparison to a strong prior-year period and a normalization in activity, particularly in flow trading, including lower volatility and spreads, partially offset by strong securitization activity. 

&#8226; Equity markets revenues increased 40%, driven by growth across all products. Equity derivatives revenues increased reflecting higher client activity, particularly in EMEA and Asia . Prime finance revenues increased due to favorable market conditions as well as growth in client balances. Cash equities revenues increased modestly reflecting higher client activity. Non-interest revenues increased, primarily in principal transactions, primarily due to the higher client activity. 

&#8226; Securities services revenues increased 10%. Excluding the impact of FX translation, revenues increased 9%, as an increase in fee revenues from both new and existing clients, driven by growth in assets under custody and settlement volumes, was partially offset by lower deposit spreads. 

Expenses were up 9%, primarily driven by continued investments in Citi&#8217;s transformation, business-led investments and higher revenue-related expenses, partially offset by efficiency savings. 

Provisions reflected a benefit of $46 million compared to costs of $838 million in the prior-year period. Net credit losses declined to $40 million from $326 million in the prior-year period, driven by improvements in portfolio credit quality. 

The ACL release for the quarter was $0.1 billion, compared to a build of $0.5 billion in the prior-year period. The release was primarily driven by an improvement in portfolio credit quality. For additional information on Citi&#8217;s ACL, see &#8220;Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates&#8221; below.

3Q21 YTD vs. 3Q20 YTD 

Net income of $13.1 billion increased 60% versus the prior-year period, primarily driven by lower cost of credit, partially offset by lower revenues and higher expenses. 

Revenues declined 5%, driven by an 11% decrease in Markets and securities services revenues, partially offset by a 3% increase in Banking revenues (including the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges). Excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges, Banking revenues increased 6%, as growth in investment banking, the private bank and corporate lending was partially offset by a decrease in treasury and trade solutions. Markets and securities services revenues decreased 11%, primarily driven by normalization in fixed income markets revenues due to a strong prior-year performance, partially offset by growth in equity markets and securities services. 

Within Banking : 

&#8226; Investment banking revenues increased 26%. Advisory revenues increased 57%, driven by growth in the market wallet. Equity underwriting revenues increased 67%, primarily driven by growth in the market wallet in the first half of 2021, as well as share gains. Debt underwriting revenues decreased 2%, driven by a decline in wallet share. 

&#8226; Treasury and trade solutions revenues decreased 5% (6% decrease excluding the impact of FX translation), driven by lower cash revenues, partially offset by higher trade revenues. Cash revenues declined, driven by the same factors described above. Trade revenues increased, reflecting improved loan spreads. 

&#8226; Corporate lending revenues decreased 19%, including the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges. Excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges, revenues increased 2%, primarily driven by the same factors described above and lower mark-downs on the portfolio, given lower volatility compared to the first half of 2020 due to the pandemic. 

&#8226; Private bank revenues increased 3%. Excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges, revenues increased 5%, driven by the same factors described above. 

Within Markets and securities services : 

&#8226; Fixed income markets revenues decreased 23%, with declines across all regions, reflecting a strong prior-year comparison, particularly in rates and currencies, as well as declines in spread products and other fixed income revenues. 

&#8226; Equity markets revenues increased 34%, driven largely by higher revenues in equity derivatives and prime finance, as well as an increase in cash equities. 

&#8226; Securities services revenues increased 6%. Excluding the impact of FX translation, revenues increased 5%, driven by the same factors described above. 

Expenses increased 7%, primarily driven by continued investments in Citi&#8217;s transformation and business-led investments, partially offset by efficiency savings. 

Provisions reflected a net benefit of $2.6 billion, compared to costs of $6.7 billion, driven by an ACL release and lower net credit losses. Net credit losses declined to $315 million from $777 million in the prior-year period, driven by improvements in portfolio credit quality. The ACL release was $2.9 billion, compared to a build of $5.9 billion in the prior-year period. The release was primarily driven by an improvement in portfolio credit quality as well as Citi&#8217;s improved macroeconomic outlook. 

CORPORATE/OTHER 

Corporate/Other includes certain unallocated costs of global staff functions (including finance, risk, human resources, legal and compliance), other corporate expenses and unallocated global operations and technology expenses and income taxes, as well as Corporate Treasury, certain North America legacy consumer loan portfolios, other legacy assets and discontinued operations (for additional information on Corporate/Other , see &#8220;Citigroup Segments&#8221; above). At September 30, 2021, Corporate/Other had $101 billion in assets.

3Q21 vs. 3Q20 

Net loss was $111 million in the third quarter of 2021, compared to a net loss of $607 million in the prior-year period, primarily driven by higher revenues and lower expenses, partially offset by a lower net ACL release. 

Revenues of $108 million increased from $(224) million in the prior-year period, largely reflecting higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. 

Expenses decreased 37%, primarily driven by the absence of the $400 million civil money penalty in the prior-year period, partially offset by investments in Citi&#8217;s transformation. 

Provisions reflected a net benefit of $81 million, compared to a net benefit of $136 million in the prior-year period, primarily driven by a lower net ACL release in the current quarter ($54 million compared to $132 million in the prior-year period), reflecting the continued wind&#8208;down of the legacy North America mortgage portfolio.

3Q21 YTD vs. 3Q20 YTD 

Net income was $298 million, compared to a net loss of $921 million in the prior-year period, largely reflecting the higher revenues, lower expenses and a higher net ACL release, as well as certain income tax benefit items related to non-U.S. operations in the second quarter of 2021. 

Revenues of $445 million increased from $139 million in the prior-year period, primarily reflecting the same factors described above. 

Expenses decreased 12%, driven by the same factors described above, partially offset by an increase in brand marketing and transformation spend. 

Provisions reflected a benefit of $314 million, compared to costs of $220 million in the prior-year period. The net ACL release was $270 million, compared to a build of $230 million in the prior-year period, primarily reflecting Citi&#8217;s improved macroeconomic outlook. 

CAPITAL RESOURCES 

For additional information about capital resources, including Citi&#8217;s capital management, regulatory capital buffers, the stress testing component of capital planning and current regulatory capital standards and developments, see &#8220;Capital Resources&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

During the third quarter of 2021, Citi returned a total of approximately $4.0 billion of capital to common shareholders in the form of share repurchases (approximately 43 million common shares) and dividends. For additional information, see &#8220;Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Repurchases of Equity Securities and Dividends&#8221; below. Year-to-date, Citi returned nearly $11 billion of capital to its common shareholders. 

Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio 

Citi&#8217;s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio was 11.7% as of September 30, 2021, compared to 11.8% as of June 30, 2021, both under the Basel III Standardized Approach. Citi&#8217;s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio was 11.7% as of December 31, 2020, under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework. 

Citi&#8217;s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio decreased from June 30, 2021, as an increase in risk-weighted assets and the return of approximately $4 billion of capital to common shareholders were partially offset by net income of $4.6 billion. 

Citi&#8217;s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio remained unchanged from year-end 2020, as net income of $18.8 billion was offset by the return of approximately $11 billion of capital to common shareholders, adverse net movements in Accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ), an increase in risk-weighted assets and a reduction in the benefit of the modified CECL transition provision as a result of the Allowance for credit losses (ACL) released during the year. 

Stress Capital Buffer 

In August 2021, the Federal Reserve Board finalized and announced Citi&#8217;s Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) requirement of 3.0%. Accordingly, beginning October 1, 2021, Citigroup is required to maintain a 10.5% effective minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital requirement under the Standardized Approach. Citi&#8217;s effective minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital requirement under the Advanced Approaches (using the fixed 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer) remains unchanged at 10.0%. 

The SCB applies to Citigroup only. The regulatory capital framework applicable to Citibank, including the Capital Conservation Buffer, is unchanged by Citigroup&#8217;s SCB. For additional information regarding the SCB, see &#8220;Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Capital Buffers&#8212;Stress Capital Buffer&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(1) Citi&#8217;s effective minimum risk-based capital requirements include the 2.5% Stress Capital Buffer and 3.0% GSIB surcharge under the Standardized Approach, and the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer and 3.0% GSIB surcharge under the Advanced Approaches (all of which must be composed of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital). These effective minimum requirements were applicable through September 30, 2021. See &#8220;Stress Capital Buffer&#8221; above for additional information. 

(2) Citi has elected to apply the modified transition provision related to the impact of the CECL accounting standard on regulatory capital, as provided by the U.S. banking agencies&#8217; September 2020 final rule. Under the modified CECL transition provision, the changes in retained earnings (after-tax), deferred tax assets (DTAs) arising from temporary differences and the allowance for credit losses upon the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date have been deferred and will phase in to regulatory capital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022. For the ongoing impact of CECL, Citigroup is allowed to adjust retained earnings and the allowance for credit losses in an amount equal to 25% of the change in the allowance for credit losses (pretax) for each period between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021. The cumulative adjustments to retained earnings and the allowance for credit losses between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021 will also phase in to regulatory capital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022, along with the deferred impacts related to the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date. Corresponding adjustments to average on-balance sheet assets are reflected in quarterly adjusted average total assets and Total Leverage Exposure. In addition, the increase in DTAs arising from temporary differences upon the January 1, 2020 adoption date has been deducted from risk-weighted assets (RWA) and will phase in to RWA at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022. 

(3) Citi&#8217;s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios were derived under the Basel III Standardized Approach as of September 30, 2021 and June 30, 2021, and under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework as of December 31, 2020, whereas Citi&#8217;s reportable Total Capital ratio was derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework for all periods presented. 

(4) Tier 1 Leverage ratio denominator. Represents quarterly average total assets less amounts deducted from Tier 1 Capital. 

(5) Supplementary Leverage ratio denominator. Commencing with the second quarter of 2020 and continuing through the first quarter of 2021, Citigroup&#8217;s Total Leverage Exposure temporarily excluded U.S. Treasuries and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. For additional information, see &#8220;Capital Resources&#8212;Current Regulatory Capital Standards&#8212;Temporary Supplementary Leverage Ratio Relief&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

As indicated in the table above, Citigroup&#8217;s risk-based capital ratios at September 30, 2021 were in excess of the stated and effective minimum requirements under the U.S. Basel III rules. In addition, Citi was also &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under current federal bank regulatory agency definitions as of September 30, 2021.

(1) Issuance costs of $125 million and $156 million related to outstanding noncumulative perpetual preferred stock as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, are excluded from common stockholders&#8217; equity and are netted against such preferred stock in accordance with Federal Reserve Board regulatory reporting requirements, which differ from those under U.S. GAAP. 

(2) Citi has elected to apply the modified transition provision related to the impact of the CECL accounting standard on regulatory capital, as provided by the U.S. banking agencies&#8217; September 2020 final rule. Under the modified CECL transition provision, the changes in retained earnings (after-tax) and the allowance for credit losses upon the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date have been deferred and will phase in to regulatory capital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022. For the ongoing impact of CECL, Citigroup is allowed to adjust retained earnings and the allowance for credit losses in an amount equal to 25% of the change in the allowance for credit losses (pretax) for each period between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021. The cumulative adjustments to retained earnings and the allowance for credit losses between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021 will also phase in to regulatory capital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022, along with the deferred impacts related to the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date. 

(3) Includes goodwill &#8220;embedded&#8221; in the valuation of significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions. 

Footnotes continue on the following page. 

(4) Of Citi&#8217;s $24.5 billion of net DTAs at September 30, 2021, $15.3 billion was included in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital pursuant to the U.S. Basel III rules, while $9.2 billion was excluded. Excluded from Citi&#8217;s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital as of September 30, 2021 was $10.9 billion of net DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit tax carry-forwards. The amount excluded was reduced by $1.7 billion of net DTLs primarily associated with goodwill and certain other intangible assets that are separately deducted from capital. DTAs arising from tax carry-forwards are required to be entirely deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules. DTAs arising from temporary differences are required to be deducted from capital only if these DTAs exceed 10%/15% limitations under the U.S. Basel III rules. Citi&#8217;s DTAs do not currently exceed these limitations and, therefore, are not subject to deduction from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, but are subject to risk weighting at 250%. 

(5) Represents Citigroup Capital XIII trust preferred securities, which are permanently grandfathered as Tier 1 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules. 

(6) Banking entities are required to be in compliance with the Volcker Rule of the Dodd-Frank Act, which prohibits conducting certain proprietary investment activities and limits their ownership of, and relationships with, covered funds. Commencing January 1, 2021, Citi no longer deducts permitted market making positions in third-party covered funds from Tier 1 Capital, in accordance with the revised Volcker Rule 2.0 issued by the U.S. agencies in November 2019. Upon the removal of the capital deduction, permitted market making positions in third-party covered funds are included in risk-weighted assets. 

(7) Represents the amount of non-grandfathered trust preferred securities eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules, which will be fully phased out of Tier 2 Capital by January 1, 2022. 

(8) Under the Standardized Approach, the allowance for credit losses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of credit risk-weighted assets, with any excess allowance for credit losses being deducted in arriving at credit risk-weighted assets, which differs from the Advanced Approaches framework, in which eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent that the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets. The total amount of eligible credit reserves in excess of expected credit losses that were eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital, subject to limitation, under the Advanced Approaches framework was $5.0 billion and $5.1 billion at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

(1) Represents the daily average of on-balance sheet assets for the quarter. 

(2) Citi has elected to apply the modified transition provision related to the impact of the CECL accounting standard on regulatory capital, as provided by the U.S. banking agencies&#8217; September 2020 final rule. Under the modified CECL transition provision, the changes in DTAs arising from temporary differences and the allowance for credit losses upon the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date have been deferred and will phase in to regulatory capital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022. For the ongoing impact of CECL, Citigroup is allowed to adjust the allowance for credit losses in an amount equal to 25% of the change in the allowance for credit losses (pretax) for each period between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021. The cumulative adjustments to the allowance for credit losses between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021 will also phase in to regulatory capital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022, along with the deferred impacts related to the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date. Corresponding adjustments to average on-balance sheet assets are reflected in Total Leverage Exposure. 

(3) Commencing with the second quarter of 2020 and continuing through the first quarter of 2021, Citigroup&#8217;s Total Leverage Exposure temporarily excluded U.S. Treasuries and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. For additional information, see &#8220;Capital Resources&#8212;Current Regulatory Capital Standards&#8212;Temporary Supplementary Leverage Ratio Relief&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

(4) Represents the average of certain off-balance sheet exposures calculated as of the last day of each month in the quarter. 

(5) Under the U.S. Basel III rules, banking organizations are required to include in Total Leverage Exposure the effective notional amount of sold credit derivatives, with netting of exposures permitted if certain conditions are met. 

(6) Repo-style transactions include repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions as well as securities borrowing and securities lending transactions. 

(7) Other off-balance sheet exposures include unfunded commitments other than those that are unconditionally cancellable. 

As set forth in the table above, Citigroup&#8217;s Supplementary Leverage Ratio was approximately 5.8% at September 30, 2021 and June 30, 2021, compared to 7.0% at December 31, 2020. The ratio remained largely unchanged from the second quarter of 2021. 

The ratio decreased from the fourth quarter of 2020, primarily attributable to an approximate 100 basis point impact from the expiration of the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s temporary Supplementary Leverage ratio relief. For additional information, see &#8220;Capital Resources&#8212;Current Regulatory Capital Standards&#8212;Temporary Supplementary Leverage Ratio Relief&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Capital Resources of Citigroup&#8217;s Subsidiary U.S. Depository Institutions 

Citigroup&#8217;s subsidiary U.S. depository institutions are also subject to regulatory capital standards issued by their respective primary bank regulatory agencies, which are similar to the standards of the Federal Reserve Board.

(2) Citibank has elected to apply the modified transition provision related to the impact of the CECL accounting standard on regulatory capital, as provided by the U.S. banking agencies&#8217; September 2020 final rule. Under the modified CECL transition provision, the changes in retained earnings (after-tax), deferred tax assets (DTAs) arising from temporary differences and the allowance for credit losses upon the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date have been deferred and will phase in to regulatory capital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022. For the ongoing impact of CECL, Citibank is allowed to adjust retained earnings and the allowance for credit losses in an amount equal to 25% of the change in the allowance for credit losses (pretax) for each period between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021. The cumulative adjustments to retained earnings and the allowance for credit losses between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021 will also phase in to regulatory capital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022, along with the deferred impacts related to the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date. Corresponding adjustments to average on-balance sheet assets are reflected in quarterly adjusted average total assets and Total Leverage Exposure. In addition, the increase in DTAs arising from temporary differences upon the January 1, 2020 adoption date has been deducted from risk-weighted assets (RWA) and will phase in to RWA at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022. 

(3) Under the Advanced Approaches framework, eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent that the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets, which differs from the Standardized Approach in which the ACL is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of credit risk-weighted assets, with any excess ACL being deducted in arriving at credit risk-weighted assets. 

(4) Citibank&#8217;s reportable Total Capital ratio was derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework, whereas Citibank&#8217;s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios were the lower derived under the Basel III Standardized Approach for all periods presented. 

(5) Citibank must maintain minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital, Total Capital and Tier 1 Leverage ratios of 6.5%, 8.0%, 10.0% and 5.0%, respectively, to be considered &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under the revised Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) regulations applicable to insured depository institutions as established by the U.S. Basel III rules. Citibank must also maintain a minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio of 6.0% to be considered &#8220;well capitalized.&#8221; 

(6) Tier 1 Leverage ratio denominator. Represents quarterly average total assets less amounts deducted from Tier 1 Capital. 

(7) Supplementary Leverage ratio denominator. Citibank did not elect to temporarily exclude U.S. Treasuries and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from Total Leverage Exposure. For additional information, see &#8220;Capital Resources&#8212;Current Regulatory Capital Standards&#8212;Temporary Supplementary Leverage Ratio Relief&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

As indicated in the table above, Citibank&#8217;s capital ratios at September 30, 2021 were in excess of the stated and effective minimum requirements under the U.S. Basel III rules. In addition, Citibank was &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; as of September 30, 2021. 

Impact of Changes on Citigroup and Citibank Capital Ratios 

The following tables present the estimated sensitivity of Citigroup&#8217;s and Citibank&#8217;s capital ratios to changes of $100 million in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital (numerator), and changes of $1 billion in 

Advanced Approaches and Standardized Approach risk-weighted assets and quarterly adjusted average total assets, as well as Total Leverage Exposure (denominator), as of September 30, 2021. This information is provided for the purpose of analyzing the impact that a change in Citigroup&#8217;s or Citibank&#8217;s financial position or results of operations could have on these ratios. These sensitivities only consider a single change to either a component of capital, risk-weighted assets, quarterly adjusted average total assets or Total Leverage Exposure. Accordingly, an event that affects more than one factor may have a larger basis point impact than is reflected in these tables.

Upcoming Adoption of the Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk 

In January 2020, the U.S. banking agencies issued a final rule to introduce the Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR). SA-CCR will replace the Current Exposure Method, which is the current methodology used to calculate exposure for derivative contracts, throughout the regulatory framework. Among other instances, SA-CCR will be used for purposes of calculating risk-weighted assets under the Standardized Approach and Advanced Approaches (where internal models are not used), as well as Total Leverage Exposure. The mandatory compliance date of the SA-CCR final rule is January 1, 2022. For additional information on the SA-CCR final rule, see &#8220;Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Capital Standards Developments&#8212;Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Citi&#8217;s adoption of SA-CCR will result in an adverse impact to Citigroup&#8217;s and Citibank&#8217;s regulatory capital ratios in the first quarter of 2022. The magnitude of the impact upon adoption remains subject to additional implementation planning and business actions, including composition of the derivatives portfolio as of the adoption date. 

Tangible Common Equity, Book Value Per Share, Tangible Book Value Per Share and Return on Equity 

Tangible common equity (TCE), as defined by Citi, represents common stockholders&#8217; equity less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)). Tangible book value per share, as defined by Citi, represents TCE divided by common shares outstanding. Other companies may calculate TCE in a different manner. TCE, tangible book value per share and return on average TCE (RoTCE) are non-GAAP financial measures.

MANAGING GLOBAL RISK 

For Citi, effective risk management is of primary importance to its overall operations. Accordingly, Citi&#8217;s risk management process has been designed to monitor, evaluate and manage the principal risks it assumes in conducting its activities. Specifically, the activities that Citi engages in, and the risks those activities generate, must be consistent with Citi&#8217;s mission, strategy, value proposition, key guiding principles and risk appetite.

(1) Loans modified under Citi&#8217;s consumer relief programs continue to be reported in the same delinquency bucket they were in at the time of modification (which have various durations, and certain of which may be renewed by the customer). Consumer relief programs in Asia and Mexico largely expired during the fourth quarter of 2020. 

(2) End-of-period (EOP) loans include interest and fees on credit cards. 

(3) The ratios of 90+ days past due and 30&#8211;89 days past due are calculated based on EOP loans, net of unearned income. 

(4) The 90+ days past due balances for North America &#8212;Citi-branded and North America &#8212;Citi retail services are generally still accruing interest. Citigroup&#8217;s policy is generally to accrue interest on credit card loans until 180 days past due, unless notification of bankruptcy filing has been received earlier. 

(5) The 90+ days past due and 30&#8211;89 days past due and related ratios for North America GCB exclude loans that are primarily related to U.S. mortgages guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies since the potential loss predominantly resides with the U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past due and (EOP loans) were $146 million ($0.6 billion), $150 million ($0.7 billion) and $148 million ($0.6 billion) as of September 30, 2021, June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively. The amounts excluded for loans 30&#8211;89 days past due and (EOP loans) were $78 million ($0.6 billion), $80 million ($0.7 billion) and $88 million ($0.6 billion) as of September 30, 2021, June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively. 

(6) Asia includes delinquencies and loans in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented. 

(7) During the third quarter of 2021, Citi&#8217;s Australia consumer banking business was classified as held-for-sale (HFS) pursuant to Citi&#8217;s agreement to sell the business. Accordingly, the Australian consumer loans are recorded in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and hence the loans and related delinquencies and ratios are not included in this table. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

(8) The loans 90+ days past due and related ratios exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are primarily related to U.S. mortgages guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies since the potential loss predominantly resides with the U.S. agencies. The amounts excluded for 90+ days past due and (EOP loans) for each period were $138 million ($0.4 billion), $125 million ($0.3 billion) and $172 million ($0.5 billion) as of September 30, 2021, June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively.

Portfolio Mix&#8212;Geography and Counterparty 

Citi&#8217;s corporate credit portfolio is diverse across geography and counterparty. The following table shows the percentage of this portfolio by region (excluding the delinquency-managed private bank portfolio) based on Citi&#8217;s internal management geography: 

September 30, 2021 June 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 North America 57 &#160; % 57 % 56 % EMEA 25 &#160; 25 25 Asia 13 &#160; 13 13 Latin America 5 &#160; 5 6 Total 100 &#160; % 100 % 100 % 

The maintenance of accurate and consistent risk ratings across the corporate credit portfolio facilitates the comparison of credit exposure across all lines of business, geographic regions and products. Counterparty risk ratings reflect an estimated probability of default for a counterparty and are derived by leveraging validated statistical models, scorecard models and external agency ratings (under defined circumstances), in combination with consideration of factors specific to the obligor or market, such as management experience, competitive position, regulatory environment and commodity prices. Facility risk ratings are assigned that reflect the probability of default of the obligor and factors that affect the loss given default of the facility, such as support or collateral. Internal obligor ratings that generally correspond to BBB and above are considered investment grade, while those below are considered non-investment grade. 

The following table presents the corporate credit portfolio (excluding the delinquency-managed private bank portfolio) by facility risk rating as a percentage of the total corporate credit portfolio: 

&#160; Total exposure &#160; September 30, 2021 June 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 AAA/AA/A 49 &#160; % 49 % 49 % BBB 32 &#160; 32 31 BB/B 16 &#160; 16 17 CCC or below 3 &#160; 3 3 Total 100 &#160; % 100 % 100 % 

Note: Total exposure includes direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments. 

In addition to the obligor and facility risk ratings assigned to all exposures, Citi may classify exposures in the corporate credit portfolio. These classifications are consistent with Citi&#8217;s interpretation of the U.S. banking regulators&#8217; definition of criticized exposures, which may categorize exposures as special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss. 

Risk ratings and classifications are reviewed regularly, and adjusted as appropriate. The credit review process incorporates quantitative and qualitative factors, including financial and non-financial disclosures or metrics, idiosyncratic events or changes to the competitive, regulatory or macroeconomic environment. This includes but is not limited to exposures in those sectors significantly impacted by the pandemic (including consumer retail, commercial real estate and transportation). 

Citigroup believes the corporate credit portfolio to be appropriately rated and classified as of September 30, 2021. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Citigroup has taken action to adjust internal ratings and classifications of exposures as both the macroeconomic environment and obligor-specific factors have changed, particularly where additional stress has been seen. 

As obligor risk ratings are downgraded, the probability of default increases. Downgrades of obligor risk ratings tend to 

result in a higher provision for credit losses. In addition, downgrades may result in the purchase of additional credit derivatives or other risk mitigants to hedge the incremental credit risk, or may result in Citi&#8217;s seeking to reduce exposure to an obligor or an industry sector. Citi will continue to review exposures to ensure that the appropriate probability of default is incorporated into all risk assessments.

(7) In addition to this exposure, Citi has energy-related exposure within the public sector (e.g., energy-related state-owned entities) and the transportation and industrial sector (e.g., off-shore drilling entities) included in the table above. As of September 30, 2021, Citi&#8217;s total exposure to these energy-related entities was approximately $6.7 billion, of which approximately $3.5 billion consisted of direct outstanding funded loans. 

Exposure to Commercial Real Estate 

As of September 30, 2021, ICG &#8217;s total corporate credit exposure to commercial real estate (CRE) was $67 billion, with $45 billion consisting of direct outstanding funded loans (mainly included in the real estate and private bank categories in the above table), or 7% of Citi&#8217;s total outstanding loans. In addition, as of September 30, 2021, more than 70% of ICG &#8217;s total corporate CRE exposure was to borrowers in the U.S. Also, as of September 30, 2021, approximately 74% of ICG &#8217;s total corporate CRE exposure was rated investment grade. 

As of September 30, 2021, the ACLL was 0.9% of funded CRE exposure, including 2.4% of funded non-investment-grade exposure. 

Of the total CRE exposure: 

&#8226; $20 billion ($13 billion of direct outstanding funded loans) relates to Community Reinvestment Act-related lending provided pursuant to Citi&#8217;s regulatory requirements to meet the credit needs of borrowers in low and moderate income neighborhoods. 

&#8226; $20 billion ($16 billion of direct outstanding funded loans) relates to exposure secured by mortgages on underlying properties or in well-rated securitization exposures. 

&#8226; $16 billion ($5 billion of direct outstanding funded loans) relates to unsecured loans to large REITs, with nearly 74% of the exposure rated investment grade. 

&#8226; $11 billion ($11 billion of direct outstanding funded loans) relates to CRE exposure in the private bank of which 100% is secured by mortgages. In addition, 47% of the exposure is also full recourse to the client. As of September 30, 2021, 77% of the exposure was rated investment grade.

(1) Excludes $42.6 billion and $4.4 billion of funded and unfunded exposure at December 31, 2020, respectively, primarily related to the delinquency-managed private bank portfolio. 

(2) Includes non-accrual loan exposures and criticized unfunded exposures. 

(3) Excludes $162 million of past due loans primarily related to the delinquency-managed private bank portfolio. 

(4) Net charge-offs (recoveries) are for the year ended December 31, 2020 and exclude delinquency-managed private bank charge-offs of $10 million. 

(5) Represents the amount of purchased credit protection in the form of derivatives to economically hedge funded and unfunded exposures. Of the $38.8 billion of purchased credit protection, $36.8 billion represents the total notional amount of purchased credit derivatives on individual reference entities. The remaining $2.0 billion represents the first loss tranche of portfolios of purchased credit derivatives with a total notional of $16.1 billion, where the protection seller absorbs the first loss on the referenced loan portfolios. 

(6) Autos total credit exposure includes securitization financing facilities secured by auto loans and leases, extended mainly to the finance company subsidiaries of global auto manufacturers, bank subsidiaries and independent auto finance companies, of approximately $20.2 billion ($10.3 billion in funded, with more than 99% rated investment grade) as of December 31, 2020. 

(7) In addition to this exposure, Citi has energy-related exposure within the public sector (e.g., energy-related state-owned entities) and the transportation and industrials sector (e.g., off-shore drilling entities) included in the table above. As of December 31, 2020, Citi&#8217;s total exposure to these energy-related entities was approximately $7.0 billion, of which approximately $3.8 billion consisted of direct outstanding funded loans. 

Credit Risk Mitigation 

As part of its overall risk management activities, Citigroup uses credit derivatives and other risk mitigants to hedge portions of the credit risk in its corporate credit portfolio, in addition to outright asset sales. Citi may enter into partial-term hedges as well as full-term hedges. In advance of the expiration of partial-term hedges, Citi will determine, among other factors, the economic feasibility of hedging the remaining life of the instrument. The results of the mark-to-market and any realized gains or losses on credit derivatives are reflected primarily in Principal transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 

At September 30, 2021, June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, ICG (excluding the delinquency-managed private bank portfolio) had economic hedges on the corporate credit portfolio of $38.1 billion, $37.2 billion and $38.8 billion, respectively. Citigroup&#8217;s expected credit loss model used in the calculation of its ACL does not include the favorable impact of credit derivatives and other mitigants that are marked to market. In addition, the reported amounts of direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments in the tables above do not reflect the impact of these hedging transactions. The credit protection was economically hedging underlying ICG (excluding the delinquency-managed private bank portfolio) corporate credit portfolio exposures with the following risk rating distribution:

Non-Accrual Loans and Assets and Renegotiated Loans 

For additional information on Citi&#8217;s non-accrual loans and assets and renegotiated loans, see &#8220;Non-Accrual Loans and Assets and Renegotiated Loans&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Non-Accrual Loans 

The table below summarizes Citigroup&#8217;s non-accrual loans as of the periods indicated. Non-accrual loans may still be current on interest payments. In situations where Citi reasonably expects that only a portion of the principal owed will ultimately be collected, all payments received are reflected as a reduction of principal and not as interest income. For all other non-accrual loans, cash interest receipts are generally recorded as revenue.

(2) In addition to modifications reflected as TDRs at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, Citi also modified zero and $47 million, respectively, of commercial loans risk rated &#8220;Substandard Non-Performing&#8221; or worse (asset category defined by banking regulators) in offices outside the U.S. These modifications were not considered TDRs because the modifications did not involve a concession or because the modifications qualified for exemptions from TDR accounting provided by the CARES Act or the interagency guidance. 

(3) Includes $714 million and $873 million of non-accrual loans included in the non-accrual loans table above at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The remaining loans were accruing interest.

Note: The amounts set forth in the table above are presented on an average basis. For securities, the amounts represent the liquidity value that potentially could be realized and, therefore, exclude any securities that are encumbered and incorporate any haircuts applicable under the U.S. LCR rule. The table above incorporates various restrictions that could limit the transferability of liquidity between legal entities, including Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. 

(1) Foreign government debt includes securities issued or guaranteed by foreign sovereigns, agencies and multilateral development banks. Foreign government debt securities are held largely to support local liquidity requirements and Citi&#8217;s local franchises and principally include government bonds from Japan, Mexico, Hong Kong, South Korea and India. 

The table above includes average amounts of HQLA held at Citigroup&#8217;s operating entities that are eligible for inclusion in the calculation of Citigroup&#8217;s consolidated Liquidity Coverage ratio (LCR), pursuant to the U.S. LCR rules. These amounts include the HQLA needed to meet the minimum requirements at these entities and any amounts in excess of these minimums that are assumed to be transferable to other entities within Citigroup. Citigroup&#8217;s HQLA increased quarter-over-quarter, primarily reflecting growth in deposits. 

As of September 30, 2021, Citigroup had approximately $994 billion of available liquidity resources to support client and business needs, including end-of-period HQLA assets; additional unencumbered securities, including excess liquidity held at bank entities that is non-transferable to other entities within Citigroup; and available assets not already accounted for within Citi&#8217;s HQLA to support Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and Federal Reserve Bank discount window borrowing capacity. 

Short-Term Liquidity Measurement: Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) 

In addition to internal 30-day liquidity stress testing performed for Citi&#8217;s major entities, operating subsidiaries and countries, Citi also monitors its liquidity by reference to the LCR. The table below details the components of Citi&#8217;s LCR calculation and HQLA in excess of net outflows for the periods indicated: 

In billions of dollars Sept. 30, 2021 Jun. 30, 2021 Sept. 30, 2020 HQLA $ 546.5 &#160; $ 522.6 $ 522.0 Net outflows 474.8 &#160; 461.7 442.6 LCR 115 &#160; % 113 % 118 % HQLA in excess of net outflows $ 71.7 &#160; $ 60.9 $ 79.4 

Note: The amounts are presented on an average basis. 

As of September 30, 2021, Citigroup&#8217;s average LCR increased from the quarter ended June 30, 2021. The increase was primarily driven by lower funding needs in broker-dealer subsidiaries along with debt issuance in the latter part of the prior quarter. 

Long-Term Liquidity Measurement: Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) 

As previously disclosed, in October 2020, the U.S. banking agencies adopted a final rule to assess the availability of a bank&#8217;s stable funding against a required level. 

The final rule became effective beginning July 1, 2021, while public disclosure requirements to report the ratio will occur on a semiannual basis beginning June 30, 2023. Citi was in compliance with the final rule as of the third quarter of 2021.

End-of-period loans were largely unchanged year-over-year and declined 2% quarter-over-quarter. 

On an average basis, loans declined 1% year-over-year and were largely unchanged sequentially. Excluding the impact of FX translation, average loans declined 2% year-over-year and were largely unchanged sequentially. On this basis, average GCB loans declined 4% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the reclassification of loans to held-for-sale as a result of Citi&#8217;s agreement to sell its consumer banking business in Australia. 

Excluding the impact of FX translation, average ICG loans were largely unchanged year-over-year. Loans in corporate lending declined 23% on an average basis, reflecting net repayments as Citi continued to assist its clients in accessing the capital markets, as well as lower demand. Private bank loans increased 14%, largely driven by increased secured lending to high-net-worth clients. Markets and securities services loans increased 35%, reflecting an increase in securitization financing. TTS loans increased 9%, reflecting an increase in trade flows and originations. 

Average Corporate/Other loans continued to decline (down 42%), driven by the wind-down of legacy assets.

(2) Includes deposits in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented. 

End-of-period deposits increased 7% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. 

On an average basis, deposits increased 6% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Excluding the impact of FX translation, average deposits grew 5% from the prior-year period and 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase reflected continued client engagement as well as the elevated level of liquidity in the financial system. On this basis, average deposits in GCB increased 9%, with strong growth in North America . 

Excluding the impact of FX translation, average deposits in ICG grew 4% year-over-year, with strong growth in the private bank and securities services. 

Long-Term Debt 

The weighted-average maturity of unsecured long-term debt issued by Citigroup and its affiliates (including Citibank) with a remaining life greater than one year was approximately 8.6 years as of September 30, 2021, compared to 8.6 years as of the prior year and 8.8 years as of the prior quarter. The weighted-average maturity is calculated based on the contractual maturity of each security. For securities that are redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the holder, the weighted-average maturity is calculated based on the earliest date an option becomes exercisable. 

Citi&#8217;s long-term debt outstanding at the Citigroup parent company includes benchmark senior and subordinated debt and what Citi refers to as customer-related debt, consisting of structured notes, such as equity- and credit-linked notes, as well as non-structured notes. Citi&#8217;s issuance of customer-related debt is generally driven by customer demand and complements benchmark debt issuance as a source of funding for Citi&#8217;s non-bank entities. Citi&#8217;s long-term debt at the bank includes bank notes, FHLB advances and securitizations. 

Long-Term Debt Outstanding 

The following table sets forth Citi&#8217;s end-of-period total long-term debt outstanding for each of the dates indicated:

Note: Amounts represent the current value of long-term debt on Citi&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet that, for certain debt instruments, includes consideration of fair value, hedging impacts and unamortized discounts and premiums. 

(1) Non-bank includes long-term debt issued to third parties by the parent holding company (Citigroup) and Citi&#8217;s non-bank subsidiaries (including broker-dealer subsidiaries) that are consolidated into Citigroup. As of September 30, 2021, non-bank included $63.5 billion of long-term debt issued by Citi&#8217;s broker-dealer and other subsidiaries, as well as certain Citigroup consolidated hedging activities. 

(2) Local country and other includes debt issued by Citi&#8217;s affiliates in support of their local operations. Within non-bank, certain secured financing is also included. 

(3) Predominantly credit card securitizations, primarily backed by Citi-branded credit card receivables. 

Citi&#8217;s total long-term debt outstanding decreased year-over-year, primarily driven by declines in unsecured benchmark senior debt, FHLB borrowings and securitizations at the bank, partially offset by the issuance of customer-related debt at the non-bank entities. Sequentially, long-term debt outstanding decreased, driven primarily by decreases in FHLB borrowings at the bank and unsecured benchmark senior debt at the non-bank entities. 

As part of its liability management, Citi has considered, and may continue to consider, opportunities to redeem or repurchase its long-term debt pursuant to open market purchases, tender offers or other means. Such redemptions and repurchases help reduce Citi&#8217;s overall funding costs. During the third quarter of 2021, Citi redeemed or repurchased an aggregate of approximately $5.9 billion of its outstanding long-term debt.

Secured Funding Transactions and Short-Term Borrowings 

Citi supplements its primary sources of funding with short-term financings that generally include (i) secured funding transactions consisting of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, i.e., repos, and (ii) to a lesser extent, short-term borrowings consisting of commercial paper and borrowings from the FHLB and other market participants. 

Secured Funding Transactions 

Secured funding is primarily accessed through Citi&#8217;s broker-dealer subsidiaries to fund efficiently both (i) secured lending activity and (ii) a portion of the securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities. Citi also executes a smaller portion of its secured funding transactions through its bank entities, which are typically collateralized by government debt securities. Generally, daily changes in the level of Citi&#8217;s secured funding are primarily due to fluctuations in secured lending activity in the matched book (as described below) and securities inventory. 

Secured funding of $209 billion as of September 30, 2021 increased 1% from the prior-year period and decreased 6% sequentially. Excluding the impact of FX translation, secured funding was largely unchanged from the prior-year period and decreased 4% sequentially, driven by normal business activity. The average balance for secured funding was approximately $229 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2021. 

The portion of secured funding in the broker-dealer subsidiaries that funds secured lending is commonly referred to as &#8220;matched book&#8221; activity. The majority of this activity is secured by high-quality liquid securities such as U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities and foreign government debt securities. Other secured funding is secured by less liquid securities, including equity securities, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities, the tenor of which is generally equal to or longer than the tenor of the corresponding matched book assets. 

The remainder of the secured funding activity in the broker-dealer subsidiaries serves to fund securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities. To maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market conditions, including under periods of stress, Citi manages these activities by taking into consideration the quality of the underlying collateral and establishing minimum required funding tenors. The weighted average maturity of Citi&#8217;s secured funding of less liquid securities inventory was greater than 110 days as of September 30, 2021. 

Citi manages the risks in its secured funding by conducting daily stress tests to account for changes in capacity, tenor, haircut, collateral profile and client actions. In addition, Citi maintains counterparty diversification by establishing concentration triggers and assessing counterparty reliability and stability under stress. Citi generally sources secured funding from more than 150 counterparties. 

Short-Term Borrowings 

Citi&#8217;s short-term borrowings of $30 billion decreased 21% year-over-year, reflecting a decline in FHLB advances, and 6% sequentially, driven by a decline in FHLB advances and unsecured commercial paper, partially offset by increases in asset-backed commercial paper and structured notes (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on Citigroup&#8217;s and its affiliates&#8217; outstanding short-term borrowings). 

Credit Ratings 

While not included in the table below, the long-term and short-term ratings of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. (CGMHI) were BBB+/A-2 at Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s and A+/F1 at Fitch as of September 30, 2021.

Potential Impacts of Ratings Downgrades 

Ratings downgrades by Moody&#8217;s, Fitch or S&#38;P could negatively impact Citigroup&#8217;s and/or Citibank&#8217;s funding and liquidity due to reduced funding capacity, including derivative triggers, which could take the form of cash obligations and collateral requirements. 

The following information is provided for the purpose of analyzing the potential funding and liquidity impact to Citigroup and Citibank of a hypothetical simultaneous 

ratings downgrade across all three major rating agencies. This analysis is subject to certain estimates, estimation methodologies, judgments and uncertainties. Uncertainties include potential ratings limitations that certain entities may have with respect to permissible counterparties, as well as general subjective counterparty behavior. For example, certain corporate customers and markets counterparties could re-evaluate their business relationships with Citi and limit transactions in certain contracts or market instruments with Citi. Changes in counterparty behavior could impact Citi&#8217;s funding and liquidity, as well as the results of operations of certain of its businesses. The actual impact to Citigroup or Citibank is unpredictable and may differ materially from the potential funding and liquidity impacts described below. For additional information on the impact of credit rating changes on Citi and its applicable subsidiaries, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Liquidity Risks&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Citigroup Inc. and Citibank&#8212;Potential Derivative Triggers 

As of September 30, 2021, Citi estimates that a hypothetical one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of Citigroup Inc. across all three major rating agencies could impact Citigroup&#8217;s funding and liquidity due to derivative triggers by approximately $1.1 billion, compared to $1.0 billion as of June 30, 2021. Other funding sources, such as secured financing transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely affected. 

As of September 30, 2021, Citi estimates that a hypothetical one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of Citibank across all three major rating agencies could impact Citibank&#8217;s funding and liquidity due to derivative triggers by approximately $0.5 billion, unchanged from June 30, 2021. Other funding sources, such as secured funding transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely impacted. 

In total, as of September 30, 2021, Citi estimates that a one-notch downgrade of Citigroup and Citibank across all three major rating agencies could result in increased aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately $1.6 billion, compared to $1.4 billion as of June 30, 2021 (see also Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). As detailed under &#8220;High-Quality Liquid Assets&#8221; above, Citigroup has various liquidity resources available to its bank and non-bank entities in part as a contingency for the potential events described above. 

In addition, a broad range of mitigating actions are currently included in Citigroup&#8217;s and Citibank&#8217;s contingency funding plans. For Citigroup, these mitigating factors include, but are not limited to, accessing surplus funding capacity from existing clients, tailoring levels of secured lending and adjusting the size of select trading books and collateralized borrowings at certain Citibank subsidiaries. Mitigating actions available to Citibank include, but are not limited to, selling or financing highly liquid government securities, tailoring levels of secured lending, adjusting the size of select trading assets, reducing loan originations and renewals, raising additional deposits or borrowing from the FHLB or central banks. Citi believes these mitigating actions could substantially reduce the funding and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades described above. 

Citibank&#8212;Additional Potential Impacts 

In addition to the above derivative triggers, Citi believes that a potential downgrade of Citibank&#8217;s senior debt/long-term rating across any of the three major rating agencies could also have an adverse impact on the commercial paper/short-term rating of Citibank. As of September 30, 2021, Citibank had liquidity commitments of approximately $10.0 billion to consolidated asset-backed commercial paper conduits, compared to $9.0 billion as of June 30, 2021 (for additional information, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 

In addition to the above-referenced liquidity resources of certain Citibank entities, Citibank could reduce the funding and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades described above through mitigating actions, including repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial paper conduits. In the event of the potential downgrades described above, Citi believes that certain corporate customers could re-evaluate their deposit relationships with Citibank. This re-evaluation could result in clients&#8217; adjusting their discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository institution, which could potentially reduce certain deposit levels at Citibank. However, Citi could choose to adjust pricing, offer alternative deposit products to its existing customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers, in addition to the mitigating actions referenced above. 

MARKET RISK 

Market risk emanates from both Citi&#8217;s trading and non-trading portfolios. For additional information on market risk and market risk management at Citi, see &#8220;Market Risk&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Market Risk of Non-Trading Portfolios 

The following table sets forth the estimated impact to Citi&#8217;s net interest revenue, AOCI and the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio (on a fully implemented basis), each assuming an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 100 basis point (bps) increase in interest rates:

(1) Certain trading-oriented businesses within Citi have accrual-accounted positions that are excluded from the estimated impact to net interest revenue in the table, since these exposures are managed economically in combination with mark-to-market positions. The U.S. dollar interest rate exposure associated with these businesses was $(70) million for a 100 bps instantaneous increase in interest rates as of September 30, 2021. 

(2) Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments. 

The sequential decline in the estimated impact to Citi&#8217;s net interest revenue was driven by a decline in non-U.S. dollar exposure due to an increase in non-U.S. interest rates. 

The modest sequential decline in the estimated impact to AOCI primarily reflected a continuation of the positioning strategy of Citi Treasury&#8217;s investment securities and related interest rate derivatives portfolio. 

In the event of a parallel instantaneous 100 bps increase in interest rates, as of September 30, 2021, Citi expects that the $4.9 billion negative impact to AOCI would be offset in stockholders&#8217; equity through the expected recovery of the impact on AOCI through accretion of Citi&#8217;s investment portfolio over approximately 37 months. 

The following table sets forth the estimated impact to Citi&#8217;s net interest revenue, AOCI and the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio (on a fully implemented basis) under five different changes in interest rate scenarios for the U.S. dollar and Citi&#8217;s other currencies. The 100 bps downward rate scenarios are impacted by the low level of interest rates in several countries and the assumption that market interest rates, as well as rates paid to depositors and charged to borrowers, do not fall below zero (i.e., the &#8220;flooring assumption&#8221;). The rate scenarios are also impacted by convexity related to mortgage products.

Note: Each scenario assumes that the rate change will occur instantaneously. Changes in interest rates for maturities between the overnight rate and the 10-year rate are interpolated. 

(1) Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments. 

As shown in the table above, the magnitude of the impact to Citi&#8217;s net interest revenue and AOCI is greater under Scenario 2 as compared to Scenario 3. This is because the combination of changes to Citi&#8217;s investment portfolio, partially offset by changes related to Citi&#8217;s pension liabilities, results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at shorter- and intermediate-term maturities. 

Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates&#8212;Impacts on AOCI and Capital 

As of September 30, 2021, Citi estimates that an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar against all of the other currencies in which Citi has invested capital could reduce Citi&#8217;s tangible common equity (TCE) by approximately $1.5 billion, or 0.9%, as a result of changes to Citi&#8217;s foreign currency translation adjustment in AOCI , net of hedges. This impact would be primarily due to changes in the value of the Mexican peso, Euro and Indian rupee. 

This impact is also before any mitigating actions Citi may take, including ongoing management of its foreign currency translation exposure. Specifically, as currency movements change the value of Citi&#8217;s net investments in foreign currency-denominated capital, these movements also change the value of Citi&#8217;s risk-weighted assets denominated in those currencies. This, coupled with Citi&#8217;s foreign currency hedging strategies, such as foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency forwards and other currency hedging instruments, lessens the impact of foreign currency movements on Citi&#8217;s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio. Changes in these hedging strategies, as well as hedging costs, divestitures and tax impacts, can further affect the actual impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on Citi&#8217;s capital as compared to an unanticipated parallel shock, as described above. 

The effect of Citi&#8217;s ongoing management strategies with respect to changes in foreign exchange rates, and the impact of these changes on Citi&#8217;s TCE and Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio, are shown in the table below. For additional information on the changes in AOCI , see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(1) Interest revenue and Net interest revenue include the taxable equivalent adjustments primarily related to the tax-exempt bond portfolio and certain tax-advantaged loan programs (based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%) of $46 million, $51 million and $59 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021, June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively. 

(2) Interest expense associated with certain hybrid financial instruments, which are classified as Long-term debt and accounted for at fair value, is reported together with any changes in fair value as part of Principal transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income and is therefore not reflected in Interest expense in the table above. 

(3) The average rate on interest revenue and net interest margin reflects the taxable equivalent gross-up adjustment. See footnote 1 above.

Citi&#8217;s net interest revenue (NIR) in the third quarter of 2021 decreased 1% to $10.4 billion versus the prior-year period. As set forth in the table above, Citi&#8217;s NIR on a taxable equivalent basis also decreased 1% year-over-year, or approximately $100 million, driven by modest declines in both non- ICG Markets NIR and ICG Markets (fixed income markets and equity markets) NIR. The decrease in non- ICG Markets NIR reflected lower loan balances and the impact of lower deposit spreads. The decrease in ICG Markets NIR largely reflected a change in the mix of trading positions in support of client activity. 

Citi&#8217;s NIM was 1.93% on a taxable equivalent basis in the third quarter of 2021, an increase of 1 basis point from the prior quarter, primarily reflecting higher cards NIR in North America GCB due to higher fees and higher loans, partially offset by growth in the balance sheet due to higher deposits and a decrease in ICG Markets NIR.

Market Risk of Trading Portfolios 

Value at Risk (VAR) 

Citi believes its VAR model is conservatively calibrated to incorporate fat-tail scaling and the greater of short-term (approximately the most recent month) and long-term (three years) market volatility. As of September 30, 2021, Citi estimates that the conservative features of the VAR calibration contribute an approximate 31% add-on to what would be a VAR estimated under the assumption of stable and perfectly, normally distributed markets. As of June 30, 2021, the add-on was 35%. 

As set forth in the table below, Citi&#8217;s average trading VAR decreased quarter-over-quarter, mainly due to a reduction in interest rate short hedges as well as a general reduction in interest rate risk, both in ICG Markets businesses. Citi&#8217;s average trading and credit portfolio VAR increased quarter-over-quarter, largely driven by increased credit hedging activity.

(1) Covariance adjustment (also known as diversification benefit) equals the difference between the total VAR and the sum of the VARs tied to each risk type. The benefit reflects the fact that the risks within individual and across risk types are not perfectly correlated and, consequently, the total VAR on a given day will be lower than the sum of the VARs relating to each risk type. The determination of the primary drivers of changes to the covariance adjustment is made by an examination of the impact of both model parameter and position changes. 

(2) The total trading VAR includes mark-to-market and certain fair value option trading positions in ICG , with the exception of hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value option loans and all CVA exposures. Available-for-sale and accrual exposures are not included. 

(3) The specific risk-only component represents the level of equity and fixed income issuer-specific risk embedded in VAR. 

(4) The credit portfolio is composed of mark-to-market positions associated with non-trading business units including Citi Treasury, the CVA relating to derivative counterparties and all associated CVA hedges. FVA and DVA are not included. The credit portfolio also includes hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value option loans and hedges to the leveraged finance pipeline within capital markets origination in ICG . 

The table below provides the range of market factor VARs associated with Citi&#8217;s total trading VAR, inclusive of specific risk:

Note: No covariance adjustment can be inferred from the above table as the high and low for each market factor will be from different close-of-business dates. 

The following table provides the VAR for ICG , excluding the CVA relating to derivative counterparties, hedges of CVA, fair value option loans and hedges to the loan portfolio:

Regulatory VAR Back-testing 

In accordance with Basel III, Citi is required to perform back-testing to evaluate the effectiveness of its Regulatory VAR model. Regulatory VAR back-testing is the process in which the daily one-day VAR, at a 99% confidence interval, is compared to the buy-and-hold profit and loss (i.e., the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of the day and re-priced the following day). Buy-and-hold profit and loss represents the daily mark-to-market profit and loss attributable to price movements in covered positions from the close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue, net interest, fees and commissions, intra-day trading profit and loss and changes in reserves. 

Based on a 99% confidence level, Citi would expect two to three days in any one year where buy-and-hold losses exceed the Regulatory VAR. Given the conservative calibration of Citi&#8217;s VAR model (as a result of taking the greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-tail scaling of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer exceptions under normal and stable market conditions. Periods of unstable market conditions could increase the number of back-testing exceptions. 

As of September 30, 2021, there were no back-testing exceptions observed for Citi&#8217;s Regulatory VAR for the prior 12 months. 

STRATEGIC RISK 

For additional information regarding strategic risk, including Citi&#8217;s management of strategic risk, see &#8220;Managing Global Risk&#8212;Strategic Risk&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s First Quarter of 2021 Form 10-Q and Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Country Risk 

Top 25 Country Exposures 

The following table presents Citi&#8217;s top 25 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of September 30, 2021. (Including the U.S, the total exposure as of September 30, 2021 to the top 25 countries would represent approximately 96% of Citi&#8217;s exposure to all countries.) 

For purposes of the table, loan amounts are reflected in the country where the loan is booked, which is generally based on the domicile of the borrower. For example, a loan to a 

Chinese subsidiary of a Switzerland-based corporation will generally be categorized as a loan in China. In addition, Citi has developed regional booking centers in certain countries, most significantly in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Ireland, in order to more efficiently serve its corporate customers. As an example, with respect to the U.K., only 32% of corporate loans presented in the table below are to U.K. domiciled entities (32% for unfunded commitments), with the balance of the loans predominately to European domiciled counterparties. Approximately 84% of the total U.K. funded loans and 84% of the total U.K. unfunded commitments were investment grade as of September 30, 2021. 

Trading account assets and investment securities are generally categorized based on the domicile of the issuer of the security of the underlying reference entity. For additional information on the assets included in the table, see the footnotes to the table below.

Argentina 

Citi operates in Argentina through its ICG businesses. As of September 30, 2021, Citi&#8217;s net investment in its Argentine operations was approximately $1.3 billion. Citi uses the U.S. dollar as the functional currency for its operations in highly inflationary countries under U.S. GAAP. Citi uses Argentina&#8217;s official market exchange rate to remeasure its net Argentine peso-denominated assets into the U.S. dollar. As of September 30, 2021, the official Argentine peso exchange rate against the U.S. dollar was 98.74. 

As previously disclosed, the Central Bank of Argentina has continued to maintain certain capital and currency controls that restrict Citi&#8217;s ability to access U.S. dollars in Argentina and remit earnings from its Argentine operations. Citi&#8217;s net investment in its Argentine operations is likely to increase as Citi generates net income in its Argentine franchise and its earnings cannot be remitted. 

Due to the currency controls implemented by the Central Bank of Argentina, certain indirect foreign exchange mechanisms have developed that some Argentine entities may use to obtain U.S. dollars, generally at rates that are significantly higher than Argentina&#8217;s official exchange rate. Citibank Argentina is precluded from accessing these alternative mechanisms, and these exchange mechanisms cannot be used to remeasure Citi&#8217;s net monetary assets into the U.S. dollar under U.S. GAAP. Citi cannot predict future fluctuations in Argentina&#8217;s official market exchange rate or to what extent Citi may be able to access U.S. dollars at the official exchange rate in the future. 

Citi economically hedges the foreign currency risk in its net Argentine peso-denominated assets to the extent possible and prudent using non-deliverable forward (NDF) derivative instruments that are primarily executed outside of Argentina. As of September 30, 2021, the international NDF market had very limited liquidity, resulting in Citi being unable to economically hedge nearly all of its Argentine peso exposure. As a result, and to the extent that Citi does not execute NDF contracts for this unhedged exposure in the future, Citi would record devaluations on its net Argentine peso&#8208;denominated assets in earnings, without any benefit from a change in the fair value of derivative positions used to economically hedge the exposure. 

Citi continually evaluates its economic exposure to its Argentine counterparties and reserves for changes in credit risk and sovereign risk associated with its Argentine assets. Citi believes it has established appropriate allowances for credit losses on its Argentine loans, and appropriate fair value adjustments on Argentine assets and liabilities measured at fair value, for such risks under U.S. GAAP as of September 30, 2021. However, U.S. regulatory agencies may require Citi to record additional reserves in the future, increasing ICG &#8217;s cost of credit, based on the perceived country risk associated with its Argentine exposures. For additional information on emerging markets risks, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Strategic Risks&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES 

This section contains a summary of Citi&#8217;s most significant accounting policies. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citigroup&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K contains a summary of all of Citigroup&#8217;s significant accounting policies. These policies, as well as estimates made by management, are integral to the presentation of Citi&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. While all of these policies require a certain level of management judgment and estimates, this section highlights and discusses the significant accounting policies that require management to make highly difficult, complex or subjective judgments and estimates at times regarding matters that are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change (see also &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Operational Risks&#8221; in Citigroup&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K). Management has discussed each of these significant accounting policies, the related estimates and its judgments with the Audit Committee of the Citigroup Board of Directors. 

Valuations of Financial Instruments 

Citigroup holds debt and equity securities, derivatives, retained interests in securitizations, investments in private equity and other financial instruments. A substantial portion of these assets and liabilities is reflected at fair value on Citi&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet as Trading account assets , Available-for-sale securities and Trading account liabilities . 

Citi purchases securities under agreements to resell (reverse repos or resale agreements) and sells securities under agreements to repurchase (repos), a substantial portion of which is carried at fair value. In addition, certain loans, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and deposits, as well as certain securities borrowed and loaned positions that are collateralized with cash, are carried at fair value. Citigroup holds its investments, trading assets and liabilities, and resale and repurchase agreements on Citi&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet to meet customer needs and to manage liquidity needs, interest rate risks and private equity investing. 

When available, Citi generally uses quoted market prices to determine fair value and classifies such items within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy established under ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurement . If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed valuation models that use, where possible, current market-based or independently sourced market parameters, such as interest rates, currency rates and option volatilities. Such models are often based on a discounted cash flow analysis. In addition, items valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation. Thus, an item may be classified under the fair value hierarchy as Level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable. 

Citi is required to exercise subjective judgments relating to the applicability and functionality of internal valuation models, the significance of inputs or value drivers to the valuation of an instrument and the degree of illiquidity and subsequent lack of observability in certain markets. The fair value of these instruments is reported on Citi&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet with the changes in fair value recognized in either the Consolidated Statement of Income or in AOCI . 

Losses on available-for-sale securities whose fair values are less than the amortized cost, where Citi intends to sell the security or could more-likely-than-not be required to sell the security, are recognized in earnings. Where Citi does not intend to sell the security nor could more-likely-than-not be required to sell the security, the portion of the loss related to credit is recognized as an allowance for credit losses with a corresponding provision for credit losses and the remainder of the loss is recognized in other comprehensive income. Such losses are capped at the difference between the fair value and amortized cost of the security. 

For equity securities carried at cost or under the measurement alternative, decreases in fair value below the carrying value are recognized as impairment in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Moreover, for certain equity method investments, decreases in fair value are only recognized in earnings in the Consolidated Statement of Income if such decreases are judged to be an other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI). Adjudicating the temporary nature of fair value impairments is also inherently judgmental. 

The fair value of financial instruments incorporates the effects of Citi&#8217;s own credit risk and the market view of counterparty credit risk, the quantification of which is also complex and judgmental. For additional information on Citi&#8217;s fair value analysis, see Notes 6, 20 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(1) As of September 30, 2021, in North America GCB , Citi-branded cards ACLL/EOP loans was 8.3% and Citi retail services ACLL/EOP loans was 11.5%. 

Citi&#8217;s reserves for expected credit losses on funded loans and unfunded lending commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in the Allowance for credit losses on loans (ACLL) and Other liabilities (Allowance for credit losses on unfunded lending commitments (ACLUC)), respectively. In addition, Citi reserves for expected credit losses on other financial assets carried at amortized cost, including held-to-maturity securities, reverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowed, deposits with banks and other financial receivables. These reserves, together with the ACLL and ACLUC, are referred to as the ACL. Changes in the ACL are reflected as Provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income for each reporting period. 

The ACL is composed of quantitative and qualitative management adjustment components. The quantitative component uses a forward-looking base macroeconomic forecast. The qualitative management adjustment component reflects economic uncertainty using alternative downside macroeconomic scenarios and portfolio characteristics and current economic conditions not captured in the quantitative component, such as adjustments to reflect uncertainty around the estimated impact of the pandemic on credit losses. Both the quantitative and qualitative management adjustment components are further discussed below. 

Quantitative Component 

Citi estimates expected credit losses for its quantitative component using (i) its comprehensive internal data on loss and default history, (ii) internal credit risk ratings, (iii) external credit bureau and rating agencies information, and (iv) a reasonable and supportable forecast of macroeconomic conditions. 

For its consumer and corporate portfolios, Citi&#8217;s expected credit losses are determined primarily by utilizing models that consider the borrowers&#8217; probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD). The loss likelihood and severity models used for estimating expected credit losses are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic variables that inform the forecasts, and cover a wide range of geographic, industry, product and business segments. 

In addition, Citi&#8217;s models determine expected credit losses based on leading credit indicators, including loan delinquencies, changes in portfolio size, default frequency, risk ratings and loss recovery rates (among other things), as well as other current economic factors and credit trends, including housing prices, unemployment and gross domestic product (GDP). 

Qualitative Component 

The qualitative management adjustment component includes, among other things, management adjustments to reflect economic uncertainty based on the likelihood and severity of downside scenarios and certain portfolio characteristics not captured in the quantitative component, such as concentrations, collateral valuation, model limitations, idiosyncratic events and other factors as required by banking supervisory guidance for the ACL. The qualitative management adjustment component also reflects the uncertainty around the estimated impact of the pandemic on credit loss estimates. The ultimate extent of the pandemic&#8217;s impact on Citi&#8217;s ACL will depend on, among other things, (i) how consumers respond to the conclusion of government stimulus and assistance programs, (ii) the impact on unemployment, (iii) the timing and extent of the economic recovery, (iv) the severity and duration of any resurgence of COVID-19, (v) the rate of distribution and administration of vaccines and (vi) the extent of any market volatility. 

3Q21 Changes in the Allowance 

In the third quarter of 2021, Citi released $1.1 billion of the ACL for its consumer portfolios and $0.1 billion of the ACL for its corporate portfolios, for a total release of $1.2 billion. The release in the consumer ACL was driven primarily by continued improvements in portfolio credit quality, as well as the continued improvement in the macroeconomic outlook. The release in the corporate ACL was also driven primarily by improvements in portfolio credit quality. The overall qualitative management adjustments declined compared to the previous quarter. Based on its latest macroeconomic forecast, Citi believes its analysis of the ACL reflects the forward view of the economic environment as of September 30, 2021. 

Macroeconomic Variables 

Citi considers a multitude of macroeconomic variables for both the base and downside macroeconomic forecasts it uses to estimate the ACL, including domestic and international variables for its global portfolios and exposures. Citi&#8217;s forecasts of the U.S. unemployment rate and U.S. Real GDP growth rate represent the key macroeconomic variables that most significantly affect its estimate of the ACL. 

The tables below show Citi&#8217;s forecasted quarterly average U.S. unemployment rate and year-over-year U.S. Real GDP growth rate used in determining Citi&#8217;s ACL for each quarterly reporting period from 3Q20 to 3Q21: 

Quarterly average U.S. unemployment 4Q21 2Q22 4Q22 13-quarter average (1) 

Citi forecast at 3Q20 6.4 % 6.1 % 5.7 % 6.6 % Citi forecast at 4Q20 6.3 6.1 5.7 6.1 Citi forecast at 1Q21 4.9 4.1 3.8 4.3 Citi forecast at 2Q21 4.6 4.1 3.9 4.1 Citi forecast at 3Q21 4.5 4.1 3.9 4.0

(1) The year-over-year growth rate is the percentage change in the Real (inflation adjusted) GDP level. 

Under the base macroeconomic forecast as of 3Q21, U.S. Real GDP growth is expected to remain strong during the remainder of 2021 and in 2022, and the unemployment rate is expected to continue to improve as the U.S. moves past the peak of the pandemic-related health and economic crisis. 

Consumer 

As discussed above, Citi&#8217;s total consumer ACL release (including Corporate/Other ) of $1.1 billion in the third quarter of 2021 reduced the ACL balance to $14.7 billion, or 5.55% of total consumer loans at September 30, 2021. The release was primarily driven by the continued improvements in portfolio credit quality, as well as the continued improvement in the macroeconomic outlook. Citi&#8217;s consumer ACL is largely driven by the cards businesses. 

For cards, including Citi&#8217;s international businesses, the level of reserves relative to EOP loans decreased to 9.09% at September 30, 2021, compared to 9.72% at June 30, 2021, primarily driven by improvements in portfolio credit quality, as well as the continued improvement in the macroeconomic 

outlook. For the remaining consumer exposures, the level of reserves relative to EOP loans decreased to 1.4% at September 30, 2021, compared to 1.5% at June 30, 2021. 

Corporate 

Citi&#8217;s corporate ACLL release of $0.1 billion in the third quarter of 2021 reduced the ACLL reserve balance to $3.0 billion, or 0.77% of total funded loans, and was primarily driven by improvements in portfolio credit quality. 

The Allowance for credit losses on unfunded lending commitments (ACLUC) release of $14 million in the third quarter of 2021 decreased the total ACLUC reserve balance included in Other liabilities to $2.1 billion at September 30, 2021. 

ACLL and Non-accrual Ratios 

At September 30, 2021, the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to total funded loans was 2.69% (5.55% for consumer loans and 0.77% for corporate loans) compared to 2.88% at June 30, 2021 (5.84% for consumer loans and 0.80% for corporate loans). 

Citi&#8217;s total non-accrual loans were $4.0 billion at September 30, 2021, down $393 million from June 30, 2021. Consumer non-accrual loans decreased $217 million to $1.6 billion at September 30, 2021 from $1.8 billion at June 30, 2021, while corporate non-accrual loans decreased $176 million to $2.4 billion at September 30, 2021 from $2.6 billion at June 30, 2021. In addition, the ratio of non-accrual loans to total corporate loans was 0.60%, and 0.60% of non-accrual loans to total consumer loans, at September 30, 2021. 

Regulatory Capital Impact 

Citi has elected to phase in the CECL impact for regulatory capital purposes. The transition provisions were recently modified to defer the phase-in. After two years with no impact on capital, the CECL transition impact will phase in over a three-year transition period with 25% of the impact (net of deferred taxes) recognized on the first day of each subsequent year, commencing January 1, 2022, and will be fully implemented on January 1, 2025. In addition, 25% of the build (pretax) made in 2020 and 2021 will be deferred and amortized over the same timeframe. 

For a further description of the ACL and related accounts, see Notes 1 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

For a discussion of the adoption of the CECL accounting pronouncement, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Goodwill 

Citi tests goodwill for impairment annually as of July 1 (the annual test) and through interim assessments between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate, a decision to sell or dispose of all or a significant portion of a reporting unit or a significant decline in Citi&#8217;s stock price. 

Citi performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of July 1, 2021. The fair values of the Company&#8217;s reporting units as a percentage of their carrying values ranged from approximately 125% to 153%, resulting in no impairment. While the inherent risk related to uncertainty is embedded in the key assumptions used in the valuations, the economic and business environment continue to evolve as management progresses on its strategic refresh, including, among others, the exits of consumer businesses in 13 markets in Asia and EMEA . If management&#8217;s best estimate of future key economic and market assumptions were to differ from current assumptions, Citi could potentially experience material goodwill impairment charges in the future. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion on goodwill. 

Litigation Accruals 

See the discussion in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding Citi&#8217;s policies on establishing accruals for litigation and regulatory contingencies. 

INCOME TAXES 

Deferred Tax Assets 

For additional information on Citi&#8217;s deferred tax assets (DTAs), see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Strategic Risks,&#8221; &#8220;Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates&#8212;Income Taxes&#8221; and Notes 1 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

At September 30, 2021, Citigroup had recorded net DTAs of approximately $24.5 billion, unchanged from June 30, 2021 and a decrease of $0.3 billion from December 31, 2020. 

The table below summarizes Citi&#8217;s net DTAs balance: 

Jurisdiction/Component DTAs balance In billions of dollars September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Total U.S. $ 21.7 &#160; $ 22.2 Total foreign 2.8 &#160; 2.6 Total $ 24.5 &#160; $ 24.8 

Of Citi&#8217;s total net DTAs of $24.5 billion as of September 30, 2021, $9.2 billion was excluded from Citi&#8217;s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. Excluded from Citi&#8217;s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital as of September 30, 2021 was $10.9 billion of net DTAs arising from net operating losses, foreign tax credit (FTC) and general business credit carry-forwards, which decreased by $0.3 billion in the current quarter. The amount excluded was reduced by $1.7 billion of net DTLs, primarily associated with goodwill and certain other intangible assets, that are separately deducted from capital. Net DTAs arising from temporary differences are deducted from regulatory capital if in excess of the 10%/15% limitations (see &#8220;Capital Resources&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K). For the quarter ended September 30, 2021, Citi did not have any such DTAs. Accordingly, the remaining $15.3 billion of net DTAs as of September 30, 2021 was not deducted in calculating regulatory capital pursuant to Basel III standards and was appropriately risk weighted under those rules. 

DTA Realizability 

Citi believes that the realization of the recognized net DTAs of $24.5 billion at September 30, 2021 is more-likely-than-not based on management&#8217;s expectations as to future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the DTAs arise, as well as consideration of available tax planning strategies (as defined in ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ). 

In the third quarter of 2021, there was no change in Citi&#8217;s DTA valuation allowance (VA) requirements for foreign tax credit carry-forwards. As part of its normal planning process in the fourth quarter of 2021, Citi expects to further update its forecasts of operating income and foreign source income, which in turn could affect Citi&#8217;s valuation allowance against FTC carry-forwards. 

Effective Tax Rate 

Citi&#8217;s reported effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2021 was approximately 20%, largely unchanged from the third quarter of 2020. 

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Citi&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&#8217;s rules and forms, including without limitation that information required to be disclosed by Citi in its SEC filings is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Citi&#8217;s Disclosure Committee assists the CEO and CFO in their responsibilities to design, establish, maintain and evaluate the effectiveness of Citi&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures. The Disclosure Committee is responsible for, among other things, the oversight, maintenance and implementation of the disclosure controls and procedures, subject to the supervision and oversight of the CEO and CFO. 

Citi&#8217;s management, with the participation of its CEO and CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of Citigroup&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of September 30, 2021. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that at that date Citigroup&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO SECTION 219 OF THE IRAN THREAT REDUCTION AND SYRIA HUMAN RIGHTS ACT 

Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (Section 219), which added Section 13(r) to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Citi is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with certain individuals or entities that are the subject of sanctions under U.S. law. Disclosure is generally required even where the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law. Citi, in its related quarterly report on Form 10-Q, did not identify any reportable activities for the first quarter of 2021. Citi identified and reported certain activities pursuant to Section 219 for the second quarter of 2021. Citi did not identify any reportable activities pursuant to Section 219 for the third quarter of 2021. 

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 

Securities and Commodities Regulation&#8212;Swap Dealer/ Security-Based Swap Dealer Requirements 

Rules of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) govern the registration and regulation of swap dealers. As previously disclosed, several Citigroup subsidiaries, including Citibank, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (CGMI), Citigroup Global Markets Limited (CGML), Citigroup Global Markets Europe (CGME) and Citigroup Energy Inc., are registered with the CFTC as swap dealers. On July 22, 2020, the CFTC adopted final rules establishing capital and financial reporting requirements for swap dealers that took effect in October 2021. 

In addition, the SEC has adopted rules governing the registration and regulation of security-based swap dealers. The regulations include requirements related to (i) capital, margin and segregation, (ii) record-keeping, reporting and notification and (iii) risk management practices for uncleared security-based swaps and the cross-border application of certain security-based swap requirements. These requirements also took effect in October 2021. 

For additional information about supervision and regulation applicable to Citi, see &#8220;Supervision, Regulation and Other&#8212;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

&#8226; the potential outcomes of the extensive legal and regulatory proceedings, examinations, investigations, consent orders and related compliance efforts and other inquiries, to which Citi is or may be subject at any given time, such as the previously disclosed October 2020 FRB and OCC consent orders, particularly given the increased focus by regulators on risks and controls, such as risk management, compliance, data quality management and governance and internal controls, and policies and procedures; as well as the transformative efforts to remediate deficiencies on a timely and sufficient basis and increased expenses for such remediation efforts, together with the heightened scrutiny and expectations generally from regulators, and the severity of the remedies sought by regulators, such as civil money penalties, supervisory or enforcement orders, business restrictions, limitations on dividends and changes to directors and/or officers, and potential collateral consequences to Citi arising from such outcomes. 

Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of Citigroup speak only as to the date they are made, and Citi does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the forward-looking statements were made.

See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citigroup&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of all of Citigroup&#8217;s significant accounting policies. 

ACCOUNTING CHANGES 

Accounting for Financial Instruments &#8212; Credit Losses 

Overview 

In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments &#8212; Credit Losses (Topic 326). The ASU introduced a new credit loss methodology, the current expected credit losses (CECL) methodology, which requires earlier recognition of credit losses while also providing additional disclosure about credit risk. Citi adopted the ASU as of January 1, 2020, which, as discussed below, resulted in an increase in Citi&#8217;s Allowance for credit losses and a decrease to opening Retained earnings , net of deferred income taxes, at January 1, 2020. 

The CECL methodology utilizes a lifetime &#8220;expected credit loss&#8221; measurement objective for the recognition of credit losses for loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, receivables and other financial assets measured at amortized cost at the time the financial asset is originated or acquired. The ACL is adjusted each period for changes in lifetime expected credit losses. The CECL methodology represents a significant change from prior U.S. GAAP and replaced the prior multiple existing impairment methods, which generally required that a loss be incurred before it was recognized. Within the life cycle of a loan or other financial asset, the methodology generally results in an earlier recognition of the provision for credit losses and the related ACL than prior U.S. GAAP. For available-for-sale debt securities where fair value is less than cost that Citi intends to hold or more-likely-than-not will not be required to sell, credit-related impairment, if any, is recognized through an ACL and adjusted each period for changes in credit risk. 

January 1, 2020 CECL Transition (Day 1) Impact 

The CECL methodology&#8217;s impact on expected credit losses, among other things, reflects Citi&#8217;s view of the current state of the economy, forecasted macroeconomic conditions and quality of Citi&#8217;s portfolios. At the January 1, 2020 date of adoption, based on forecasts of macroeconomic conditions and exposures at that time, the aggregate impact to Citi was an approximate $ 4.1 billion, or an approximate 29 %, pretax increase in the Allowance for credit losses , along with a $ 3.1 billion after-tax decrease in Retained earnings and a deferred tax asset increase of $ 1.0 billion. This transition impact reflects (i) a $ 4.9 billion build to the Allowance for credit losses for Citi&#8217;s consumer exposures, primarily driven by the impact on credit card receivables of longer estimated tenors under the CECL lifetime expected credit loss methodology (loss coverage of approximately 23 months) compared to shorter estimated tenors under the probable loss methodology under prior U.S. GAAP (loss coverage of approximately 14 months), net of recoveries; and (ii) a release of $ 0.8 billion of reserves primarily related to Citi&#8217;s corporate net loan loss exposures, largely due to more precise contractual maturities that result in shorter remaining tenors, incorporation of recoveries and use of more specific historical loss data based 

on an increase in portfolio segmentation across industries and geographies. 

Under the CECL methodology, the Allowance for credit losses consists of quantitative and qualitative components. Citi&#8217;s quantitative component of the Allowance for credit losses is model based and utilizes a single forward-looking macroeconomic forecast and discounts inputs for the corporate classifiably managed portfolios, complemented by the qualitative component described below, in estimating expected credit losses and discounts inputs for the corporate classifiably managed portfolios. Reasonable and supportable forecast periods vary by product. For example, Citi&#8217;s consumer models use a 13-quarter reasonable and supportable period and revert to historical loss experience thereafter, while its corporate loan models use a nine-quarter reasonable and supportable period followed by a three-quarter graduated transition to historical loss experience. 

The qualitative management adjustment component includes, among other things, management adjustments to reflect economic uncertainty based on the likelihood and severity of downside scenarios and certain portfolio characteristics not captured in the quantitative component, such as concentrations, collateral coverage, model limitations, idiosyncratic events and other factors as required by banking supervisory guidance for the ACL. The qualitative management adjustment component also includes management adjustments to reflect the uncertainty around the estimated impact of the pandemic on credit loss estimates. 

Accounting for Variable Post-Charge-Off Third-Party Collection Costs 

In the fourth quarter of 2020, Citi revised the 2020 second quarter accounting conclusion for its variable post-charge-off third-party collection costs from a &#8220;change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle&#8221; to a &#8220;change in accounting principle,&#8221; which required an adjustment to January 1, 2020 opening retained earnings, rather than 2020 net income. As a result, Citi&#8217;s full-year and quarterly results for 2020 were revised to reflect this change as if it were effective as of January 1, 2020, as follows: 

&#8226; An increase to beginning retained earnings on January 1, 2020 of $ 330 million and a decrease of $ 443 million in the allowance for credit losses on loans, as well as a $ 113 million decrease in other assets related to income taxes. 

&#8226; A decrease of $ 18 million to provisions for credit losses on loans in the first quarter and increases of $ 339 million and $ 122 million to provisions for credit losses on loans in the second and third quarters, respectively. 

&#8226; Increases in operating expenses of $ 49 million and $ 45 million with a corresponding decrease in net credit losses, in the first and second quarters, respectively. 

In making these revisions, Citi considered the guidance in ASC Topic 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections ; ASC Topic 270, Interim Reporting ; ASC Topic 250-S99-1, Assessing Materiality ; and ASC Topic 250-S99-23, Accounting Changes Not Retroactively Applied Due to Immateriality, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements . Citi believes that the effects of the revisions were not material to any previously reported quarterly or annual period. 

Reference Rate Reform 

In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting , which provides optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. Specifically, the guidance permits an entity, when certain criteria are met, to consider amendments to contracts made to comply with reference rate reform to meet the definition of a modification under U.S. GAAP. It further allows hedge accounting to be maintained and permits a one-time transfer or sale of qualifying held-to-maturity securities. The expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments are permitted to be adopted any time through December 31, 2022 and do not apply to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022, except for certain optional expedients elected for certain hedging relationships existing as of December 31, 2022. The ASU was adopted by Citi as of June 30, 2020 with prospective application and did not impact financial results in 2020. 

In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope , which clarifies that the scope of the initial accounting relief issued by the FASB in March 2020 includes derivative instruments that do not reference a rate that is expected to be discontinued but that use an interest rate for margining, discounting or contract price alignment that is modified as a result of reference rate reform (commonly referred to as the &#8220;discounting transition&#8221;). The amendments do not apply to contract modifications made after December 31, 2022, new hedging relationships entered into after December 31, 2022 and existing hedging relationships evaluated for effectiveness in periods after December 31, 2022, except for hedging relationships existing as of December 31, 2022, that apply certain optional expedients in which the accounting effects are recorded through the end of the hedging relationship. The ASU was adopted by Citi on a full retrospective basis upon issuance and did not impact financial results in 2020. 

FUTURE ACCOUNTING CHANGES 

Long-Duration Insurance Contracts 

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-12, Financial Services&#8212;Insurance: Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts , which changes the existing recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosures for long-duration contracts issued by an insurance entity. Specifically, the guidance (i) improves the timeliness of recognizing changes in the liability for future policy benefits and prescribes the rate used to discount future cash flows for long-duration insurance contracts, (ii) simplifies and improves the accounting for certain market-based options or guarantees associated with deposit (or account balance) contracts, (iii) simplifies the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and (iv) introduces additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures. Citi has certain insurance subsidiaries, primarily in Mexico, that issue long-duration insurance contracts such as traditional life insurance policies and life-contingent annuity contracts that will be impacted by the requirements of ASU 2018-12. 

The effective date of ASU 2018-12 was deferred for all insurance entities by ASU 2019-09, Financial Services&#8212;Insurance: Effective Date (issued in October 2019) and by ASU 2020-11, Financial Services&#8212;Insurance: Effective Date and Early Application (issued in November 2020). Citi plans to adopt the targeted improvements in ASU 2018-12 on January 1, 2023 and is currently evaluating the impact of the standard on its insurance subsidiaries. Citi does not expect a material impact to its results of operations as a result of adopting the standard. 

2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, SIGNIFICANT DISPOSALS AND OTHER BUSINESS EXITS 

Discontinued Operations 

The Company&#8217;s results from Discontinued operations consisted of residual activities related to previously divested operations. All Discontinued operations results are recorded within Corporate/Other . 

The following table summarizes financial information for all Discontinued operations : 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, In millions of dollars 2021 2020 2021 2020 Total revenues, net of interest expense $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160;

(1) Amounts in each period relate to the sale of the Egg Banking business in 2011. 

Cash flows from Discontinued operations were not material for the periods presented. 

Significant Disposals 

The following transactions were identified as significant disposals that are recorded within the Global Consumer Banking segment, including the assets and liabilities that were reclassified to held-for-sale within Other assets and Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the Income (loss) before taxes (benefits) related to each business. 

Agreement to Sell Australia Consumer Banking Business 

On August 9, 2021, Citi entered into an agreement to sell its Australia consumer banking business. The sale, which is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, is expected to close in the first half of 2022. As of the third quarter of 2021, Citi reported the business as held-for-sale, resulting in a pretax loss on sale of approximately $ 680 million recorded in Other revenue ($ 580 million after-tax), subject to closing adjustments. The loss on sale primarily reflects the impact of a pretax $ 625 million currency translation adjustment (CTA) loss (net of hedges) ($ 475 million after-tax) already reflected in the Accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) component of equity. Upon closing, the CTA-related balance would be removed from the AOCI component of equity, resulting in a neutral CTA impact to Citi&#8217;s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. 

Income before taxes, excluding the pretax loss on sale, for the Australia consumer banking business is as follows: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, In millions of dollars 2021 2020 2021 2020 Income before taxes $ 95 &#160; $ 78 &#160; $ 236 &#160; $ 153 &#160; 

The following are assets and liabilities for the Australia consumer banking business, which were identified and reclassified to held-for-sale within Other assets and Other liabilities , respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2021: 

In millions of dollars September 30, 2021 Assets Cash and deposits with banks $ 21 &#160; 

Loans (net of allowance of $ 249 million at September 30, 2021) 

8,291 &#160; Goodwill and intangible assets 257 &#160; Other assets 85 &#160; Total assets $ 8,654 &#160; Liabilities Deposits $ 6,912 &#160; Long-term debt 521 &#160; Other liabilities 143 &#160; Total liabilities $ 7,576 &#160; 

Citi did not have any other significant disposals to report as of September 30, 2021. As of November 8, 2021, Citi had not entered into any other definitive sales agreements related to its recently announced intention to pursue exits of its consumer franchises in 13 markets across Asia and EMEA . 

For a description of the Company&#8217;s significant disposal transactions in prior periods and financial impact, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Other Business Exits 

Wind-Down of Korea Consumer Banking Business 

On October 25, 2021, Citi announced its decision to wind down and close its Korea consumer banking business. In connection with the announcement, Citibank Korea Inc. (CKI) has commenced a voluntary termination program. Due to the voluntary nature of this termination program, no liabilities for termination benefits are recorded until CKI makes formal offers to employees that are then irrevocably accepted by the employees. Citi expects to incur total estimated cash charges ranging from approximately $ 1.2 billion to $ 1.5 billion, related to voluntary termination benefits and related costs. Citi does not expect to recognize these charges all at once, but over time through the remainder of 2021 and 2022, as voluntary retirements are phased and irrevocably accepted in order to minimize business and operational impacts. 

3. BUSINESS SEGMENTS 

Citigroup&#8217;s activities are conducted through two business segments: Global Consumer Banking ( GCB ) and Institutional Clients Group ( ICG ), with the remaining operations in Corporate/Other , which includes activities not assigned to a specific business segment as well as certain North America legacy loan portfolios, discontinued operations and other legacy assets. 

Beginning in the first quarter of 2021, Citi changed its allocation for certain recurring expenses that are attributable to the business segments from Corporate/Other to GCB and ICG . These expenses include incremental investments related to risks and controls, technology capabilities and information security initiatives, as well as some incremental spend related to the pandemic. The prior-period reportable operating segment results have been revised to conform the presentation for all periods to reflect this revised allocation methodology. Citi&#8217;s consolidated results were unchanged for all periods presented as a result of the changes discussed above. 

For additional information regarding Citigroup&#8217;s business segments, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(1) Citi&#8217;s consumer credit card programs have certain partner-sharing agreements that vary by partner. These agreements are subject to contractually based performance thresholds that, if met, would require Citi to make ongoing payments to the partner. The threshold is based on the profitability of a program and is generally calculated based on predefined program revenues less predefined program expenses. In most of Citi&#8217;s partner-sharing agreements, program expenses include net credit losses and, to the extent that the increase in net credit losses reduces Citi&#8217;s liability for the partners&#8217; share for a given program year, would generally result in lower payments to partners in total for that year and vice versa. Further, in some instances, other partner payments are based on program sales and new account acquisitions. 

(2) Includes overdraft fees of $ 28 million and $ 23 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $ 75 million and $ 74 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Overdraft fees are accounted for under ASC 310. 

(3) Consists primarily of fees earned from structuring and underwriting loan syndications or related financing activity. This activity is accounted for under ASC 310. 

(4) Commissions and fees include $( 2,208 ) million and $( 1,816 ) million not accounted for under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $( 6,031 ) million and $( 5,044 ) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Amounts reported in Commissions and fees accounted for under other guidance primarily include card-related loan fees, card reward programs and certain partner payments, corporate finance fees, insurance premiums and loan servicing fees.

6. PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS 

Principal transactions revenue consists of realized and unrealized gains and losses from trading activities. Trading activities include revenues from fixed income, equities, credit and commodities products and foreign exchange transactions that are managed on a portfolio basis and characterized below based on the primary risk managed by each trading desk. Not included in the table below is the impact of net interest revenue related to trading activities, which is an integral part of trading activities&#8217; profitability. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about net interest revenue related to trading activities. Principal transactions include CVA (credit valuation adjustments) and FVA (funding valuation adjustments) on over-the-counter derivatives, and gains (losses) on certain economic hedges on loans in ICG . These adjustments are discussed further in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

In certain transactions, Citi incurs fees and presents these fees paid to third parties in operating expenses.

In these transactions, the Company recognizes the securities received at fair value within Other assets and the obligation to return those securities as a liability within Brokerage payables . 

(2) See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 

It is the Company&#8217;s policy to take possession of the underlying collateral, monitor its market value relative to the amounts due under the agreements and, when necessary, require prompt transfer of additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection. For resale and repurchase agreements, when necessary, the Company posts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection. 

A substantial portion of the resale and repurchase agreements is recorded at fair value, as described in Notes 20 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The remaining portion is carried at the amount of cash initially advanced or received, plus accrued interest, as specified in the respective agreements. 

A substantial portion of securities borrowing and lending agreements is recorded at the amount of cash advanced or received. The remaining portion is recorded at fair value as the Company elected the fair value option for certain securities borrowed and loaned portfolios, as described in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. With respect to securities loaned, the Company receives cash collateral in an amount generally in excess of the market value of the securities loaned. The Company monitors the market value of securities borrowed and securities loaned on a daily basis and posts or obtains additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection. 

The following tables present the gross and net resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending 

agreements and the related offsetting amounts permitted under ASC 210-20-45. The tables also include amounts related to financial instruments that are not permitted to be offset under ASC 210-20-45, but would be eligible for offsetting to the extent that an event of default has occurred and a legal opinion supporting enforceability of the offsetting rights has been obtained.

Evaluating Investments for Impairment 

AFS Debt Securities 

Overview&#8212;AFS Debt Securities 

The Company conducts periodic reviews of all AFS debt securities with unrealized losses to evaluate whether the impairment resulted from expected credit losses or from other factors and to evaluate the Company&#8217;s intent to sell such securities. 

An AFS debt security is impaired when the current fair value of an individual AFS debt security is less than its amortized cost basis. 

The Company recognizes the entire difference between amortized cost basis and fair value in earnings for impaired AFS debt securities that Citi has an intent to sell or for which Citi believes it will more-likely-than-not be required to sell prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis. However, for those AFS debt securities that the Company does not intend to sell and is not likely to be required to sell, only the credit-related impairment is recognized in earnings by recording an allowance for credit losses. Any remaining fair value decline for such securities is recorded in AOCI . The Company does not consider the length of time that the fair value of a security is below its amortized cost when determining if a credit loss exists. 

For AFS debt securities, credit losses exist where Citi does not expect to receive contractual principal and interest cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of a security. The allowance for credit losses is limited to the amount by which the AFS debt security&#8217;s amortized cost basis exceeds its fair value. The allowance is increased or decreased if credit conditions subsequently worsen or improve. Reversals of credit losses are recognized in earnings. 

The Company&#8217;s review for impairment of AFS debt securities generally entails: 

&#8226; identification and evaluation of impaired investments; 

&#8226; consideration of evidential matter, including an evaluation of factors or triggers that could cause individual positions to qualify as credit impaired and those that would not support credit impairment; and 

&#8226; documentation of the results of these analyses, as required under Citi&#8217;s policies. 

The sections below describe the Company&#8217;s process for identifying expected credit impairments for debt security types that have the most significant unrealized losses as of September 30, 2021. 

Mortgage-Backed Securities 

Citi records no allowances for credit losses on U.S. government-agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities, because the Company expects to incur no credit losses in the event of default due to a history of incurring no credit losses and due to the nature of the counterparties. 

State and Municipal Securities 

The process for estimating credit losses in Citigroup&#8217;s AFS state and municipal bonds is primarily based on a credit analysis that incorporates third-party credit ratings. Citi monitors the bond issuers and any insurers providing default protection in the form of financial guarantee insurance. The average external credit rating, ignoring any insurance, is Aa2/AA. In the event of an external rating downgrade or other indicator of credit impairment (i.e., based on instrument-specific estimates of cash flows or probability of issuer default), the subject bond is specifically reviewed for adverse changes in the amount or timing of expected contractual principal and interest payments. 

For AFS state and municipal bonds with unrealized losses that Citi plans to sell or would more-likely-than-not be required to sell, the full impairment is recognized in earnings. For AFS state and municipal bonds where Citi has no intent to sell and it is more-likely-than-not that the Company will not be required to sell, Citi records an allowance for expected credit losses for the amount it expects not to collect, capped at the difference between the bond&#8217;s amortized cost basis and fair value. 

Equity Method Investments 

Management assesses equity method investments that have fair values that are less than their respective carrying values for other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI). Fair value is measured as price multiplied by quantity if the investee has publicly listed securities. If the investee is not publicly listed, other methods are used (see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 

For impaired equity method investments that Citi plans to sell prior to recovery of value or would more-likely-than-not be required to sell, with no expectation that the fair value will recover prior to the expected sale date, the full impairment is recognized as OTTI in Other revenue regardless of severity and duration. The measurement of the OTTI does not include partial projected recoveries subsequent to the balance sheet date. 

For impaired equity method investments that management does not plan to sell and is not more-likely-than-not to be required to sell prior to recovery of value, the evaluation of whether an impairment is other-than-temporary is based on (i) whether and when an equity method investment will recover in value and (ii) whether the investor has the intent and ability to hold that investment for a period of time sufficient to recover the value. The determination of whether the impairment is considered other-than-temporary considers the following indicators: 

&#8226; the cause of the impairment and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including any specific events that may influence the operations of the issuer; 

&#8226; the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value; and 

&#8226; the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the carrying value.

Non-Marketable Equity Securities Not Carried at Fair Value 

Non-marketable equity securities are required to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings unless (i) the measurement alternative is elected or (ii) the investment represents Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank stock or certain exchange seats that continue to be carried at cost. 

The election to measure a non-marketable equity security using the measurement alternative is made on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Under the measurement alternative, an equity security is carried at cost plus or minus changes resulting from observable prices in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The carrying value of the equity security is adjusted to fair value on the date of an observed transaction. Fair value may differ from the observed transaction price due to a number of factors, including marketability adjustments and differences in rights and obligations when the observed transaction is not for the identical investment held by Citi. 

Equity securities under the measurement alternative are also assessed for impairment. On a quarterly basis, management qualitatively assesses whether each equity security under the measurement alternative is impaired. Impairment indicators that are considered include, but are not limited to, the following: 

&#8226; a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality or business prospects of the investee; 

&#8226; a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic or technological environment of the investee; 

&#8226; a significant adverse change in the general market condition of either the geographical area or the industry in which the investee operates; 

&#8226; a bona fide offer to purchase, an offer by the investee to sell or a completed auction process for the same or similar investment for an amount less than the carrying amount of that investment; and 

&#8226; factors that raise significant concerns about the investee&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern, such as negative cash flows from operations, working capital deficiencies or noncompliance with statutory capital requirements or debt covenants. 

When the qualitative assessment indicates that impairment exists, the investment is written down to fair value, with the full difference between the fair value of the investment and its carrying amount recognized in earnings. 

Below is the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities measured using the measurement alternative at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020: 

In millions of dollars September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Measurement alternative: Carrying value $ 1,392 &#160; $ 962 &#160;

A similar impairment analysis is performed for non-marketable equity securities carried at cost. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, there was no impairment loss recognized in earnings for non-marketable equity securities carried at cost. 

Investments in Alternative Investment Funds That Calculate Net Asset Value 

The Company holds investments in certain alternative investment funds that calculate net asset value (NAV), or its equivalent, including private equity funds, funds of funds and real estate funds, as provided by third-party asset managers. Investments in such funds are generally classified as non-marketable equity securities carried at fair value. The fair values of these investments are estimated using the NAV of the Company&#8217;s ownership interest in the funds. Some of these investments are in &#8220;covered funds&#8221; for purposes of the Volcker Rule, which prohibits certain proprietary investment activities and limits the ownership of, and relationships with, covered funds. On April 21, 2017, Citi&#8217;s request for extension of the permitted holding period under the Volcker Rule for certain of its investments in illiquid funds was approved, allowing the Company to hold such investments until the earlier of five years from the July 21, 2017 expiration date of the general conformance period or the date such investments mature or are otherwise conformed with the Volcker Rule.

(1) Private equity funds include funds that invest in infrastructure, emerging markets and venture capital. 

(2) With respect to the Company&#8217;s investments in private equity funds and real estate funds, distributions from each fund will be received as the underlying assets held by these funds are liquidated. It is estimated that the underlying assets of these funds will be liquidated over a period of several years as market conditions allow. Private equity and real estate funds do not allow redemption of investments by their investors. Investors are permitted to sell or transfer their investments, subject to the approval of the general partner or investment manager of these funds, which generally may not be unreasonably withheld. 

(3) Includes several real estate funds that invest primarily in commercial real estate in the U.S., Europe and Asia.

(1) The above tables do not include loan modifications that meet the TDR relief criteria in the CARES Act or the interagency guidance. 

(2) TDRs involving changes in the amount or timing of principal payments may involve principal forgiveness or deferral of periodic and/or final principal payments. Because forgiveness of principal is rare for corporate loans, modifications typically have little to no impact on the loans&#8217; projected cash flows and thus little to no impact on the allowance established for the loans. Charge-offs for amounts deemed uncollectible may be recorded at the time of the restructuring or may have already been recorded in prior periods such that no charge-off is required at the time of the modification. 

(3) TDRs involving changes in the amount or timing of interest payments may involve a below-market interest rate. 

The following table presents total corporate loans modified in a TDR as well as those TDRs that defaulted and for which the payment default occurred within one year of a permanent modification. Default is defined as 60 days past due, except for classifiably managed commercial banking loans, where default is defined as 90 days past due.
