MANAGING GLOBAL RISK

For Citi, effective risk management is of primary importance 
to its overall operations. Accordingly, Citi’s risk management 
process has been designed to monitor, evaluate and manage 
the principal risks it assumes in conducting its activities. 
Specifically, the activities that Citi engages in, and the risks 
those activities generate, must be consistent with Citi’s 
mission, value proposition, key guiding principles and risk 
appetite. For more information on Citi’s management of 
global risk, see “Managing Global Risk” in Citi’s 2020 Annual 
Report on Form 10-K. As discussed above, Citi is continuing 
its efforts to comply with the Federal Reserve Board and OCC 
consent orders, relating principally to various aspects of risk 
management, compliance, data quality management and 
governance, and internal controls. See “Citi’s Consent Order 
Compliance” above and in Citi’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 
10-K..

including delinquency and net credit loss rates, see “Credit 
Card Trends” below).

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 

North America GCB as of the first quarter of 2021 increased 
quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by seasonality in both 
cards portfolios, and decreased year-over-year, primarily 
driven by the continued impacts of government stimulus, 
unemployment benefits and consumer relief programs.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate in North America 

GCB decreased quarter-over-quarter, reflecting higher 
payment rates driven by government stimulus. Year-over-year, 
the decrease in the 90+ days past due delinquency rate was 
driven by the continued impacts of government stimulus, 
unemployment benefits and consumer relief programs.

Latin America GCB

Latin America GCB operates in Mexico through 
Citibanamex, one of Mexico’s largest banks, and provides 
credit cards, consumer mortgages and small business and 
personal loans. Latin America GCB serves a more mass-
market segment in Mexico and focuses on developing 
multiproduct relationships with customers.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 
Latin America GCB as of the first quarter of 2021 increased 
significantly quarter-over quarter and year-over-year, driven 
by a majority of customers exiting consumer relief programs 
at the end of the third quarter of 2020 as well as the continued 
adverse pandemic-related macroeconomic impacts.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased year-
over-year, primarily due to the continued adverse pandemic-
related macroeconomic impacts, including lower loan 
balances. The 90+ days past due delinquency rate decreased 
quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to the charge-off of most 
of the spike in delinquent balances from the fourth quarter of 
2020 related to customers exiting consumer relief programs.

Overall Consumer Credit Trends

Global Consumer Banking

As shown in the chart above, GCB’s net credit loss rate and 
the 90+ days past due delinquency rate decreased year-over-
year as of the first quarter of 2021, driven by North America 
GCB, primarily reflecting the benefit of significant 
government stimulus and assistance, and lower customer 
spending. 

Quarter-over-quarter, GCB’s net credit loss rate increased 
and its 90+ days past due rate decreased, driven by Asia GCB 
and Latin America GCB, as Citi charged off most of the spike 
in delinquencies from the fourth quarter of 2020 related to 
customer accounts exiting consumer relief programs, as well 
as the seasonality observed in North America GCB’s net credit 
loss rate. 

For additional information on consumer credit trends, see 

“Managing Global Risk—Credit Risk—Overall Consumer 
Credit Trends” in Citi’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

North America GCB

North America GCB provides mortgage, home equity, 
small business and personal loans through Citi’s retail banking 
network and card products through Citi-branded cards and Citi 
retail services businesses. The retail bank is concentrated in 
six major metropolitan cities in the U.S. (for additional 
information on the U.S. retail bank, see “North America GCB” 
above).

As of March 31, 2021, approximately 70% of North 
America GCB consumer loans consisted of Citi-branded and 
Citi retail services cards, which generally drives the overall 
credit performance of North America GCB (for additional

Credit Card Trends

Global Cards

(1) Asia includes GCB activities in certain EMEA countries for all periods 

presented.

Asia GCB operates in 17 countries and jurisdictions in 

Asia and EMEA and provides credit cards, consumer 
mortgages and small business and personal loans.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 
Asia GCB as of the first quarter of 2021 increased quarter-
over-quarter and year-over-year, driven by customers exiting 
consumer relief programs in certain countries, as well as the 
continued adverse pandemic-related macroeconomic impacts 
in the region.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate was largely 
unchanged year-over-year. Quarter-over-quarter, the 90+ days 
past due delinquency rate decreased due to the charge-off of 
most of the spike in delinquent balances from the fourth 
quarter of 2020 related to customers exiting consumer relief 
programs in 2020.

The performance of Asia GCB’s portfolios continues to 
reflect the strong credit profiles in the region’s target customer 
segments. Regulatory changes in many markets in Asia over 
the past few years have also resulted in improved credit 
quality.

For additional information on cost of credit, loan 
delinquency and other information for Citi’s consumer loan 
portfolios, see each respective business’s results of operations 
above and Notes 13 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial

North America GCB’s Citi-branded cards portfolio issues 

proprietary and co-branded cards. 

 As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 
Citi-branded cards as of the first quarter of 2021 increased 
quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by seasonality, and 
decreased year-over-year, primarily reflecting the benefit of 
significant government stimulus, unemployment benefits and 
consumer relief programs.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate decreased 
quarter-over-quarter, reflecting higher payment rates due to 
government stimulus. Year-over-year, the 90+ days past due

add partners within target industries that have strong loyalty, 
lending or payment programs and growth potential.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in Citi 

retail services as of the first quarter of 2021 increased quarter-
over-quarter, primarily due to seasonality, and decreased year-
over-year, primarily reflecting the benefit of significant 
government stimulus, unemployment benefits and consumer 
relief programs.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate was largely

(1) Loans modified under Citi’s consumer relief programs continue to be reported in the same delinquency bucket they were in at the time of modification (which 

have various durations, and certain of which may be renewed by the customer). Consumer relief programs in Asia and Mexico largely expired during the fourth 
quarter of 2020. 

(2) End-of-period (EOP) loans include interest and fees on credit cards.
(3) The ratios of 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due are calculated based on EOP loans, net of unearned income.
(4) The 90+ days past due balances for North America—Citi-branded and North America—Citi retail services are generally still accruing interest. Citigroup’s policy 

is generally to accrue interest on credit card loans until 180 days past due, unless notification of bankruptcy filing has been received earlier.

(5) The 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios for North America GCB exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are guaranteed by U.S. government-
sponsored agencies since the potential loss predominantly resides with the U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past 
due and (EOP loans) were $176 million ($0.7 billion), $171 million ($0.7 billion) and $124 million ($0.5 billion) as of March 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and 
March 31, 2020, respectively. The amounts excluded for loans 30–89 days past due and (EOP loans) were $84 million ($0.7 billion), $98 million ($0.7 billion) and 
$64 million ($0.5 billion) as of March 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2020, respectively. 

(6) Asia includes delinquencies and loans in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.
(7) The loans 90+ days past due and related ratios exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies since the potential loss 

predominantly resides with the U.S. agencies. The amounts excluded for 90+ days past due and (EOP loans) for each period were $169 million ($0.4 billion), $183

The maintenance of accurate and consistent risk ratings 
across the corporate credit portfolio facilitates the comparison 
of credit exposure across all lines of business, geographic 
regions and products. Counterparty risk ratings reflect an 
estimated probability of default for a counterparty and are 
derived by leveraging validated statistical models, scorecard 
models and external agency ratings (under defined 
circumstances), in combination with consideration of factors 
specific to the obligor or market, such as management 
experience, competitive position, regulatory environment and 
commodity prices. Facility risk ratings are assigned that reflect 
the probability of default of the obligor and factors that affect 
the loss given default of the facility, such as support or 
collateral. Internal obligor ratings that generally correspond to 
BBB and above are considered investment grade, while those 
below are considered non-investment grade.

The following table presents the corporate credit portfolio 

(excluding the delinquency-managed private bank portfolio) 
by facility risk rating as a percentage of the total corporate 
credit portfolio:

Note: Total exposure includes direct outstandings and unfunded lending 
commitments. 

In addition to the obligor and facility risk ratings assigned 

to all exposures, Citi may classify exposures in the corporate 
credit portfolio. These classifications are consistent with Citi’s 
interpretation of the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of 
criticized exposures, which may categorize exposures as 
special mention, substandard, doubtful, or loss.

Risk ratings and classifications are reviewed regularly, 

and adjusted as appropriate. The credit review process 
incorporates quantitative and qualitative factors, including 
financial and non-financial disclosures or metrics, 
idiosyncratic events or changes to the competitive, regulatory 
or macroeconomic environment. This includes but is not 
limited to exposures in those sectors significantly impacted by 
the pandemic (including consumer retail, commercial real 
estate and transportation). 

Citigroup believes the corporate credit portfolio to be 
appropriately rated and classified as of March 31, 2021. Since 
the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Citigroup has taken 
action to adjust internal ratings and classifications of 
exposures as both the macroeconomic environment and 
obligor-specific factors have changed, particularly where 
additional stress has been seen. 

As obligor risk ratings are downgraded, the probability of 

default increases. Downgrades of obligor risk ratings tend to 
result in a higher provision for credit losses. In addition, 

  
 
 
 
 
downgrades may result in the purchase of additional credit 
derivatives or other risk mitigants to hedge the incremental 
credit risk, or may result in Citi’s seeking to reduce exposure 
to an obligor or an industry sector. Citi will continue to review 
exposures to ensure that the appropriate probability of default 
is incorporated into all risk assessments.

For additional information on Citi’s corporate credit 

portfolio, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.

Credit Risk Mitigation
As part of its overall risk management activities, Citigroup 
uses credit derivatives and other risk mitigants to hedge 
portions of the credit risk in its corporate credit portfolio, in 
addition to outright asset sales. Citi may enter into partial-term 
hedges as well as full-term hedges. In advance of the 
expiration of partial-term hedges, Citi will determine, among 
other factors, the economic feasibility of hedging the 
remaining life of the instrument. The results of the mark-to-
market and any realized gains or losses on credit derivatives 
are reflected primarily in Principal transactions in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income.

At March 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and March 31, 

2020, ICG (excluding the delinquency-managed private bank 
portfolio) had economic hedges on the corporate credit 
portfolio of $38.8 billion, $38.8 billion and $33.0 billion, 
respectively. Citigroup’s expected credit loss model used in 
the calculation of its ACL does not include the favorable 
impact of credit derivatives and other mitigants that are 
marked to market. In addition, the reported amounts of direct 
outstandings and unfunded lending commitments in the tables 
above do not reflect the impact of these hedging transactions. 
The credit protection was economically hedging underlying 
ICG (excluding the delinquency-managed private bank 
portfolio) corporate credit portfolio exposures with the 
following risk rating distribution:

(1) North America includes the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Mexico is included in offices outside North America. The classification of corporate loans between 

offices in North America and outside North America is based on the domicile of the booking unit. The difference between the domicile of the booking unit and the 
domicile of the managing unit is not material. 

(2) Loans secured primarily by real estate.
(3) Consumer loans are net of unearned income of $700 million, $749 million, $739 million, $734 million and $771 million at March 31, 2021, December 31, 2020, 

September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, respectively. Unearned income on consumer loans primarily represents unamortized origination fees and 
costs, premiums and discounts. 

(4) Corporate loans include private bank loans and are net of unearned income of $(844) million, $(844) million, $(857) million, $(854) million and $(791) million at 
March 31, 2021, December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, respectively. Unearned income on corporate loans primarily 
represents interest received in advance, but not yet earned, on loans originated on a discounted basis.

(5) Because loans carried at fair value do not have an ACLL, they are excluded from the ACLL ratio calculation.

(1) On January 1, 2020, Citi adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASC) 326, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (CECL). The ASU introduces a new credit loss 
methodology requiring earlier recognition of credit losses while also providing additional transparency about credit risk. On January 1, 2020, Citi recorded a $4.1 
billion, or an approximate 29%, pretax increase in the Allowance for credit losses, along with a $3.1 billion after-tax decrease in Retained earnings and a deferred 
tax asset increase of $1.0 billion. This transition impact reflects (i) a $4.9 billion build to the consumer allowance for credit losses due to longer estimated tenors 
for cards than under the incurred loss methodology under prior U.S. GAAP, net of recoveries; and (ii) a $(0.8) billion decrease to the corporate allowance for

credit losses due to shorter remaining tenors, incorporation of recoveries and use of more specific historical loss data based on an increase in portfolio 
segmentation across industries and geographies. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the impact of Citi’s adoption of 
CECL.

(2) Citi had a change in accounting related to its variable post-charge-off third-party collection costs that was recorded as an adjustment to its January 1, 2020 opening 

(3)

allowance for credit losses on loans of $443 million. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Includes all adjustments to the allowance for credit losses, such as changes in the allowance from acquisitions, dispositions, securitizations, FX translation, 
purchase accounting adjustments, etc.

(4) The first quarter of 2021 includes a decrease of approximately $108 million related to FX translation.
(5) The fourth quarter of 2020 includes an increase of approximately $376 million related to FX translation.
(6) The third quarter of 2020 includes an increase of approximately $116 million related to FX translation. 
(7) The second quarter of 2020 includes an increase of approximately $88 million related to FX translation.
(8) The first quarter of 2020 includes a decrease of approximately $483 million related to FX translation.
(9) March 31, 2021, December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, exclude $7.5 billion, $6.9 billion, $5.5 billion, $5.8 billion and $4.0 

billion, respectively, of loans that are carried at fair value.

(10) At June 30, 2020, the corporate ACLUC includes a non-provision transfer of $68 million, representing reserves on performance guarantees as of March 31, 2020. 
The reserves on these contracts have been reclassified out of the allowance for credit losses on unfunded lending commitments and into other liabilities as of June 
30, 2020.

(11) Represents additional credit reserves recorded as Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
(12) See “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Attribution of the allowance is made for 

analytical purposes only and the entire allowance is available to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the overall portfolio.

Non-Accrual Loans and Assets and Renegotiated Loans
For additional information on Citi’s non-accrual loans and 
assets and renegotiated loans, see “Non-Accrual Loans and 
Assets and Renegotiated Loans” in Citi’s 2020 Annual Report 
on Form 10-K.

Non-Accrual Loans
The table below summarizes Citigroup’s non-accrual loans as 
of the periods indicated. Non-accrual loans may still be current 
on interest payments. In situations where Citi reasonably 
expects that only a portion of the principal owed will 
ultimately be collected, all payments received are reflected as 
a reduction of principal and not as interest income. For all 
other non-accrual loans, cash interest receipts are generally 
recorded as revenue.

Note: The amounts set forth in the table above are presented on an average basis. For securities, the amounts represent the liquidity value that potentially could be 
realized and, therefore, exclude any securities that are encumbered and incorporate any haircuts applicable under the U.S. LCR rule. The table above incorporates 
various restrictions that could limit the transferability of liquidity between legal entities, including Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.
(1)  Foreign government debt includes securities issued or guaranteed by foreign sovereigns, agencies and multilateral development banks. Foreign government debt 
securities are held largely to support local liquidity requirements and Citi’s local franchises and principally include government bonds from Japan, Mexico, Hong 
Kong, South Korea and India. 

The table above includes average amounts of HQLA held 
at Citigroup’s operating entities that are eligible for inclusion 
in the calculation of Citigroup’s consolidated Liquidity 
Coverage ratio (LCR), pursuant to the U.S. LCR rules. These 
amounts include the HQLA needed to meet the minimum 
requirements at these entities and any amounts in excess of 
these minimums that are assumed to be transferable to other 
entities within Citigroup. Citigroup’s HQLA decreased 
quarter-over-quarter, primarily reflecting a decrease in cash as 
Citi optimized its overall HQLA and deployed liquidity.  

As of March 31, 2021, Citigroup had approximately $957 

billion of available liquidity resources to support client and 
business needs, including end-of-period HQLA assets; 
additional unencumbered securities, including excess liquidity 
held at bank entities that is non-transferable to other entities 
within Citigroup; and available assets not already accounted 
for within Citi’s HQLA to support Federal Home Loan Bank 
(FHLB) and Federal Reserve Bank discount window 
borrowing capacity.

Short-Term Liquidity Measurement: Liquidity Coverage 
Ratio (LCR)
In addition to internal 30-day liquidity stress testing performed 
for Citi’s major entities, operating subsidiaries and countries, 
Citi also monitors its liquidity by reference to the LCR. The 
table below details the components of Citi’s LCR calculation 
and HQLA in excess of net outflows for the periods indicated:

As of March 31, 2021, Citigroup’s average LCR 

decreased from the fourth quarter of 2020. The decrease was 
primarily driven by Citi’s deploying liquidity and optimizing 
its overall HQLA.

Long-Term Liquidity Measurement: Net Stable Funding 
Ratio (NSFR)
As previously disclosed, in October 2020, the U.S. banking 
agencies adopted a final rule to assess the availability of a 
bank’s stable funding against a required level. 

increased 8%, largely driven by secured lending to high-net-
worth clients, including residential real estate lending. TTS 
loans decreased 8%, reflecting weakness in underlying trade 
flows and the continued low level of spend in commercial 
cards driven by the impact of the pandemic. 

In general, a bank’s available stable funding will include 

Average Corporate/Other loans continued to decline 

portions of equity, deposits and long-term debt, while its 
required stable funding will be based on the liquidity 
characteristics of its assets, derivatives and commitments. The 
ratio of available stable funding to required stable funding will 
be required to be greater than 100%.

The final rule becomes effective beginning July 1, 2021, 

while public disclosure requirements to report the ratio will 
occur on a semi-annual basis beginning June 30, 2023. Citi 
expects to be in compliance with the final rule upon its 
effective date.

translation, average loans declined 5% year-over-year and 1%

year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher payment rates 
given high levels of liquidity due to U.S. fiscal stimulus and 
the impact of lower customer spending, primarily in Citi’s 
cards businesses in Asia and Mexico.

Excluding the impact of FX translation, average ICG 
loans declined 3% year-over-year. Loans in corporate lending 
declined 15% on an average basis, reflecting net repayments 
as Citi continued to assist its clients in accessing the capital 
markets, as well as lower demand. Private bank loans

Long-Term Debt 
The weighted-average maturity of unsecured long-term debt 
issued by Citigroup and its affiliates (including Citibank) with 
a remaining life greater than one year was approximately 
8.9 years as of March 31, 2021, compared to 9.0 years as of 
the prior year and 8.6 years as of the prior quarter. The 
weighted-average maturity is calculated based on the 
contractual maturity of each security. For securities that are 
redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the holder, the 
weighted-average maturity is calculated based on the earliest 
date an option becomes exercisable.

Citi’s long-term debt outstanding at the Citigroup parent 

company includes benchmark senior and subordinated debt 
and what Citi refers to as customer-related debt, consisting of 
structured notes, such as equity- and credit-linked notes, as 
well as non-structured notes. Citi’s issuance of customer-
related debt is generally driven by customer demand and 
complements benchmark debt issuance as a source of funding 
for Citi’s non-bank entities. Citi’s long-term debt at the bank 
includes bank notes, FHLB advances and securitizations.

Note: Amounts represent the current value of long-term debt on Citi’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheet that, for certain debt instruments, includes 
consideration of fair value, hedging impacts and unamortized discounts and 
premiums.
(1) Non-bank includes long-term debt issued to third parties by the parent 

holding company (Citigroup) and Citi’s non-bank subsidiaries (including 
broker-dealer subsidiaries) that are consolidated into Citigroup. As of 
March 31, 2021, non-bank included $55.7 billion of long-term debt 
issued by Citi’s broker-dealer and other subsidiaries, as well as certain 
Citigroup consolidated hedging activities.

(2) Local country and other includes debt issued by Citi’s affiliates in 
support of their local operations. Within non-bank, certain secured 
financing is also included.

(3) Predominantly credit card securitizations, primarily backed by Citi-

branded credit card receivables.

Citi’s total long-term debt outstanding decreased year-

over-year, primarily driven by declines in unsecured 
benchmark senior debt, FHLB borrowings and securitizations 
at the bank, partially offset by the issuance of unsecured 
benchmark senior debt and customer-related debt at the non-
bank entities. Sequentially, long-term debt outstanding 
decreased, driven primarily by declines in unsecured 
benchmark senior debt at the non-bank entities, as well as 
declines in unsecured benchmark senior debt and 
securitizations at the bank.

As part of its liability management, Citi has considered, 

and may continue to consider, opportunities to redeem or 
repurchase its long-term debt pursuant to open market 
purchases, tender offers or other means. Such redemptions and 
repurchases help reduce Citi’s overall funding costs. During 
the first quarter of 2021, Citi redeemed or repurchased an 
aggregate of approximately $10.7 billion of its outstanding 
long-term debt.

Citi manages the risks in its secured funding by 

conducting daily stress tests to account for changes in 
capacity, tenor, haircut, collateral profile and client actions. In 
addition, Citi maintains counterparty diversification by 
establishing concentration triggers and assessing counterparty 
reliability and stability under stress. Citi generally sources 
secured funding from more than 150 counterparties.

Short-Term Borrowings
Citi’s short-term borrowings of $32 billion decreased 42% 
year-over-year, primarily driven by a decline in FHLB 
advances. Sequentially, short-term borrowings increased by 
9%, driven by customer-related debt issuance (see Note 16 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information 
on Citigroup’s and its affiliates’ outstanding short-term 
borrowings).

Secured Funding Transactions and Short-Term 
Borrowings
Citi supplements its primary sources of funding with short-
term financings that generally include (i) secured funding 
transactions consisting of securities loaned or sold under 
agreements to repurchase, i.e., repos, and (ii) to a lesser extent, 
short-term borrowings consisting of commercial paper and 
borrowings from the FHLB and other market participants. 

Secured Funding Transactions
Secured funding is primarily accessed through Citi’s broker-
dealer subsidiaries to fund efficiently both (i) secured lending 
activity and (ii) a portion of the securities inventory held in the 
context of market making and customer activities. Citi also 
executes a smaller portion of its secured funding transactions 
through its bank entities, which are typically collateralized by 
government debt securities. Generally, daily changes in the 
level of Citi’s secured funding are primarily due to 
fluctuations in secured lending activity in the matched book 
(as described below) and securities inventory. 

Secured funding of $219 billion as of March 31, 2021 
declined 1% from the prior-year period and increased 10% 
sequentially. Excluding the impact of FX translation, secured 
funding declined 6% from the prior-year period and increased 
12% sequentially, both driven by normal business activity. 
The average balance for secured funding was approximately 
$235 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2021.

The portion of secured funding in the broker-dealer 
subsidiaries that funds secured lending is commonly referred 
to as “matched book” activity. The majority of this activity is 
secured by high-quality liquid securities such as U.S. Treasury 
securities, U.S. agency securities and foreign government debt 
securities. Other secured funding is secured by less liquid 
securities, including equity securities, corporate bonds and 
asset-backed securities, the tenor of which is generally equal 
to or longer than the tenor of the corresponding matched book 
assets.

The remainder of the secured funding activity in the 
broker-dealer subsidiaries serves to fund securities inventory 
held in the context of market making and customer activities. 
To maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market 
conditions, including under periods of stress, Citi manages 
these activities by taking into consideration the quality of the 
underlying collateral and establishing minimum required 
funding tenors. The weighted average maturity of Citi’s 
secured funding of less liquid securities inventory was greater 
than 110 days as of March 31, 2021.

Credit Ratings
While not included in the table below, the long-term and 
short-term ratings of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. 
(CGMHI) were BBB+/A-2 at Standard & Poor’s and A/F1 at 
Fitch as of March 31, 2021.

Fitch Ratings (Fitch)

Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s)

Standard & Poor’s (S&P)

Potential Impacts of Ratings Downgrades
Ratings downgrades by Moody’s, Fitch or S&P could 
negatively impact Citigroup’s and/or Citibank’s funding and 
liquidity due to reduced funding capacity, including derivative 
triggers, which could take the form of cash obligations and 
collateral requirements.

The following information is provided for the purpose of 

analyzing the potential funding and liquidity impact to 
Citigroup and Citibank of a hypothetical simultaneous 
ratings downgrade across all three major rating agencies. This 
analysis is subject to certain estimates, estimation 
methodologies, judgments and uncertainties. Uncertainties 
include potential ratings limitations that certain entities may 
have with respect to permissible counterparties, as well as 
general subjective counterparty behavior. For example, certain 
corporate customers and markets counterparties could re-
evaluate their business relationships with Citi and limit 
transactions in certain contracts or market instruments with 
Citi. Changes in counterparty behavior could impact Citi’s 
funding and liquidity, as well as the results of operations of 
certain of its businesses. The actual impact to Citigroup or 
Citibank is unpredictable and may differ materially from the 
potential funding and liquidity impacts described below. For 
additional information on the impact of credit rating changes 
on Citi and its applicable subsidiaries, see “Risk Factors— 
Liquidity Risks” in Citi’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Citigroup Inc. and Citibank—Potential Derivative Triggers
As of March 31, 2021, Citi estimates that a hypothetical one-
notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of 
Citigroup Inc. across all three major rating agencies could 
impact Citigroup’s funding and liquidity due to derivative 
triggers by approximately $1.5 billion, compared to $0.6 
billion as of December 31, 2020. Other funding sources, such 
as secured financing transactions and other margin 
requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could 
also be adversely affected.

As of March 31, 2021, Citi estimates that a hypothetical 
one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of 
Citibank across all three major rating agencies could impact 
Citibank’s funding and liquidity due to derivative triggers by 
approximately $0.5 billion, compared to $0.4 billion as of 
December 31, 2020. Other funding sources, such as secured 
funding transactions and other margin requirements, for which 
there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely 
impacted.

In total, as of March 31, 2021, Citi estimates that a one-
notch downgrade of Citigroup and Citibank across all three 
major rating agencies could result in increased aggregate cash 
obligations and collateral requirements of approximately $1.9 
billion, compared to $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2020 (see 
also Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). As 
detailed under “High-Quality Liquid Assets” above, Citigroup 
has various liquidity resources available to its bank and non-
bank entities in part as a contingency for the potential events 
described above.

In addition, a broad range of mitigating actions are 
currently included in Citigroup’s and Citibank’s contingency 
funding plans. For Citigroup, these mitigating factors include, 
but are not limited to, accessing surplus funding capacity from 
existing clients, tailoring levels of secured lending and 
adjusting the size of select trading books and collateralized 
borrowings at certain Citibank subsidiaries. Mitigating actions 
available to Citibank include, but are not limited to, selling or 
financing highly liquid government securities, tailoring levels 
of secured lending, adjusting the size of select trading assets, 
reducing loan originations and renewals, raising additional 
deposits or borrowing from the FHLB or central banks. Citi 
believes these mitigating actions could substantially reduce the 
funding and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades 
described above.

62

 
Citibank—Additional Potential Impacts
In addition to the above derivative triggers, Citi believes that a 
potential downgrade of Citibank’s senior debt/long-term rating 
across any of the three major rating agencies could also have 
an adverse impact on the commercial paper/short-term rating 
of Citibank. As of March 31, 2021, Citibank had liquidity 
commitments of approximately $10.0 billion to consolidated 
asset-backed commercial paper conduits, unchanged from the 
prior quarter (for additional information, see Note 18 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements).

In addition to the above-referenced liquidity resources of 

certain Citibank entities, Citibank could reduce the funding 
and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades 
described above through mitigating actions, including 
repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial 
paper conduits. In the event of the potential downgrades 
described above, Citi believes that certain corporate customers 
could re-evaluate their deposit relationships with Citibank. 
This re-evaluation could result in clients’ adjusting their 
discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository 
institution, which could potentially reduce certain deposit 
levels at Citibank. However, Citi could choose to adjust 
pricing, offer alternative deposit products to its existing 
customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers, in 
addition to the mitigating actions referenced above.

MARKET RISK

Market risk emanates from both Citi’s trading and non-trading 
portfolios. For additional information on market risk and 
market risk management at Citi, see “Market Risk” and “Risk 
Factors” in Citi’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(1) Certain trading-oriented businesses within Citi have accrual-accounted positions that are excluded from the estimated impact to net interest revenue in the table, 
since these exposures are managed economically in combination with mark-to-market positions. The U.S. dollar interest rate exposure associated with these 
businesses was $(9) million for a 100 bps instantaneous increase in interest rates as of March 31, 2021.
Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments.

(2)

As shown in the table above, Citi decreased its net interest 

revenue exposure due to an increase in interest rates. The 
decrease was predominantly in U.S. dollar exposure, which 
was $102 million as of March 31, 2021, primarily driven by an  
increase in investment securities.

The relatively small quarterly change in the estimated 

impact to AOCI primarily reflected a continuation of the 
positioning strategy of Citi Treasury’s investment securities 
and related interest rate derivatives portfolio. In the event of a 
parallel instantaneous 100 bps increase in interest rates, Citi 
expects that the negative impact to AOCI would be offset in 
stockholders’ equity through the expected recovery of the 
impact on AOCI through accretion of Citi’s investment 
portfolio over a period of time. As of March 31, 2021, Citi 
expects that the negative $5.4 billion impact to AOCI in such a 
scenario could potentially be offset over approximately 35 
months.

The following table sets forth the estimated impact to 
Citi’s net interest revenue, AOCI and the Common Equity 
Tier 1 Capital ratio (on a fully implemented basis) under five 
different changes in interest rate scenarios for the U.S. dollar 
and Citi’s other currencies. The 100 bps downward rate 
scenarios are impacted by the low level of interest rates in 
several countries and the assumption that market interest rates, 
as well as rates paid to depositors and charged to borrowers, 
do not fall below zero (i.e., the “flooring assumption”). The 
rate scenarios are also impacted by convexity related to 
mortgage products.

In addition, in the table below, the magnitude of the 
impact to Citi’s net interest revenue and AOCI is greater under 
Scenario 2 as compared to Scenario 3. This is because the 
combination of changes to Citi’s investment portfolio, 
partially offset by changes related to Citi’s pension liabilities, 
results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at 
shorter- and intermediate-term maturities.

Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates—Impacts on AOCI 
and Capital
As of March 31, 2021, Citi estimates that an unanticipated 
parallel instantaneous 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar 
against all of the other currencies in which Citi has invested 
capital could reduce Citi’s tangible common equity (TCE) by 
approximately $1.8 billion, or 1.1%, as a result of changes to 
Citi’s foreign currency translation adjustment in AOCI, net of 
hedges. This impact would be primarily due to changes in the 
value of the Mexican peso, Euro and Indian rupee.

This impact is also before any mitigating actions Citi may 

take, including ongoing management of its foreign currency 
translation exposure. Specifically, as currency movements 
change the value of Citi’s net investments in foreign currency-
denominated capital, these movements also change the value 
of Citi’s risk-weighted assets denominated in those currencies. 
This, coupled with Citi’s foreign currency hedging strategies, 
such as foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency 
forwards and other currency hedging instruments, lessens the 
impact of foreign currency movements on Citi’s Common 
Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio. Changes in these hedging 
strategies, as well as hedging costs, divestitures and tax 
impacts, can further affect the actual impact of changes in 
foreign exchange rates on Citi’s capital as compared to an 
unanticipated parallel shock, as described above.

The effect of Citi’s ongoing management strategies with 

respect to changes in foreign exchange rates, and the impact of 
these changes on Citi’s TCE and Common Equity Tier 1 
Capital ratio, are shown in the table below. For additional 
information on the changes in AOCI, see Note 17 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

approximately $1.4 billion, as a decline of approximately $1.5 
billion in non-ICG Markets NIR was partially offset by a $140 
million increase in ICG Markets (fixed income markets and 
equity markets) NIR. The decrease in non-ICG Markets NIR 
primarily reflected the impact of lower interest rates and lower 
loan balances in the consumer businesses as well as the impact 
of one fewer day versus last year. The increase in ICG 
Markets NIR largely reflected a change in the mix of trading 
positions in support of client activity.  

Citi’s NIM was 1.95% on a taxable equivalent basis in the 

first quarter of 2021, a decrease of 5 basis points from the 
prior quarter, primarily reflecting the lower NIR, partially 
offset by Citi Treasury actions and balance sheet optimization. 
Citi’s ICG Markets NIR and non-ICG Markets NIR are 

non-GAAP financial measures.

Market Risk of Trading Portfolios

Value at Risk (VAR)
As of March 31, 2021, Citi believes its VAR model is conservatively calibrated to incorporate fat-tail scaling and the greater of short-
term (approximately the most recent month) and long-term (three years) market volatility, and estimates that the conservative features 
of the VAR calibration contribute an approximate 34% add-on to what would be a VAR estimated under the assumption of stable and 
perfectly, normally distributed markets. As of December 31, 2020, the add-on was 32%. 

As set forth in the table below, Citi’s average trading VAR increased to $102 million at March 31, 2021 from $93 million at 

December 31, 2020, mainly due to an increase in foreign exchange and commodity exposures in ICG’s Markets businesses, while 
average trading and credit portfolio VAR declined to $123 million from $126 million due to a reduction in market volatility.

(1) Covariance adjustment (also known as diversification benefit) equals the difference between the total VAR and the sum of the VARs tied to each risk type. The 
benefit reflects the fact that the risks within individual and across risk types are not perfectly correlated and, consequently, the total VAR on a given day will be 
lower than the sum of the VARs relating to each risk type. The determination of the primary drivers of changes to the covariance adjustment is made by an 
examination of the impact of both model parameter and position changes.

(2)  The total trading VAR includes mark-to-market and certain fair value option trading positions in ICG, with the exception of hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value 

option loans and all CVA exposures. Available-for-sale and accrual exposures are not included.

(3)  The specific risk-only component represents the level of equity and fixed income issuer-specific risk embedded in VAR. 
(4)  The credit portfolio is composed of mark-to-market positions associated with non-trading business units including Citi Treasury, the CVA relating to derivative 
counterparties and all associated CVA hedges. FVA and DVA are not included. The credit portfolio also includes hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value option 
loans and hedges to the leveraged finance pipeline within capital markets origination in ICG.

Regulatory VAR Back-testing
In accordance with Basel III, Citi is required to perform back-
testing to evaluate the effectiveness of its Regulatory VAR 
model. Regulatory VAR back-testing is the process in which 
the daily one-day VAR, at a 99% confidence interval, is 
compared to the buy-and-hold profit and loss (i.e., the profit 
and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of 
the day and re-priced the following day). Buy-and-hold profit 
and loss represents the daily mark-to-market profit and loss 
attributable to price movements in covered positions from the 
close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and 
loss excludes realized trading revenue, net interest, fees and 
commissions, intra-day trading profit and loss and changes in 
reserves.

Based on a 99% confidence level, Citi would expect two 

to three days in any one year where buy-and-hold losses 
exceed the Regulatory VAR. Given the conservative 
calibration of Citi’s VAR model (as a result of taking the 
greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-tail scaling 
of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer exceptions under 
normal and stable market conditions. Periods of unstable 
market conditions could increase the number of back-testing 
exceptions.

As of March 31, 2021, there were no back-testing 
exceptions observed for Citi’s Regulatory VAR for the prior 
12 months.

LIBOR Transition Risk 
Citi has continued its efforts to transition away from LIBOR, 
including implementing its LIBOR transition action plans and 
associated roadmaps under its key workstreams, as well as 
working with clients, regulators and various industry groups 
such as the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC). 
In addition, Citi has been monitoring regulatory, legislative 
and market developments regarding LIBOR transition, 
including the following:

•

•

In March 2021, following the completion of its 
consultation, the ICE Benchmark Administration, the 
authorized LIBOR administrator, notified the U.K. 
Financial Conduct Authority of its intention to cease 
publication of GBP, EUR, CHF and JPY LIBOR settings 
for all tenors, as well as USD LIBOR settings for one-
week and two-month tenors after December 31, 2021, 
while the publication of USD LIBOR settings for 
overnight and one-, three-, six- and 12-month tenors 
would cease after June 30, 2023. 
In April 2021, New York State legislation addressing 
USD LIBOR discontinuance became effective. The 
legislation addresses the transition away from USD 
LIBOR for legacy contracts that are governed by New 
York law and that lack fallback provisions or contain 
fallback provisions that are based in any way on USD 
LIBOR. Upon USD LIBOR’s permanent discontinuance, 
USD LIBOR in such contracts will be replaced with a rate 
based on SOFR plus a spread adjustment by operation of 
law. 

For additional information about Citi’s actions to address 

a transition away from and discontinuance of LIBOR, see 
“Managing Global Risk—Strategic Risk—LIBOR Transition 
Risk” in Citi’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For 
information about Citi’s LIBOR transition risks, see “Risk 
Factors—Strategic Risks” in Citi’s 2020 Annual Report on 
Form 10-K.
