CORPORATE PROFILE 

Regions is a financial holding company headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama, that operates in the South, Midwest and Texas. Regions provides traditional commercial, retail and mortgage banking services, as well as other financial services in the fields of asset management, wealth management, securities brokerage, trust services, merger and acquisition advisory services and other specialty financing. 

Regions conducts its banking operations through Regions Bank, an Alabama state-chartered commercial bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System. At September 30, 2020 , Regions operated 1,381 total branch outlets. Regions carries out its strategies and derives its profitability from three reportable business segments: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management, with the remainder in Other. See Note 11 "Business Segment Information" to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding Regions&#8217; segment reporting structure. 

On May 31, 2019, Regions entered into an agreement to acquire Highland Associates, Inc., an institutional investment firm based in Birmingham, Alabama. The transaction closed on August 1, 2019. 

On February 27, 2020, Regions entered into an agreement to acquire Ascentium Capital LLC, an independent equipment financing company headquartered in Kingwood, Texas. The transaction closed on April 1, 2020, and included approximately $1.9 billion in loans and leases to small businesses. Refer to the "Ascentium Acquisition" section for more detail. 

Regions&#8217; profitability, like that of many other financial institutions, is dependent on its ability to generate revenue from net interest income as well as non-interest income sources. Net interest income is primarily the difference between the interest income Regions receives on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest expense Regions pays on interest-bearing liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. Regions&#8217; net interest income is impacted by the size and mix of its balance sheet components and the interest rate spread between interest earned on its assets and interest paid on its liabilities. Non-interest income includes fees from service charges on deposit accounts, card and ATM fees, mortgage servicing and secondary marketing, investment management and trust activities, capital markets and other customer services which Regions provides. Results of operations are also affected by the provision for credit losses and non-interest expenses such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, professional, legal and regulatory expenses, FDIC insurance assessments, and other operating expenses, as well as income taxes. 

Economic conditions, competition, new legislation and related rules impacting regulation of the financial services industry and the monetary and fiscal policies of the Federal government significantly affect most, if not all, financial institutions, including Regions. Lending and deposit activities and fee income generation are influenced by levels of business spending and investment, consumer income, consumer spending and savings, capital market activities, and competition among financial institutions, as well as customer preferences, interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing products in Regions&#8217; market areas. 

Regions&#8217; business strategy is focused on providing a competitive mix of products and services, delivering quality customer service, and continuing to develop and optimize distribution channels that include a branch distribution network with offices in convenient locations, as well as electronic and mobile banking. 

THIRD QUARTER OVERVIEW 

Economic Environment in Regions&#8217; Banking Markets 

One of the primary factors influencing the credit performance of Regions&#8217; loan portfolio is the overall economic environment in the U.S. and the primary markets in which it operates. While on a quarterly average basis economic growth was notably robust in the third quarter, the pace of growth decelerated through the quarter, and growth is expected to settle into a slower but more sustainable pace over coming quarters. For full-year 2020, real GDP is expected to contract by 3.8 percent and to grow by 3.6 percent in 2021. As the COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing, there remains a heightened degree of uncertainty around economic forecasts. 

After the loss of more than 22 million non-farm jobs over March and April, the economy added over 11.4 million jobs over the subsequent five months, though this still left the level of non-farm employment as of September more than 10.6 million jobs below the level as of February. The unemployment rate has continued to recede from the peak of 14.7 percent in April, falling to 7.9 percent in September, although part of that decline reflects lower labor force participation. The incidence of permanent job losses has increased over recent months as the duration of unemployment has increased. While the labor market continues to heal, progress will likely be harder to come by in the months ahead. 

While the significant amount of financial support to households provided under the CARES Act helped sustain consumer spending during second and third quarters of 2020, and as the labor market began to recover, growth in labor earnings, the largest component of personal income, also began to rebound sharply. Still, there is a sharp divergence in patterns of consumer spending on goods and consumer spending on services. By June, the level of consumer spending on goods had surpassed the level as of February, but as of August the level of consumer spending on services remained well below the level as of February. This reflects ongoing restrictions on activities such as tourism, dining out, recreation, and attendance at sporting events, while shifting consumer attitudes toward engaging in such activities could also be playing a role. Either way, providers of such services continue to struggle to gain traction. 

The story in the industrial sector and the housing market is quite different. The ISM Manufacturing Index points to a recovery in the manufacturing sector that is becoming increasingly entrenched, and this is supported by growth in business orders for capital goods. New single family construction and sales of new and existing homes have surprised to the upside over recent months, in part reflecting the benefits of notably low mortgage interest rates. While the pace of growth in demand seen in the third quarter is unlikely to be sustained, construction and sales of new homes are likely to rise further, but persistently lean inventories will continue to dampen growth in sales of existing homes. 

While the economy is expected to settle into a path of steady but moderate economic growth over coming quarters, a considerable degree of uncertainty continues to cloud the outlook, which will remain the case until there is more clarity around the public health picture. Though Congress agreeing to an additional bill to provide assistance to households and small businesses is the most likely outcome, it remains uncertain when an agreement will be reached and what would be included in any such bill. Additionally, the outlook for growth in 2021 and beyond could be impacted by the outcome of the November elections. The October baseline forecast anticipates the level of real GDP will return to the level as of the fourth quarter of 2019, the last quarter free of the effects of COVID-19, in the first quarter of 2022. 

The effects within the Regions footprint will be broadly similar to those seen in the U.S. as a whole. Florida&#8217;s economy has an above-average exposure to leisure and hospitality services, while Texas and Louisiana have above-average exposure to energy, so these economies could be more prone to lasting effects if the recovery does prove to be slower than is now anticipated. 

The continued economic uncertainty, as described above, impacted Regions' forecast utilized in calculating the ACL as of September 30, 2020 . See the "Allowance" section for further information. 

COVID-19 Pandemic 

Regions' business operations and financial results are influenced by the economic environment in which the Company operates. The adverse economic conditions and uncertainty in the economic outlook as of September 30, 2020 driven by the COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact the third quarter 2020 financial results in the areas as described below. Regions expects that the pandemic will continue to influence economic conditions and the Company's financial results in future quarters. 

In the third quarter of 2020, Regions re-opened branches for walk-in services. As branch lobbies re-open, Regions continues to keep measures in place to help ensure associate and customer safety, such as providing face coverings for all associates and reducing occupancy levels to encourage social distancing. As of September 30, 2020, approximately 99% of branches were open. Regions is in the process of implementing a phased approach to return remote working associates to office locations. As of September 30, 2020, approximately 90 percent of the Company's non-branch associates are working remotely. 

During the third quarter of 2020, the Company continued to offer special financial assistance to support customers who were experiencing financial hardships related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This assistance included offering customer payment deferrals or forbearances to existing loans over a set period of time, typically 90 days. Residential mortgage payment assistance is granted through a forbearance. During the forbearance period, a borrower's payment obligation is suspended and no foreclosure action will be pursued. All payments are then due at expiration of the forbearance period, unless the loan has been modified. For most other loan products (commercial and consumer products except for residential real estate), payment assistance is granted through deferrals or extensions. Deferrals and extensions are different than forbearances in that all payments are normally not due at the end of the deferral or extension period. Instead, the payment due date is advanced. However, for most all products, interest continues to accrue on the loan during the deferral or forbearance period, unless the loan is on non-accrual. 

As of September 30, 2020, the Company had total outstanding customer payment deferrals of approximately $1.5 billion, a decline of $4.2 billion from the second quarter. As of September 30, 2020, Regions had approximately 2,600 outstanding deferrals for business customers totaling approximately $468 million, of which approximately 68% are in a second deferral. Total business deferrals have declined $3.3 billion compared to June 30, 2020. As of September 30, 2020, Regions had approximately 8,900 consumer payment deferrals outstanding totaling $1.0 billion, of which approximately 85% are in a second deferral. Total consumer deferrals have declined $900 million from the second quarter. Included in consumer deferrals are approximately 4,800 forbearances related to residential mortgages totaling approximately $920 million, of which approximately 37% relate to loans repurchased from GNMA during the third quarter of 2020. Total mortgage deferrals declined $476 million from the second quarter and approximately 88% were in second deferral as of September 30, 2020. The second forbearance period expired for most loans in October, therefore these loans will either be modified, granted another forbearance (if approved through Regions' credit risk management framework) or will be evaluated for partial write-down and non-accrual status during the fourth quarter 2020. In addition Regions had active forbearances for approximately 9,300 mortgage loans serviced for others outstanding totaling approximately $1.5 billion, as of September 30, 2020. 

During the months of August and September, approximately 20% of borrowers made a mortgage payment while in forbearance, approximately 20% of borrowers made a home equity payment, approximately 34% made a credit card payment, and approximately 10% made an auto loan payment while in deferral. Additionally, during the months of August and September, approximately 39% of corporate banking borrowers, which excludes Ascentium and branch small business customers, have made a payment while in deferral. 

As provided in the CARES Act passed into law on March 27, 2020, certain loan modifications related to COVID-19 beginning March 1, 2020 through the earlier of 60 days after the national emergency concerning the COVID-19 outbreak ends or December 31, 2020 are eligible for relief from TDR classification. Refer to Table 15 "Troubled Debt Restructurings" for further information. 

As a certified SBA lender, Regions experienced a slight increase in lending activity in the third quarter of 2020 as the Company continued to assist customers through the loan process under the PPP. Under this program, Regions has approximately 46,500 loans outstanding totaling approximately $4.6 billion as of September 30, 2020 . 

Regions continues to have strong liquidity and capital levels, which have the Company well-prepared to respond to customer borrowing needs. The Company has ample sources of liquidity that include a granular and stable deposit base, cash balances held at the Federal Reserve, borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank, unencumbered highly liquid securities, and borrowing availability at the Federal Reserve's discount window. See the "Liquidity", "Shareholders' Equity", and "Regulatory Capital" sections for further information. 

The COVID-19 pandemic also affected non-interest income. Consumer spending increased moderately in the third quarter of 2020 as restrictions on economic activity were eased throughout the country. While moderate increases to consumer spending increased service charges and card and ATM fees compared to the second quarter, spend remains below pre-pandemic levels. If current spending levels persist, the Company estimates consumer service charges will remain $30 million to $35 million per quarter behind prior-year levels. See Table 28 "Non-Interest Income" for more detail. 

Regions assessed goodwill for impairment in light of the economic environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of the Company's reporting units was less than its carrying value. Refer to the "Goodwill" section for further detail. 

Regions has experienced a modest increase in cyber events as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, however the Company's layered control environment has effectively detected and prevented any material impact related to these events. Refer to the "Information Security" section for further detail. 

Supervisory Stress Test Update 

On June 25, 2020, the Federal Reserve indicated that the Company exceeded all minimum capital levels under the supervisory stress test. The capital plan submitted to the Federal Reserve reflected no share repurchases through year-end 2020. During the third quarter, the FRB finalized Regions' SCB requirement for the fourth quarter of 2020 through the third quarter of 2021 at 3.0 percent . On October 15, 2020, the Company declared a cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2020 of $0.155 per share, which was in compliance with the Federal Reserve's SCB framework. 

Third Quarter Results 

Regions reported net income available to common shareholders of $501 million , or $0.52 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2020 compared to $385 million , or $0.39 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2019 . 

For the third quarter of 2020 , net interest income (taxable-equivalent basis) totaled $1.0 billion , up $50 million compared to the third quarter of 2019 . The net interest margin (taxable-equivalent basis) was 3.13 percent for the third quarter of 2020 and 3.44 percent in the third quarter of 2019 . The increase in net interest income was primarily driven by increases in loan balances due to PPP lending, the Company's April 2020 equipment finance acquisition, increased production of residential first mortgage 

loans, a decrease in deposit costs, and decreases in short and long-term borrowings through the redemption of Bank senior notes and paydowns of FHLB advances. Net interest income also benefited from the execution of the Company's interest rate hedging strategy. The decline in net interest margin was primarily driven by elevated levels of cash held at the Federal Reserve and the impact of lower yielding PPP loans. Additionally, net interest margin was negatively impacted by the repricing of fixed rate loan portfolios and the securities portfolio at lower market interest rates. 

The provision for credit losses totaled $113 million in the third quarter of 2020 , as compared to the provision for loan losses of $108 million during the third quarter of 2019 . The current quarter provision matched net charge-offs. Refer to the "Allowance for Credit Losses" section for further detail. 

Net charge-offs totaled $113 million , or an annualized 0.50 percent of average loans, in the third quarter of 2020 , compared to $92 million, or an annualized 0.44 percent for the third quarter of 2019 . The increase was driven primarily by deterioration in the loan portfolio due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the inclusion of net charge-offs associated with the April 2020 equipment finance acquisition. See Note 3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

The allowance was 2.74 percent of total loans, net of unearned income at September 30, 2020 compared to 1.10 percent at December 31, 2019 . The increase was impacted by the adoption of CECL at the beginning of 2020 and other factors discussed above, particularly the provisions recorded during the first half of 2020. The allowance was 316 percent of total non-performing loans at September 30, 2020 compared to 180 percent at December 31, 2019 . Total non-performing loans increased to 0.87 percent of total loans, net of unearned income, at September 30, 2020 , compared to 0.61 percent at December 31, 2019 . The increase in non-performing loans was driven primarily by downgrades in retail IRE mortgage, administrative support, waste and repair, manufacturing, restaurant and energy-related credits. Refer to the "Allowance for Credit Losses" section for further detail. 

Non-interest income was $655 million for the third quarter of 2020 , a $97 million increase from the third quarter of 2019 . The increase was primarily driven by higher mortgage and capital markets income and a valuation gain on an equity investment. The increases are partially offset by lower service charges income. See Table 28 "Non-Interest Income" for more detail. 

Total non-interest expense was $896 million in the third quarter of 2020 , a $25 million increase from the third quarter of 2019 . The increase was primarily driven by the April 2020 equipment finance acquisition. See Table 29 "Non-Interest Expense" for more detail. 

Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2020 was $104 million compared to $107 million for the same period in 2019 . See "Income Taxes" toward the end of the Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis section of this report for more detail. 

Expectations 

Due to the current economic uncertainty, the Company has rescinded previously issued financial targets for 2020, as well as the three-year targets previously announced in 2019. Regions' expectations will continue to evolve in response to the changing economic conditions presented amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, as the Company expects that the financial results of subsequent quarters will continue to be impacted. 

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS 

The following sections provide expanded discussion of significant changes in certain line items in asset, liability, and shareholders' equity categories. 

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 

Cash and cash equivalents increased approximately $9.4 billion from year-end 2019 to September 30, 2020 , due primarily to an increase in cash on deposit with the FRB. Significant deposit growth during the second and third quarters has contributed to historically elevated liquidity sources for the Company. Commercial customer deposit levels have significantly increased as customers have kept their PPP loans and brought excess deposits back to Regions. Additionally, consumers have kept government stimulus payments as well as continued to adjust their spending and saving behavior in response to the economic environment. Some of these liquidity sources were used to maintain cash at the FRB. See the "Liquidity" and "Deposits" sections for more information.

Debt securities available for sale, which constitute the majority of the securities portfolio, are an important tool used to manage interest rate sensitivity and provide a primary source of liquidity for the Company. Regions maintains a highly rated securities portfolio consisting primarily of agency mortgage-backed securities. See Note 2 "Debt Securities" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Also see the "Market Risk-Interest Rate Risk" and "Liquidity" sections for more information. 

Debt securities increased $4.3 billion from December 31, 2019 to September 30, 2020 . Despite the interest rate volatility during the first nine months of 2020, Regions' comprehensive securities repositioning executed in late 2019 positioned the portfolio to react favorably to the current economic environment. The increase from year-end was the result of improved market valuation and purchases of mortgage-backed securities. During the third quarter of 2020, as part of its cash deployment strategy, Regions added $2.6 billion of residential agency mortgage-backed securities and $391 million of commercial agency mortgage-backed securities. 

LOANS HELD FOR SALE 

Loans held for sale totaled $1.2 billion at September 30, 2020 , consisting of $1.1 billion of residential real estate mortgage loans, $117 million of commercial mortgage and other loans, and $5 million of non-performing loans. At December 31, 2019 , loans held for sale totaled $637 million , consisting of $436 million of residential real estate mortgage loans, $188 million of commercial mortgage and other loans, and $13 million of non-performing loans. The levels of residential real estate and commercial mortgage loans held for sale that are part of the Company's mortgage originations to be sold fluctuate depending on the timing of origination and sale to third parties. 

LOANS 

Loans, net of unearned income, represented approximately 68 percent of Regions&#8217; interest-earning assets at September 30, 2020 . The following table presents the distribution of Regions&#8217; loan portfolio by portfolio segment and class, net of unearned income:

PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS 

The following sections describe the composition of the portfolio segments and classes disclosed in Table 2 , explain changes in balances from 2019 year-end, and highlight the related risk characteristics. Regions believes that its loan portfolio is well diversified by product, client, and geography throughout its footprint. However, the loan portfolio may be exposed to certain concentrations of credit risk which exist in relation to individual borrowers or groups of borrowers, certain types of collateral, certain types of industries, certain loan products, or certain regions of the country. See Note 3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion. 

Many classes within Regions' portfolio segments continue to experience the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent to which Regions' borrowers are ultimately impacted will be a factor of the duration and severity of the economic impact as well as the effectiveness of the various government programs in place to support individuals and businesses. See Tables 3 through 8 below for more detail. 

Commercial 

The commercial portfolio segment includes commercial and industrial loans to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs, equipment purchases and other expansion projects. Commercial and industrial loans increase d $5.2 billion since year-end 2019 . This balance includes $4.6 billion of PPP loans generated in 2020 and the addition of $1.9 billion in loans related to the Ascentium acquisition that occurred at the beginning of the second quarter of 2020 (see the "Ascentium Acquisition" section for more information). In the first half of 2020, the portfolio experienced elevated draws on commercial lines of credit. However, during the third quarter of 2020, line utilization levels normalized and declined to historic lows at the end of the third quarter. 

Commercial also includes owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans to operating businesses, which are loans for long-term financing of land and buildings, and are repaid by cash flows generated by business operations. Owner-occupied commercial real estate construction loans are made to commercial businesses for the development of land or construction of a building where the repayment is derived from revenues generated from the business of the borrower. 

Over half of the Company&#8217;s total loans are included in the commercial portfolio segment. These balances are spread across numerous industries, as noted in the table below. The Company manages the related risks to this portfolio by setting certain lending limits for each significant industry. 

The following tables provide detail of Regions' commercial lending balances in selected industries.

________ 

(1) 

"Real estate" includes REITs, which are unsecured commercial and industrial products that are real estate related. 

(2) 

"Other" contains balances related to non-classifiable and invalid business industry codes offset by payments in process and fee accounts that are not available at the loan level. 

(3) 

As customers' businesses evolve (e.g. up or down the vertical manufacturing chain), Regions may need to change the assigned business industry code used to define the customer relationship. When these changes occur, Regions does not recast the customer history for prior periods into the new classification because the business industry code used in the prior period was deemed appropriate. As a result, comparable period changes may be impacted. 

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, Regions' risk management framework provides for credit reviews to identify certain industry sectors within the commercial and investor real estate portfolio segments that have the highest risk due to COVID-19. A bottom-up review was performed in the third quarter of 2020, which narrowed high-risk industry sectors compared to the second quarter. As of September 30, 2020 , these high-risk industries include energy, healthcare, other consumer services, restaurants, travel and leisure, hotels and retail. Industries identified as high-risk may change in future periods depending on how the macroeconomic environment conditions develop over time. These identified high-risk industries, and specified sectors within these industries, are detailed in Table 4 below. PPP loan balances are not included in Table 4 as these loans are not considered high risk. Regions is closely monitoring customers in these industries and has frequent dialogue with these customers. Certain of these exposures are also represented in Table 5 through Table 8 below. All loans within these tables are in the commercial portfolio segment, unless specifically identified as IRE.

Energy 

Regions' direct energy portfolio is comprised mostly of E&#38;P and midstream sector borrowers. As of September 30, 2020 , oil prices have rebounded from all-time lows in April 2020, but have not yet reached pre-pandemic levels. None of Regions' direct energy credits are leveraged loans and Regions has no second lien energy exposure. During the first nine months of 2020, Regions has recognized approximately $128 million in energy charge-offs, of which 80% is associated with loans originated prior to 2016 and were unable to restructure after the 2015 downturn. Since first quarter 2015, utilization rates have remained between 40-60%. Hedge positions are adequate for oil producers and strong for natural gas providers, and approximately 2% of energy loans are currently operating under a COVID-19 payment deferral.

Restaurant 

Quarantining, social distancing, and reduced business travel as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has and will continue to result in lost demand, much of which may not be recoverable. The quick service sector comprises over half of Regions' restaurant portfolio balances outstanding. The $730 million in COVID high-risk balances related to restaurants disclosed in Table 4 above is included across various sectors in Table 6 below, with the casual dining sector under the most stress in the current environment. Quick service restaurants, which focus on fast food service and limited menus, have performed relatively well during the pandemic given digital platforms, drive-through and delivery capabilities. Approximately 20% of restaurant outstandings are leveraged. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Regions strategically exited some higher risk restaurant relationships at par. Approximately 2% of restaurant, accommodation and lodging portfolio balances are in payment deferrals as of September 30, 2020 . During the first nine months of 2020, Regions has recognized approximately $33 million in restaurant charge-offs.

Hotel-related 

Regions' hotel-related portfolio is primarily comprised of 11 REIT customers. These loans are unsecured commercial and industrial loans; however, they are real estate related. The REIT portfolio benefits from low leverage, strong liquidity, and diversity of property holdings. Companies have also taken proactive steps to reduce capital expenditures, cut dividends, and reduce overhead to preserve cash. SNCs comprise 57% of Regions' total hotel-related loans. Most of Regions' borrowers for secured hotel loans have requested deferrals. As noted above, approximately 2% of restaurant, accommodation and lodging portfolio balances are in payment deferrals as of September 30, 2020 . The consumer services and PPP balances included in the table below along with the total restaurants balance in Table 6 above comprise the restaurant, accommodation and lodging balance in Table 3 above.

Retail-related 

Regions' retail-related industry is primarily comprised of REITs and non-leveraged commercial and industrial sectors. Approximately $425 million of outstanding balances across the REIT and IRE portfolios relate to shopping malls and outlet centers. Portfolio exposure to REITs specializing in enclosed malls consists of a small number of credits. Approximately 34% of mall REIT balances are investment grade with low leverage. The IRE portfolio is widely distributed. The largest tenants typically include "basic needs" anchors. The commercial and industrial retail portfolio is also widely distributed. The largest categories include motor vehicle and parts dealers, building materials, garden equipment and supplies, and non-store retailers. Owner-occupied CRE consists primarily of small strip malls and convenience stores which are largely term loans where a higher utilization rate is expected. Less than one percent of retail-related lending is operating in a deferral as of September 30, 2020 . During the first nine months of 2020, Regions has recognized approximately $10 million in retail-related lending charge-offs. The commercial and industrial leveraged and non-leveraged, asset-based lending, PPP and CRE owner-occupied balances totaling $2,977 million in the table below comprise the retail trade commercial industry sector balance in Table 3 .

Investor Real Estate 

Loans for real estate development are repaid through cash flows related to the operation, sale or refinance of the property. This portfolio segment includes extensions of credit to real estate developers or investors where repayment is dependent on the sale of real estate or income generated from the real estate collateral. A portion of Regions&#8217; investor real estate portfolio segment consists of loans secured by residential product types (land, single-family and condominium loans) within Regions&#8217; markets. Additionally, this category includes loans made to finance income-producing properties such as apartment buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping centers. Total investor real estate loans increased $ 1.0 billion in comparison to 2019 year-end balances reflecting new fundings and draws on investor real estate construction lines. 

Residential First Mortgage 

Residential first mortgage loans represent loans to consumers to finance a residence. These loans are typically financed over a 15 to 30 year term and, in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence. These loans increased $ 1.7 billion in comparison to 2019 year-end balances. The increase in residential first mortgage loans was primarily driven by an increase in originations due to historically low market interest rates during 2020. Approximately $5.4 billion in new loan originations were retained on the balance sheet through the first nine months of 2020 . In addition, Regions repurchased approximately $340 million delinquent residential mortgage loans from GNMA during the third quarter of 2020. 

Home Equity Lines 

Home equity lines are secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower's residence and allow customers to borrow against the equity in their homes. Home equity lines decreased by $ 547 million in comparison to 2019 year-end balances. Substantially all of this portfolio was originated through Regions&#8217; branch network. 

Beginning in December 2016, new home equity lines of credit have a 10-year draw period and a 20-year repayment term. During the 10-year draw period customers do not have an interest-only payment option, except on a very limited basis. From May 2009 to December 2016, home equity lines of credit had a 10-year draw period and a 10-year repayment term. Prior to May 2009, home equity lines of credit had a 20-year repayment term with a balloon payment upon maturity or a 5-year draw period with a balloon payment upon maturity. The term &#8220;balloon payment&#8221; means there are no principal payments required until the balloon payment is due for interest-only lines of credit. 

The following table presents information regarding the future principal payment reset dates for the Company's home equity lines of credit as of September 30, 2020 . The balances presented are based on maturity date for lines with a balloon payment and draw period expiration date for lines that convert to a repayment period.

Home equity loans are also secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower's residence, are primarily originated as amortizing loans, and allow customers to borrow against the equity in their homes. Home equity loans decreased by $ 245 million in comparison to 2019 year-end balances. Substantially all of this portfolio was originated through Regions&#8217; branch network. 

Other Consumer Credit Quality Data 

The Company calculates an estimate of the current value of property secured as collateral for both residential first mortgage and home equity lending products (&#8220;current LTV&#8221;). The estimate is based on home price indices compiled by a third party. The third party data indicates trends for MSAs. Regions uses the third party valuation trends from the MSAs in the Company's footprint in its estimate. The trend data is applied to the loan portfolios taking into account the age of the most recent valuation and geographic area. 

The following table presents current LTV data for components of the residential first mortgage, home equity lines and home equity loans classes of the consumer portfolio segment. Current LTV data for some loans in the portfolio is not available due to mergers and systems integrations. The amounts in the table represent the entire loan balance. For purposes of the table below, if the loan balance exceeds the current estimated collateral, the entire balance is included in the &#8220;Above 100%&#8221; category, regardless of the amount of collateral available to partially offset the shortfall.

Indirect&#8212;Vehicles 

Indirect-vehicles lending, which is lending initiated through third-party business partners, largely consists of loans made through automotive dealerships. This portfolio class decreased $692 million from year-end 2019 . The decrease is due to the termination of a third-party arrangement during the fourth quarter of 2016 and Regions' decision in January 2019 to discontinue its indirect auto lending business. Regions ceased originating new indirect auto loans in the first quarter of 2019 and completed any in-process indirect auto loan closings at the end of the second quarter of 2019. The Company will remain in the direct auto lending business. 

Indirect&#8212;Other Consumer 

Indirect-other consumer lending represents other lending initiatives through third parties, including point of sale lending. This portfolio class decreased $ 586 million from year-end 2019 due to exiting a third party relationship during the fourth quarter of 2019. 

Consumer Credit Card 

Consumer credit card lending represents primarily open-ended variable interest rate consumer credit card loans. These balances decreased $198 million from year-end 2019 reflecting lower credit card transaction volume as customers react to the economic environment. 

Other Consumer 

Other consumer loans primarily include direct consumer loans, overdrafts and other revolving loans. Other consumer loans decreased $187 million from year-end 2019 . 

Regions considers factors such as periodic updates of FICO scores, unemployment, home prices, and geography as credit quality indicators for consumer loans. FICO scores are obtained at origination and refreshed FICO scores are obtained by the Company quarterly for all consumer loans. For more information on credit quality indicators refer to Note 3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" . 

ALLOWANCE 

In preparing financial information, management is required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses for the periods shown. The accounting principles followed by Regions and the methods of applying these principles conform with GAAP, regulatory guidance (where applicable), and general banking practices. The allowance is one of the most significant estimates and assumptions to Regions. The allowance consists of two components: the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments. Unfunded credit commitments include items such as letters of credit, financial guarantees and binding unfunded loan commitments. 

On January 1, 2020, Regions adopted CECL, which replaced the incurred loss allowance methodology with an expected loss allowance methodology. See Note 1 "Basis of Presentation" , Note 3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" and Note 13 "Recent Accounting Pronouncements" for information about CECL adoption, areas of judgment and methodologies used in establishing the allowance. 

The allowance is sensitive to a number of internal factors, such as modifications in the mix and level of loan balances outstanding, portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings. The allowance is also sensitive to external factors such as the general health of the economy, as evidenced by changes in interest rates, GDP, unemployment rates, changes in real estate demand and values, volatility in commodity prices, bankruptcy filings, health pandemics, government stimulus, and the effects of weather and natural disasters such as droughts, floods and hurricanes. 

Management considers these variables and all other available information when establishing the final level of the allowance. These variables and others have the ability to result in actual credit losses that differ from the originally estimated amounts. 

Since the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, Regions has increased the allowance by $1.0 billion from $1.4 billion to $2.4 billion , which represents management's best estimate of expected losses over the life of the loan and credit commitment portfolios. Key drivers of the change in the allowance are presented in Table 11 below. While many of these items overlap regarding impact, they are included in the category most relevant.

Regions adopted the CECL accounting guidance on January 1, 2020 and recorded the cumulative effect of the change in accounting guidance as a reduction to retained earnings and an increase to deferred tax assets. See Note 1 for additional details. 

(2) 

Excludes the impact of PPP loans of $4.6 billion and $4.5 billion as of September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020, respectively, which are fully backed by the U.S. government and do not have an associated allowance. 

(3) 

This balance includes $64 million related to the initial allowance for non-PCD loans acquired as part of the Ascentium acquisition. Impact included only for the quarter of acquisition. 

While the third quarter of 2020 showed signs of economic improvement, there continues to be uncertainty surrounding the economic environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Credit metrics improved during the third quarter, and deferrals and forbearance balances declined. Additionally, unprecedented stimulus is working its way through the economic system, evidenced 

by higher consumer spend in the current quarter. While economic growth improved, the public health crisis is not resolved and continued economic uncertainty remains. While the initial economic stimulus for those on unemployment expired in the third quarter, a temporary stimulus was approved at a slightly reduced rate and, many on unemployment had higher cash flows than when they were employed. Additionally, mortgage LTVs are holding up well and the HPI showed robust appreciation. As the credit risk within Regions' loan portfolio continues to be evaluated for the remainder of 2020, both negative and positive factors of the ever-evolving economic landscape were considered in determining the allowance estimate. 

Credit metrics are monitored throughout the quarter in order to understand external macro-views of credit metrics, trends and industry outlooks as well as Regions' internal specific views of credit metrics and trends. The third quarter of 2020 exhibited some signs of improvement from the initial onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, as commercial and investor real estate criticized balances decrease d approximately $ 491 million and total net charge-offs decreased $69 million compared to the second quarter. Conversely, classified balances increased $74 million and non-performing loans, excluding held for sale, increase d $153 million compared to the second quarter. Regions performed a bottom-up review of commercial and IRE loan portfolios during the third quarter, which resulted in fewer sectors considered high-risk compared to the second quarter. As of September 30, 2020, $6.6 billion of commercial and investor real estate loans are in COVID-19 high-risk industry segments, a decline of $1.8 billion from June 30, 2020. These high-risk industries include energy, healthcare, other consumer services, restaurants, travel and leisure, unsecured and investor real estate hotels, unsecured retail and investor real estate retail. Refer to the "Portfolio Characteristics" section for more information about the high-risk industries. 

Regions purchased Ascentium, an independent equipment financing company on April 1, 2020. The purchase included approximately $1.9 billion in loans and leases to small businesses, of which approximately 46% were considered to be PCD. Regions considered loan payment status, COVID-19 deferral status, and loans in high-risk industries in COVID-19 highly-impacted states in its determination of PCD. The Ascentium acquisition resulted in $136 million in additional allowance in the second quarter, of which $76 million was recorded through the provision for credit losses and the remaining $60 million was for acquired PCD loans and did not impact the provision for credit losses. See the "Ascentium Acquisition" section for more information. 

Changes in the macroeconomic environment can be extremely impactful to the allowance estimate under CECL. Regions' economic forecast utilized in the January 1, 2020 allowance estimate upon adoption of CECL considered a relatively benign economic environment. The forecast utilized in the March 31, 2020 allowance estimate considered a more stressed economic environment due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic based on early stage pandemic information. The economic forecast utilized in the June 30, 2020 allowance estimate included further deterioration primarily due to higher levels of unemployment. The economic forecast utilized in the September 30, 2020 allowance estimate includes normalization of economic activity, albeit at an uneven pace across individual states and industry groups. Refer to the Economic Environment in Regions' Banking Markets within the "Third Quarter Overview" section for more information. Regions benchmarked its internal forecast with external forecasts and external data available. 

Risks to the economic forecast included a high degree of uncertainty around how wide the COVID-19 pandemic could spread, how long it could persist, and if any public health changes could trigger another round of shutdowns. In the second quarter of 2020, the economic environment produced unintuitive modeled results due to sensitivity to the unemployment forecasts, specifically the transient spike in unemployment rates. The CECL models are not built or conditioned to reflect the unprecedented levels of stimulus and cannot anticipate (or connect) the new relationships between economic variables and portfolio risks that existed during the second quarter. In the third quarter of 2020, unemployment declined from the second quarter to more normalized, yet elevated, forecasted levels and the CECL models reacted as directionally expected. The normalized, yet elevated, trends in the third quarter were considered to inform appropriate model adjustments for economic uncertainty. Industry-level stress analyses were also performed on industries most acutely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to the "Portfolio Characteristics" section for more information about COVID-19 impacted industries. 

While Regions' quantitative allowance methodologies strive to reflect all risk factors, any estimate involves assumptions and uncertainties resulting in some level of imprecision. The qualitative framework has a general imprecision component which is meant to acknowledge that model and forecast errors are inherent in any modeling estimate. The September 30, 2020 general imprecision allowance considered the incremental risk specific to the economic uncertainty caused by COVID-19 on commercial and consumer models as well as the incremental risk associated with payment deferrals for certain consumer models that are not economically conditioned and as such do not fully consider these impacts. 

The table below reflects a range of macroeconomic factors utilized in the Base forecast over the two-year R&#38;S forecast period as of September 30, 2020. The unemployment rate is the most significant macroeconomic factor among the CECL models. Unemployment normalized in the third quarter as noted above and, after reviewing updated factors, the Company determined that a current period adjustment to the Base forecast for unemployment was not required.

Based on the overall analysis performed, management deemed an allowance of $2.4 billion to be appropriate to absorb expected credit losses in the loan and credit commitment portfolios as of September 30, 2020. 

In June 2020, the Federal Reserve disclosed their estimated modeled credit losses for Regions as a part of the supervisory stress test. The Federal Reserve's economic scenario resulted in estimated losses for Regions of $5.3 billion. Whereas this scenario assumed a different macroeconomic outlook than Regions', it may represent a possible range of potential credit losses assuming a longer-term, widespread pandemic. As a point of clarification, the Federal Reserve's scenario assumes severe deterioration across both business services (commercial and investor real estate) and consumer portfolios, while Regions assumes deterioration mainly in the business services portfolio. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's estimate includes no benefit of government stimulus or benefit from debt payment relief being offered by Regions and other financial institutions. See the "Third Quarter Overview" section for further information regarding the Company's economic outlook. 

Changes in the factors used by management to determine the appropriateness of the allowance or the availability of new information could cause the allowance to be increased or decreased in future periods. In addition, bank regulatory agencies, as part of their examination process, may require changes in the level of allowance based on their judgments and estimates. Volatility in certain credit metrics is to be expected. Additionally, changes in circumstances related to individually large credits, commodity prices, or certain macroeconomic forecast assumptions may result in volatility. The scenarios discussed above, or other scenarios, have the ability to result in actual credit losses that differ, perhaps materially, from the originally estimated amounts. In addition, it is difficult to predict how changes in economic conditions, including changes resulting from various pandemic scenarios, the impact of government stimulus, and other relief programs could affect borrower behavior. This analysis is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled loss estimates to reflect uncertainty and imprecision based on then-current circumstances and conditions. 

Details regarding the allowance and net charge-offs, including an analysis of activity from the previous year&#8217;s totals, are included in Table 13 "Allowance for Credit Losses." As noted above, economic trends such as interest rates, unemployment, volatility in commodity prices and collateral valuations as well as the length and depth of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of the CARES Act and other policy accommodations will impact the future levels of net charge-offs and may result in volatility of certain credit metrics during the remainder of 2020 and beyond.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs) 

TDRs are modified loans in which a concession is provided to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. As provided in the CARES Act passed into law on March 27, 2020, certain loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic beginning March 1, 2020 through the earlier of 60 days after the end of the pandemic or December 31, 2020 are eligible for relief from TDR classification. Regions elected this provision of the CARES Act; therefore, modified loans that met the required guidelines for relief are not considered TDRs and are excluded from the disclosures below. 

Under Regions' COVID-19 deferral and forbearance programs, customer payments are deferred for a period of time, typically 90 days. During this time, a customer's loan is not considered past due and continues to accrue interest (unless it is a nonperforming loan). As of September 30, 2020, the initial 90-day deferral period had expired for the majority of COVID-19 modified loans. See the "Third Quarter Overview" section for details on deferrals as of September, 30, 2020. Upon expiration of the deferral period, customers may apply for additional relief or resume making payments on their loans. Repayment plans for the deferrals differ depending on the loan type and repayment ability of the borrower. The CARES Act relief and short-term nature of most COVID-19 deferrals precluded these modifications from being classified as TDRs as of September 30, 2020. 

Residential first mortgage, home equity, consumer credit card and other consumer TDRs are consumer loans modified under the CAP. Commercial and investor real estate loan modifications are not the result of a formal program, but represent situations where modifications were offered as a workout alternative. Renewals of classified commercial and investor real estate loans are considered to be TDRs, even if no reduction in interest rate is offered, if the existing terms are considered to be below market. Insignificant modifications are not considered TDRs. More detailed information is included in Note 3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements. The following table summarizes the loan balance and related allowance for accruing and non-accruing TDRs for the periods presented:

The following table provides an analysis of the changes in commercial and investor real estate TDRs. TDRs with subsequent restructurings that meet the definition of a TDR are only reported as TDR additions in the period they were first modified. Other than resolutions such as charge-offs, foreclosures, payments, sales and transfers to held for sale, Regions may remove loans from TDR classification if the following conditions are met: the borrower's financial condition improves such that the borrower is no longer in financial difficulty, the loan has not had any forgiveness of principal or interest, the loan has not been restructured as an "A" note/"B" note, the loan has been reported as a TDR over one fiscal year-end and the loan is subsequently refinanced or restructured at market terms such that it qualifies as a new loan. 

For the consumer portfolio, changes in TDRs are primarily due to additions from CAP modifications and outflows from payments and charge-offs. Given the types of concessions currently being granted under the CAP as detailed in Note 3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements, Regions does not expect that the market interest rate condition will be widely achieved. Therefore, Regions expects consumer loans modified through CAP to continue to be identified as TDRs for the remaining term of the loan.

Excludes accruing loans 90 days past due. 

(2) 

Excludes residential first mortgage loans that are 100% guaranteed by the FHA and all guaranteed loans sold to the GNMA where Regions has the right but not the obligation to repurchase. Total 90 days or more past due guaranteed loans excluded were $47 million at September 30, 2020 and $66 million at December 31, 2019 . 

Non-performing loans at September 30, 2020 have increased compared to year-end levels, primarily driven by downgrades in retail IRE mortgage, energy and restaurant loans, all of which, have experienced stress due to recent declines in demand brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Economic trends such as interest rates, unemployment, volatility in commodity prices, and collateral valuations will impact the future level of non-performing assets. Circumstances related to individually large credits could also result in volatility. 

At September 30, 2020 , Regions estimates that the amount of commercial and investor real estate loans that have the potential to migrate to non-accrual status in the next quarter is within the range of $150 million to $250 million . 

In order to arrive at the estimated range of potential problem loans for the next quarter, credit personnel forecast certain larger dollar loans that may potentially be downgraded to non-accrual at a future time, depending upon the occurrence of future events. A variety of factors are included in the assessment of potential problem loans, including a borrower&#8217;s capacity and willingness to meet contractual repayment terms, make principal curtailments or provide additional collateral when necessary and provide current and complete financial information, including global cash flows, contingent liabilities and sources of liquidity. For other loans (for example, smaller dollar loans), a trend analysis is also incorporated to determine an estimate of potential future downgrades. In addition, the economic environment and industry trends are evaluated in the establishment of the estimated range of potential problem loans for the next quarter. Current trends will additionally influence the size of the estimated range. Because of the inherent uncertainty in forecasting future events, the estimated range of potential problem loans ultimately represents the estimated aggregate dollar amounts of loans, as opposed to an individual listing of loans. 

Many of the loans on which the potential problem loan estimate is based are considered criticized and classified. Detailed disclosures for substandard accrual loans (as well as other credit quality metrics) are included in Note 3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements.

(1) 

All net activity within the consumer portfolio segment other than sales and transfers to held for sale (including related charge-offs) is included as a single net number within the net payments/other activity line. 

(2) 

Includes charge-offs on loans on non-accrual status and charge-offs taken upon sale and transfer of non-accrual loans to held for sale. 

(3) 

Transfers to held for sale are shown net of charge-offs of $6 million and $8 million recorded upon transfer for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. 

GOODWILL 

Goodwill totaled $ 5.2 billion at September 30, 2020 and $4.8 billion at December 31, 2019 and is allocated to each of Regions&#8217; reportable segments (each a reporting unit), at which level goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more often if events and circumstances indicate the fair value of the reporting unit may have declined below the carrying value (refer to Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for further discussion of when Regions tests goodwill for impairment and the Company's methodology and valuation approaches used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit). The increase in goodwill from December 31, 2019 was related to the Company's acquisition of Ascentium during the second quarter of 2020. 

The result of the assessment performed for the third quarter of 2020 did not indicate that the estimated fair values of the Company&#8217;s reporting units (Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank and Wealth Management) had declined below their respective carrying values. Therefore, Regions determined that a test of goodwill impairment was not required for each of Regions&#8217; reporting units for the September 30, 2020 interim period. Refer to Note 5 "Goodwill" to the consolidated financial statements for further information. 

DEPOSITS 

Regions competes with other banking and financial services companies for a share of the deposit market. Regions&#8217; ability to compete in the deposit market depends heavily on the pricing of its deposits and how effectively the Company meets customers&#8217; needs. Regions employs various means to meet those needs and enhance competitiveness, such as providing a high level of customer service, competitive pricing and convenient branch locations for its customers. Regions also serves customers through providing centralized, high-quality banking services and alternative product delivery channels such as mobile and internet banking.

Total deposits at September 30, 2020 increased approximately $21.0 billion compared to year-end 2019 levels, due to increases in non-interest-bearing demand, savings, interest-bearing transaction and domestic money market categories. These increases were partially offset by decreases in corporate treasury other deposits and customer time deposits. Non-interest-bearing demand deposits continued to increase as customers have been bringing their elevated cash levels back to Regions. Also, businesses are focused on supply chain efficiencies and turnover of receivables which has increased their cash balances and resulting deposits. Savings, interest-bearing transaction and domestic money market categories increased due to customers choosing to keep excess cash from government stimulus and funds from PPP loans in their deposit accounts. Additionally, consumers' spending has declined due to the economic environment and consumers continue to adjust their spending and saving patterns, which has led to an increase in deposit balances. Customer time deposits decreased due to maturities during the third quarter, and continued lower interest rates during the third quarter resulted in a decrease in the utilization of time deposit accounts. Corporate treasury other deposits decreased as these deposits were used to supplement incremental balance sheet funding at year-end 2019, but were not utilized at the end of the third quarter of 2020. 

SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS 

Short-term borrowings, which consist of FHLB advances, were zero at September 30, 2020 as compared to $2.1 billion at December 31, 2019 . The levels of these borrowings can fluctuate depending on the Company's funding needs and the sources utilized. FHLB borrowings decreased from December 31, 2019 to September 30, 2020 as the increase in deposits reduced the need for funding from the FHLB. 

Short-term secured borrowings, such as securities sold under agreements to repurchase and FHLB advances, are a core portion of Regions funding strategy. The securities financing market and specifically short-term FHLB advances continue to provide reliable funding at attractive rates. See the "Liquidity" section for further detail of Regions' borrowing capacity with the FHLB.

Long-term borrowings decreased by approximately $3.0 billion since year-end 2019, due primarily to the decrease in FHLB advances of $2.5 billion, as well as several other debt transactions. As mentioned above in the "Short-Term Borrowings" section, the increase in deposits also reduced the need for long-term borrowings from the FHLB. See the "Liquidity" section for further detail of Regions' borrowing capacity with the FHLB. In the second quarter of 2020, Regions issued $750 million of senior notes due 2025. The issuance was more than offset by partial tenders and redemptions executed in the second and third quarters of 2020. In the second quarter, Regions executed a partial tender of the two Regions Bank Senior Notes due April 2021. In the third quarter, Regions redeemed the two Regions Bank Senior Notes due August 2021 in their entirety. In conjunction with the partial tenders and redemptions of bank notes and early terminations of FHLB advances, Regions incurred related early extinguishment pre-tax charges totaling $ 8 million for the first nine months of 2020. Lastly, through the Ascentium acquisition, Regions acquired securitized borrowings, which the Company will manage within its broader liability management process and in line with the allowable terms of the contracts. 

Long-term FHLB advances had a weighted-average interest rate of 1.9 percent at December 31, 2019 . 

The Ascentium note securitizations have various classes and have a weighted-average interest rate of 2.25 percent as of September 30, 2020 , with remaining maturities ranging from 3 years to 7 years and a weighted-average of 6.0 years. 

SHAREHOLDERS&#8217; EQUITY 

Shareholders&#8217; equity was $17.9 billion at September 30, 2020 as compared to $16.3 billion at December 31, 2019 . During the first nine months of 2020 , net income increased shareholders' equity by $478 million , cash dividends on common stock reduced shareholders' equity by $447 million and cash dividends on preferred stock reduced shareholder's equity by $75 million . The cumulative effect from the adoption of CECL decreased shareholders' equity by $377 million . See Note 1 "Basis of Presentation" for information about the CECL adoption. Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income increased shareholders' equity by $1.7 billion , primarily due to the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on securities available for sale and derivative instruments as a result of changes in market interest rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 . The derivative instruments are hedges designed to protect net interest income in a low short-term interest rate environment, such as the one that currently exists. Lastly, during the second quarter of 2020, the Company issued Series D preferred stock, which increased shareholders' equity by $346 million . 

See Note 6 "Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income" and the "Regulatory Capital Requirements" section for additional information. 

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS 

Regions and Regions Bank are required to comply with regulatory capital requirements established by Federal and State banking agencies. These regulatory capital requirements involve quantitative measures of the Company's assets, liabilities and selected off-balance sheet items, and also qualitative judgments by the regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can subject the Company to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory actions. 

Under the Basel III Rules, Regions is designated as a standardized approach bank. Additional discussion of the Basel III Rules, their applicability to Regions, recent proposals and final rules issued by the federal banking agencies and recent laws enacted that impact regulatory requirements is included in the "Regulatory Requirements" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis in the 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional discussion is also included in Note 13 "Regulatory Capital Requirements and Restrictions" to the consolidated financial statements in the 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

In the third quarter of 2020, the federal banking agencies finalized a rule related to the impact of CECL on regulatory capital requirements. The rule allows an add-back to regulatory capital for the impacts of CECL for a two-year period. At the end of the two years, the impact is then phased-in over the following three years. The add-back is calculated as the impact of initial adoption, adjusted for 25 percent of subsequent changes in the allowance. At September 30, 2020, the impact of the addback on CET1 was approximately $611 million , or approximately 56 basis points. 

The following table summarizes the applicable holding company and bank regulatory requirements:

_______ 

(1) The current quarter Basel III CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital, and Leverage capital ratios are estimated. 

In October of 2020, the SCB framework, that was finalized in the first quarter of 2020, was implemented. This new framework created a firm-specific risk sensitive buffer that is applied to regulatory minimum capital levels to help determine effective minimum ratio requirements. The SCB is now floored at 2.5% to ensure effective minimum capital levels do not decline as a result of this rule change. At implementation, the SCB replaced the current Capital Conservation Buffer, which was a static 2.5% in addition to the minimum risk-weighted asset ratios shown above. 

During the third quarter, the Federal Reserve finalized Regions' SCB requirement for the fourth quarter of 2020 through the third quarter of 2021 at 3.0 percent. The 3.0 percent requirement represented the amount of capital degradation under the supervisory severely adverse scenario, inclusive of four quarters of planned common stock dividends. 

The Federal Reserve approved its rule for tailoring enhanced prudential standards for bank holding companies with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets. The framework outlines tailored standards for matters related to capital and liquidity. Regions is a "Category IV" institution under these rules. See the &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; subsection of the &#8220;Business&#8221; section in the 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. 

LIQUIDITY 

Regions maintains a robust liquidity management framework designed to effectively manage liquidity risk in accordance with sound risk management principals, as well as regulatory requirements as applicable to Regions' Category IV status under the tailoring rules. Regions' framework establishes sustainable processes and tools to effectively identify, measure, mitigate, monitor, and report liquidity risks beginning with Regions&#8217; Liquidity Management Policy and the Liquidity Risk Appetite Statements approved by the Board. Processes within the liquidity management framework include, but are not limited to, liquidity risk governance, cash management, cash flow forecasting, liquidity stress testing, liquidity risk limits, contingency funding plans, and collateral management. The framework is designed to simultaneously meet the expectations of regulations, as well as be aligned with Regions' business mix and operating model and their impact to liquidity management. 

See the "Liquidity" section for more information. Also, see the &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8212;Liquidity Regulation&#8221; subsection of the &#8220;Business&#8221; section, the "Risk Factors" section and the "Liquidity" section in the 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

N/A - Not applicable. 

On April 3, 2020, Moody's revised outlooks for Regions Bank and Regions Financial Corporation to stable from positive citing expectations for a contracting economy in 2020 which is expected to have a direct negative impact on U.S. banks' asset quality and profitability. 

On April 9, 2020, Fitch revised the outlook for Regions Financial Corporation to stable from positive as part of an overall revision of its U.S. bank sector and rating outlook. Revision to the overall outlook was driven by concerns over the negative financial and economic impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. 

In general, ratings agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, probability of government support, and level and quality of earnings. Any downgrade in credit ratings by one or more ratings agencies may impact Regions in several ways, including, but not limited to, Regions&#8217; access to the capital markets or short-term funding, borrowing cost and capacity, collateral requirements, and acceptability of its letters of credit, thereby potentially adversely impacting Regions&#8217; financial condition and liquidity. See the &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for more information. 

A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and the ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 

NON-GAAP MEASURES 

The table below presents computations of earnings and certain other financial measures, which exclude certain significant items that are included in the financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures include &#8220;adjusted average total loans&#8221;, "ending total loans excluding PPP, net", "ACL to loans excluding PPP, net ratio", &#8220;adjusted efficiency ratio&#8221;, &#8220;adjusted fee income ratio&#8221;, &#8220;return on average tangible common shareholders' equity&#8221;, and end of period &#8220;tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity&#8221;, and related ratios. Regions believes that expressing earnings and certain other financial measures excluding these significant items provides a meaningful base for period-to-period comparisons, which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the Company and predicting future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of Regions&#8217; business because management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments to be indications of ongoing operations. Regions believes that presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the Company on the same basis as that applied by management. Management and the Board utilize these non-GAAP financial measures as follows: 

&#8226; 

Preparation of Regions&#8217; operating budgets 

&#8226; 

Monthly financial performance reporting 

&#8226; 

Monthly close-out reporting of consolidated results (management only) 

&#8226; 

Presentations to investors of Company performance 

Average total loans are presented excluding loan balances related to loans originated through the SBA's PPP program, the indirect-other consumer exit portfolio, and indirect vehicles exit portfolio to arrive at adjusted average total loans (non-GAAP). Regions believes adjusting average total loans provides a meaningful calculation of loan growth rates and presents them on the same basis as that applied by management. 

Ending total loans are presented excluding loan balances related to loans originated through the SBA's PPP program. Regions believes the related ACL to loans excluding PPP ratio provides meaningful information about credit loss allowance levels when the SBA's PPP loans, which are fully backed by the U.S. government, are excluded from total loans. 

The adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP), which is a measure of productivity, is generally calculated as adjusted non-interest expense divided by adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. The adjusted fee income ratio (non-GAAP) is generally calculated as adjusted non-interest income divided by adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. Management uses these ratios to monitor performance and believes these measures provide meaningful information to investors. Non-interest expense (GAAP) is presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the adjusted efficiency ratio. Non-interest income (GAAP) is presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the adjusted fee income ratio. Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis and non-interest income are added together to arrive at total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. Adjustments are made to arrive at adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis (non-GAAP), which is the denominator for the adjusted efficiency and adjusted fee income ratios. 

Tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity ratios have become a focus of some investors in analyzing the capital position of the Company absent the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Traditionally, the Federal Reserve and other banking regulatory bodies have assessed a bank&#8217;s capital adequacy based on CET1, the calculation of which is codified in federal banking regulations. Analysts and banking regulators have assessed Regions&#8217; capital adequacy using the tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity measure. Because tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity is not formally defined by GAAP, this measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure and other entities may calculate it differently than Regions&#8217; disclosed calculations. Since analysts and banking 

regulators may assess Regions&#8217; capital adequacy using tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity, Regions believes that it is useful to provide investors the ability to assess Regions&#8217; capital adequacy on this same basis. 

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP. In particular, a measure of earnings that excludes selected items does not represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to shareholders. 

The following tables provide: 1) a reconciliation of average total loans (GAAP) to adjusted average total loans (non-GAAP), 2) a reconciliation of ending total loans (GAAP) to ending total loans excluding PPP loans (non-GAAP) and a computation of ACL to ending loans excluding PPP loans (non-GAAP), 3) a reconciliation of net income (GAAP) to net income available to common shareholders (GAAP), 4) a reconciliation of non-interest expense (GAAP) to adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP), 5) a reconciliation of net interest income/margin, taxable equivalent basis (GAAP) to adjusted net interest income/margin, taxable equivalent basis (non-GAAP), 6) a reconciliation of non-interest income (GAAP) to adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP), 9) a computation of adjusted total revenue (non-GAAP), 7) a computation of the adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP), 8) a computation of the adjusted fee income ratio (non-GAAP), and 9) a reconciliation of average and ending shareholders&#8217; equity (GAAP) to average and ending tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity (non-GAAP) and calculations of related ratios (non-GAAP).

(1) 

Debt securities are included on an amortized cost basis with yield, net interest spread, and net interest margin calculated accordingly. 

(2) 

Loans, net of unearned income include non-accrual loans for all periods presented. 

(3) 

Interest income includes net loan fees of $21 million and $1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. 

(4) 

Total deposit costs may be calculated by dividing total interest expense on deposits by the sum of interest-bearing deposits and non-interest-bearing deposits. The rates for total deposit costs equal 0.11% and 0.49% for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. 

(5) 

The computation of taxable-equivalent net interest income is based on the statutory federal income tax rate of 21% for both September 30, 2020 and 2019 adjusted for applicable state income taxes net of the related federal tax benefit.

(1) 

Debt securities are included on an amortized cost basis with yield, net interest spread, and net interest margin calculated accordingly. 

(2) 

Loans, net of unearned income include non-accrual loans for all periods presented. 

(3) 

Interest income includes net loan fees of $26 million and $4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. 

(4) 

Total deposit costs may be calculated by dividing total interest expense on deposits by the sum of interest-bearing deposits and non-interest-bearing deposits. The rates for total deposit costs equal 0.19% and 0.49% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. 

(5) 

The computation of taxable-equivalent net interest income is based on the statutory federal income tax rate of 21% for both September 30, 2020 and 2019 adjusted for applicable state income taxes net of the related federal tax benefit. 

The increase in net interest income for the third quarter 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was driven by increases in loan balances attributable to PPP lending, the Company's April 2020 equipment finance company acquisition, increased production of residential first mortgage loans, a decrease in deposit costs, and decreases in short and long-term borrowings through the redemption of Bank senior notes and paydowns of FHLB advances. Net interest income also benefitted from the execution of the Company's interest rate hedging strategy. The hedges are designed to protect net interest income in a low short-term interest rate environment, such as the one that currently exists, and had a positive impact of approximately $163 million for the first nine months 

of 2020, of which $94 million was realized in the three months ended September 30, 2020 . The hedging strategy produced no benefits before 2020. 

The declines in net interest margin for the third quarter 2020 and the first nine months of 2020, compared to the same periods in 2019 , were primarily driven by elevated cash levels, increases in loan balances due to PPP lending and loan production at lower market interest rates. Additionally, net interest margin was negatively impacted by the repricing of fixed rate loan portfolios and the securities portfolio at lower market interest rates. 

MARKET RISK&#8212;INTEREST RATE RISK 

Regions&#8217; primary market risk is interest rate risk. This includes uncertainty with respect to absolute interest rate levels as well as relative interest rate levels, which are impacted by both the shape and the slope of the various yield curves that affect the financial products and services that the Company offers. To quantify this risk, Regions measures the change in its net interest income in various interest rate scenarios compared to a base case scenario. Net interest income sensitivity to market rate movements is a useful short-term indicator of Regions&#8217; interest rate risk. 

Sensitivity Measurement &#8212;Financial simulation models are Regions&#8217; primary tools used to measure interest rate exposure. Using a wide range of sophisticated simulation techniques provides management with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates. Models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of Regions&#8217; balance sheet. Assumptions are made about the direction and volatility of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve, and the changing composition of the balance sheet that results from both strategic plans and from customer behavior. Among the assumptions are expectations of balance sheet growth and composition, the pricing and maturity characteristics of existing business and the characteristics of future business. Interest rate-related risks are expressly considered, such as pricing spreads, the pricing of deposit accounts, prepayments and other option risks. Regions considers these factors, as well as the degree of certainty or uncertainty surrounding their future behavior. 

The primary objective of asset/liability management at Regions is to coordinate balance sheet composition with interest rate risk management to sustain reasonable and stable net interest income throughout various interest rate cycles. In computing interest rate sensitivity for measurement, Regions compares a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario derived using &#8220;market forward rates.&#8221; The standard set of interest rate scenarios includes the traditional instantaneous parallel rate shifts of plus 100 and 200 basis points. Given low market rates by historical standards, the Company focuses on a falling rate shock scenario with most yield curve tenors floored near zero and a reduction in mortgage indices based on historical minimums as explained in the following section. In addition to parallel curve shifts, multiple curve steepening and flattening scenarios are contemplated. Regions includes simulations of gradual interest rate movements phased in over a six-month period that may more realistically mimic the speed of potential interest rate movements. 

Exposure to Interest Rate Movements &#8212;As of September 30, 2020 , Regions was modestly asset sensitive to both gradual and instantaneous parallel yield curve shifts as compared to the base case for the measurement horizon ending September 2021 . The third quarter continued the trend of strong balance sheet growth in low-cost deposits and cash balances held with the Federal Reserve. These trends increase reported asset sensitivity levels in the near-term; however, this is offset somewhat by the addition of approximately $3 billion of fixed-rate investment securities (Agency MBS and Agency CMBS) within the quarter. 

The estimated exposure associated with falling rate scenarios in the table below reflects the combined impacts of movements in short-term and long-term interest rates. The decline in short-term interest rates (such as the Fed Funds rate, the rate of Interest on Excess Reserves and 1 month LIBOR) will lead to a reduction of yield on assets and liabilities contractually tied to such rates. Under that environment, it is expected that declines in funding costs and increases in balance sheet hedging income will completely offset the decline in asset yields. Therefore, net interest income sensitivity to short-term rates is approximately neutral. Net interest income remains exposed to longer yield curve tenors. A reduction in intermediate and long-term interest rates (such as intermediate to longer-term U.S. Treasuries, swap and mortgage rates) will drive yields lower on certain fixed rate, newly originated or renewed loans, reduce prospective yields on certain investment portfolio purchases, and increase amortization of premium expense on existing securities in the investment portfolio. 

The table below summarizes Regions' positioning in various parallel yield curve shifts (i.e., including all yield curve tenors). The scenarios are inclusive of all interest rate risk hedging activities. Forward starting hedges that have been transacted are contemplated to the extent they start within the measurement horizon. More information regarding forward starting hedges is disclosed in Table 26 and its accompanying description.

(1) 

Disclosed interest rate sensitivity levels represent the 12 month forward looking net interest income changes as compared to market forward rate cases and include expected balance sheet growth and remixing. 

(2) 

Forward starting cash flow hedges already transacted will reduce sensitivity levels into 1Q 2021 as they continue to move into the measurement horizon. See Table 27 for additional information regarding hedge start dates. 

(3) 

The -100 basis point (floored) scenario represents a 12 month average rate shock of -16 basis points and -80 basis points to approximately zero for 1 month LIBOR and the 10 year U.S. Treasury yield, respectively. Mortgage yield shocks are floored at their historical minimums minus 35 basis points. 

As market interest rates increased in recent years, Regions had established scenarios by which yield curve tenors will fall to a consistent level. The shock magnitude for each tenor, when compared to market forward rates, equated to the lesser of the shock scenario amount, or a rate 35 basis points lower than the historical all-time minimum. Recent market volatility and new historic lows established for longer yield curve tenors have resulted in a shock scenario where the majority of rates now fall to approximately zero. Mortgage rates, which have retained somewhat elevated levels, are still being shocked in the manner previously described. Further, the scenarios presented do not allow for negative rates. The falling rate scenarios in Table 25 above quantify the expected impact for both gradual and instantaneous shocks under this environment. 

As discussed above, the interest rate sensitivity analysis presented in Table 25 is informed by a variety of assumptions and estimates regarding the progression of the balance sheet in both the baseline scenario as well as the scenarios of instantaneous and gradual shifts in the yield curve. Though there are many assumptions which affect the estimates for net interest income, those pertaining to deposit pricing, deposit mix and overall balance sheet composition are particularly impactful. Given the uncertainties associated with the prolonged period of low interest rates and industry liquidity, management evaluates the impact to its sensitivity analysis of these key assumptions. Sensitivity calculations are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future results. 

The Company&#8217;s baseline balance sheet assumptions include loan growth and deposit normalization reflecting management's best estimate. The behavior of deposits in response to changes in interest rate levels is largely informed by analyses of prior rate cycles, but with suitable adjustments based on management&#8217;s expectations in the current environment. In the base case scenario and falling rate scenarios in Table 25 , interest-bearing deposit rates move into the single digits. In rising rate scenarios only, management assumes that the mix of deposits will change versus the base case balance sheet assumptions as informed by analyses of prior rate cycles. Management assumes that in rising rate scenarios, some shift from non-interest bearing to interest-bearing products will occur. The magnitude of the shift is rate dependent and equates to approximately $3 billion over 12 months in the gradual +100 basis point scenario in Table 25 . Since the end of 2019, Regions has seen sizable deposit growth, which has contributed to its higher interest rate risk sensitivity year-to-date. The Company estimates that every $1 billion decline in total deposit balances would reduce NII sensitivity in Table 25 by approximately -$8 million and +$2 million in the gradual +100 basis point and the gradual -100 basis point floored shock scenarios, respectively. While estimates should be used as a guide, differences may result driven by the pace of rate changes, and other market competitive factors. 

Interest rate movements may also have an impact on the value of Regions&#8217; securities portfolio, which can directly impact the carrying value of shareholders&#8217; equity. Regions from time to time may hedge these price movements with derivatives (as discussed below). 

Derivatives &#8212;Regions uses financial derivative instruments for management of interest rate sensitivity. ALCO, which consists of members of Regions&#8217; senior management team, in its oversight role for the management of interest rate sensitivity, approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging strategies. Derivatives are also used to offset the risks associated with customer derivatives, which include interest rate, credit and foreign exchange risks. The most common derivatives Regions employs are forward rate contracts, Eurodollar futures contracts, interest rate swaps, options on interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, and forward sale commitments. 

Forward rate contracts are commitments to buy or sell financial instruments at a future date at a specified price or yield. A Eurodollar futures contract is a future on a Eurodollar deposit. Eurodollar futures contracts subject Regions to market risk associated with changes in interest rates. Because futures contracts are cash settled daily, there is minimal credit risk associated with Eurodollar futures. Interest rate swaps are contractual agreements typically entered into to exchange fixed for variable (or vice versa) streams of interest payments. The notional principal is not exchanged but is used as a reference for the size of interest settlements. Interest rate options are contracts that allow the buyer to purchase or sell a financial instrument at a predetermined price and time. Forward sale commitments are contractual obligations to sell market instruments at a future date for an already agreed-upon price. Foreign currency contracts involve the exchange of one currency for another on a specified date and at a specified rate. These contracts are executed on behalf of the Company's customers and are used by customers to manage fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The Company is subject to the credit risk that another party will fail to perform. 

Regions has made use of interest rate swaps and floors in balance sheet hedging strategies to effectively convert a portion of its fixed-rate funding position to a variable-rate position and to effectively convert a portion of its variable-rate loan portfolios to fixed-rate. Regions also uses derivatives to economically manage interest rate and pricing risk associated with its mortgage origination business. In the period of time that elapses between the origination and sale of mortgage loans, changes in interest rates have the potential to cause a decline in the value of the loans in this held-for-sale portfolio. Futures contracts and forward sale commitments are used to protect the value of the loan pipeline and loans held for sale from changes in interest rates and pricing.

Variable rate indexes on swap and floor contracts reference a combination of short-term LIBOR benchmarks, primarily 1 month LIBOR. 

A portion of the cash flow hedging relationships designated in Table 26 above are forward starting as of September 30, 2020, including $1.0 billion notional of the outstanding cash flow swaps and $250 million notional of the outstanding cash flow floors. Forward starting swaps and floors have maturities of approximately five years from their respective start dates, and further information regarding the timeline for start dates has been disclosed in Table 27 . During the third quarter, Regions unwound $1 billion notional of interest rate floors at a gain, which will be amortized throughout the life of the original instrument, or approximately five years. This action was performed to partially offset the asset duration increases provided by the $3 billion securities portfolio additions within the quarter. 

The following table presents cash flow hedge notional amounts with start dates prior to the year-end periods shown through 2026. All cash flow hedge notional amounts mature prior to the end of 2027.

As forward starting cash flow hedges are transacted within the 12 month measurement horizon, they will reduce 12 month net interest income sensitivity levels as disclosed in Table 25 . 

(2) 

As of September 30, 2020, $15.0 billion of the $16.0 billion notional of the cash flow swaps and $5.50 billion of the $5.75 billion notional of the interest rate floors are active. During the fourth quarter of 2020, $250 million notional of interest rate swaps become active. The remaining $750 million notional of interest rate swaps and $250 million notional of interest rate floors become active in the first quarter of 2021. 

Regions manages the credit risk of these instruments in much the same way as it manages credit risk of the loan portfolios by establishing credit limits for each counterparty and through collateral agreements for dealer transactions. For non-dealer transactions, the need for collateral is evaluated on an individual transaction basis and is primarily dependent on the financial strength of the counterparty. Credit risk is also reduced significantly by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements. When there is more than one transaction with a counterparty and there is a legally enforceable master netting agreement in place, the exposure represents the net of the gain and loss positions with and collateral received from and/or posted to that counterparty. All hedging interest rate swap derivatives traded by Regions are subject to mandatory clearing. The counterparty risk for cleared trades effectively moves from the executing broker to the clearinghouse allowing Regions to benefit from the risk mitigation controls in place at the respective clearinghouse. The &#8220;Credit Risk&#8221; section in Regions&#8217; Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 contains more information on the management of credit risk. 

Regions also uses derivatives to meet the needs of its customers. Interest rate swaps, interest rate options and foreign exchange forwards are the most common derivatives sold to customers. Other derivative instruments with similar characteristics are used to hedge market risk and minimize volatility associated with this portfolio. Instruments used to service customers are held in the trading account, with changes in value recorded in the consolidated statements of income. 

The primary objective of Regions&#8217; hedging strategies is to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes, from an economic perspective, on net interest income and the net present value of its balance sheet. The overall effectiveness of these hedging strategies is subject to market conditions, the quality of Regions&#8217; execution, the accuracy of its valuation assumptions, counterparty credit risk and changes in interest rates. 

See Note 9 "Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities" to the consolidated financial statements for a tabular summary of Regions&#8217; quarter-end derivatives positions and further discussion. 

Regions accounts for residential MSRs at fair market value with any changes to fair value being recorded within mortgage income. Regions enters into derivative transactions to economically mitigate the impact of market value fluctuations related to residential MSRs. Derivative instruments entered into in the future could be materially different from the current risk profile of Regions&#8217; current portfolio. 

LIBOR Transition &#8212;In 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that by the end of 2021, panel banks will no longer be required to submit estimates that are used to construct LIBOR, confirming that the continuation of LIBOR will not be guaranteed beyond that date. Regions holds instruments that may be impacted by the likely discontinuance of LIBOR, including loans, investments, derivative products, floating-rate obligations, and other financial instruments that use LIBOR as a benchmark rate. The Company has established a LIBOR Transition Program, which includes dedicated leadership and staff, with all relevant business lines and support groups engaged. As part of this program, the Company continues to identify, assess, and monitor risks associated with the discontinuation, unavailability, or non-representativeness of LIBOR. Regions is also coordinating with regulatory agencies and industry groups to identify appropriate alternative rates for contracts expiring after 2021, and preparing for this transition as it relates to both new and existing exposures. Significant uncertainty remains; however, steps to mitigate risks associated with the transition are being overseen by Regions&#8217; Executive LIBOR Steering Committee. Continuing activities of the LIBOR Transition Program include facilitating the transition of all financial and strategic processes, systems, and models; performing assessments of the transition&#8217;s impact to contracts and products; evaluating necessary operational and infrastructure enhancements to implement alternative benchmark rates; and coordinating communications with customers. In the third quarter of 2020, Regions adopted temporary accounting relief for affected transactions that reference LIBOR. See Note 13 &#8220;Recent Accounting Pronouncements&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements for details. 

MARKET RISK&#8212;PREPAYMENT RISK 

Regions, like most financial institutions, is subject to changing prepayment speeds on mortgage-related assets under different interest rate environments. Prepayment risk is a significant risk to earnings and specifically to net interest income . For example, mortgage loans and other financial assets may be prepaid by a debtor, so that the debtor may refinance its obligations at lower rates. As loans and other financial assets prepay in a falling rate environment, Regions must reinvest these funds in lower-yielding assets. Prepayments of assets carrying higher rates reduce Regions&#8217; interest income and overall asset yields. Conversely, in a rising rate environment, these assets will prepay at a slower rate, resulting in opportunity cost by not having the cash flow to reinvest at higher rates. Prepayment risk can also impact the value of securities and the carrying value of equity. Regions&#8217; greatest exposures to prepayment risks primarily rest in its mortgage-backed securities portfolio, the mortgage fixed-rate loan portfolio and the residential MSR, all of which tend to be sensitive to interest rate movements. Each of these assets is also exposed to prepayment risk due to factors which are not necessarily the result of interest rates, but rather due to changes in policies or programs related, either directly or indirectly, to the U.S. Government's governance over certain lending and financing within the mortgage market. Such policies can work to either encourage or discourage financing dynamics and represent a risk that is extremely difficult to forecast and may be the result of non-economic factors. The Company attempts to monitor and manage such exposures within reasonable expectations while acknowledging all such risks cannot be foreseen or avoided. Further, Regions has prepayment risk that would be reflected in non-interest income in the form of servicing income on the residential MSRs. Regions actively monitors prepayment exposure as part of its overall net interest income forecasting and interest rate risk management.

Liquidity is an important factor in the financial condition of Regions and affects Regions&#8217; ability to meet the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal requirements of its customers. Regions maintains strong liquidity levels that position the Company to respond to stressed environments. As discussed below, Regions has a variety of liquidity sources, which it continues to utilize to fund customer needs. 

On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law as a response to the economic uncertainty amid the COVID-19 pandemic. A focus of the Act is the establishment of federally guaranteed loans for small businesses under the PPP. Regions, a certified SBA lender, has and will continue to assist its customers through the process of utilizing this program. As a lending institution in this program, additional liquidity is available to the Company through the Federal Reserve's Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility. As of September 30, 2020, Regions has not used the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility. 

Regions intends to fund its obligations primarily through cash generated from normal operations. Regions also has obligations related to potential litigation contingencies. See Note 12 "Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees" to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the Company&#8217;s funding requirements. 

Assets, consisting principally of loans and securities, are funded by customer deposits, borrowed funds and shareholders&#8217; equity. Regions&#8217; goal in liquidity management is to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, while at the same time meeting the Company&#8217;s cash flow needs in normal and stressed conditions. Having and using various sources of liquidity to satisfy the Company&#8217;s funding requirements is important. 

In order to ensure an appropriate level of liquidity is maintained, Regions performs specific procedures including scenario analyses and stress testing at the bank, holding company, and affiliate levels. Regions' liquidity policy requires the holding company to maintain cash sufficient to cover the greater of (1) 18 months of debt service and other cash needs or (2) a minimum cash balance of $500 million. Cash and cash equivalents at the holding company totaled $2.5 billion at September 30, 2020 . Compliance with the holding company cash requirements is reported to the Risk Committee of the Board on a quarterly basis. Regions also has minimum liquidity requirements for the Bank and subsidiaries. These minimum requirements are informed by internal stress testing measures which are reflective of Regions' portfolio and business mix. The Bank's funding and contingency planning does not currently assume any reliance on short-term unsecured sources. Risk limits are established by the Board through its Risk Appetite Statement and Liquidity Policy. The Company's Board, LROC and ALCO regularly review compliance with the established limits. 

The securities portfolio is one of Regions&#8217; primary sources of liquidity. Proceeds from maturities and principal and interest payments of securities provide a constant flow of funds available for cash needs (see Note 2 "Debt Securities" to the consolidated financial statements). The agency guaranteed mortgage-backed securities portfolio is another source of liquidity in various secured borrowing capacities. 

Maturities in the loan portfolio also provide a steady flow of funds. Regions&#8217; liquidity is further enhanced by its relatively stable customer deposit base. Liquidity needs can also be met by borrowing funds in state and national money markets, although Regions does not assume reliance on short-term unsecured sources of funding. 

The balance with the FRB is the primary component of the balance sheet line item, &#8220;interest-bearing deposits in other banks.&#8221; At September 30, 2020 , Regions had approximately $11.4 billion in cash on deposit with the FRB, an increase from approximately $2.5 billion at December 31, 2019 , due to the significant increase in deposits associated with government programs offered in relation to COVID-19. Refer to the "Cash and Cash Equivalents" section for more information. 

Regions&#8217; borrowing availability with the FRB as of September 30, 2020 , based on assets pledged as collateral on that date, was $13.7 billion. 

Regions&#8217; financing arrangement with the FHLB adds additional flexibility in managing the Company's liquidity position. As of September 30, 2020 , Regions had no FHLB borrowings and its total borrowing capacity from the FHLB totaled approximately $16.8 billion. FHLB borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral pledged to the FHLB. Regions Bank pledged certain eligible securities and loans as collateral for the outstanding FHLB advances. Additionally, investment in FHLB stock is required in relation to the level of outstanding borrowings. The FHLB has been and is expected to continue to be a reliable and economical source of funding. 

Regions maintains a shelf registration statement with the SEC that can be utilized by Regions to issue various debt and/or equity securities. Additionally, Regions' Board has authorized Regions Bank to issue up to $10 billion in aggregate principal amount of bank notes outstanding at any one time. Refer to Note 12 "Borrowings" to the consolidated financial statements in the 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 

Regions may, from time to time, consider opportunistically retiring outstanding issued securities, including subordinated debt in privately negotiated or open market transactions for cash or common shares. Regulatory approval would be required for retirement of some instruments. 

CREDIT RISK 

Regions&#8217; objective regarding credit risk is to maintain a credit portfolio that provides for stable credit costs with acceptable volatility through an economic cycle. Regions has various processes to manage credit risk as described below. In order to assess the risk profile of the loan portfolio, Regions considers risk factors within the loan portfolio segments and classes, the current U.S. economic environment and that of its primary banking markets, as well as counterparty risk. See the &#8220;Portfolio Characteristics&#8221; section of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for a discussion of risk characteristics of each loan type. 

INFORMATION SECURITY RISK 

Regions faces a variety of operational risks, including information security risks. Information security risks, such as evolving and adaptive cyber attacks that are conducted regularly against Regions and other large financial institutions to compromise or disable information systems, have generally increased in recent years. This trend is expected to continue for a number of reasons, including the proliferation of new technologies, increase in technology-based products and services used by us and our customers, the growing use of mobile devices and cloud technologies, the ability to conduct more financial transactions online, and the increasing sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists and other external parties or fraud on the part of employees. 

Regions devotes significant financial and non-financial resources to identify and mitigate threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of its information systems. Regions regularly assesses the threats and vulnerabilities to its environment, so it can update and maintain its systems and controls to effectively mitigate these risks. Layered security controls are designed to complement each other to protect customer information and transactions. Regions regularly tests its control environment utilizing practices such as penetration testing and more targeted assessments to ensure its controls are working as expected. Regions will continue to commit the resources necessary to mitigate these growing cyber risks, as well as continue to develop and enhance controls, processes and technology to respond to evolving disruptive technology and to protect its systems from attacks or unauthorized access. In addition, Regions maintains a strong commitment to a comprehensive risk management program that includes due diligence and oversight of third-party relationships with vendors. 

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Regions has experienced a modest increase in cyber events, such as phishing attacks and malicious traffic from outside the United States. However, the Company's layered control environment has effectively detected and prevented any material impact related to these events. 

Regions&#8217; system of internal controls also incorporates an organization-wide protocol for the appropriate reporting and escalation of information security matters to management and the Board, to ensure effective and efficient resolution and, if necessary, disclosure of any matters. The Board is actively engaged in the oversight of Regions&#8217; continuous efforts to reinforce and enhance its operational resilience and receives education to ensure that their oversight efforts accommodate for the ever-evolving information security threat landscape. The Board monitors Regions&#8217; information management risk policies and practices primarily through its Risk Committee, which oversees areas of operational risk such as information technology activities; risks associated with development, infrastructure, and cybersecurity; approval and oversight of internal and third-party information security risk assessments, strategies, policies and programs; and disaster recovery, business continuity, and incident response plans. Additionally, the Board&#8217;s Audit Committee regularly reviews Regions&#8217; cybersecurity practices, mainly by receiving reports on the cybersecurity management program prepared by the Chief Information Security Officer, Risk Management, and Internal Audit. The Board annually reviews the information security program and, through its various committees, is briefed at least quarterly on information security matters. 

Regions participates in information sharing organizations such as FS-ISAC, to gather and share information with peer banks and other financial institutions to better prepare and protect its information systems from attack. FS-ISAC is a nonprofit organization whose objective is to protect the financial services sector against cyber and physical threats and risk. It acts as a trusted third party that provides anonymity to allow members to submit threat, vulnerability and incident information in a non-attributable and trusted manner so information that would normally not be shared is instead made available to other members for the greater good of the membership. In addition to FS-ISAC, Regions is a member of BITS. BITS serves the financial community and its members by providing industry best practices on a variety of security and fraud topics. 

Regions has contracts with vendors to provide denial of service mitigation. These vendors have also committed the necessary resources to support Regions in the event of a cyber event. Even though Regions devotes significant resources to combat cyber security risks, there is no guarantee that these measures will provide absolute security. As an additional security measure, Regions has engaged a computer forensics firm and an industry-leading consulting firm on retainer in case of a cyber event. Regions has also developed and maintains robust business continuity and disaster recovery plans that it could implement in the event of a cyber event to mitigate the effects of any such event and minimize necessary recovery time. Some of Regions' financial risk exposure with respect to data breaches may be offset by applicable insurance. 

Even if Regions successfully prevents cyber attacks to its own network, the Company may still incur losses that result from customers' account information being obtained through breaches of retailers' networks where customers have transacted business. The fraud losses, as well as the costs of investigations and re-issuing new customer cards, may impact Regions' financial results. In addition, Regions also relies on some vendors to provide certain components of its business infrastructure, and although Regions actively assesses and monitors the information security capabilities of these vendors, Regions' reliance on them may also increase exposure to information security risk. 

In the event of a cyber-attack or other data breach, Regions may be required to incur significant expenses, including with respect to remediation costs, costs of implementing additional preventative measures, addressing any reputational harm and addressing any related regulatory inquiries or civil litigation arising from the event. 

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES 

The provision for credit losses is used to maintain the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit losses at a level that in management&#8217;s judgment is appropriate to absorb expected credit losses over the contractual life of the loan and credit commitment portfolio at the balance sheet date. Regions adopted CECL on January 1, 2020. Upon adoption, Regions classified the provision for unfunded credit losses as provision for credit losses. Prior to 2020, the provision for unfunded credit losses was included in non-interest expense. The provision for credit losses totaled $113 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the provision for loan losses of $ 108 million during the third quarter of 2019 . The provision for credit losses totaled $1.4 billion for the first nine months of 2020 compared to the provision for loan losses of $291 million during the first nine months of 2019 . Refer to the "Allowance for Credit Losses" section for further detail.

In the third quarter of 2020, the equity investee executed an initial public offering. However, the Company is subject to a conventional post-issuance 180 day lock-up period, which prevents the sale of its position. 

&#160; 

Service charges on deposit accounts&#8212; Service charges on deposit accounts include non-sufficient fund and overdraft fees, corporate analysis service charges, overdraft protection fees and other customer transaction-related service charges. The decrease s during the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 compared to the same periods of 2019 were the result of lower customer spending due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Government stimulus programs resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic aided in the increase of customer deposits, elevation of customer liquidity and also resulted in a reduction in overdraft charges. Although 

consumer spending has begun to normalize, if spend levels continue at the current pace, service charges on deposit accounts will continue to be negatively impacted in comparison to the prior year levels. See the "Third Quarter Overview" section for further detail. 

Card and ATM fees&#8212; Card and ATM fees include the combined amounts of credit card/bank card income and debit card and ATM related revenue. In the third quarter of 2020, card and ATM fees recovered to prior year levels, primarily driven by debit card spending. However, card and ATM fees decrease d for the first nine months of 2020 as compared to the same period of 2019 . The decline was due to decreases in bank card and consumer credit card income in the first and second quarters of 2020 as a result of declines in debit and credit card spending and transaction volumes associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Although card and ATM fees are beginning to recover, if fee levels continue at the current pace, they will continue to be lower on a year-to-date basis as compared to the prior year levels. 

Capital markets income&#8212; Capital markets income primarily relates to capital raising activities that include securities underwriting and placement, loan syndication and placement, as well as foreign exchange, derivatives, merger and acquisition and other advisory services. The increase s in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 , compared to the same periods of 2019 , were primarily driven by increases in debt and equity underwriting and positive market-related credit valuation adjustments tied to credit derivatives within commercial swap income. During both the third quarter of 2020 and first nine months of 2020, positive valuation adjustments totaled $5 million , compared to negative adjustments of $6 million for the third quarter of 2019 and $15 million the first nine months of 2019. Capital markets income also benefited from an increase in fees generated from the placement of permanent financing for real estate during the the first nine months of 2020 as compared to the first nine months of the prior year. 

Mortgage income&#8212; Mortgage income is generated through the origination and servicing of residential mortgage loans for long-term investors and sales of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. The increase s in mortgage income in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 compared to the same periods of 2019 were due to increased loan production and sales income as lower interest rates during the current quarter and first nine months of 2020 drove higher loan application volume. 

Bank-owned life insurance&#8212; Bank-owned life insurance decrease d in the first nine months of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 due primarily to a decrease in claims benefits in the first quarter of 2020 and favorable market adjustments in the first quarter of 2019. 

Securities gains (losses), net&#8212; Net securities gains (losses) primarily result from the Company's asset/liability management process. See Table 1 "Debt Securities" section for additional information. 

Market value adjustments on employee benefit assets&#8212; Market value adjustments on employee benefit assets, both defined benefit and other, are the reflection of market value variations related to assets held for certain employee benefits. The adjustments reported as employee benefit assets - other are offset in salaries and benefits. Changes to market valuation adjustments in 2020 compared to 2019 were driven by the overall performance of the equity markets. Furthermore, the Company repositioned its defined employee benefits assets portfolio during the second quarter of 2019 into investments that are no longer subject to the volatility of the equity markets. 

Valuation gain on equity investment&#8212; Valuation gain on equity investment is associated with an unrealized holding gain on an equity investment in a company which executed an initial public offering during the third quarter of 2020. However, the Company is subject to a conventional post-issuance 180-day lockup period, which prevents the sale of its position and is therefore reflected in the investment valuation . 

Other miscellaneous income &#8212;Other miscellaneous income includes net revenue from affordable housing, valuation adjustments to equity investments (other than the item referenced above), fees from safe deposit boxes, check fees and other miscellaneous income. Net revenue from affordable housing includes actual gains and losses resulting from the sale of affordable housing investments, cash distributions from the investments and any related impairment charges.

(1) Upon adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, the provision for credit losses presented within net interest income after provision for credit losses is the sum of the provision for loan losses and the provision for unfunded credit commitments. Prior to the adoption of CECL, the provision for unfunded commitments was included in other non-interest expense. 

Salaries and employee benefits&#8212; Salaries and employee benefits consist of salaries, incentive compensation, long-term incentives, payroll taxes, and other employee benefits such as 401(k), pension, and medical, life and disability insurance, as well as, expenses from liabilities held for employee benefit purposes. Salaries and employee benefits increase d during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 , driven primarily by higher production-based incentives, the addition of associates through the Company's April 2020 equipment finance acquisition and annual merit raises that occurred in the second quarter of 2020. Also contributing to the increase for the first nine months of 2020 was increased pay related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Full-time equivalent headcount increased to 19,766 at September 30, 2020 from 19,549 at September 30, 

2019 , primarily due to the addition of approximately 450 associates from the Company's April 2020 equipment finance acquisition offset by headcount reductions elsewhere. 

Net occupancy expense&#8212; Net occupancy expense includes rent, depreciation, ad valorem taxes, utilities, insurance, and maintenance. Net occupancy expense decreased during the first nine months of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to lower operating expenses resulting from the shelter in place orders during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Furniture and equipment expense&#8212; Furniture and equipment expense includes depreciation, maintenance and repairs, rent, taxes, and other expenses of equipment utilized by Regions and its affiliates. Furniture and equipment expense increase d during the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 primarily due to increases in rental expenses and maintenance and repairs related to investments in technology.

INCOME TAXES 

The Company&#8217;s income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2020 was $104 million compared to $107 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 , resulting in effective tax rates of 16.5 percent and 20.6 percent, respectively. The income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was $99 million compared to $305 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 , resulting in effective tax rates of 17.1 percent and 20.3 percent, respectively. The effective tax rates are lower in both current year periods due primarily to a consistent level of permanent income tax preferences having a proportionally larger impact relative to pre&#8211;tax earnings, which were negatively impacted in the current year because of the COVID&#8211;19 pandemic. 

Many factors impact the effective tax rate including, but not limited to, the level of pre-tax income, the mix of income between various tax jurisdictions with differing tax rates, net tax benefits related to affordable housing investments, bank-owned life insurance, tax-exempt interest, and nondeductible expenses. In addition, the effective tax rate is affected by items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period-to-period, such as the termination of certain leveraged leases, share-based payments, valuation allowance changes and changes to unrecognized tax benefits. Accordingly, the comparability of the effective tax rate between periods may be impacted. 

On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted CECL. This resulted in an adjustment to the opening balance of the allowance. The tax impact of this adjustment increased deferred tax assets by approximately $126 million. See Note 1 &#8220;Basis of Presentation&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements for further information. 

At September 30, 2020 , the Company reported a net deferred tax liability of $517 million compared to a net deferred tax liability of $328 million at December 31, 2019 . The increase in the net deferred tax liability was primarily due to an increase in unrealized gains on derivative instruments and available for sale securities, partially offset by an increase in the deferred tax asset related to the allowance. 

ASCENTIUM ACQUISITION 

On April 1, 2020, Regions completed its acquisition of an equipment finance company Ascentium Capital, LLC. The acquisition gives Regions the ability to increase business loans and leases to small business customers using Ascentium's tech-enabled same-day credit decision and funding capabilities. 

As a result of the acquisition Regions recorded approximately $2.4 billion of assets and assumed $1.9 billion of liabilities. Of the total assets acquired, $1.9 billion were loans and leases that are included in Regions' commercial and industrial loan portfolio. Of the liabilities assumed, $1.8 billion were long-term borrowings. Regions subsequently paid down a significant portion of the borrowings, and as of September 30, 2020 , $406 million of long-term debt remained. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at estimated fair value. 

These fair value estimates are considered preliminary as of September 30, 2020 . Fair value estimates, including loans, intangible assets and goodwill, are subject to change for up to one year after the acquisition date as additional information becomes available. 

Of the loans acquired, a portion were determined to be credit deteriorated on the date of purchase. Purchased loans that have experienced a more than insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination are considered to be credit deteriorated. PCD loans are initially recorded at purchase price less the ALLL recognized at acquisition. Subsequent credit loss activity is recorded within the provision for credit losses. 

Regions recorded PCD loans of $873 million as a result of the acquisition, which was reflective of a nominal discount. Regions recorded an ALLL related to these loans of $60 million, which was included in the total acquired asset value as part of the acquisition. 

The non-credit discount related to Ascentium's PCD loans and the fair value mark on non-PCD loans will be amortized to interest income over the contractual life of the loan using the effective interest method. The amortization will not be material. 

In conjunction with the acquisition, Regions initially recognized goodwill of $348 million and other intangible assets of $47 million. In the third quarter of 2020, goodwill declined $6 million due to purchase accounting adjustments. Intangible assets are comprised of trademarks, customer lists and other intangibles. Intangible assets will be amortized over the expected useful life of each recognized asset.
