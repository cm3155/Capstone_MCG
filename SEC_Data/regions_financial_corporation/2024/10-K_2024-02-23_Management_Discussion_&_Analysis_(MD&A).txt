 Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 

Management believes the following sections provide an overview of several of the most relevant matters necessary for an understanding of the financial aspects of Regions's business, particularly regarding its 2023 results. Cross references to more detailed information regarding each topic within MD&#38;A and the consolidated financial statements are included. This summary is intended to assist in understanding the information provided, but should be read in conjunction with the entire MD&#38;A and consolidated financial statements, as well as the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Economic Environment in Regions&#8217; Banking Markets 

After full-year 2023 growth of 2.5 percent, Regions' baseline forecast anticipates real GDP growth of 2.6 percent in 2024. While the Company did not have recession as its base forecast for 2023, the economy outperformed expectations, reflecting marked improvement on the supply side of the economy that allowed for faster growth and decelerating inflation. Growth is expected to be somewhat restrained over the first half of 2024 before picking up over the second half of the year. 

The labor market proved to be resilient in 2023. While the pace of job growth slowed over the course of the year, it was driven by a slower pace of hiring as opposed to a rising pace of layoffs. This pattern is expected to continue in 2024, with further slowing in the pace of job growth putting upward pressure on the unemployment rate, but the Company does not anticipate a significant, broad-based, and sustained spike in layoffs. 

A slowing pace of job growth will lead to further deceleration in growth of aggregate labor earnings, but growth in labor earnings is expected to continue to outpace inflation, thus providing support for consumer spending. Household balance sheets remain notably healthy, and the preponderance of fixed-rate debt on household balance sheets has been a buffer against the effects of higher interest rates. Full-year 2024 growth in real consumer spending is expected to be slightly faster than 2023 growth. 

Real business investment in equipment and machinery is expected to remain soft before picking up over the second half of 2024. At the same time, the wave of business spending on structures seen over much of 2023 is subsiding, to the point that real spending on structures is expected to offer little, if any, support for real GDP growth in 2024. After having been displaced by spending on structures in 2023, business investment in intellectual property products is expected to return to its usual role as the fastest growing segment of real business fixed investment. 

Higher mortgage interest rates weighed on single family construction and sales in 2023, but sales of new single family homes proved to be more resilient than anticipated driven by a combination of still-significant pent-up demand for home purchases and the lack of existing single family homes for sale. While mortgage rates have started to decline, helping to ease affordability constraints, it will likely not do much to unlock inventories of existing homes for sale. Builders should fare better in 2024 and real residential fixed investment should be a modest support for top-line real GDP growth in 2024. 

Further deceleration in inflation in 2024, driven by a slower pace of economic growth, a modestly rising unemployment rate, and the avoidance of disruptions to the supply side of the economy would be consistent with the FOMC beginning to cut the Fed funds rate even with inflation above their 2.0 percent target rate. The real, or, inflation-adjusted, current funds rate is meaningfully restrictive, and further deceleration in inflation without cuts in the Fed funds rate would effectively make policy more restrictive. As such, we expect four twenty-five basis point cuts in the Fed funds rate by year-end 2024. 

Patterns of economic activity within the Regions footprint are expected to be broadly similar to those seen for the U.S. as a whole. A number of in-footprint states have seen heightened flows of domestic in-migration since the onset of the pandemic, which has resulted in more rapid rates of job growth and more rapid growth in housing costs. If, as Regions anticipates, the broader economy slows and labor market conditions loosen, it could be that migration patterns will shift over coming quarters. Job growth for the Company's footprint as a whole is expected to be faster than that for the U.S. as a whole. Some of the metro areas which had, prior to the increase in mortgage interest rates, seen the largest increases in house prices could experience declining house prices, but continued robust population growth in these markets will help stem the extent of any such declines. 

The continued economic uncertainty, as described above, impacted Regions' forecast utilized in calculating the ACL as of December 31, 2023. See the "Allowance" section for further information. 

2023 Results 

Regions reported net income available to common shareholders of $2.0 billion or $2.11 per diluted share in 2023 compared to net income available to common shareholders of $2.1 billion or $2.28 per diluted share in 2022. 

Net interest income (taxable-equivalent basis) totaled $5.4 billion in 2023 compared to $4.8 billion in 2022. The net interest margin (taxable-equivalent basis) was 3.90 percent in 2023, reflecting a 54 basis point increase from 2022. The increase in net interest income was primarily driven by a significant increase in market interest rates and average loan growth. Deposit mix and pricing normalization combined with higher overall funding costs, which are expected in a rising rate environment, partially offset the increases in net interest income. 

The provision for credit losses totaled $553 million in 2023 compared to $271 million in 2022. The provision for credit losses was higher than net charge-offs by $156 million in 2023. The increase in the provision for credit losses was driven primarily by adverse risk migration and continued credit normalization, as well as a build in qualitative adjustments for incremental risk in higher risk portfolios. Refer to the "Allowance for Credit Losses" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis for further detail. 

Non-interest income was $2.3 billion in 2023 compared to $2.4 billion in 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by lower capital markets income, service charges on deposit accounts and mortgage income partially offset by an increase in market valuation adjustments on employee benefit assets. See Table 4 "Non-Interest Income" for further details. 

Non-interest expense was $4.4 billion in 2023 and $4.1 billion in 2022. The increase was driven by an increase in FDIC insurance assessments primarily related to the special assessment, operational losses, and salaries and employee benefits. These increases were partially offset by a decline in professional, legal and regulatory expenses related to a settled matter with the CFPB in 2022. See Table 5 "Non-Interest Expense" for further details. 

Regions' effective tax rate was 20.5 percent in 2023 compared to 22.0 percent in 2022. See the "Income Taxes" section for further details.

Capital 

Capital Actions 

Regions participates in supervisory stress testing conducted by the Federal Reserve and its SCB is currently floored at 2.5 percent. See Note 14 "Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)" to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding CCAR results. 

On April 20, 2022, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of the Company's common stock, permitting purchases from the second quarter of 2022 through the fourth quarter of 2024. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Regions repurchased approximately 16 million shares of common stock under these programs, which reduced shareholders' equity by $252 million.

Regulatory Capital 

Regions and Regions Bank are required to comply with regulatory capital requirements established by Federal and State banking agencies. Under the Basel III Rules, Regions is designated as a standardized approach bank. The Basel III Rules maintain the minimum guidelines for Regions to be considered well-capitalized for Tier 1 capital and Total capital at 6.0% and 10.0%, respectively. At December 31, 2023, Regions&#8217; Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios were estimated to be 11.57% and 13.35%, respectively. 

The Basel III Rules also officially defined CET1. Regions' CET1 ratio at December 31, 2023 was estimated to be 10.26%.

&#8226; Note 12 "Regulatory Capital Requirements and Restrictions" to the consolidated financial statements 

Loan Portfolio and Credit 

During 2023, total loans increased by $1.4 billion or 1.4 percent compared to 2022. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in the consumer portfolio of $1.2 billion, with the combined balance of commercial and investor real estate loans also increasing by $198 million. The increase in consumer loans reflects growth in residential first mortgage and in other consumer loans, which was driven by consumer home improvement loans. Refer to the "Portfolio Characteristics" section for further discussion. 

Net charge-offs totaled $397 million, or 0.40 percent of average loans, in 2023, compared to $263 million, or 0.29 percent in 2022, with both periods reflecting an increase in consumer charge-offs due to the sale of loan portfolios. In 2023 and 2022, adjusted net charge-offs (non-GAAP) totaled $362 million, or 0.37 percent, and $200 million, or 0.22 percent, respectively. See Table 1 "GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations for additional information. Commercial and industrial net charge-offs also increased from 2022 to 2023. The allowance was 1.73 percent of total loans, net of unearned income at December 31, 2023, an increase from 1.63 percent at December 31, 2022. The coverage ratio of allowance to non-performing loans excluding held for sale was 211 percent at December 31, 2023, compared to 317 percent at December 31, 2022.

Liquidity 

At the end of 2023, Regions Bank had $4.2 billion in cash on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank and the loan-to-deposit ratio was 77 percent. Cash and cash equivalents at the parent company totaled $1.9 billion. Cash at the Federal Reserve declined from December 31, 2022 due to an expected decline in deposits, as well as growth in loans. 

At December 31, 2023, the Company&#8217;s borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve was $21.3 billion based on available collateral. Borrowing availability with the FHLB was $15.1 billion based on available collateral at the same date. Regions also maintains a shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that can be utilized by the Company to issue various debt and/or equity securities. Additionally, Regions' Board has authorized Regions Bank to issue up to $10 billion in aggregate principal amount of bank notes outstanding at any one time. 

Regions is required to conduct liquidity stress testing and measure its available sources of liquidity against minimums as established by Regions' internal liquidity policy. Regions was fully compliant with those requirements as of year-end.

GENERAL 

The following discussion and financial information is presented to aid in understanding Regions&#8217; financial position and results of operations. The emphasis of this discussion will be on operations for the years 2023 and 2022; in addition, financial information for prior years will also be presented when appropriate. 

Regions&#8217; profitability, like that of many other financial institutions, is dependent on its ability to generate revenue from net interest income as well as non-interest income sources. Net interest income is primarily the difference between the interest income Regions receives on interest-earning assets, such as loans, leases, investment securities and cash balances held at the Federal Reserve Bank, and the interest expense Regions pays on interest-bearing liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. Regions&#8217; net interest income is impacted by the size and mix of its balance sheet components and the interest rate spread between interest earned on its assets and interest paid on its liabilities. Non-interest income includes fees from service charges on deposit accounts, card and ATM fees, mortgage servicing and secondary marketing, investment management and trust activities, capital markets and other customer services which Regions provides. Results of operations are also affected by the provision for credit losses and non-interest expenses such as salaries and employee benefits, equipment and software expenses, occupancy, professional, legal and regulatory expenses, FDIC insurance assessments, and other operating expenses, as well as income taxes. 

Economic conditions, competition, new legislation and related rules impacting regulation of the financial services industry and the monetary and fiscal policies of the Federal government significantly affect most, if not all, financial institutions, including Regions. Lending and deposit activities and fee income generation are influenced by levels of business spending and investment, consumer income, consumer spending and savings, capital market activities, and competition among financial institutions, as well as customer preferences, interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing products in Regions&#8217; market areas. 

Regions&#8217; business strategy is focused on providing a competitive mix of products and services, delivering quality customer service, and continuing to develop and optimize distribution channels that include a branch distribution network with offices in convenient locations, as well as electronic and mobile banking. 

Business Segments 

Regions provides traditional commercial, retail and mortgage banking services, as well as other financial services in the fields of asset management, wealth management, securities brokerage, and other specialty financing. Regions carries out its strategies and derives its profitability from three reportable segments: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management, with the remainder in Other. 

See Note 22 "Business Segment Information" to the consolidated financial statements for further information on Regions&#8217; business segments. 

NON-GAAP MEASURES 

The table below presents computations of earnings and certain other financial measures, which excludes certain adjustments that are included in the financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures include "adjusted net loan charge-offs", "adjusted net loan charge-offs as a percent of average loans, annualized", "adjusted non-interest expense", "adjusted non-interest income", "adjusted total revenue", and "adjusted total revenue, taxable-equivalent basis". Regions believes that excluding certain items provides a meaningful base for period-to-period comparison, which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the Company and predicting future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of Regions&#8217; business because management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments to be indications of ongoing operations. Regions believes that presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the Company on the same basis as that applied by management. Management and the Board utilize these non-GAAP financial measures as follows: 

&#8226; Preparation of Regions&#8217; operating budgets 

&#8226; Monthly financial performance reporting 

&#8226; Monthly close-out reporting of consolidated results 

&#8226; Presentations to investors of Company performance 

&#8226; Metrics for incentive compensation 

Net loan charge-offs (GAAP) are presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted net loan-charge offs (non-GAAP). Adjusted net loan charge-offs as a percentage of average loans (non-GAAP) are calculated as adjusted net loan charge-offs (non-GAAP) divided by average loans (GAAP) and annualized. Non-interest expense (GAAP) is presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP). Net interest income (GAAP) is presented with taxable-equivalent adjustments to arrive at net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis (GAAP). Non-interest income (GAAP) is 

presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP). Net interest income (GAAP) and adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP) are added together to arrive at adjusted total revenue (non-GAAP). Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis (GAAP) and adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP) are added together to arrive at adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis (non-GAAP). 

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP. In particular, a measure of earnings that excludes selected items does not represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to shareholders. 

The following table provides: 1) a reconciliation of net loan charge-offs (GAAP) to adjusted net loan charge-offs (non-GAAP), 2) a computation of adjusted net loan charge-offs as a percentage of average loans, annualized (non-GAAP). 3) a reconciliation of non-interest expense (GAAP) to adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP), 4) a reconciliation of non-interest income (GAAP) to adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP), 5) a computation of adjusted total revenue (non-GAAP), and 6) a computation of adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis (non-GAAP).

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND RELATED POLICIES 

In preparing financial information, management is required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses for the periods shown. The accounting principles followed by Regions and the methods of applying these principles conform with GAAP, regulatory guidance, where applicable, and general banking practices. Estimates and assumptions most significant to Regions are related primarily to the allowance for credit losses, fair value measurements, intangible assets (goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets), residential MSRs and income taxes, and are summarized in the following discussion and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses (&#8220;allowance&#8221;) consists of two components: the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments. Unfunded credit commitments include items such as letters of credit, financial guarantees and binding unfunded loan commitments. Regions determines its allowance in accordance with GAAP and applicable regulatory guidance. 

See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and Note 5 "Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements for information about areas of judgment and methodologies used in establishing the allowance. 

The allowance is sensitive to a number of internal factors, such as changes in the mix and level of loan balances outstanding, portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings. The allowance is also sensitive to external factors such as the general health of the economy, as evidenced by changes in interest rates, inflation, GDP, unemployment rates, changes in real estate demand and values, volatility in commodity prices, bankruptcy filings, health pandemics, government stimulus, and the effects of weather and natural disasters such as droughts, floods and hurricanes. 

Management considers these variables and all other available information when establishing the final level of the allowance. These variables and others have the ability to result in actual loan losses that differ from the originally estimated amounts. 

Changes in the factors used by management to determine the appropriateness of the allowance or the availability of new information could cause the allowance to be increased or decreased in future periods. In addition, bank regulatory agencies, as part of their examination process, may require changes in the level of allowance based on their judgments and estimates. Volatility in certain credit metrics is to be expected. Additionally, changes in circumstances related to individually large credits, commodity prices, or certain macroeconomic forecast assumptions may result in volatility. The scenarios discussed below, or other scenarios, have the ability to result in actual credit losses that differ, perhaps materially, from the originally estimated amounts. This analysis is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled loss estimates to reflect uncertainty and imprecision based on then-current circumstances and conditions. 

It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one economic factor might affect the overall allowance because a wide variety of factors and inputs are considered in the allowance estimate. Changes in the factors and inputs may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all product types. Additionally, changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others. However, to consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate economic forecast, Regions estimated the allowance using a scenario that was one standard deviation unfavorable to the expected scenario for each macroeconomic variable. This unfavorable scenario resulted in an allowance approximately 16 percent higher than the allowance using the expected scenario. 

Similar to the scenarios above, it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in credit risk factors might affect the overall allowance because of the wide variety of credit risk factors that are considered in estimating the allowance. Changes in risk ratings may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across product or industry types. Regions conducted a separate sensitivity analysis considering deteriorating conditions for commercial and investor real estate portfolio factors by stressing key portfolio drivers relative to the baseline portfolio conditions. Regions stressed risk ratings by one downgrade for commercial and investor real estate loans. This scenario generated an increase in the modeled allowance of approximately $185 million for the commercial and investor real estate portfolios. 

Fair Value Measurements 

A portion of the Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities is carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded either in earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). These include debt securities available for sale, mortgage loans held for sale, equity investments (with and without readily determinable market values), residential MSRs and derivative assets and liabilities. From time to time, the estimation of fair value also affects other loans held for sale, which are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. Fair value determination is also relevant for certain other assets such as foreclosed property and other real estate, which are recorded at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan/property or fair value, less estimated costs to sell the property. For example, the fair value of other real estate is determined based on recent appraisals by third parties and other market information, less estimated selling costs. Adjustments to the appraised value are made if management becomes aware of changes in the fair value of specific properties or property types. The determination of fair value also impacts certain other assets that are periodically evaluated for impairment using fair value estimates, including goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. 

Fair value is generally defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) as opposed to the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability (an entry price), in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. While management uses judgment when determining the price at which willing market participants would transact when there has been a significant decrease in the volume or level of activity for the asset or liability in relation to &#8220;normal&#8221; market activity, management&#8217;s objective is to determine the point within the range of fair value estimates that is most representative of a sale to a third-party investor under current market conditions. The value to the Company if the asset or liability were held to maturity is not included in the fair value estimates. 

A fair value measure should reflect the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including the assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique, the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset and the risk of nonperformance. Fair value is measured based on a variety of inputs the Company utilizes. Fair value may be based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets (Level 1 valuations). If market prices are not available, quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market are used (Level 2 valuations). Where observable market data is not available, the valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market, but observable based on Company-specific data (Level 3 valuations). These unobservable assumptions reflect the Company&#8217;s own estimates for assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques typically include option 

pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques, but may also include the use of market prices of assets or liabilities that are not directly comparable to the subject asset or liability. 

See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of determining fair value, including pricing validation processes. 

Intangible Assets 

Regions&#8217; intangible assets consist primarily of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of acquired businesses (&#8220;goodwill&#8221;) and other identifiable intangible assets (primarily relationship assets and agency commercial real estate licenses). Goodwill totaled $5.7 billion at both December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Goodwill is allocated to each of Regions&#8217; reportable segments (each a reporting unit: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management). Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1 or more often if events and circumstances indicate impairment may exist (refer to Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion). 

The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2023; the Company elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level to determine whether the fair value exceeded the carrying value. In performing the quantitative assessment, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was determined using a blend of both income and market approaches. 

The results of the goodwill impairment test did not require Regions to record a goodwill impairment charge as all three reporting units continued to have a fair value in excess of carrying value. 

Other identifiable intangible assets such as relationship assets and agency commercial real estate licenses are reviewed at least annually (usually in the fourth quarter) for events or circumstances which could impact the recoverability of the intangible asset. These events could include loss of customer relationships, increased competition, or adverse changes in the economy. To the extent an other identifiable intangible asset is deemed unrecoverable, an impairment loss would be recorded to reduce the carrying amount. These events or circumstances, if they occur, could be material to Regions&#8217; operating results for any particular reporting period but the potential impact cannot be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2023, the Company&#8217;s review indicated there was no impairment in the value of the other identifiable intangible assets. 

Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights 

Regions has elected to measure and report its residential MSRs using the fair value method. Although sales of residential MSRs do occur, residential MSRs do not trade in an active market with readily observable market prices and the exact terms and conditions of sales may not be readily available, and are therefore Level 3 valuations in the fair value hierarchy previously discussed in the "Fair Value Measurements" section. Specific characteristics of the underlying loans greatly impact the estimated value of the related residential MSRs. As a result, Regions stratifies its residential mortgage servicing portfolio on the basis of certain risk characteristics, including loan type and contractual note rate, and values its residential MSRs using discounted cash flow modeling techniques. These techniques require management to make estimates regarding future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration historical and forecasted residential mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rates, escrow balances and servicing costs. Changes in interest rates, prepayment speeds or other factors impact the fair value of residential MSRs which impacts earnings. Refer to Note 6 "Servicing of Financial Assets" to the consolidated financial statements for quantitative disclosures reflecting the effect that changes in management's assumptions would have on the fair value of residential MSRs. 

Refer to Note 6 "Servicing of Financial Assets" to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure on residential mortgage servicing rights. 

Income Taxes 

Accrued income taxes are reported as a component of either other assets or other liabilities, as appropriate, in the consolidated balance sheets and reflect management&#8217;s estimate of income taxes to be paid or received. The Company is subject to income tax in the U.S. and multiple state and local jurisdictions. The tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction are complex and may be subject to different interpretations by the Company and the relevant government taxing authorities. Therefore, the Company is required to exercise judgment in determining tax accruals and evaluating the Company&#8217;s tax positions, including evaluating uncertain tax positions. 

Deferred income taxes represent the amount of future income taxes to be paid or received and are accounted for using the asset and liability method with the net balance reported in other assets or other liabilities, as appropriate, in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company determines the realization of deferred tax assets by considering all positive and negative evidence available, including the impact of recent operating results, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards and tax planning strategies. In projecting future taxable income, the Company utilizes forecasted pre-tax earnings, adjusts for the estimated temporary differences and incorporates assumptions, including the amounts of income allocable to taxing jurisdictions. Determining whether deferred tax assets are realizable is subjective and requires the use of significant judgment. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more-likely- 

than-not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company currently maintains a valuation allowance for certain state carryforwards. 

The Company&#8217;s estimate of accrued income taxes, deferred income taxes and income tax expense can also change in any period as a result of new legislative or judicial guidance impacting tax positions, as well as changes in income tax rates and changes in operating activities. Any changes, if they occur, can be significant to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and Note 19 "Income Taxes" to the consolidated financial statements for further details and discussion. 

OPERATING RESULTS 

NET INTEREST INCOME AND NET INTEREST MARGIN 

Net interest income is Regions&#8217; principal source of income and is one of the most important elements of Regions&#8217; ability to meet its overall performance goals. In 2023, balance sheet and net interest income performance were the result of post-pandemic normalization and tightening monetary policy, including a higher interest rate environment. Both net interest income and net interest margin are influenced by market interest rates and the FOMC increased the Fed funds rate by 100 basis points during the year ended December 31, 2023. See the "Executive Overview" for a discussion of recent FOMC activity and expectations for 2024 net interest income that incorporates anticipated FOMC activity. 

Net interest income (taxable-equivalent basis) increased by $538 million in 2023 compared to 2022, and net interest margin increased by 54 basis points to 3.90 percent in 2023. The increases in net interest income and net interest margin were driven primarily by significantly higher short-term and long-term market interest rates and average loan growth. The loan portfolio yield, inclusive of hedging impacts, increased to 5.86 percent in 2023 from 4.46 percent in 2022. The Company's loan yields are primarily influenced by short-term interest rates such as 30-day term SOFR, which averaged 4.98 percent in 2023 compared to 1.46 percent in 2022. Additionally, fixed-rate lending production which contains significant residential mortgage fixed-rate exposure, benefited from higher middle and long-term rates. While the Company temporarily slowed reinvestment within the investment securities portfolio for much of 2023, it had returned to full reinvestment by the fourth quarter. The investment securities portfolio benefited from rising rates, with the yield increasing to 2.38 percent in 2023 from 2.20 percent in 2022. 

Deposit and funding cost normalization, which are expected in a rising rate environment and were further influenced by bank industry stresses during the year, partially offset the increases in net interest income and net interest margin driven by loans and investment securities. In 2023, funding costs, which includes deposits and wholesale borrowings utilized during the year, increased to 1.19 percent compared to 0.23 percent in 2022. The increase in funding costs includes the impact of deposit remixing as depositors moved into higher interest earning products. Deposit costs increased to 99 basis points for 2023 compared to 14 basis points for 2022. 

Additionally, net interest margin benefited from earning asset remixing out of cash balances held with the Federal Reserve Bank, which are the primary component of interest-bearing deposits in other banks shown in Table 2. In 2022, elevated cash balances were held to fund anticipated, post-pandemic deposit outflows, reducing the net interest margin in that period. Cash balances largely returned to normal levels by the end of 2023. 

See also the "Market Risk-Interest Rate Risk" section in Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional information. 

Table 2 "Consolidated Average Daily Balances and Yield/Rate Analysis" presents a detail of net interest income (on a taxable-equivalent basis), the net interest margin, and the net interest spread.

______ 

Notes: 

&#8226; The change in interest not due solely to volume or yield/rate has been allocated to the volume column and yield/rate column in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each. 

&#8226; The computation of taxable-equivalent net interest income is based on the statutory federal income tax rate of 21%, adjusted for applicable state income taxes net of the related federal tax benefit. 

Annual changes in net interest income are due to changes in the interest rate environment, product pricing, balance sheet mix, and balance sheet growth. Over recent years, changes in the interest rate environment and the impact on product pricing and mix has been the primary contributor to changes in net interest income. The mix of earning assets can affect the interest rate spread. Regions&#8217; primary types of earning assets are loans and investment securities. Certain types of earning assets have historically generated larger spreads; for example, loans typically generate larger spreads than other assets, such as securities or interest-bearing deposits in other banks. Average earning assets in 2023 totaled $137.9 billion, a decrease of $6.1 billion as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in interest-bearing deposits in other banks offset by a growth in loans, net of unearned income. See the "Loans", "Debt Securities", and "Cash and Cash Equivalents" sections for further details. 

Average loans as a percentage of average earning assets was 71 percent and 64 percent in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The remaining categories of earning assets are shown in Table 2 "Consolidated Average Daily Balances and Yield/Rate Analysis". The proportion of average earning assets to average total assets, which was 90 percent in both 2023 and 2022, measures the effectiveness of management&#8217;s efforts to invest available funds into the most profitable earning instruments. 

The mix of interest-bearing liabilities can also affect the interest spread. Funding for Regions&#8217; earning assets comes from interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing sources. As previously discussed, in 2023 the Company experienced deposit balance declines and remixing into higher interest bearing deposit categories. As the percentage of earning assets funded by deposits declined during the year, the Company utilized short and long-term wholesale borrowings. The changes to interest-bearing liabilities partially offset increases to net interest income and margin. 

PROVISION FOR (BENEFIT FROM) CREDIT LOSSES 

The provision for credit losses is used to maintain the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit losses at a level that in management's judgment is appropriate to absorb expected credit losses over the contractual life of the loan and credit commitment portfolio at the balance sheet date. During 2023, the provision for credit losses totaled $553 million and net charge-offs were $397 million. This compares to a provision for credit losses of $271 million and net charge-offs of $263 million in 2022. 

For further discussion and analysis of the total allowance for credit losses, see the "Allowance for Credit Losses" and &#8220;Risk Management&#8221; sections found later in this report. See also Note 5 "Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements.

(1) In the third quarter of 2022, the Company settled a previously disclosed matter with the CFPB. The Company received an insurance reimbursement in the fourth quarter of 2022 related to the settlement. 

Service Charges on Deposit Accounts 

Service charges on deposit accounts include overdraft fees, treasury management fees and other customer transaction-related service charges, and, prior to mid-2022, non-sufficient fund fees. Service charges decreased in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily as a result of overdraft-related policy enhancements that eliminated non-sufficient fund fees in mid-June 2022. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2023, the Company added an overdraft grace feature, which compliments the overdraft-related policy enhancements and contributed to the decrease. An increase in fees from treasury management services partially offset the overall decline in service charges. 

On October 25, 2023, the Federal Reserve issued a proposal for public comment that, if finalized, would lower the maximum interchange fee that a large debit card issuer can receive for a debit card transaction. Under the proposed rule the maximum interchange fee would be subject to adjustments every other year based upon issuer cost data. The Company is studying the proposal and evaluating its impact. 

On January 17, 2024, the CFPB issued a proposal for public comment that, if finalized, would cap overdraft fees in line with established benchmarks ranging between $3-$14 or their actual costs. Alternatively, an institution could calculate its own fee to break even. The Company is studying the proposal and evaluating its impact. 

Capital Markets Income 

Capital markets income primarily relates to capital raising activities that include securities underwriting and placement, loan syndication, as well as foreign exchange, derivatives, merger and acquisition and other advisory services. Capital markets income decreased in 2023 compared to 2022, driven primarily by negative credit/debit valuation adjustments in 2023 due to rate and spread movements. To a lesser degree, capital markets income was negatively impacted by declines in merger and acquisition advisory services and syndication revenue. Partially offsetting these decreases were increases in securities underwriting and placement fees and real estate capital markets revenue in 2023 compared to 2022. 

Mortgage Income 

Mortgage income is generated through the origination and servicing of residential mortgage loans for long-term investors and sales of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. The decrease in mortgage income in 2023 was due primarily to lower mortgage production and sales as a result of higher market interest rates. The decrease was also a result of amortization of mortgage servicing rights. Additionally, mortgage income for 2022 included approximately $12 million in gains associated with the re-securitization and sale of Ginnie Mae loans previously repurchased from their pools. Partially offsetting the declines was an increase in servicing income associated with a bulk purchase of the rights to service $6.2 billion of residential mortgage loans in the third quarter of 2023. 

Investment Services Fee Income 

Investment services fee income represents income earned from investment advisory services. Investment services fee income increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to the rising interest rate environment, which has driven increases in fixed annuity rates and the related investment income. Also contributing were increases in assets under management due to additional financial advisors. 

Bank-owned Life Insurance 

Bank-owned life insurance income primarily represents income earned from the appreciation of the cash surrender value of insurance contracts held and the proceeds of insurance benefits. Bank-owned life insurance income increased during 2023 compared to 2022 driven primarily by improvement in underlying crediting rates as a result of an overall increase in interest rates. 

Market Value Adjustments on Employee Benefit Assets 

Market value adjustments on employee benefit assets are the reflection of market value variations related to assets held for certain employee benefits. The adjustments are offset in salaries and benefits and other non-interest expense. 

Insurance Proceeds 

Insurance proceeds recognized in 2022 were related to the settlement of a previously disclosed matter with the CFPB. 

Other Miscellaneous Income 

Other miscellaneous income includes net revenue from affordable housing, valuation adjustments to equity investments, fees from safe deposit boxes, check fees and other miscellaneous income. Net revenue from affordable housing includes actual gains and losses resulting from the sale of affordable housing investments, cash distributions from the investments and any related impairment charges.

Salaries and Employee Benefits 

Salaries and employee benefits consist of salaries, incentive compensation, long-term incentives, payroll taxes, and other employee benefits such as 401(k), pension, and medical, life and disability insurance, as well as, expenses from liabilities held 

for employee benefit purposes. Salaries and employee benefits increased during 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to increases in base salaries, higher benefit expenses, and, to a lesser degree, an increase in severance costs in the second half of the year. These increases were offset by a decline in incentive compensation. Full-time equivalent headcount was relatively flat at December 31, 2023 as compared to December 31, 2022. 

Professional, legal and regulatory expenses 

Professional, legal, and regulatory expenses consist of amounts related to legal, consulting, other professional fees and regulatory charges. Professional, legal, and regulatory expenses decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to a settled matter with the CFPB in 2022. See Note 23 "Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 for more detail. 

FDIC Insurance Assessments 

FDIC insurance assessments increased in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily resulting from a special assessment recorded in 2023 (discussed below) and a two basis point increase in the quarterly assessment rate schedules charged to all financial institutions effective for the first quarter of 2023. 

Federal law requires that any losses to the FDIC&#8217;s DIF related to the protection of uninsured depositors under the Systemic Risk Exception be repaid by a special assessment on IDIs. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the FDIC finalized a special assessment related to the two March 2023 bank failures, totaling an estimated $16.3 billion. The rule requires the estimated amount of the entire special assessment be recognized as the accrual of a liability and related expense in the fourth quarter of 2023 pursuant to accounting guidance. The special assessment for Regions is estimated at approximately $119 million to be paid in eight quarterly installments beginning in the first quarter of 2024, which was accrued in the fourth quarter and should be deductible for income taxes. 

Operational Losses 

Operational losses include losses related to fraud, execution, delivery and process management, and damage to physical assets. Operational losses increased in 2023 compared to 2022 due to elevated check-related fraud losses experienced primarily during the second and third quarters of 2023. 

Other Miscellaneous Expenses 

Other miscellaneous expenses include expenses related to communications, postage, supplies, certain credit-related costs, foreclosed property expenses, mortgage repurchase costs, and other costs (benefits) related to employee benefit plans. Other miscellaneous expenses increased in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to higher non-service based pension-related expenses and, to a lesser degree, higher fees associated with licenses and taxes. 

INCOME TAXES 

The Company&#8217;s income tax expense for the year ended 2023 was $533 million compared to $631 million for the same period in 2022, resulting in effective tax rates of 20.5% and 22.0%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for 2023 is due to lower pre-tax income for the year as compared to 2022 causing the impact of tax preferential items to increase, as well as increased tax benefits related to investments in affordable housing in 2023 as compared to 2022. See the "Executive Overview" for the Company's expectations for the 2024 effective tax rate. 

The effective tax rate is affected by many factors including, but not limited to, the level of pre-tax income, the mix of income between various tax jurisdictions with differing tax rates, enacted tax legislation, net tax benefits related to affordable housing investments, bank-owned life insurance income, tax-exempt interest and nondeductible expenses. In addition, the effective tax rate is affected by items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period-to-period, such as the termination of certain leveraged leases, share-based payments, valuation allowance changes and changes to unrecognized tax benefits. Accordingly, the comparability of the effective tax rate between periods may be impacted. 

At December 31, 2023, the Company reported a net deferred tax asset of $741 million compared to $943 million at December 31, 2022. The change in the net deferred tax position was due primarily to the deferred tax impact of decreases in unrealized losses on securities for sale and derivative instruments arising during the period. 

See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and Note 19 "Income Taxes" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about income taxes. 

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS 

The following sections provide expanded discussion of significant changes in certain line items in asset, liability, and shareholders' equity categories. 

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 

At December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents totaled $6.8 billion compared to $11.2 billion at December 31, 2022. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in cash balances on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank driven by an expected decline in deposits and growth in loans. See the "Loans", "Deposits", and "Liquidity" sections for more information. 

DEBT SECURITIES 

Debt securities available for sale, comprising 21 percent of earning assets, constitute approximately 97 percent of the securities portfolio. Regions maintains a highly-rated securities portfolio consisting primarily of agency MBS. Regions&#8217; investment policy emphasizes credit quality and liquidity. Debt securities rated in the highest category by nationally recognized rating agencies and debt securities backed by the U.S. Government and government sponsored agencies, both on a direct and indirect basis, represented approximately 96 percent of the investment portfolio at December 31, 2023. All other debt securities rated below AAA, not backed by the U.S. Government or government sponsored agencies, or which are not rated represented approximately 4 percent of total debt securities at December 31, 2023. Debt securities increased $124 million from year-end 2022, as detailed below in Table 6 . In 2023, Regions temporarily slowed reinvestment but returned to full reinvestment in the fourth quarter of 2023. 

The average life of the debt securities portfolio at December 31, 2023 was estimated to be 5.5 years, with a duration of approximately 4.5 years. These metrics compare with an estimated average life of 5.8 years and a duration of approximately 4.8 years for the portfolio at December 31, 2022. 

Debt securities are an important tool used to manage interest rate sensitivity and provide a primary source of liquidity for the Company, as much of the portfolio is highly liquid. Additionally, some of the securities portfolio is eligible to be used as collateral for funding of various types of borrowings. See the "Liquidity" section for more information on these arrangements. See Note 3 "Debt Securities" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Also see the "Market Risk-Interest Rate Risk" section for more information. 

The following table details the carrying values of debt securities, including both available for sale and held to maturity as of December 31:

Subsequent to December 31, 2023, the Company sold approximately $1.3 billion of debt securities available for sale, realizing $50 million in pre-tax losses. Proceeds were reinvested at higher current market yields. The portfolio mix, duration, and liquidity profile were largely unchanged.

Commercial loans held for sale include commercial loans originated for sale to third parties and commercial loans originally recorded as held for investment when management has the intent to sell. Levels of commercial loans held for sale fluctuate based on timing of sale to third parties. The levels of residential first mortgage loans held for sale that are part of the Company's mortgage originations fluctuate depending on the timing of origination and sale to third parties. 

LOANS 

GENERAL 

Loans, net of unearned income, represented 74 percent of interest-earning assets as of December 31, 2023 compared to 71 percent as of December 31, 2022. Lending at Regions is generally organized along three portfolio segments: commercial loans (including commercial and industrial, and owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage and construction loans), investor real estate loans (commercial real estate mortgage and construction loans) and consumer loans (residential first mortgage, home equity lines and loans, consumer credit card, other consumer&#8212;exit portfolios, and other consumer loans). See the "Executive Overview" for expectations for loans in 2024. 

Table 9 illustrates a year-over-year comparison of loans, net of unearned income, by portfolio segment and class as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and Table 10 provides information on selected loan maturities as of December 31, 2023:

_________ 

(1) The lending reported in variable rate disclosure is based upon the rate in the underlying lending agreements. For some lending arrangements, Regions enters into interest rate swap and floor agreements to manage overall cash flow changes related to interest rate risk exposure on variable rate loans. The agreements effectively modify the Company&#8217;s exposure to interest rate risk by utilizing receive fixed/pay variable interest rate swaps and interest rate floors. The impact of hedging is not considered within this disclosure. 

PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS 

Loans, net of unearned income, increased $1.4 billion year over year, primarily due to increases in the investor real estate, residential first mortgage and other consumer portfolio classes. Regions manages loan growth with a focus on risk management and risk-adjusted return on capital. See the "Executive Overview" section for details on average loan growth expectations for 2024. 

The following sections describe the composition of the portfolio segments and classes disclosed in Table 9, explain changes in balances from year-end 2022 and highlight the related risk characteristics. Regions believes that its loan portfolio is well diversified by product, client, and geography throughout its footprint. However, the loan portfolio may be exposed to certain concentrations of credit risk which exist in relation to individual borrowers or groups of borrowers, certain types of collateral, certain types of industries, and certain loan products. See Note 4 "Loans" and Note 5 "Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion. 

Commercial 

The commercial portfolio segment includes commercial and industrial loans to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs, equipment purchases and other expansion projects. 

The commercial portfolio also includes owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans to operating businesses, which are loans for long-term financing on land and buildings, and are repaid by cash generated by business operations. Owner-occupied commercial real estate construction loans are made to commercial businesses for the development of land or construction of a building where the repayment is derived from revenues generated from the business of the borrower. 

Over half of the Company&#8217;s total loans are included in the commercial portfolio segment. These balances are spread across numerous industries, as noted in Table 12. The Company manages the related risks to this portfolio by setting certain lending limits for each significant industry. In 2023, total commercial loans decreased $273 million. The decline in commercial loan activity was the result of soft loan demand and was broad-based across industries as shown in Table 12. 

The following tables provide detail of Regions' commercial lending balances in selected industries as of December 31:

_______ 

(1) Real estate includes REITs, which are unsecured commercial and industrial products that are real estate related. This portfolio, which accounts for approximately 18 percent of the total commercial exposure, is well diversified, generally has low leverage with strong access to liquidity, and the REITs included in this portfolio are primarily investment or near investment grade. 

(2) Other contains balances related to non-classifiable and invalid business industry codes offset by payments in process and fee accounts that are not available at the loan level. 

(3) As customers' businesses evolve (e.g. up or down the vertical manufacturing chain), Regions may need to change the assigned business industry code used to define the customer relationship. When these changes occur, Regions does not recast the customer history for prior periods into the new classification because the business industry code used in the prior period was deemed appropriate. As a result, year over year changes may be impacted. 

Investor Real Estate 

Loans for real estate development are repaid through cash flows related to the operation, sale or refinance of the property. This portfolio segment includes extensions of credit to real estate developers or investors where repayment is dependent on the sale of real estate or income generated from the real estate collateral. A portion of Regions&#8217; investor real estate portfolio segment consists of loans secured by residential product types (land, single-family and condominium loans) within Regions&#8217; markets. Additionally, this category includes loans made to finance income-producing properties such as apartment buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping centers. Total investor real estate loans increased $471 million in comparison to year-end 2022, primarily due to increases in fundings under previous commitments. 

The Company's total non-owner-occupied commercial real estate lending consists of both unsecured commercial and industrial loans that are real estate related (including REITs) and investor real estate loans and are considered to be well diversified across property types. The following table provides detail of these loans:

_______ 

(1) Amounts calculated based on whole dollar values. 

(2) Apartments, often referred to as multi-family, represented 4.1 percent of total loans at December 31, 2023. Approximately 90 percent of these loans were secured, with approximately 80 percent of the secured loans located in the Sunbelt region of the U.S. 

(3) Business offices represented 1.5 percent of total loans at December 31, 2023. Approximately 90 percent of these loan were secured, with approximately 60 percent of the secured loans located in the Sunbelt region of the U.S. 

(4) Senior housing loans are included within the Healthcare portfolio and represented 1.4 percent of total loans at December 31, 2023. 

(5) Owner-occupied commercial real estate is not included as the principal source of repayment is individual businesses, which more closely aligns with the commercial portfolio credit performance. 

Residential First Mortgage 

Residential first mortgage loans represent loans to consumers to finance a residence. These loans are typically financed over a 15 to 30 year term and, in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence. Total residential first mortgage loans increased $1.4 billion in comparison to year-end 2022 balances, driven by approximately $2.8 billion in new loan originations retained on the balance sheet in 2023. 

Home Equity Lines 

Home equity lines are secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower's residence and allow customers to borrow against the equity in their homes. Home equity lines decreased $289 million in comparison to year-end 2022 balances, as payoffs and paydowns continue to outpace production. Substantially all of this portfolio was originated through Regions&#8217; branch network. 

Beginning in December 2016, new home equity lines of credit have a 10-year draw period and a 20-year repayment term. During the 10-year draw period customers do not have an interest-only payment option, except on a very limited basis. From May 2009 to December 2016, home equity lines of credit had a 10-year draw period and a 10-year repayment term. Prior to May 2009, the predominant structure was a 20-year draw period with a balloon payment upon maturity. The term &#8220;balloon payment&#8221; means there are no principal payments required until the balloon payment is due for interest-only lines of credit. 

The following table presents information regarding the future principal payment reset dates for the Company's home equity lines of credit as of December 31, 2023. The balances presented are based on maturity date for lines with a balloon payment and draw period expiration date for lines that convert to a repayment period.

Home Equity Loans 

Home equity loans are also secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower's residence, are primarily originated as amortizing loans, and allow customers to borrow against the equity in their homes. Substantially all of this portfolio was originated through Regions&#8217; branch network. 

Consumer Credit Quality Data 

The Company calculates an estimate of the current value of property secured as collateral for both residential first mortgage and home equity lending products (&#8220;current LTV&#8221;). The estimate is based on home price indices compiled by a third party. The third party data indicates trends for MSAs. Regions uses the third party valuation trends from the MSAs in the Company's footprint in its estimate. The trend data is applied to the loan portfolios taking into account the age of the most recent valuation and geographic area. 

The following table presents current LTV data for components of the residential first mortgage, home equity lines and home equity loans classes of the consumer portfolio segment. Current LTV data for some loans in the portfolio is not available due to mergers and systems integrations. The amounts in the table represent the entire loan balance. For purposes of the table below, if the loan balance exceeds the current estimated collateral the entire balance is included in the &#8220;Above 100%&#8221; category, regardless of the amount of collateral available to partially offset the shortfall.

Consumer Credit Card 

Consumer credit card lending represents primarily open-ended variable interest rate consumer credit card loans. 

Other Consumer&#8212;Exit Portfolios 

Other consumer &#8212; exit portfolios include lending initiatives through third parties consisting of loans made through automotive dealerships and other point of sale lending. Regions ceased originating new loans related to these businesses prior to 2020 and therefore the portfolio balances have been in run-off. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company sold substantially all of its unsecured consumer loans in this portfolio totaling approximately $300 million, which was the primary driver of the $527 million decrease from year-end 2022. 

Other Consumer 

Other consumer loans primarily include indirect and direct consumer loans, overdrafts and other revolving loans. Other consumer loans increased $548 million from year-end 2022 primarily driven by increases in consumer home improvement loans. 

Regions considers factors such as periodic updates of FICO scores, unemployment, home prices, and geography as credit quality indicators for consumer loans. FICO scores are obtained at origination and refreshed FICO scores are obtained by the Company quarterly for most consumer loans. For more information on credit quality indicators refer to Note 5 "Allowance for Credit Losses". 

ALLOWANCE 

The allowance consists of two components: the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments. The allowance totaled $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2023 compared to $1.6 billion at December 31, 2022, which represents management's best estimate of expected losses over the life of the loan and credit commitment portfolios. Key drivers of the change in the allowance by quarter are presented in Table 16 below. While many of these items overlap regarding impact, they are included in the category most relevant.

(3) In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company sold substantially all of its portfolio of a third-party relationship with an associated allowance of $27 million at the time of the sale. As discussed before Table 18 below, there was a $35 million fair value mark recorded through charge-offs, which resulted in a net provision expense of $8 million associated with the sale. 

The table below reflects a range of macroeconomic factors utilized in the Base forecast over the two-year R&#38;S forecast period as of December 31, 2023. The unemployment rate is the most significant macroeconomic factor among the allowance models and continues to be at a normalized level with forecasted periods expected to remain relatively consistent.

In deriving any forecast, Regions benchmarks its internal forecast with external forecasts and external data available. Regions' December 2023 baseline forecast indicated overall improvement compared to the September 2023 forecast. Slower 

growth in consumer spending and reduced business investment in equipment, machinery and structures were drags on real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2023. The trend of job growth is slowing, and the baseline forecast anticipates further deceleration into 2024. The unemployment rate is expected to increase modestly over the forecast horizon, with the increase constrained by the labor force participation rate remaining below pre-pandemic levels. As measured by CPI, inflation is expected to slow further but remain above the FOMC's 2.0 percent target through 2024. The risks to the baseline forecast are considered to be balanced. See the Economic Environment in Regions' Banking Markets discussion in the "Executive Overview" section for additional information. 

Credit metrics are monitored throughout each quarter in order to understand external macro-views, trends and industry outlooks, as well as Regions' internal specific views of credit metrics and trends. In the fourth quarter of 2023, asset quality continued to normalize, as expected. Commercial and investor real estate criticized balances increased approximately $492 million, which included an increase in classified balances of $135 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. Non-performing loans, excluding held for sale, and non-performing assets increased approximately $163 million and $164 million, respectively, compared to the third quarter of 2023. Total net charge-offs increased by 14 basis points to 0.54% of average loans; however, excluding the impact of charge-offs associated with the fourth quarter sale of unsecured consumer loans, adjusted net charge-offs (non-GAAP) decreased one basis point compared to the third quarter of 2023. See Table 1 "GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations" for further details, and Table 20 for more details regarding non-performing assets. 

While Regions' quantitative allowance methodologies strive to reflect all risk factors, any estimate involves assumptions and uncertainties resulting in some level of imprecision. The qualitative framework has a general imprecision component which is meant to acknowledge that model and forecast errors are inherent in any modeling estimate. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the general imprecision remained stable. 

Based upon the factors discussed above, the December 31, 2023 allowance increased compared to the third quarter of 2023 due to adverse risk migration and continued credit normalization, as well as a build in qualitative adjustments for incremental risk in higher risk portfolios (see further discussion in Table 20 below). Based on the overall analysis performed, management deemed an allowance of $1.7 billion to be appropriate to absorb expected credit losses in the loan and credit commitment portfolios as of December 31, 2023. 

Net charge-offs increased $134 million year-over-year, primarily driven by an increase in commercial and industrial net charge-offs resulting from expected normalization. The increase in other consumer&#8212;exit portfolios charge-offs includes $35 million in net charge-offs from the sale of unsecured consumer loans. Additionally, net charge-offs for 2022 include $63 million in net charge-offs in the other consumer portfolio due to the sale of unsecured consumer loans. See Table 1 "GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations" for further details. As noted, economic trends such as interest rates, unemployment, volatility in commodity prices, collateral valuations and inflationary pressure will impact the future levels of net charge-offs and may result in volatility of certain credit metrics in 2024 and beyond. See the "Executive Overview" section for details on expectations for net charge-offs in 2024. 

Details regarding the allowance and net charge-offs, including an analysis of activity from previous years' totals, are included in Table 18 "Allowance for Credit Losses".

(2) Excludes residential first mortgage loans that are 100% guaranteed by the FHA and all guaranteed loans sold to Ginnie Mae where Regions has the right but not the obligation to repurchase. Total 90+ days or more past due guaranteed loans excluded were $34 million at December 31, 2023 and $34 million at December 31, 2022. 

Non-performing loans at December 31, 2023 increased $305 million as compared to year-end 2022 levels as a result of continued asset quality normalization and downgrades within industries previously identified as higher risk such as information, healthcare, transportation and warehousing, and office industries partially offset by improvement in agriculture. The same economic trends that impact net charge-offs, as discussed above, will impact the future level of non-performing assets. Circumstances related to individually large credits could also result in volatility. 

The following table provides an analysis of non-accrual loans (excluding loans held for sale) by portfolio segment:

(2) Includes charge-offs on loans on non-accrual status and charge-offs taken upon sale and transfer of non-accrual loans to held for sale. 

(3) Transfers to held for sale are shown net of charge-offs recorded upon transfer. 

OTHER EARNING ASSETS 

Other earning assets consist primarily of investments in Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB stock, marketable equity securities, and other miscellaneous earning assets. The balance at December 31, 2023 totaled $1.4 billion, increasing from $1.3 billion at December 31, 2022 primarily due to an increase in marketable equity securities partially offset by a decline in certificates of deposits held at other institutions. Refer to Note 7 "Other Earning Assets" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS AT FAIR VALUE 

Residential MSRs increased approximately $94 million from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to a bulk purchase of the rights to service $6.2 billion of residential mortgage loans in the third quarter of 2023. Partially offsetting the increase was higher amortization of servicing rights. An analysis of residential MSRs is presented in Note 6 "Servicing of Financial Assets" to the consolidated financial statements. 

DEPOSITS 

Regions competes with other banking and financial services companies for a share of the deposit market. Regions&#8217; ability to compete in the deposit market depends heavily on the pricing of its deposits and how effectively the Company meets customers&#8217; needs. Regions employs various means to meet those needs and enhance competitiveness, such as providing a high level of customer service, competitive pricing and convenient branch locations for its customers. Regions also serves customers through providing centralized, high-quality banking services through the Company's digital channels and contact center. 

Deposits are Regions&#8217; primary source of funds, providing funding for 92 percent of average earning assets in 2023 and 95 percent of average earning assets in 2022. Regions' deposit base composition is a key component of the Company's franchise value. Table 22 "Deposits" provides a year-over-year comparison of deposit balances on a period-ending basis. 

The cost of deposits rose in 2023 as expected in an elevated interest rate environment. Deposit costs increased to 99 basis points for 2023, compared to 14 basis points for 2022. The rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased to 156 basis points in 2023 compared to 25 basis points for 2022. The increase in deposit costs also reflected remixing as customers moved into higher interest-bearing categories. See the &#8220;Market Risk-Interest Rate Risk&#8221; section for further discussion of these balances. 

The following table summarizes deposits by category and by segment as of December 31: 

Table 22&#8212;Deposits

____ 

(1) Other deposits represent non-customer balances primarily consisting of wholesale funding (for example, Eurodollar trade deposits, selected deposits and brokered time deposits). 

(2) Includes brokered deposits totaling $2.4 billion at December 31, 2023 and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2022. 

Total deposits at December 31, 2023 decreased approximately $4.0 billion compared to year-end 2022 levels, with all deposit categories and segments impacted by remixing as customers continued to exhibit rate-seeking behavior. Non-interest-bearing demand products decreased $9.0 billion to $42.4 billion and represented 33 percent of total deposits at year-end 2023 compared to 39 percent at year-end 2022. Interest-bearing checking also decreased $1.2 billion to $24.5 billion at year-end 2023 and accounted for 19 percent of total deposits at year-end 2023 and 2022. Savings accounts decreased $3.1 billion to $12.6 billion at year-end 2023 and accounted for 10 percent of total deposits at year-end 2023 compared to 12 percent at year-end 2022. Money market balances remained stable compared to the prior year. 

Growth in time deposits partially offset decreases in other categories with time deposit balances increasing $9.2 billion to $15.0 billion in 2023, as customers moved into higher interest rate products. The increase in time deposit balances also reflects additional brokered deposits in the Other segment entered into to maintain diversified funding sources. Time deposits represented 12 percent of total deposits at year-end 2023 compared to 4 percent at year-end 2022. 

Regions' deposits are granular and diversified including insured and collateralized deposits, with consumer deposits making up more than 60 percent of the total deposit base. Furthermore, corporate deposits include those that are operational in nature (where the primary use is certain operational services such as clearing, custody, payments or other cash management activities). A significant amount of the Company's deposit base is insured by the FDIC or collateralized, with approximately $11.2 billion in deposits collateralized in public funds or in trusts at December 31, 2023. The amount of estimated uninsured deposits totaled $47.8 billion at December 31, 2023, therefore over 60 percent of total deposits are insured by the FDIC. The Company's deposits are also granular in nature as evidenced by an average deposit account balance of approximately $18 thousand at December 31, 2023. The estimates of uninsured deposits and average account size were based on methodologies used in the Company's Call Report, which is prepared on an unconsolidated bank basis. 

See the "Executive Overview" section for details on expectations for deposits in 2024. See also the "Liquidity" and "Market Risk-Interest Rate Risk" sections for further discussion. 

Time deposit accounts with balances of $250,000 or more totaled $2.6 billion and $790 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

The following table shows scheduled maturities of estimated uninsured time deposits as of December 31, 2023:

BORROWED FUNDS 

Total long-term borrowings increased approximately $46 million to $2.3 billion at December 31, 2023 due entirely to valuation adjustments. Regions and Regions Bank did not issue or redeem any debt in 2023. 

During 2023, the Company utilized short-term and long-term FHLB borrowings as a part of its liquidity management. All of these borrowings were redeemed prior to year-end resulting in a $4 million pre-tax gain associated with the extinguishment. Funding from the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank is secured by pledged assets, primarily certain loan portfolios which are also subject to blanket lien arrangements with the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank. As of December 31, 2023, Regions' blanket lien arrangements with these entities covered a total loan balance of approximately $95 billion and included loans from various loan portfolios. However, borrowing capacity with the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank is contingent on a subset of the blanket lien portfolios which are eligible and pledged according to the parameters for each counterparty. 

See Note 11 "Borrowed Funds" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of both short-term and long-term borrowings. 

RATINGS 

Table 24 "Credit Ratings" reflects the debt ratings information of Regions Financial Corporation and Regions Bank by S&#38;P, Moody&#8217;s, Fitch and DBRS as of December 31, 2023.

(1) On February 1, 2024, DBRS announced plans to withdraw the credit ratings on Regions Financial Corporation and its bank subsidiary, Regions Bank, on or about March 4, 2024 due to business reasons; however, DBRS may elect to continue coverage based on investor feedback. 

##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END

As part of an industry-wide evaluation, on August 7, 2023, Moody's affirmed all long-term and short-term ratings and updated the outlook to negative from stable reflecting several sources of strain on the U.S. banking sector. 

In general, ratings agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, probability of government support, and level and quality of earnings. Any downgrade in credit ratings by one or more ratings agencies may impact Regions in several ways, including, but not limited to, Regions&#8217; access to the capital markets or short-term funding, borrowing cost and capacity, collateral requirements, and acceptability of its letters of credit, thereby potentially adversely impacting Regions&#8217; financial condition and liquidity. See the &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. 

A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and the ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Additional information on the credit rating ranking within the overall classification system is located on the website of each credit rating agency. 

SHAREHOLDERS' AND TOTAL EQUITY 

Shareholders&#8217; equity was $17.4 billion at December 31, 2023 as compared to $15.9 billion at December 31, 2022. During 2023, net income increased shareholders' equity by $2.1 billion, cash dividends on common stock reduced shareholders' equity by $822 million, and cash dividends on preferred stock reduced shareholders' equity by $98 million. Changes in AOCI increased shareholders' equity by $531 million, primarily due to available for sale securities and derivative instruments as a result of changes in market interest rates during 2023. Common stock repurchased during 2023 decreased shareholders' equity by $252 million. These shares were immediately retired upon repurchase and therefore were not included in treasury stock. The cumulative effect from the adoption of new accounting guidance that eliminated TDRs and created modifications to troubled borrowers increased shareholders' equity by $28 million. 

Total equity includes noncontrolling interest of $64 million and $4 million at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The noncontrolling interest represents the unowned portion of a low income housing tax credit fund syndication, of which Regions held the majority interest at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

Subsequent to December 31, 2023, the Company purchased 4.3 million shares of common stock for $79 million through February 21, 2024. These shares were immediately retired upon repurchase and therefore were not included in treasury stock. 

See Note 14 "Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)" section for additional information. 

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS 

CAPITAL RULES 

Regions and Regions Bank are required to comply with regulatory capital requirements established by Federal and State banking agencies. These regulatory capital requirements involve quantitative measures of the Company's assets, liabilities and selected off-balance sheet items, and also qualitative judgments by the regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can subject the Company to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory actions. Under the Basel III Rules, Regions is designated as a standardized approach bank. Regions is a "Category IV" institution under the Federal Reserve's Tailoring Rules. 

Federal banking agencies allowed a phase-in of the impact of CECL on regulatory capital. At December 31, 2021, the add-back to regulatory capital was calculated as the impact of initial adoption, adjusted for 25 percent of subsequent changes in the allowance. The amount is phased-in over a three-year period beginning in 2022. At December 31, 2023, the net impact of the addback on CET1 was approximately $204 million or approximately 16 basis points. The add-back amount will decrease by approximately $100 million each year, or approximately 8 basis points, in the first quarters of 2024 and 2025. 

Regions participates in supervisory stress testing conducted by the Federal Reserve and its SCB is currently floored at 2.5 percent. See Note 14 "Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income" to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding CCAR results. 

See the "Executive Overview" section for details on expectations for CET1. 

In July 2023, U.S. federal banking regulators issued a proposal for long-term debt requirements that, if finalized, would require the Company to maintain minimum long-term debt requirements. If the proposal becomes effective, banks would be allowed a three-year phase-in period. The Company is studying the proposal and evaluating its impact. 

In August 2023, the U.S. banking regulators proposed new rules for U.S. implementation of capital requirements under Basel IV rules, more recently referred to as the Basel III "Endgame". These proposed rules include broad-based changes to the risk weighting framework for various credit exposures and operational risk capital requirements. The Company is studying the proposals and evaluating their impacts. 

Additional discussion of the Basel III Rules, their applicability to Regions, recent proposals and final rules issued by the federal banking agencies and recent laws enacted that impact regulatory requirements is included in the "Supervision and Regulation" subsection of the "Business" section. Additional discussion and a tabular presentation of the applicable holding company and bank regulatory capital requirements is included in Note 12 "Regulatory Capital Requirements and Restrictions" to the consolidated financial statements. 

LIQUIDITY 

Regions maintains a robust liquidity management framework designed to effectively manage liquidity risk in accordance with sound risk management principals and regulatory expectations. The framework establishes sustainable processes and tools to effectively identify, measure, mitigate, monitor, and report liquidity risks beginning with Regions&#8217; Liquidity Management Policy and the Liquidity Risk Appetite Statements approved by the Board. Processes within the liquidity management framework include, but are not limited to, liquidity risk governance, cash management, liquidity stress testing, liquidity risk limits, contingency funding plans, and collateral management. While the framework is designed to comply with liquidity regulations, the processes are further tailored to be commensurate with Regions&#8217; operating model and risk profile. 

See the &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8212;Liquidity Regulation&#8221; subsection of the &#8220;Business&#8221; section, the "Risk Factors" section and the "Liquidity" section for more information. 

RISK MANAGEMENT 

Regions is exposed to various risks as part of the normal course of operations. The exposure to risk requires sound risk management practices that comprise an integrated and comprehensive set of programs and processes that apply to the entire Company. Accordingly, Regions has established a risk management framework to manage risks and provide reasonable assurance of the achievement of the Company&#8217;s strategic objectives. 

The primary risk exposures identified and managed through the Company&#8217;s risk management framework are market risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, operational risk, legal risk, compliance risk, reputational risk and strategic risk. 

&#8226; Market risk is the risk to the Company&#8217;s financial condition resulting from adverse movements in market rates or prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates or equity prices. 

&#8226; Liquidity risk is the potential that the Company will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding (referred to as "funding liquidity risk") or the potential that the Company cannot easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions (referred to as "market liquidity risk"). 

&#8226; Credit risk is the risk that arises from the potential that a borrower or counterparty will fail to perform on an obligation. 

&#8226; Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events. 

&#8226; Legal risk is defined as the risk associated with the failure to meet Regions' legal obligations from legislative, regulatory, or contractual perspectives. 

&#8226; Compliance risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from violations of laws, rules, or regulations, or from non-conformance with prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures, or ethical standards. 

&#8226; Reputational risk is the potential that negative publicity regarding the Company&#8217;s business practices, whether true or not, will cause a decline in the customer base, costly litigation, or revenue reductions. 

&#8226; Strategic risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience from adverse business decisions, poor implementation of business decisions, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the banking industry and operating environment. 

Several of these primary risk exposures are expanded upon further within the remaining sections of Management's Discussion and Analysis. 

Regions&#8217; risk management framework outlines the Company&#8217;s approach for managing risk that includes the following four components: 

&#8226; Collaborative Risk Culture - A strong, collaborative risk culture is fundamental to the Company's core values and operating principles. It ensures focus on risk in all activities and encourages the necessary mindset and behavior to enable effective risk management and promote sound risk-taking within the bounds of the Company&#8217;s risk appetite. The Company's risk culture requires that risks be promptly identified, escalated, and challenged; thereby, benefiting the overall performance of the Company. Sustaining a collaborative risk culture is critical to the Company's success and is a clear expectation of executive management and the Board. 

&#8226; Sound Risk Appetite - The Company's risk appetite statements define the types and levels of risk the Company is willing to take to achieve its objectives. 

&#8226; Sustainable Risk Processes - Effective risk management requires sustainable processes and tools to effectively identify, measure, mitigate, monitor, and report risk. 

&#8226; Responsible Risk Governance - Governance serves as the foundation for comprehensive management of risks facing the Company. It outlines clear responsibility and accountability for managing, monitoring, escalating, and reporting both existing and emerging risks. 

Clearly defined roles and responsibilities are critical to the effective management of risk and are central to the four components of the Company&#8217;s approach to risk management. Regions utilizes the Three Lines of Defense concept to clearly designate risk management activities within the Company. 

&#8226; 1st Line of Defense activities include the proactive identification, management (including mitigation and risk acceptance), and ownership of risks. 

&#8226; 2nd Line of Defense activities provide for objective oversight of the Company&#8217;s risk-taking activities and assessment of the Company&#8217;s aggregate risk levels. 

&#8226; 3rd Line of Defense activities provide for independent reviews and assessments of risk management practices across the Company. 

The Board provides the highest level of risk management governance. The principal risk management functions of the Board are to oversee processes for evaluating the adequacy of internal controls, risk management, financial reporting and compliance with laws and regulations. The Board has designated an Audit Committee of outside directors to focus on oversight of management's establishment and maintenance of appropriate disclosure controls and procedures over financial reporting. See the "Financial Disclosures and Internal Controls" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional information. The Board has also designated a Risk Committee of outside directors to focus on Regions&#8217; overall risk profile. The Risk Committee annually approves an Enterprise Risk Appetite Statement that reflects core business principles and strategic vision by including quantitative limits and qualitative statements that are organized by risk type. This statement is 

designed to be a high-level document that sets the tone for the Board&#8217;s risk appetite, which is the maximum amount of risk the Company is willing to accept in pursuit of its business objectives. By establishing boundaries around risk taking and business decisions, and by incorporating the needs and goals of its shareholders, regulators, customers and other stakeholders, the Company&#8217;s risk appetite is aligned with its strategic priorities and goals. 

The Risk Management Group, led by the Company&#8217;s Chief Risk Officer, ensures the consistent application of Regions&#8217; risk management approach within the structure of the Company&#8217;s operating, capital and strategic plans. The primary activities of the Risk Management Group include: 

&#8226; Interpreting internal and external signals that point to possible risk issues for the Company; 

&#8226; Identifying risks and determining which Company areas and/or products will be affected; 

&#8226; Ensuring there are mechanisms in place to specifically determine how risks will affect the Company as a whole and the individual area and or product; 

&#8226; Assisting business groups in analyzing trends and ensuring Company areas have appropriate risk identification and mitigation processes in place; and 

&#8226; Reviewing the limits, parameters, policies, and procedures in place to ensure the continued appropriateness of risk controls. 

As part of its ongoing assessment process, the Risk Management Group makes recommendations to management and the Risk Committee of the Board regarding adjustments to these controls as conditions or risk tolerances change. In addition, the Internal Audit division provides an independent assessment of the Company&#8217;s internal control structure and related systems and processes. 

Management, with the assistance of the Risk Management Group, follows a formal process for identifying, measuring and documenting key risks facing each business group and determining how those risks can be controlled or mitigated, as well as how the controls can be monitored to ensure they are effective. The Risk Committee receives reports from management to ensure operations are within the limits established by the Enterprise Risk Appetite Statement. 

Some of the more significant processes used by management to manage and control risks are described in the remainder of this report. External factors beyond management&#8217;s control may result in losses despite the Risk Management Group&#8217;s efforts. 

EFFECTS OF INFLATION 

The majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature; therefore, a financial institution differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies, which have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories that are greatly impacted by inflation. While the implications differ for a bank, inflation does have influence on the growth of total assets and deposits in the banking industry and the resulting level of profitability and capitalization. Inflation also affects the level of market interest rates, and therefore, the pricing of financial instruments. 

Management believes the most significant potential impact of inflation on financial results is a direct result of Regions&#8217; ability to manage the impact of changes in interest rates. The Company&#8217;s interest rate risk positioning was mostly neutral as of December 31, 2023, and therefore, net interest income increases or declines only modestly from higher or lower interest rates. Hedging activity has reduced the exposure to net interest income late in the rising interest rate cycle as intended. Refer to Table 25 "Interest Rate Sensitivity" for additional details on Regions&#8217; interest rate sensitivity. 

Additionally, inflation has the potential to impact credit risk. Periods of inflation could influence asset prices and business input costs which could affect the ability of borrowers to repay loans. The Company has sound credit risk management practices to maintain a credit portfolio through the economic cycle. Refer to the "Credit Risk" section for further details on Regions' credit risk management process. 

EFFECTS OF DEFLATION 

A period of deflation would affect all industries, including financial institutions. Deflation potentially could lead to lower profits, higher unemployment, lower production and deterioration in overall economic conditions. In addition, deflation could depress economic activity and impair bank earnings through reduced balance sheet growth and less favorable product pricing, as well as impairment in the ability of borrowers to repay loans. 

Management believes the most significant potential impact of deflation on financial results relates to Regions&#8217; ability to maintain a sufficient amount of capital to cushion against future market and credit related losses. However, the Company can utilize certain risk management tools to help it maintain its balance sheet strength even if a deflationary scenario were to develop. 

MARKET RISK&#8212;INTEREST RATE RISK 

Regions&#8217; primary market risk is interest rate risk. This includes uncertainty with respect to absolute interest rate levels as well as relative interest rate levels, which are impacted by both the shape and the slope of the various yield curves that affect the financial products and services that the Company offers. As its primary tool to analyze this risk, Regions measures the change in its net interest income in various interest rate scenarios compared to a base case scenario. Net interest income sensitivity to market rate movements is a useful short-term indicator of Regions&#8217; interest rate risk. 

In addition to net interest income simulations, Regions also utilizes an EVE analysis as a measurement tool to estimate risk exposure over a longer-term horizon. EVE measures the extent to which the economic value of assets, liabilities and derivative instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. Importantly, EVE values only the current balance sheet, excluding the growth assumptions used in net interest income sensitivity analyses. Additionally, the results are highly dependent on imprecise assumptions for products with embedded prepay optionality and indeterminate maturities. The uncertainty surrounding important assumptions used in EVE analysis may limit its efficacy. 

Sensitivity Measurement&#8212;Financial simulation models are Regions&#8217; primary tools used to measure interest rate exposure. Using a wide range of sophisticated simulation techniques provides management with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates. Models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of Regions&#8217; balance sheet. Assumptions are made about the direction and magnitude of interest rate movements, the slope of the yield curve, and the changing composition of the balance sheet that results from both strategic plans and customer behavior. Among the assumptions are expectations of balance sheet growth and composition, the pricing and maturity characteristics of existing business and the characteristics of future business. Interest rate-related risks are expressly considered, such as pricing spreads, the pricing of deposit accounts, prepayments and other option risks. Regions considers these factors, as well as the degree of certainty or uncertainty surrounding their future behavior. 

The primary objective of asset/liability management at Regions is to coordinate balance sheet composition with interest rate risk management to sustain reasonable and stable net interest income throughout various interest rate cycles. In computing interest rate sensitivity, Regions compares a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario derived using &#8220;market forward rates.&#8221; See the "Executive Overview" section for details on expectations for net interest income in 2024. The set of alternative interest rate scenarios includes instantaneous parallel rate shifts of various magnitudes. In addition to parallel rate shifts, multiple curve steepening and flattening scenarios are contemplated. Regions includes simulations of gradual interest rate movements phased in over a six-month period that may more realistically mimic the speed of potential interest rate movements. 

Exposure to Interest Rate Movements&#8212;Regions' balance sheet is naturally asset sensitive, with net interest income increasing with higher interest rates, and decreasing with lower interest rates. This is the result of approximately half of the loan portfolio floating contractually with market rate indices, and funding from a large, mostly stable retail deposit portfolio. Importantly, the stability and rate sensitivity of Regions' deposit portfolio has been proven over multiple interest rate cycles. With this natural balance sheet profile, the ability to utilize discretionary asset duration strategies within the investment portfolio and through derivative hedges is critical in mitigating the Bank&#8217;s naturally asset sensitive position. 

As of December 31, 2023, Regions evidenced a mostly balanced, or "neutral" asset/liability position, with an asset duration of approximately 2.6 years and a liability duration of approximately 2.8 years, using historically-informed approximations. The securities portfolio duration was approximately 4.5 years and is appropriate for Regions' risk profile in order to offset the long-duration deposit liabilities. While the derivative hedging portfolio is recorded on the balance sheet including current unrealized losses, deposit value increases have more than offset these losses through the rising rate environment. The additional value of deposits in a higher rate environment is realized in the form of lower-cost funding when compared with wholesale sources. While balance sheet analysis, particularly EVE analysis, does contemplate the economic value of deposits, the estimated fair value of deposits is equal to their carrying value for certain financial statement footnote disclosures, consistent with industry practices. See Note 21 "Fair Value Measurements" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

As of December 31, 2023, Regions' net interest income profile was mostly neutral to both gradual and instantaneous parallel yield curve shifts as compared to the base case for the 12-month measurement horizon ending December 2024. The estimated exposure associated with the rising and falling rate scenarios in Table 25 below reflects the combined impacts of movements in short-term and long-term interest rates. An increase or reduction in short-term interest rates (such as the Fed Funds rate, the rate of Interest on Excess Reserves, and SOFR) will drive the yield on assets and liabilities contractually tied to such rates higher or lower. In either scenario, it is expected that changes in funding costs and balance sheet hedging income will offset the change in asset yields, resulting in little change to net interest income. 

Net interest income remains exposed to intermediate and long-term yield curve tenors. While this was a headwind to net interest income during a low rate environment, it represents a tailwind to net interest income growth as the yield curve rises and remains elevated. Elevated, or increasing intermediate and long-term interest rates (such as intermediate to longer-term U.S. Treasuries, swaps and mortgage rates) will drive yields higher on certain fixed-rate, newly originated or renewed loans, increase 

prospective yields on certain investment portfolio purchases, and reduce amortization of premium expense on existing securities in the investment portfolio. The opposite is true in an environment where intermediate and long-term interest rates fall. 

The interest rate sensitivity analysis presented below in Table 25 is informed by a variety of assumptions and estimates regarding the progression of the balance sheet in both the baseline scenario as well as the scenarios of instantaneous and gradual shifts in the yield curve. Though there are many assumptions which affect the estimates for net interest income, those pertaining to deposit pricing, deposit mix and overall balance sheet composition are particularly impactful. Given the uncertainties associated with monetary policy on industry liquidity levels and the cost of that liquidity, management evaluates the impacts from these key assumptions through sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity calculations are hypothetical and should not be considered predictive of future results. 

The Company&#8217;s baseline balance sheet assumptions include management's best estimate for balance sheet changes in the coming 12 months. In 2023, Regions experienced a decline in deposit balances, both from the normalization of balances acquired from stimulative policies, as well as from late-cycle rate seeking behavior by higher-balance customers, yet those declines slowed during the second half of the year. The baseline scenario projects deposit balances to be stable to modestly lower over the forecast horizon. Additional deposit balance outflow of $1 billion would reduce net interest income by $21 million over 12 months in the parallel, instantaneous +100 basis point scenario in Table 25. Conversely, if an additional $1 billion are retained, a positive benefit of $21 million would be expected over 12 months in the parallel, instantaneous +100 basis point scenario Table 25. 

While the base case estimates mostly stable deposit balances in aggregate, additional remixing of approximately $2 billion to $3 billion out of low-cost deposit categories and into high-cost deposit categories is anticipated through mid-2024. In rising rate scenarios only, management assumes that the mix of deposits will further change versus the base case as informed by analyses of prior rate cycles. Currently, however, much of the anticipated mix shift has already occurred or is expected to occur within the baseline scenario, mitigating the amount of additional remixing in higher rate scenarios. The magnitude of the remixing shift is rate dependent and equates to approximately $1.6 billion over 12 months in the parallel, instantaneous +100 basis point scenario in Table 25. Furthermore, over the 12 month horizon, an increase of $1 billion in deposit remixing would decrease net interest income by approximately $27 million, and a decrease of $1 billion in deposit remixing would increase net interest income by $27 million in the parallel, instantaneous +100 basis point scenario. 

The interest-bearing deposit beta is calibrated using the experience from prior rate cycles and is dynamic across both interest rate level and time. The base case scenario anticipates a peak in deposit rates by mid-year 2024. The parallel, instantaneous +100 basis point shock scenario in Table 25 incorporates an incremental beta between 40 and 45 percent when compared to the base case scenario, while the parallel, instantaneous -100 basis point shock scenario incorporates an incremental beta between 35 and 40 percent when compared to the base case scenario. Incremental deposit pricing outperformance or underperformance of 5 percent in a parallel, instantaneous 100 basis point shock would increase or decrease net interest income by approximately $42 million. 

The table below summarizes Regions' positioning over the next 12 months in various parallel yield curve shifts (i.e., including all yield curve tenors). The scenarios are inclusive of all interest rate hedging activities. More information regarding hedges is disclosed in Table 26 and its accompanying description.

Regions' comprehensive interest rate risk management approach uses derivatives and debt securities to manage its interest rate risk position. 

During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company added $250 million of 3 year maturity, forward starting swaps hedging floating rate loan cash flows, with a receive fixed rate of 3.26 percent becoming active in 2028. Additionally, the Company added $1.2 billion of pay fixed fair value swaps on available for sale securities and $252 million of receive fixed fair value swaps on brokered CDs. The pay fixed fair value swaps had a weighted average fixed rate of 4.9 percent with a weighted average maturity of fourteen months, and the received fixed fair value swaps had a weighted average fixed rate of 4.9 percent with a weighted average maturity of twelve months. All trades were executed with overnight SOFR as the floating leg benchmark rate. 

Subsequent to December 31, 2023, the Company terminated approximately $500 million of receive fixed cash flow swaps with a fixed rate of 2.86% and original maturity of January 2025. 

Interest rate movements may also have an impact on the value of Regions&#8217; securities portfolio, which can directly impact the carrying value of shareholders&#8217; equity. 

Derivatives &#8212;Regions uses financial derivative instruments for management of interest rate sensitivity. ALCO, which consists of members of Regions&#8217; senior management team, in its oversight role for the management of interest rate sensitivity, approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging strategies. Derivatives are also used to offset the risks associated with customer derivatives, which include interest rate, credit, and foreign exchange risks. The most common derivatives Regions employs are forward rate contracts, forward sale commitments, futures contracts, interest rate swaps, interest rate options (caps, floors and collars), and contracts with a combination of these instruments. 

Forward rate contracts are commitments to buy or sell financial instruments at a future date at a specified price or yield. Futures contracts subject Regions to market risk associated with changes in interest rates. Because futures contracts are cash settled daily, there is minimal credit risk associated with futures. Interest rate swaps are contractual agreements typically entered into to exchange fixed for variable (or vice versa) streams of interest payments. The notional principal is not exchanged but is used as a reference for the size of interest settlements. Interest rate options are contracts that allow the buyer to purchase or sell a financial instrument at a predetermined price and time. Forward sale commitments are contractual obligations to sell market instruments at a future date for an already agreed-upon price. Foreign currency contracts involve the exchange of one currency for another on a specified date and at a specified rate. These contracts are executed on behalf of the Company's customers and are used by customers to manage fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The Company is subject to the credit risk that another party will fail to perform. 

Regions has made use of interest rate swaps and options in balance sheet hedging strategies to effectively convert a portion of its fixed-rate funding position to a variable-rate position, to effectively convert a portion of its fixed-rate debt securities available for sale portfolio to a variable-rate position, and to effectively convert a portion of its floating-rate loan portfolios to fixed-rate. Regions also uses derivatives to economically manage interest rate and pricing risk associated with its mortgage origination business. In the period of time that elapses between the origination and sale of mortgage loans, changes in interest rates have the potential to cause a decline in the value of the loans in this held-for-sale portfolio. Futures contracts and forward sale commitments are used to protect the value of the loan pipeline and loans held for sale from changes in interest rates and pricing. 

The following table presents additional information about hedging interest rate derivatives used by Regions to manage interest rate risk:

(1) All cash flow hedges are reflected within the 12-month measurement horizon and included in income sensitivity levels as disclosed in Table 25. 

Regions manages the credit risk of these instruments in much the same way as it manages credit risk of the loan portfolios by establishing credit limits for each counterparty and through collateral agreements for dealer transactions. For non-dealer transactions, the need for collateral is evaluated on an individual transaction basis and is primarily dependent on the financial strength of the counterparty. Credit risk is also reduced significantly by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements. When there is more than one transaction with a counterparty and there is a legally enforceable master netting agreement in place, the exposure represents the net of the gain and loss positions with and collateral received from and/or posted to that counterparty. Most hedging interest rate swap derivatives traded by Regions are subject to mandatory clearing. The counterparty risk for cleared trades effectively moves from the executing broker to the clearinghouse allowing Regions to benefit from the risk mitigation controls in place at the respective clearinghouse. The &#8220;Credit Risk&#8221; section in this report contains more information on the management of credit risk. 

Regions also uses derivatives to meet the needs of its customers. Interest rate swaps, interest rate options and foreign exchange forwards are the most common derivatives sold to customers. Other derivative instruments with similar characteristics are used to hedge market risk and minimize volatility associated with this portfolio. Instruments used to service customers are held in the trading account, with changes in value recorded in the consolidated statements of income. 

The primary objective of Regions&#8217; hedging strategies is to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes, from an economic perspective, on net interest income and other financing income and the net present value of its balance sheet. The overall effectiveness of these hedging strategies is subject to market conditions, the quality of Regions&#8217; execution, the accuracy of its valuation assumptions, counterparty credit risk and changes in interest rates. 

See Note 20 "Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities" to the consolidated financial statements for a tabular summary of Regions&#8217; year-end derivatives positions and further discussion. 

Regions accounts for residential MSRs at fair market value with any changes to fair value being recorded within mortgage income. Regions enters into derivative transactions to economically mitigate the impact of market value fluctuations related to residential MSRs. Derivative instruments entered into in the future could be materially different from the current risk profile of Regions&#8217; current portfolio. 

LIQUIDITY 

Liquidity is an important factor in the financial condition of Regions and affects Regions&#8217; ability to meet the needs of the Company and its customers. Regions&#8217; goal in liquidity management is to maintain diverse liquidity sources and reserves sufficient to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, under normal and stressed conditions. Accordingly, Regions maintains a variety of liquidity sources to fund its obligations, as further described below. See also Note 23 "Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees" to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the Company&#8217;s funding requirements. Furthermore, Regions performs specific procedures, including scenario analyses and stress testing to evaluate and maintain appropriate levels of available liquidity in alignment with liquidity risk. 

Regions' operation of its business provides a generally balanced liquidity base which is comprised of customer assets, consisting principally of loans, and funding provided by customer deposits and borrowed funds. Maturities in the loan portfolio provide a steady flow of funds, and are supplemented by Regions' deposit base. 

Cash reserves, liquid assets and secured borrowing capabilities aid in the management of liquidity in normal and stressed conditions, and/or meeting the need of contingent events such as obligations related to potential litigation. As part of its normal management practice, Regions maintains collateral and operational readiness to utilize secured funding sources such as the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank on a same-day basis (subject to any practical constraints affecting these market participants). While the securities portfolio is a primary source of liquidity, the secured borrowing capabilities, in addition to cash reserves on hand, assist in alleviating the Company's need to sell securities for funding purposes. Liquidity needs can also be met by borrowing funds in national money markets, though Regions does maintain limits on short-term unsecured funding due to the volatility that can affect such markets. 

The following table summarizes the Company's available sources of liquidity as of December 31, 2023:

The balance with the Federal Reserve Bank is the primary component of the balance sheet line item &#8220;interest-bearing deposits in other banks.&#8221; At December 31, 2023, Regions had approximately $4.2 billion in cash on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank and other depository institutions, a decrease from approximately $9.2 billion at December 31, 2022, partially driven by the expected decline in deposits during the period. Refer to the "Cash and Cash Equivalents" and "Deposits" sections for more information. 

The securities portfolio also serves as a primary source and storehouse of liquidity. Proceeds from maturities and principal and interest payments of securities provide a continual flow of funds available for cash needs (see Note 3 "Debt Securities" to the consolidated financial statements). Furthermore, the highly liquid nature of the available for sale securities portfolio (for example, the agency guaranteed MBS portfolio) can be readily used as a source of cash through various secured borrowing arrangements. Regions' securities portfolio consists of U.S. Treasury securities, federal agency securities, MBS and corporate and other debt. In evaluating the liquidity within the securities portfolio, unencumbered investment securities are primarily comprised of U.S Treasury securities and agency MBS. Unencumbered investment securities also includes certain corporate bonds considered to be highly liquid and other securities, primarily non-agency commercial MBS. 

Regions&#8217; financing arrangement with the FHLB adds additional flexibility in managing the Company's liquidity position. As of December 31, 2023, Regions had borrowing capacity as shown in Table 28 and no outstanding borrowings. FHLB borrowing capacity was determined based on eligible securities and loan amounts, as of December 31, 2023, that can be pledged as collateral for future borrowing capacity. Additionally, investment in FHLB stock is required in relation to the level of outstanding borrowings. The FHLB has been and is expected to continue to be a reliable and economical source of funding. 

Regions has additional borrowing availability with the Federal Reserve Bank through the discount window as shown in Table 28. Federal Reserve Bank borrowing capacity is determined based on eligible loan amounts that can be used as collateral for future borrowing capacity. 

Regions maintains a shelf registration statement with the SEC that can be utilized by Regions to issue various debt and/or equity securities. Additionally, Regions' Board has authorized Regions Bank to issue up to $10 billion in aggregate principal amount of bank notes outstanding at any one time. Refer to Note 11 "Borrowed Funds" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

Regions may, from time to time, consider opportunistically retiring outstanding issued securities, including subordinated debt in privately negotiated or open market transactions for cash or common shares. Regulatory approval would be required for retirement of some instruments. See Note 14 "Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

Regions' liquidity policy requires the holding company to maintain cash sufficient to cover the greater of (1) 18 months of debt service and other cash needs or (2) a minimum cash balance of $500 million. Cash and cash equivalents at the holding company totaled $1.9 billion at December 31, 2023. Overall liquidity risk limits are established by the Board through its Risk Appetite Statement and Liquidity Policy. The Company's Board, LROC and ALCO regularly review compliance with the established limits. 

LIBOR TRANSITION AND REFERENCE RATE REFORM 

The Company successfully transitioned from LIBOR to alternative reference rates by June 30, 2023. Impacted instruments were transitioned in accordance with the LIBOR Act with certain instruments transitioning on applicable reset dates through June 30, 2024. As part of this transition, the Company applied certain optional expedients and exceptions allowed in previously adopted accounting relief for hedges. 

In the fourth quarter of 2023, Bloomberg Index Services Limited announced the permanent cessation of the BSBY index and all tenors effective November 15, 2024. Regions is in the process of evaluating exposure to BSBY and planning for cessation, and will not rely on accounting relief during transition. 

MARKET RISK&#8212;PREPAYMENT RISK 

Regions, like most financial institutions, is subject to changing prepayment speeds on mortgage-related assets under different interest rate environments. Prepayment risk is a significant risk to earnings and specifically to net interest income. For example, mortgage loans and other financial assets may be prepaid by a borrower, so that the borrower may refinance its obligations at lower rates. As loans and other financial assets prepay in a falling rate environment, Regions must reinvest these funds in lower-yielding assets. Prepayments of assets carrying higher rates reduce Regions&#8217; interest income and overall asset yields. Conversely, in a rising rate environment, these assets will prepay at a slower rate, resulting in opportunity cost by not having the cash flow to reinvest at higher rates. Prepayment risk can also impact the value of securities and the carrying value of equity. Regions&#8217; greatest exposures to prepayment risks primarily rest in its MBS portfolio, the mortgage fixed-rate loan portfolio and the residential MSR, all of which tend to be sensitive to interest rate movements. Each of these assets is also exposed to prepayment risk due to factors which are not necessarily the result of interest rates, but rather due to changes in policies or programs related, either directly or indirectly, to the U.S. Government's governance over certain lending and financing within the mortgage market. Such policies can work to either encourage or discourage financing dynamics and represent a risk that is extremely difficult to forecast and may be the result of non-economic factors. The Company attempts to monitor and manage such exposures within reasonable expectations while acknowledging all such risks cannot be foreseen or avoided. Further, Regions has prepayment risk that would be reflected in non-interest income in the form of servicing income on the residential MSRs. Regions actively monitors prepayment exposure as part of its overall net interest income forecasting and interest rate risk management. 

CREDIT RISK 

Regions&#8217; objective regarding credit risk is to maintain a credit portfolio that provides for stable credit costs with acceptable volatility through an economic cycle. Regions has various processes to manage credit risk as described below. In order to assess the risk profile of the loan portfolio, Regions considers risk factors within the loan portfolio segments and classes, the current U.S. economic environment and that of its primary banking markets, as well as counterparty risk. See the "Portfolio Characteristics" section found earlier in this report for further information regarding the risk characteristics of each loan type. See further discussion of the current U.S. economic environment in the "Economic Environment in Regions' Banking Markets" section. 

Management Process 

Credit risk is managed by maintaining a sound credit risk culture, throughout all lines of defense, which ensures that the levels and types of risk taken are aligned with Regions' credit risk appetite. The credit quality of borrowers and counterparties has a significant impact on Regions' earnings; however, the nature of the risk differs by each of the defined businesses which engage in multiple forms of commercial, investor real estate and consumer lending. Regions categorizes the credit risks it faces by asset quality, counterparty exposure, and diversification levels which provides a structure to assess credit risk and guides credit decision-making. Credit policies, another key component of Regions' culture, are designed and adjusted, as needed, to promote sound credit risk management. These policies guide lending activities in a manner consistent with Regions' strategy and provide a framework for achieving asset quality and earnings objectives. 

Effective credit risk management requires coordinated identification, measurement, mitigation, monitoring and reporting of credit risk exposure, credit quality, and emerging risk trends. Accordingly, Regions has implemented a credit risk governance structure that provides oversight from the Board to the organizational units in order to maintain open channels of communication. 

Occasionally, borrowers and counterparties do not fulfill their obligations and Regions must take steps to mitigate and manage losses. Teams are in place to appropriately identify and manage nonperforming loans, collections, loan modifications, and loss mitigation efforts. Regions maintains an allowance for credit losses that management considers adequate to absorb expected losses in the portfolio. 

For a discussion of the process and methodology used to calculate the allowance for credit losses refer to the &#8220;Critical Accounting Estimates and Related Policies&#8221; section found earlier in this report, Note 1 &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; and Note 5 "Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements. Details regarding the allowance for credit losses, including an analysis of activity from the previous year&#8217;s total, are included in Table 18 "Allowance for Credit Losses". Also, refer to Table 19 "Allowance Allocation" for details pertaining to management&#8217;s allocation of the allowance to each loan category. 

Responsibility and accountability for effectively managing all risks, including credit risk, in the various business units lies with the first line of defense. Risk Management, in the second line of defense, oversees, assesses and effectively challenges the risk-taking activities of the first line of defense. Finally, Credit Risk Review provides ongoing oversight, as a third line of defense function, of the credit portfolios to ensure Regions&#8217; activities, and controls, are appropriate for the size, complexity and risk profile of the Company. 

Counterparty Risk 

Counterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction or contract could be unable or unwilling to fulfill its contractual or legal obligations. Exposure may be to a financial institution (such as a commercial bank, an insurance company, a broker dealer, etc.) or a corporate client. 

Regions has a centralized approach to approval, management, and monitoring of counterparty exposure. The Counterparty Risk Management Group is responsible for the independent credit risk management of financial institution counterparties and their affiliates. Market Risk Management is responsible for the measurement and stress testing of counterparty exposures. The Corporate and Commercial Credit groups are responsible for the independent credit risk management of client side counterparties. 

Financial institution exposure may result from a variety of transaction types generated in one or more departments of the Company. Aggregate exposure limits are established to manage the exposure generated by various areas of the Company. Counterparty client credit risk arises when Regions sells a risk management product to hedge risks in the client&#8217;s business. Exposures to counterparties are aggregated across departments and regularly reported to senior management. 

INFORMATION SECURITY RISK 

Regions faces information security risks, such as evolving and adaptive cyber-attacks that are conducted regularly against financial institutions in attempts to compromise or disable information systems. In the event of a cyber-attack or other data breach, Regions may be required to incur significant expenses, including with respect to remediation costs, costs of implementing additional preventative measures, addressing any reputational harm and addressing any related regulatory inquiries or civil litigation arising from the event. 

See Part I Item1C. Cybersecurity found earlier in this report for further information. 

FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE AND INTERNAL CONTROLS 

Regions maintains internal controls over financial reporting, which generally include those controls relating to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Regions&#8217; process for evaluating internal controls over financial reporting starts with understanding the risks facing each of its functions and areas, how those risks are controlled or mitigated, and how management monitors those controls to ensure that they are in place and effective. These risks, control procedures and monitoring tools are documented in a standard format. This format not only documents the internal control structures over all significant accounts, but also places responsibility on management for establishing feedback mechanisms to ensure that controls are effective. 

Regions also has processes to ensure appropriate disclosure controls and procedures are maintained. These controls and procedures as defined by the SEC are generally designed to ensure that financial and non-financial information required to be disclosed in reports filed with the SEC is reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&#8217;s rules and forms, and that such information is communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Regions&#8217; Disclosure Review Committee, which includes representatives from the legal, tax, finance, risk management, accounting, investor relations, and treasury departments, meets quarterly to review recent internal and external events to determine whether all appropriate disclosures have been made in reports filed with the SEC. In addition, the CEO and CFO meet quarterly with the SEC Filings Review Committee, which includes senior representatives from accounting, legal, risk management, treasury, and the business groups. The SEC Filings Review Committee provides a forum in which senior executives disclose to the CEO and CFO any known significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in Regions&#8217; internal controls over financial reporting, and provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements and other contents of the Company&#8217;s Form 10-K and 10-Q filings are accurate, complete, and timely. As part of this process, certifications of internal control effectiveness are obtained from Regions&#8217; associates who are responsible for maintaining and monitoring effective internal controls over financial reporting. These certifications are reviewed and presented to the CEO and CFO as support of the Company&#8217;s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting. The Form 10-K is presented to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors for approval, and the Forms 10-Q are reviewed by the Audit Committee. Financial results and other financial information are also reviewed with the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis. 

As required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the CEO and the CFO review and make certifications regarding the accuracy of Regions&#8217; periodic public reports filed with the SEC, as well as the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. With the assistance of the financial review committees noted in the previous paragraph, Regions continually assesses and monitors disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, and makes refinements as necessary.
