Cautionary Notice about Forward-Looking Statements and Other Terms 

From time to time we have made, and in the future will make, forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; &#8220;intend,&#8221; &#8220;pursue,&#8221; &#8220;seek,&#8221; &#8220;continue,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;project,&#8221; &#8220;outlook,&#8221; &#8220;forecast,&#8221; &#8220;potential,&#8221; &#8220;target,&#8221; &#8220;objective,&#8221; &#8220;trend,&#8221; &#8220;plan,&#8221; &#8220;goal,&#8221; &#8220;initiative,&#8221; &#8220;priorities,&#8221; or other words of comparable meaning or future-tense or conditional verbs such as &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; or &#8220;could.&#8221; Forward-looking statements convey our expectations, intentions, or forecasts about future events, circumstances, or results. 

This report, including any information incorporated by reference in this report, contains forward-looking statements. We also may make forward-looking statements in other documents that are filed or furnished with the SEC.

All forward-looking statements, by their nature, are subject to assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, which may change over time and many of which are beyond our control. You should not rely on any forward-looking statement as a prediction or guarantee about the future. Actual future objectives, strategies, plans, prospects, performance, conditions, or results may differ materially from those set forth in any forward-looking statement. While no list of assumptions, risks, or uncertainties could be complete, some of the factors that may cause actual results or other future events or circumstances to differ from those in forward-looking statements include:

&#8226; Our Dealer Financial Services business is one of the largest full-service automotive finance operations in the country and offers a wide range of financial services and insurance products to automotive dealerships and their customers. Dealer Financial Services comprises our Automotive Finance and Insurance segments. 

Our Automotive Finance operations include purchasing retail installment sales contracts and operating leases from dealers, extending automotive loans directly to consumers, offering term loans to dealers, financing dealer floorplans and providing other lines of credit to dealers, offering automotive-fleet financing, providing financing to companies and municipalities for the purchase or lease of vehicles, and supplying vehicle-remarketing services. Our dealer-focused business model, value-added products and services, full-spectrum financing, and business expertise proven over many credit cycles make us a premier automotive finance company. Our success as an automotive finance provider is driven by the consistent and broad range of products and services we offer to dealers. The automotive marketplace is dynamic and evolving, and we are focused on meeting the needs of both our dealer and consumer customers and continuing to strengthen and expand upon the approximately 4.5 million consumer accounts in our portfolio and 18,700 dealer relationships we have. Clearlane, our online automotive lender exchange, expands our direct-to-consumer capabilities and provides a digital platform for consumers seeking financing. Clearlane further enhances our automotive financing offerings, dealer relationships, and digital capabilities. Additionally, we continue to identify and cultivate relationships with automotive retailers including those with leading eCommerce platforms. We believe these actions will enable us to respond to the growing trends for a more streamlined and digital automotive financing process to serve both dealers and consumers. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

The Growth channel was established to focus on developing dealer relationships beyond those relationships that primarily were developed through our role as a captive finance company for GM and Chrysler. The Growth channel was expanded to include direct-to-consumer financing through Clearlane and other channels and our arrangements with online automotive retailers. We have established relationships with thousands of Growth channel dealers through our customer-centric approach and specialized incentive programs designed to drive loyalty amongst dealers to our products and services. The success of the Growth channel has been a key enabler to converting our business model from a focused captive finance company to a leading market competitor. In this channel, we currently have approximately 12,300 dealer relationships, of which approximately 86% are franchised dealers (including brands such as Ford, Nissan, Kia, Hyundai, Toyota, Honda, and others), or used vehicle only retailers with a national presence. 

Our Insurance operations offer both consumer finance protection and insurance products sold primarily through the automotive dealer channel, and commercial insurance products sold directly to dealers. We serve approximately 2.5 million consumers nationwide across F&#38;I and P&#38;C products. In addition, we offer F&#38;I products in Canada, where we serve more than 400,000 consumers and are the VSC and protection plan provider for GM Canada. As part of our focus on offering dealers a broad range of consumer financial and insurance products, we offer VSCs, VMCs, and GAP products. We also underwrite selected commercial insurance coverages, which primarily insure dealers&#8217; wholesale vehicle inventory. Ally Premier Protection is our flagship VSC offering, which provides coverage for new and used vehicles of virtually all makes and models. We also offer ClearGuard on the SmartAuction platform, which is a protection product designed to minimize the risk to dealers from arbitration claims for eligible vehicles sold at auction. 

&#8226; Our Mortgage Finance operations consist of the management of held-for-investment and held-for-sale consumer mortgage loan portfolios. Our held-for-investment portfolio includes bulk purchases of high-quality jumbo and LMI mortgage loans originated by third parties, and our direct-to-consumer Ally Home mortgage offering. 

Through the bulk loan channel, we purchase loans from several qualified sellers including direct originators and large aggregators who have the financial capacity to support strong representations and warranties and the industry knowledge and experience to originate high-quality assets. Bulk purchases are made on a servicing-released basis, allowing us to directly oversee servicing activities and manage refinancing through our direct-to-consumer channel. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, we purchased $659 million and $3.0 billion of mortgage loans that were originated by third parties. Our mortgage loan purchases are held-for-investment. 

Through our direct-to-consumer channel, which was introduced late in 2016, we offer a variety of competitively priced jumbo and conforming fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage products through a third-party fulfillment provider. Under our current arrangement, our direct-to-consumer conforming mortgages are originated as held-for-sale and sold, while jumbo and LMI mortgages are originated as held-for-investment. Loans originated in the direct-to-consumer channel are sourced by existing Ally customer marketing, prospect marketing on third-party websites, and email or direct mail campaigns. In April 2019, we announced a strategic partnership with Better.com, which delivers an enhanced end-to-end digital mortgage experience for our customers through our direct-to-consumer channel. Through this partnership, Better.com conducts the sales, processing, underwriting, and closing for Ally&#8217;s digital mortgage offerings in a highly innovative, scalable, and cost-efficient manner, while Ally retains control of all the marketing and advertising strategies and loan pricing. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, we originated $1.3 billion and $3.2 billion of mortgage loans through our direct-to-consumer channel. 

The combination of our bulk portfolio purchase program and our direct-to-consumer strategy provides the capacity to expand revenue sources and further grow and diversify our finance receivable portfolio with an attractive asset class while also deepening relationships with existing Ally customers. 

&#8226; Our Corporate Finance operations primarily provides senior secured leveraged cash flow and asset-based loans to mostly U.S.-based middle-market companies owned by private equity sponsors, and loans to asset managers that primarily provide leveraged loans. We believe our growing deposit-based funding model coupled with our expanded product offerings and deep industry relationships provide an advantage over our competition, which includes other banks as well as publicly and privately held finance companies. Our corporate finance lending portfolio is generally composed of first-lien, first-out loans. Our primary focus is on businesses owned by private equity sponsors with loans typically used for leveraged buyouts, mergers and acquisitions, debt refinancing, expansions, restructurings, and working capital. Additionally, our Lender Finance business provides asset managers with partial funding for their direct-lending activities. The portfolio is well diversified across multiple industries including manufacturing, distribution, services, and other specialty sectors. These specialty sectors include our Technology Finance and Healthcare verticals. Our Technology Finance vertical provides financing solutions to venture capital-backed, technology-based companies. The Healthcare vertical provides financing across the healthcare spectrum including services, pharmaceuticals, manufacturing, and medical devices and supplies. We also provide a commercial real estate product focused on lending to skilled nursing facilities, senior housing, medical office buildings, and hospitals. 

&#8226; Corporate and Other primarily consists of centralized corporate treasury activities, such as management of the cash and corporate investment securities and loan portfolios, short- and long-term debt, retail and brokered deposit liabilities, derivative instruments, original issue discount, and the residual impacts of our corporate FTP and treasury ALM activities. Corporate and Other also includes activity related to certain equity investments, which primarily consist of FHLB and FRB stock, the management of our 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

legacy mortgage portfolio, which primarily consists of loans originated prior to January 1, 2009, and reclassifications and eliminations between the reportable operating segments. 

Corporate and Other also includes the results of Ally Invest, our digital brokerage and wealth management offering, which enables us to complement our competitive deposit products with low-cost investing. The digital wealth management business aligns with our strategy to create a premier digital financial services company and provides additional sources of fee income through asset management and certain other fees, with minimal balance sheet utilization. This business also provides an additional source of low-cost brokered deposits through arrangements with Ally Invest&#8217;s clearing broker. 

Additionally, beginning in October 2019 with the acquisition of Health Credit Services, financial information related to our consumer unsecured financing is included within Corporate and Other. The Health Credit Services business has been renamed Ally Lending and currently serves medical and home improvement service providers by enabling promotional and fixed rate installment-loan products through a highly digital application process at point-of-sale. The home improvement segment was launched in the second quarter of 2020, now represents approximately 20% of new originations, and is expected to grow. We believe the market outlook for point-of-sale lending provides attractive opportunities for future diversification, including in the automotive servicing and vehicle upfit space. Point-of-sale lending broadens our capabilities, and expands our product offering into consumer unsecured lending, all while helping to further meet the financial needs of our customers. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details on the acquisition of Health Credit Services. 

Significant Business Developments Related to COVID-19 

The spread of COVID-19 has created a global public-health crisis that has resulted in widespread volatility and deteriorations in household, business, economic, and market conditions, including in the United States where we conduct nearly all of our business. Although several leading measures, such as labor conditions and the rate of growth as measured by GDP, indicate that an economic rebound has begun to occur ahead of initial expectations, COVID-19 has not yet been contained and could continue to affect significantly more households and businesses. 

Many governmental and nongovernmental authorities initially responded to COVID-19 by curtailing household and business activity as a containment measure while simultaneously deploying fiscal- and monetary-policy measures to partially mitigate the adverse effects on individual households and businesses. Although this response slowed the rate of spread of COVID-19 and supported economic stability, the number of cases has risen meaningfully at times, and the potential exists for further resurgences to occur, especially during the upcoming cold-and-flu season. In addition, while monetary policy remains highly accommodative, a number of stimulative fiscal programs and actions have expired or been exhausted without renewal. National, regional, and local economies and markets could suffer further disruptions that are lasting. 

While we have experienced improvements in our business during the three months ended September 30, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted us and our customers, counterparties, employees, and third-party service providers since its spread began to accelerate in March 2020. At this time, we cannot yet be confident in the extent of this negative impact or the trajectory of the macroeconomic outlook&#8212;especially with the recent resurgence of COVID-19 in much of the United States and ongoing uncertainties around the efficacy, availability, and acceptance of medical treatments and potential vaccines&#8212;and the adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations, and prospects could be significant. For further information on these risks and uncertainties, refer to the section titled Risk Factors in Part II, Item 1A of this report. 

During the pandemic, we have consistently prioritized the health and well-being of our employees, offered industry-leading support and relief to our customers, and strived to make a difference in the communities where we operate. These actions reflect our relentless &#8220;Do It Right&#8221; philosophy. 

&#8226; Credit-risk management &#8212; Our credit performance has been directly impacted by the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, the national unemployment rate was below 4% for an extended period and was projected to sustain those levels into the foreseeable future. Additionally, most widely available forecasts assumed that a moderate rate of growth would continue throughout 2020. The impact of the lockdowns, stay-in-place directives, and other restrictive actions issued and enforced by state and local officials as a result of the pandemic, contributed to a significant increase in the national unemployment rate, which rose to a peak of 14.7% in April before moderating at a faster-than-expected-pace to 7.9% as of September 30, 2020. Similarly, the rate of economic growth, as measured by GDP, declined sharply on a quarter-over-quarter seasonally adjusted annualized rate basis in the second quarter by 31.7%, and rebounded in the third quarter of 2020 as the economy grew by 33.1% quarter-over-quarter based on this measure. 

In response to the impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken significant actions to support our customers with industry-leading relief programs, while prudently managing our credit risk exposure. In our consumer automotive loan portfolio, existing customers had the option to elect to defer their payments for up to 120 days without late fees being incurred, but with finance charges continuing to accrue. This program was made available to all consumer automotive loan customers beginning March 18, 2020. The length of the deferral offering was reduced incrementally, until on June 21, 2020, we eliminated the offering and migrated back to our standard extension process. Following the termination of the program, we have continued to work with impacted customers in accordance with our established credit risk management policies and practices. We have invested significant resources, including introducing enhanced digital capabilities and new communication tools, to support customers who continue to experience hardships after the initial deferrals expire. Additionally, our scaled staffing model and resource capabilities have allowed 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

for a nimble response to augment staffing to support these efforts. For our commercial dealer customers that were current on all payment obligations, we offered a waiver of curtailments on wholesale floorplan loans, an increase in floorplan advance rates, a deferral of interest and insurance charges on wholesale borrowings, and a deferral of term loan payments from April through July 2020. In our mortgage-lending business, existing customers experiencing financial hardship due to an interruption of income related to the COVID-19 pandemic were afforded the opportunity to defer their loan payments for up to 120 days, with an option for an additional 60 days, without late fees being incurred but with interest continuing to accrue. In our personal-lending business, existing customers experiencing financial hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic had the opportunity to elect to defer their loan payments for up to 120 days without late fees being incurred or finance charges continuing to accrue. For more detail and further discussion about relief programs, refer to the section titled Credit Quality Indicators in Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and to the section titled Risk Management within this MD&#38;A. 

In addition to the support that we have provided to our customers, governments have taken unprecedented steps to partially mitigate the adverse effects of their actions to contain the spread of COVID-19. For example, in late March 2020, the CARES Act was enacted to inject more than $2 trillion of financial assistance into the U.S. economy. One component of the CARES Act is the PPP, which is a guaranteed, unsecured loan program administered by the SBA. Loans under the PPP are fully guaranteed and may be forgiven by the SBA and can be obtained by small businesses and other entities to cover payroll costs and other expenses, including mortgage payments, rents, and utilities. At September 30, 2020, we had 921 loans with a carrying value of $719 million outstanding to our commercial dealer customers under the PPP. As these loans are guaranteed by the SBA, we are exposed to limited to no incremental credit risk and do not maintain an allowance for loan losses under CECL for this portfolio. Among its other provisions, the CARES Act significantly expanded eligibility for, and the amount of, unemployment benefits, created and funded the advance payment of a refundable tax credit for 2020, and appropriated $500 billion to the Treasury Secretary to support U.S. air carriers and other U.S. businesses that have not otherwise received adequate economic relief as well as states and municipalities. A number of stimulus programs under the CARES Act have expired, including the provision of enhanced unemployment benefits. It is unclear whether Congress will renew these programs or create new ones and how our customers will be impacted. 

The pandemic has significantly impacted our provision for credit losses. During the second half of March 2020, the economy experienced a significant deterioration driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, which impacted our allowance for loan losses. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, we recorded an additional $602 million of provision expense for credit losses associated with the deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook from COVID-19. During the second quarter of 2020, we incurred total provision expense of $287 million, which included $128 million attributable to the macroeconomic environment and other factors aside from changes in portfolio size and incremental net charge-offs. During the third quarter of 2020, we incurred total provision expense of $147 million. Our provision expense for the quarter was composed of a replenishment of reserves due to incremental net charge-offs of $122 million, an increase in reserves of $59 million driven by an increase in portfolio size, and a reduction in reserves of $34 million attributable to the improving macroeconomic environment, predominately the unemployment rate, and other factors aside from changes in portfolio size and incremental net charge-offs. Additionally, provision expense for credit losses was favorably impacted by lower net charge-offs in our consumer automotive portfolio as losses decreased $136 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020, compared to the prior period in 2019. The significant decrease in net charge-offs in our consumer automotive portfolio for the three months ended September 30, 2020, was attributable to strong payment performance and delinquency trends through the pandemic. Personal income and savings levels have increased as lenders, including us, have provided significant support in the form of loan modifications and fee waivers, which is in addition to the fiscal and monetary stimulus actions detailed above. Similarly, consumer discretionary spending levels have decreased significantly during the pandemic, most notably in the first and second quarters of 2020, driven by reductions in spending on services as a result of stay-in-place orders and decreased travel. Net charge-offs in our consumer automotive portfolio also continue to benefit from strong used vehicle prices. In the third quarter of 2020, used vehicle prices, as well as our off-lease gain per unit, reached the highest level since January 2010, which reduced the realized loss impact in instances of default. Our provision expense for credit losses increased $615 million to $1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. While the macroeconomic environment has rebounded and improved during the quarter, the increase in provision expense year-over-year reflects the significant deterioration observed since the inception of the pandemic. The deterioration in the macroeconomic environment drove a significant increase in our allowance for loan losses during 2020, as compared to 2019. 

While we are encouraged by the positive signs in performance observed during the three months ended September 30, 2020, the degree to which our actions and those of governments and others will directly or indirectly assist our customers, and the economy generally, is not yet clear. 

&#8226; Liquidity management, funding, and capital markets &#8212; Our retail deposit business has remained a source of strength for us through the pandemic. To support our retail deposit customers, we waived fees for overdrafts, excessive transactions, and expedited shipping of checks and debit cards through July 31, 2020. Through September 30, 2020, we refunded fees of approximately $6 million on excess transactions and overdrafts. For our brokerage customers, we waived fees for broker-assisted trades, paper statements, and overnight outbound check processing through July 31, 2020. In our retail deposits business, we continue to monitor several key items in light of a highly uncertain macroeconomic outlook, including elevated competitive pressures on the direct-banking industry given the low rate environment, overall health of the consumer and potential impacts of the pandemic, uncertainty around further stimulus measures, and how customers deploy elevated savings levels over time. Our deposits franchise recorded strong growth in retail deposits during both the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020. During the three months 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

ended September 30, 2020, we grew retail deposits by approximately $5 billion to $120.8 billion, representing 19% growth year-over-year, despite declines in online savings account yields, as well as significant outflows as customers remitted tax payments to governmental authorities, which typically occurs earlier in the year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we grew retail deposits over $17 billion, led by an approximate $10 billion increase in the second quarter of 2020. Our retail deposit customer retention rate remained steady through the third quarter at 96% while we grew our mix of total deposit funding to 82%, with the remainder through secured, unsecured, and FHLB borrowings. For additional discussions surrounding our liquidity positions and related risks, refer to the section titled Liquidity Management, Funding, and Regulatory Capital in this MD&#38;A. 

In addition to the significant injection of fiscal stimulus by the federal government, the FRB has taken decisive and sweeping actions. Since March 15, 2020, these actions have included a reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate to zero to 0.25 percent, a program to purchase an indeterminate amount of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities, and numerous facilities to support the flow of credit to households and businesses, such as the Municipal Liquidity Facility, the Main Street Lending Program, the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility, the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, and the Commercial Paper Funding Facility. We continue to execute opportunistic liability management actions and secure additional liquidity at Ally Financial Inc. through the unsecured debt capital markets. On April 6, 2020, and June 1, 2020, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.8% senior unsecured notes due 2025 and $800 million aggregate principal amount of 3.05% senior unsecured notes due 2023, respectively. Additionally, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 1.45% senior unsecured notes due 2023 on September 16, 2020. To more cost-effectively manage liquidity at Ally Bank, we elected during the third quarter of 2020 to prepay and early terminate 13 FHLB advances with an aggregate principal balance of $2.5 billion. In doing so, we recognized a loss on early repayment of FHLB borrowings of $48 million on this transaction during the three months ended September 30, 2020. We continue to assess liability management opportunities utilizing our deposit funding at Ally Bank. 

Public equity markets have experienced significant volatility as a result of the pandemic, which has impacted our investment securities portfolio. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, we recognized net realized gains on equity securities of $7 million and $88 million, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2020, we recognized net unrealized gains on equity securities of $14 million, as compared to net unrealized losses on equity securities of $82 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Given the unpredictability of COVID-19 and its direct and indirect effects on market conditions, it is possible that unusual volatility in the equity markets could continue to positively or negatively impact our results. 

&#8226; Regulatory capital and stress testing &#8212; We continue to carefully monitor our capital and liquidity positions. On March 17, 2020, in order to support the FRB's effort to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the U.S. economy and the financial system, we announced the voluntary suspension of our stock-repurchase program through its termination on June 30, 2020. Consistent with the FRB&#8217;s restrictions on common-stock repurchases by large firms such as Ally, described below, we do not currently plan to implement a new stock-repurchase program or repurchase shares of our common stock, except in connection with compensation plans, for the remainder of 2020. 

We have elected to phase the estimated impact of CECL into regulatory capital in accordance with the interim final rule of the FRB and other U.S. banking agencies that became effective on March 31, 2020, and that was subsequently clarified and adjusted in a final rule effective September 30, 2020. As further described in Note 17 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we will delay recognizing the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital until after a two-year deferral period, which for us extends through December 31, 2021. Beginning on January 1, 2022, we will be required to phase in 25% of the previously deferred estimated capital impact of CECL, with an additional 25% to be phased in at the beginning of each subsequent year until fully phased in by the first quarter of 2025. As of September 30, 2020, the total deferred impact on Common Equity Tier 1 capital related to our adoption of CECL was $1.2 billion. 

We submitted our 2020 capital plan to the FRB in April 2020. In June 2020, the FRB provided us with the results of the supervisory stress test, additional industry-wide sensitivity analyses conducted in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and our preliminary stress capital buffer requirement. At the same time, the FRB announced its determination that changes in financial markets or the macroeconomic outlook could have a material effect on the risk profiles and financial conditions of firms subject to the capital-plan rule and that, as a result, the firms (including Ally) would be required to resubmit capital plans to the FRB within 45 days after receiving updated stress scenarios from the FRB. Also at the same time, the FRB announced the suspension of nearly all common-stock repurchases and restrictions on common-stock dividends for large firms such as Ally during the third quarter of 2020. In September 2020, the FRB released its updated scenarios and extended the limitations on common-stock repurchases and common-stock dividends for the fourth quarter of 2020. We updated our capital plan in light of firm-specific baseline and stress scenarios, as required, and submitted our updated plan to the FRB on November 2, 2020. Refer to Note 17 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion about regulatory capital, capital planning, and stress testing. 

At September 30, 2020, Ally and Ally Bank were &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; and met all applicable regulatory capital requirements, including with Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratios of 10.36% and 13.63%, respectively, compared to the minimum requirement of 4.50%. We continue to anticipate that we will have sufficient capital levels to meet all of these requirements. 

&#8226; Dealer Financial Services &#8212; Our lending and finance receivable balances have been impacted by the pandemic. Through the second quarter of 2020, as governments acted to temporarily close or restrict the operations of businesses, including automotive 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

dealers, and as many consumers and businesses changed their behavior in response to governmental mandates and advisories to sharply restrain commercial and social interactions, we experienced significant reductions in our consumer automotive loan applications. In addition, we observed downward pressure on the automotive sales and other operating results of our dealer customers, on their capacity to accept the return of leased vehicles, and on used-vehicle auction activity and values. Many automotive manufacturers and their suppliers also had taken measures to slow or shut down production in response to the pandemic, which negatively affected dealer inventory levels and sales and significantly reduced wholesale floorplan lending business to dealers. As consumers and businesses adapted to changed conditions and many governmental authorities relaxed their restrictions later in the second quarter, we began to observe a recovery in quality loan application volume and resulting booked originations. In addition, automotive manufacturers and suppliers restarted production, albeit at reduced levels, and in August 2020 we experienced our first month-over-month increase in wholesale floorplan balances since the pandemic was declared. For the three months ended September 30, 2020, we decisioned 3.2 million consumer automotive financing applications, consistent with prior year levels, and funded balances of approximately $9.8 billion, as compared to 3.1 million in applications and $7.2 billion in originations for the three months ended June 30, 2020. In the three months ended September 30, 2020, booked contracts from our used segment totaled over $5.4 billion. Our commercial automotive assets increased approximately $146 million in the third quarter of 2020. Refer to the section titled Automotive Financing Volume in this MD&#38;A for a further discussion regarding the impacts of COVID-19 on our business. 

In our Insurance operations, we similarly experienced significantly reduced F&#38;I written premiums in late March and early in the second quarter and then a gradual recovery since that time. Total F&#38;I written premiums were $269 million in the third quarter of 2020, which was down slightly from $274 million during the same period in the prior year. Written insurance premiums from our property and casualty business declined during the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, as a result of lower vehicle inventory levels due primarily to impacts of COVID-19. 

&#8226; Other consumer and commercial products &#8212; Within our Corporate Finance business, we experienced higher draws on commercial customer lines of credit during the second half of March 2020, but this trend abated in April. Through the second and third quarters of 2020, we experienced significant pay-downs on draws that had been taken at the outset of the pandemic. Our balance of unfunded commitments increased from $2.5 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2020 to $3.5 billion and $3.8 billion at the end of the second and third quarters, respectively. 

In our Mortgage Finance business, refinance volume and prepayment activity increased through the third quarter of 2020, driven by lower market interest rates. 

In Ally Invest, we observed a significant increase in self-directed accounts to 400 thousand through the third quarter of 2020. While we experienced a significant outflow of deposits to brokerage accounts after the pandemic had been declared, Ally Invest was able to capture approximately one-third of these outflows. Net customer assets reached $11.1 billion as of September 30, 2020, and we experienced higher than usual daily trade volume throughout the pandemic. 

In our personal lending business, we originated $167 million of personal loans during the three months ended September 30, 2020, almost double the amount originated during the prior quarter. 

&#8226; General operations &#8212; The COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental mandates and advisories have necessitated changes in the way we operate our business. We activated our business continuity plan in late February 2020 and, since then, have migrated nearly all our workforce off-site or to work-from-home arrangements to mitigate health risks. We are also carefully monitoring the activities of our vendors and other third-party service providers to manage the risks associated with any potential service disruptions. The length of time we may be required to operate under these circumstances, as well as the potential for them to worsen or for significant disruptions to occur, remains uncertain. While we have not yet experienced material adverse disruptions to our internal operations or third-party services due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to review evolving risks and developments. 

&#8226; Employees and communities &#8212; To support our employees during the pandemic, we have provided a range of financial-assistance offerings and enhanced benefits, including a $1,200 payment for those earning less than $100,000. In May, we launched the Ally Employee Relief Fund with a $250 thousand contribution. Through the end of the third quarter, this fund has been augmented by over $100 thousand in additional employee donations and has helped over 400 of our employees. In August, recognizing the continuing difficulties caused by the pandemic, we paid 50% of the 2020 incentive-compensation targets for most of our non-executive employees. These payments were not incremental but rather were an advance of expected year-end amounts. 

Consistent with our culture and &#8220;Do it Right&#8221; philosophy, we have pledged financial support to our communities for emergency needs, such as food, health care, emergency housing, and childcare. For example, on September 24, 2020, we announced our commitment to invest $30 million in communities across our geographic footprint over the next three years. We also announced the creation of the Ally Charitable Foundation, which will deploy grants to support economic mobility in the communities we serve with a focus on affordable housing, financial literacy, workplace preparedness, and other initiatives. 

We are committed to driving financial and social inclusion as part of our &#8216;Do it Right&#8217; philosophy. This means engaging with stakeholders&#8212;including our customers, communities, employees, and suppliers&#8212; to improve economic mobility. Most recently, in October 2020, we, alongside the Thurgood Marshall College Fund and Sean Anderson Foundation, held our second annual Moguls

We earned net income from continuing operations of $476 million and $399 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to $381 million and $1.3 billion for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2019. During the three months ended September 30, 2020, results were favorably impacted by lower provision for credit losses, driven by lower net charge-offs within our consumer automotive portfolio. Results were also favorably impacted by higher other revenue and net financing revenue and other interest income, which more than offset the increase in noninterest expense. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, results were unfavorably impacted by higher provision for credit losses, driven by economic disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results were also unfavorably impacted by lower net financing revenue and other interest income driven by decreases in our commercial automotive revenue due to lower outstanding floorplan assets and lower benchmark interest rates, lower income from cash balances and investment securities, and higher prepayment activity within our mortgage finance operations as well as higher noninterest expense. 

Net financing revenue and other interest income increased $12 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019, and decreased $77 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increase in net financing revenue and other interest income during the three months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019, was driven by increased consumer automotive financing revenue within our Automotive Finance operations, primarily due to improved portfolio yields, excluding the unfavorable impact of hedges, as a result of our continued focus on expanding risk-adjusted returns. The decrease in net financing revenue and other interest income during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, was negatively impacted by a decrease of $549 million in our commercial automotive financing revenue, primarily due to lower outstanding floorplan assets as a result of vehicle inventory declines that have resulted from lower automotive production levels due to COVID-19 and the GM strike which occurred in September 2019 and as a result of lower benchmark interest rates. Results were also unfavorably impacted by lower income from our investment securities portfolio, 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

lower interest income from cash balances due to a lower interest rate environment, and higher prepayment activity within our Mortgage Finance operations. This decrease was partially offset by a 19% decrease in total interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019, which was driven by lower market interest rates, which drove a decrease in our deposit rates, and our continued shift to more cost-efficient deposit funding. Our total deposit liabilities increased $15.7 billion to $134.9 billion as of September 30, 2020, as compared to September 30, 2019. 

The loss on extinguishment of debt increased $50 million and $48 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, as compared to the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2019. During the three months ended September 30, 2020, we recognized a loss on early repayment of FHLB borrowings of $48 million, as we elected during the third quarter of 2020 to prepay and early terminate 13 FHLB advances with an aggregate principal balance of $2.5 billion to more cost-effectively manage liquidity at Ally Bank. 

Other gain on investments was $64 million and $173 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to $27 million and $174 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increase in gain on investments for the three months ended September 30, 2020, was primarily driven by favorable equity markets conditions during the quarter. 

The provision for credit losses was $147 million and $1.3 billion for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to $263 million and $722 million for the same periods in 2019. The decrease in provision for credit losses during the three months ended September 30, 2020, was primarily driven by lower net charge-offs within our consumer automotive portfolio. The increase in provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, was primarily driven by reserve increases associated with the broad macroeconomic impact resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, increased as a result of higher provisions for specific loan exposures within our Corporate Finance operations. Refer to the Risk Management section of this MD&#38;A for further discussion on our provision for credit losses. 

Noninterest expense increased $67 million and $261 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, as compared to the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increases for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, were driven by higher compensation and benefits expense from the acquisition of Health Credit Services, which we renamed Ally Lending during the three months ended December 31, 2019, and increased expenses to support the growth of our consumer product suite, as we continue to make investments in our technology platform to enhance the customer experience and expand our digital capabilities and portfolio of products. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, was also driven by an impairment charge of $50 million related to the goodwill at Ally Invest. The recognition of this impairment was the result of certain business developments that impacted the expected growth and timing of revenue at Ally Invest. Refer to Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 

We recognized total income tax expense from continuing operations of $156 million and $159 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to $119 million and $140 million for the same periods in 2019. The increase in income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, was primarily due to the tax effects of an increase in pretax earnings. The increase in income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, was primarily due to a nonrecurring tax benefit of approximately $200 million from the release of valuation allowance on foreign tax credit carryforwards during the second quarter of 2019, and a nondeductible goodwill impairment during the second quarter of 2020, offset by the tax effects of a decrease in pretax earnings. The valuation allowance release resulted in a significant variation in the customary relationship between pretax income and income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.

(c) Includes the effects of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges, which is included within Corporate and Other. 

(d) Consists primarily of automotive dealer term loans, including those to finance dealership land and buildings, and dealer fleet financing. 

(e) Yield includes gains on the sale of off-lease vehicles of $71 million and $62 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to $28 million and $66 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2019. Excluding these gains on sale, the annualized yield was 4.88% and 4.86% for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to 4.93% and 4.87% for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2019. 

Our Automotive Finance operations earned income from continuing operations before income tax expense of $566 million and $722 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to income earned of $429 million and $1.2 billion for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2019. For the three months ended September 30, 2020, the increase was due primarily to lower provision for credit losses due to lower retail net charge-offs, and higher net financing revenue, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the decrease was due primarily to higher provision for credit losses as a result of the macroeconomic impact resulting from COVID-19 pandemic, and higher noninterest expense. 

Consumer automotive loan financing revenue increased $26 million and $129 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019. The increases were primarily due to improved portfolio yields, excluding the unfavorable impact of hedges, as a result of our continued focus on expanding risk-adjusted returns. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, higher average consumer assets contributed to the increase in revenue as a result of a continued focus on the used-vehicle portfolio primarily through franchised dealers and growth in application volume from our dealer network. Through these actions, we continue to optimize our origination mix and achieve greater portfolio diversification. 

Commercial loan financing revenue decreased $232 million and $549 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019. The decreases were primarily due to lower outstanding floorplan assets as a result of vehicle inventory declines that have resulted from lower automotive production levels due to COVID-19 and the GM strike which occurred in September 2019, as well as a reduction in the number of GM dealer relationships due to the competitive environment across the automotive lending market. The decreases were also due to lower yields resulting from lower average benchmark interest rates. 

Interest expense was $490 million and $1.6 billion for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to $671 million and $2.1 billion for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2019. The decreases were primarily due to lower market interest rates, which drove a decrease in our deposit rates, and our continued shift to more cost-efficient deposit funding. The decreases were also due to lower funding costs due to lower asset levels. 

Other income increased 3% and decreased 18% for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the decrease was primarily due to a decline in late fee income, attributed to a temporary suppression of late fees as a result of the implementation of our new technology platform for our consumer automotive loans and operating leases. In addition, for customers who elected to defer their payments as part of our COVID-19 relief efforts, late fees were not incurred during the deferral period, as further described in the Risk Management section of this MD&#38;A. The declines were also attributable to decreases in remarketing fee income as a result of disruptions to vehicle sale activities associated with COVID-19 during the first six months of 2020. 

Total net operating lease revenue increased $51 million and $22 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019. We recognized remarketing gains of $71 million and $62 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to $28 million and $66 million for the same periods in 2019. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2020, was primarily driven by continued new vehicle supply constraints and an increase in demand for used vehicles. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, was primarily driven by asset growth and favorable

performance and mix in our outstanding lease portfolio, which also partially contributed to the increase for the three months ended September 30, 2020. Refer to the Operating Lease Residual Risk Management section of this MD&#38;A for further discussion. 

The provision for credit losses was $128 million and $1.2 billion for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to $265 million and $707 million for the same periods in 2019. The decrease for provision expense for the three months ended September 30, 2020, was primarily driven by lower net charge-offs within our consumer automotive portfolio. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the increase in our consumer automotive provision was primarily driven by reserve increases associated with macroeconomic deterioration from the COVID-19 pandemic, which was partially offset by lower net charge-offs. Additionally, a provision expense increase in our commercial automotive portfolio was primarily driven by reserve increases associated with macroeconomic deterioration from the COVID-19 pandemic, which was partially offset by reserve decreases driven by $11.5 billion of lower assets primarily within our floorplan balances. Refer to the Risk Management section of this MD&#38;A for further discussion. 

Other operating expenses were $335 million and $992 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to $315 million and $953 million for the same periods in 2019. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, we incurred higher costs associated with the implementation of our new technology platform during the first quarter of 2020 for our consumer automotive loans and operating leases.

Automotive Financing Volume 

Consumer Automotive Financing 

Our portfolio yield for consumer automotive loans, excluding the impact of hedging activities, increased approximately 17 and 19 basis points for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, relative to the same periods in 2019. We set our buy rates using a granular, risk-based methodology factoring in several variables including interest costs, projected net average annualized loss rates at the time of origination, anticipated operating costs, and targeted return on equity. Our underwriting capabilities allow us to manage our risk tolerance levels to quickly react to major changes in the economy, including the current pandemic environment. Over the past several years, we have continued to focus on optimizing pricing relative to market interest rates as well as portfolio diversification and the used-vehicle segment, primarily through franchised dealers, which has contributed to higher yields on our consumer automotive loan portfolio. Commensurate with this shift in origination mix, we continue to maintain consistent, disciplined underwriting within our new and used consumer automotive loan originations. The carrying value of our nonprime consumer automotive loans before allowance for loan losses was $8.8 billion, or approximately 11.9%, of our total consumer automotive loans at September 30, 2020, as compared to $8.4 billion, or approximately 11.6% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2019.

Total consumer automotive loan and operating lease originations increased $528 million and decreased $2.1 billion for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2020, compared to prior year, was primarily driven by higher used retail originations, the majority of which was sourced from diversified channels. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared to prior year, was primarily due to decreased originations across all channels, driven by impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic including the temporary shutdown or restriction of front end operations of automotive dealers during the second quarter of 2020. These restrictions, along with the industry-wide halt of new vehicle production, drove a significant decrease in industry automotive light vehicle sales. 

Our lending and finance receivable balances have been impacted by the pandemic. Through the second quarter of 2020, as governments acted to temporarily close or restrict the operations of businesses, including automotive dealers, and as many consumers and businesses changed their behavior in response to governmental mandates and advisories to sharply restrain commercial and social interactions, we experienced significant reductions in our consumer automotive loan applications. As consumers and businesses adapted to changed conditions and many governmental authorities relaxed their restrictions later in the second quarter, we began to observe a recovery in quality loan application volume and resulting booked originations. For the three months ended September 30, 2020, we decisioned 3.2 million consumer automotive financing applications, consistent with prior year levels, and funded balances of approximately $9.8 billion, as compared to 3.1 million in applications and $7.2 billion in originations for the three months ended June 30, 2020. 

We have included origination metrics by loan term and FICO&#174; Score within this MD&#38;A.

Nonprime applications are subject to more stringent underwriting criteria (for example, minimum payment-to-income ratio and vehicle mileage, and maximum amount financed), and our nonprime loan portfolio generally does not include any loans with a term of 76 months or more. For discussion of our credit-risk-management practices and performance, refer to the section titled Risk Management . 

During the third quarter of 2020, we expanded our relationship with Carvana, a leading e-commerce platform for buying and selling used vehicles. Specifically, we increased our committed facility from $2.0 billion to $3.0 billion to support Carvana&#8217;s continued growth.

Commercial Wholesale Financing Volume 

The following table presents the percentage of average balance of our commercial wholesale floorplan finance receivables, in dollars, by product type and by channel.

Average commercial wholesale financing receivables outstanding decreased $12.1 billion and $8.6 billion during the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to same periods in 2019. The decreases were primarily driven by a reduction or temporary shutdown in manufacturer production as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the GM strike which occurred in September 2019, coupled with ongoing retail automotive sales, which reduced dealer stock levels. The declines were also impacted by a reduction in the number of GM dealer relationships due to the competitive environment across the automotive lending market. Dealer inventory levels are dependent on a number of factors, including manufacturer production schedules and vehicle mix, sales incentives, and industry sales. Manufacturer production and corresponding dealer stock levels, as well as dealer penetration levels, may continue to influence our future wholesale balances during 2020 and 2021. While manufacturer production generally resumed later in the second quarter, it is not currently clear what impacts the pandemic may have on future production levels and how that may ultimately impact new vehicle sales, commercial floorplan receivables and the overall health of our dealer customers. 

In addition to the increased loan purchase commitment executed with Carvana during the quarter, we have also increased our commitment to provide funding through Carvana&#8217;s inventory floorplan from $950 million to $1.25 billion and have extended the facility from October 2020 through March 2023.

Other Commercial Automotive Financing 

We also provide other forms of commercial financing for the automotive industry including automotive dealer term and revolving loans and automotive fleet financing. Automotive dealer term and revolving loans are loans that we make to dealers to finance other aspects of the dealership business, including acquisitions. These loans are usually secured by real estate or other dealership assets and are typically personally guaranteed by the individual owners of the dealership. Additionally, these loans generally include cross-collateral and cross-default provisions. Automotive fleet financing credit lines may be obtained by dealers, their affiliates, and other independent companies that are used to purchase vehicles, which they lease or rent to others. The average balances of other commercial automotive loans increased $127 million and $24 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019, to averages of $5.9 billion and $5.7 billion.

(b) Includes net unrealized gains on equity securities of $13 million and net unrealized losses of $80 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to net unrealized losses of $10 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019, and net unrealized gains of $59 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. 

(c) Management uses a combined ratio as a primary measure of underwriting profitability. Underwriting profitability is indicated by a combined ratio under 100% and is calculated as the sum of all incurred losses and expenses (excluding interest and income tax expense) divided by the total of premiums and service revenues earned and other income. 

Our Insurance operations earned income from continuing operations before income tax expense of $78 million and $101 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to $56 million and $201 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2020, was primarily driven by $59 million of net gains on investments, compared to $6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019, partially offset by an $11 million increase in insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, was primarily driven by a $41 million increase in insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses and a $35 million decrease in net gains on investments. 

Insurance premiums and service revenue earned was $276 million and $816 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to $280 million and $802 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, was primarily due to higher earned revenue within our F&#38;I portfolio, as revenue is earned over the life of the contracts on a basis proportionate to the anticipated cost pattern. The increase was partially offset by lower dealer vehicle inventory levels within our P&#38;C business. 

Insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses totaled $85 million and $301 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to $74 million and $260 million for the same periods in 2019. The increases for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, were primarily driven by higher weather-related losses. Total acquisition and underwriting expense increased $10 million and $30 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively. These increases were primarily due to increases in insurance commissions expense, commensurate with higher earned premiums in our F&#38;I portfolio. Higher

weather losses and expenses drove an increase in the combined ratio to 96.1% and 102.6% for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to 87.5% and 95.6% for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2019. In April 2020, we renewed our annual reinsurance program and continue to utilize this coverage to manage our risk of weather-related loss.

Insurance premiums and service revenue written was $333 million and $917 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to $357 million and $976 million for the same periods in 2019. The decrease for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, were primarily due to lower F&#38;I volume and lower dealer vehicle inventory levels due to the economic impact of COVID-19, as further described in the section titled Significant Business Developments Related to COVID-19 within the MD&#38;A. While this significantly reduced our F&#38;I written premiums in late March and early in the second quarter, we have experienced gradual recoveries since that time, with total F&#38;I written premiums of $269 million in the third quarter of 2020, which was down slightly from $274 million during the same period in the prior year. Written insurance premiums from our property and casualty business have declined during the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, as a result of lower vehicle inventory levels due primarily to impacts of COVID-19. 

Cash and Investments 

A significant aspect of our Insurance operations is the investment of proceeds from premiums and other revenue sources. We use these investments to satisfy our obligations related to future claims at the time these claims are settled. Our Insurance operations have an Investment Committee, which develops guidelines and strategies for these investments. The guidelines established by this committee reflect our risk appetite, liquidity requirements, regulatory requirements, and rating agency considerations, among other factors.

Our Mortgage Finance operations earned income from continuing operations before income tax expense of $26 million and $46 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to $11 million and $38 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increase for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, was primarily due to higher net gains on the sale of mortgage loans, which was partially offset by lower net financing revenue and other interest income, which was driven by higher prepayment activity. 

Net financing revenue and other interest income was $30 million and $98 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to $39 million and $135 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2019. The decreases in net financing revenue and other interest income for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, were primarily due to accelerated premium amortization of purchased loans due to higher prepayment activity, driven by a lower interest rate environment. Amortization was $35 million and $88 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to $21 million and $46 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2019. During the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, we purchased $659 million and $3.0 billion of mortgage loans that were originated by third parties, respectively, compared to $811 million and $2.7 billion for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2019, and originated $441 million and $1.4 billion of mortgage loans held-for-investment, compared to $556 million and $1.2 billion, during the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2019. 

Gain on sale of mortgage loans, net, was $34 million and $60 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to $10 million and $14 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increases were driven by higher direct-to-consumer mortgage originations and the subsequent sale of these loans to our fulfillment provider during the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020. During the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, we originated $845 million and $1.8 billion of loans held-for-sale, respectively, compared to $220 million and $464 million during the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2019. 

The provision for credit losses remained flat for the three months ended September 30, 2020, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019, and increased $2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019, as a result of reserve increases associated with broad macroeconomic impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our Corporate Finance operations earned income from continuing operations before income tax expense of $60 million and $24 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to income earned of $44 million and $103 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2020, is due to higher net financing revenue and other interest income resulting primarily from higher asset levels and the benefits of interest rate floors on the majority of the portfolio offsetting the impact of lower base rates. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, is due to higher reserve build for potential COVID-19-related credit losses partially offset by higher net financing revenue and other interest income resulting from asset growth. 

Net financing revenue and other interest income was $75 million and $220 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to $60 million and $175 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increases were primarily due to the growth of our loan portfolio, represented by a 17% increase in the amortized cost of our finance receivables and loans. Growth in the portfolio was primarily driven by asset-based lending, mostly through our lender finance vertical, which provides asset managers with partial funding for their direct lending activities. 

The provision for credit losses decreased $2 million and increased $111 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, was primarily driven by $85 million of incremental reserves associated with the broad macroeconomic impact resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, provision expense increased as a result of higher provisions for specific loan exposures. Refer to the Risk Management section of this MD&#38;A for further discussion on our provision for credit losses. 

Total noninterest expense was $23 million and $84 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to $22 million and $73 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increases were primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense and other noninterest costs associated with growth in the business.

Corporate and Other incurred a loss from continuing operations before income tax expense of $98 million and $335 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to a loss of $40 million and $79 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increases in loss were primarily driven by a decrease in total financing revenue and other interest income from our investment securities portfolio and hedging activities, loss on extinguishment of debt from the early repayment of FHLB debt, partially offset by lower interest expense. Additionally, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the increase in loss was also attributable to a $50 million goodwill impairment at Ally Invest that occurred in the second quarter of 2020. 

Financing revenue and other interest income was $144 million and $509 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to $237 million and $736 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2019. The decreases were primarily driven by the impacts of a lower interest rate environment on the investment securities portfolio and hedging activities. 

Total interest expense decreased $81 million and $98 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019. The decreases were primarily driven by lower market interest rates, which drove a decrease in our deposit rates, and our continued shift to more cost-efficient deposit funding. 

Total other revenue was $40 million and $151 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to $46 million and $105 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2019. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2020, was primarily due to a loss on early repayment of FHLB debt of $48 million in the current period and lower realized investment gains. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, was driven by increased realized investment gains. 

The provision for credit losses increased $23 million and $59 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increases in provision expense for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, were primarily driven by reserve increases in the Ally Lending portfolio from continued growth within the portfolio. Refer to the Risk Management section of this MD&#38;A for further discussion on our provision for credit losses. 

Total assets were $51.5 billion as of September 30, 2020, compared to $36.1 billion as of September 30, 2019. This increase was primarily the result of growth in our interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities portfolio. The increase was partially offset by a decline in our held-to-maturity securities portfolio and the continued runoff of our legacy mortgage portfolio. At September 30, 2020, the amortized cost of the legacy mortgage portfolio was $904 million, compared to $1.2 billion at September 30, 2019.

Average customer trades per day decreased 3% from the prior quarter and increased 231% from third quarter of 2019, driven primarily by market volatility. Additionally, net customer assets increased 15% in the third quarter of 2020, as a result of equity market appreciation and increased customer account openings.

Risk Management 

Managing the risk/reward trade-off is a fundamental component of operating our businesses, and all employees are responsible for managing risk. We use multiple layers of defense to identify, monitor, and manage current and emerging risks. 

&#8226; Business lines &#160;&#8212; Responsible for owning and managing all of the risks that emanate from their risk-taking activities, including business units and support functions. 

&#8226; Independent risk management &#8212; Operates independent of the business lines and is responsible for establishing and maintaining our risk-management framework and promulgating it enterprise-wide. Independent risk management also provides an objective, critical assessment of risks and&#8212;through oversight, effective challenge, and other means&#8212;evaluates whether Ally remains aligned with its risk appetite. 

&#8226; Internal audit &#8212; Provides its own independent assessments of the effectiveness of our risk management, internal controls, and governance; and independent assessments regarding the quality of our loan portfolios. Internal audit includes Audit Services and the Loan Review Group. 

Our risk-management framework is overseen by the RC. The RC sets the risk appetite across our company while risk-oriented management committees, the executive leadership team, and our associates identify and monitor current and emerging risks and manage those risks within our risk appetite. For more information on our risk management process, refer to the Risk Management MD&#38;A section of our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(b) Represents the current balance of conforming mortgages originated directly to the held-for-sale portfolio. 

(c) Represents the current unpaid principal balance of outstanding loans, which are subject to our customary representation, warranty, and covenant provisions. 

The risks inherent in our loan and operating lease exposures are largely driven by changes in the overall economy, used vehicle and housing prices, unemployment levels, and their impact on our borrowers. The potential financial statement impact of these exposures varies depending on the accounting classification and future expected disposition strategy. We retain the majority of our consumer automotive loans as they complement our core business model, but we do sell loans from time to time on an opportunistic basis. We ultimately manage the associated risks based on the underlying economics of the exposure. Our operating lease residual risk may be more volatile than credit risk in

stressed macroeconomic scenarios. While all operating leases are exposed to potential reductions in used vehicle values, only loans where we take possession of the vehicle are affected by potential reductions in used vehicle values. 

Credit Risk 

Credit risk is defined as the risk of loss arising from an obligor not meeting its contractual obligations to us. Credit risk includes consumer credit risk, commercial credit risk, and counterparty credit risk. 

Credit risk is a major source of potential economic loss to us. Credit risk is monitored by the RCs, executive leadership team, and our associates. Together, they oversee credit decisioning, account servicing activities, and credit-risk-management processes, and manage credit risk exposures within our risk appetite. In addition, our Loan Review Group provides an independent assessment of the quality of our credit portfolios and credit-risk-management practices, and reports its findings to the RC on a regular basis. 

To mitigate risk, we have implemented specific policies and practices across business lines, utilizing both qualitative and quantitative analyses. This reflects our commitment to maintaining an independent and ongoing assessment of credit risk and credit quality. Our policies require an objective and timely assessment of the overall quality of the consumer and commercial loan and operating lease portfolios. This includes the identification of relevant trends that affect the collectability of the portfolios, segments of the portfolios that are potential problem areas, loans and operating leases with potential credit weaknesses, and the assessment of the adequacy of internal credit risk policies and procedures. Our consumer and commercial loan and operating lease portfolios are subject to regular stress tests that are based on plausible, but unexpected, economic scenarios to assess how the portfolios may perform in a severe economic downturn. In addition, we establish and maintain underwriting policies and limits across our portfolios and higher risk segments (for example, nonprime) based on our risk appetite. 

Another important aspect to managing credit risk involves the need to carefully monitor and manage the performance and pricing of our loan products with the aim of generating appropriate risk-adjusted returns. When considering pricing, various granular risk-based factors are considered such as expected loss rates, loss volatility, anticipated operating costs, and targeted returns on equity. We carefully monitor credit losses and trends in credit losses relative to expected credit losses at contract inception. We closely monitor our loan performance and profitability in light of forecasted economic conditions and manage credit risk and expectations of losses in the portfolio. 

We manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower, the source of repayment, the underlying collateral, and current market conditions. We monitor the credit risk profile of individual borrowers, various segmentations (for example, geographic region, product type, industry segment), as well as the aggregate portfolio. We perform quarterly analyses of the consumer automotive, consumer mortgage, consumer other, and commercial portfolios using a range of indicators to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses based on historical and current trends. Refer to Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

Additionally, we utilize numerous collection strategies to mitigate loss and provide ongoing support to customers in financial distress. For consumer automotive loans, we work with customers when they become delinquent on their monthly payment. In lieu of repossessing their vehicle, we may offer several types of assistance to aid our customers based on their willingness and ability to repay their loan. Loss mitigation may include payment extensions and rewrites of the loan terms. For mortgage loans, as part of certain programs, we offer mortgage loan modifications to qualified borrowers. These programs are in place to provide support to our mortgage customers in financial distress, including principal forgiveness, maturity extensions, delinquent interest capitalization, and changes to contractual interest rates. 

Furthermore, we manage our credit exposure to financial counterparties based on the risk profile of the counterparty. Within our policies we have established standards and requirements for managing counterparty risk exposures in a safe and sound manner. Counterparty credit risk is derived from multiple exposure types including derivatives, securities trading, securities financing transactions, and certain cash balances. For more information on derivative counterparty credit risk, refer to Note 18 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

We employ an internal team of economists to enhance our planning and forecasting capabilities. This team conducts industry and market research, monitors economic risks, and helps support various forms of scenario planning. This group closely monitors macroeconomic trends given the nature of our business and the potential impacts on our exposure to credit risk. The U.S. economy has started to recover from shutdowns that resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic. After peaking at 14.7% in April, the unemployment rate declined to 7.9% as of September 30, 2020. As a result of the economic disruption from COVID-19, sales of light motor vehicles fell to an annual pace of 8.7 million in April, a 49-year low, before rising to a 16.3 million annual pace as of September 30, 2020. Elevated unemployment may limit further gains on used vehicle values through the remainder of 2020 despite this strengthening in values. 

Consumer Credit Portfolio 

During the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, the credit performance of the consumer loan portfolio reflected our underwriting strategy to originate a diversified portfolio of consumer automotive loan assets, including new, used, prime and nonprime finance receivables and loans, as well as high-quality jumbo and LMI mortgage loans that are acquired through bulk loan purchases and direct-to-consumer mortgage originations. We also further diversified our consumer portfolio to include personal lending through the acquisition of Health Credit Services during the fourth quarter of 2019. The carrying value of our nonprime consumer automotive loans before allowance for loan losses represented approximately 11.9% and 11.6% of our total consumer automotive loans at September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. For information on our consumer credit risk practices and policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, and charge-offs, refer to Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

(b) Loans are generally in nonaccrual status when principal or interest has been delinquent for 90 days or more, or when full collection is not expected. Refer to Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our accounting policies for finance receivables and loans. 

(c) Certain finance receivables and loans are included in fair value hedging relationships. Refer to Note 18 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

(e) Excludes $8 million of finance receivables at September 30, 2020, and $11 million at December 31, 2019, for which we have elected the fair value option. 

Total consumer finance receivables and loans increased $239 million at September 30, 2020, compared with December 31, 2019. The increase consists of $1.4 billion of consumer automotive finance receivables and loans, and $118 million of consumer other finance receivables and loans, largely offset by a decrease of $1.3 billion of consumer mortgage finance receivables and loans. The increase in consumer automotive finance receivables and loans was primarily related to continued momentum in our used vehicle lending. The increase in consumer other finance receivables and loans was primarily related to Ally Lending loan originations which outpaced portfolio runoff. These increases were largely offset by lower consumer mortgage finance receivables and loans as a result of loan pay-offs which exceeded bulk loan purchases and direct-to-consumer origination volume. 

Total consumer nonperforming finance receivables and loans at September 30, 2020, increased $522 million to $1.3 billion from December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to our consumer automotive and consumer mortgage loan portfolios as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Nonperforming consumer finance receivables and loans as a percentage of total outstanding consumer finance receivables and loans were 1.5% at September 30, 2020, and 0.9% at December 31, 2019. 

Total consumer TDRs outstanding at September 30, 2020, increased $798 million since December 31, 2019, to $1.5 billion. Results primarily reflect an $811 million increase in our consumer automotive loan portfolio, driven by the impact of our loan modification program offered to borrowers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as an increase in business as usual deferrals offered to customers subsequent to a COVID deferral, where the loan modification in connection with other factors resulted in a TDR classification. Refer to Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

Consumer automotive loans accruing and past due 30 days or more decreased $958 million to $1.7 billion at September 30, 2020, compared to December 31, 2019, driven primarily by the impact of our loan modification program offered to borrowers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and normal seasonal trends for borrowers not in deferral programs. We experienced a higher level of borrowers who entered nonaccrual status as result of a TDR classification primarily based on our evaluation of the loan under our TDR framework which included a number of loans that entered into a loan modification. 

In response to the impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken significant actions to support our customers with industry-leading relief programs, while prudently managing our credit risk exposure. 

In our consumer automotive loan portfolio, existing customers had the option to elect to defer their payments for up to 120 days without late fees being incurred, but with finance charges continuing to accrue. This program was made available to all consumer automotive loan customers beginning March 18, 2020. The length of the deferral offering was reduced incrementally, until on June 21, 2020, we eliminated the offering and migrated back to our standard extension process. Approximately 1.2 million consumer automotive loan customers enrolled in the program, of which 99% had reached their scheduled expiration as of September 30, 2020. For these deferrals that had exited the program and remain outstanding, the following provides certain credit quality indicators as of September 30, 2020.

(a) As of September 30, 2020, 4% of all loans that have exited the COVID-19 deferral program have been written down to estimated collateral value, less costs to sell. Refer to Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our charge-off policies. 

Of the 1.1 million accounts that had exited the program and were active and outstanding as of September 30, 2020, 89 thousand had received a subsequent extension through our standard process, of which 88% had been current at the time of the enrollment in the deferral program. The geographic concentration of our automotive borrowers that have exited the program as of September 30, 2020, is generally consistent with our overall automotive loan portfolio, as further described in this section of the MD&#38;A. While the cumulative enrollment in this program was unprecedented, loan extensions and modifications have historically been used successfully to help manage credit losses. We have previously been effective in administering large-scale loan extensions and modifications in targeted areas following certain natural disasters such as hurricanes and floods in recent years. We continue to carefully monitor the performance of our borrowers and have taken proactive steps to expand staffing levels in order to maximize collections and work with borrowers who may not be able to make their contractual payments upon exiting the deferral program. To date, current behaviors and payment activity have outperformed our initial expectations as well as historical payment performance for accounts with previously deferred payments. The future performance of these loans will be subject to a number of factors, including future economic conditions, the amount of additional Federal stimulus provided, and the level of impact that the COVID-19 pandemic may have. 

In our mortgage-lending business, existing customers experiencing financial hardship due to an interruption of income related to the COVID-19 pandemic were afforded the opportunity to defer their loan payments for up to 120 days, with an option for an additional 60 days, without late fees being incurred but with interest continuing to accrue. This program was made available to mortgage-lending customers from March 18, 2020, through July 31, 2020. Approximately 2,350 of our mortgage-lending customers enrolled in the program, which represented 7% of our total held-for-investment portfolio as of September 30, 2020. Of these customers, 40% had cancelled their deferrals ahead of schedule or paid their balances in full, 30% remain in active forbearance, and 30% had reached their scheduled expiration and had exited the pandemic-relief program as of September 30, 2020. For accounts that had reached the scheduled expiration of their forbearance program and remain outstanding, the following provides certain credit quality indicators as of September 30, 2020. 

&#8226; 87% of the loans were current, in a repayment plan, or subject to a modification; 

&#8226; 13% were past due or undergoing other loss mitigation efforts. 

In our personal-lending business, existing customers experiencing financial hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic had the opportunity to elect to defer their loan payments for up to 120 days without late fees being incurred or finance charges continuing to accrue. In addition to this program, we temporarily suspended late fees for all customers with current accounts. The loan-deferral program was made available to personal-lending customers from March 23, 2020, through June 30, 2020. Approximately 6,300 of our personal-lending customers were enrolled in the program, and 84% of these enrolled customers were current on their loans at the time of enrollment. As of September 30, 2020, 84% of the enrolled customers had exited the program, and the remaining accounts in active forbearance represent less than 1% of the total portfolio. 

In accordance with regulatory guidance, if borrowers are less than 30 days past due on their loans and enter into loan modifications offered as a result of COVID-19, their loans generally continue to be considered performing loans and continue to accrue interest during the period of the loan modification. For borrowers who are 30 days or more past due when entering into loan modifications offered as a result of COVID-19, we evaluate the loan modifications under our existing troubled debt restructuring framework, and where such a loan modification would result in a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, the loan is accounted for as a TDR and generally will not accrue interest. For all borrowers who enroll in loan modification programs offered as a result of COVID-19, the delinquency status of the borrowers is frozen as of the date immediately preceding the commencement of the program, resulting in a static delinquency metric during the deferral period. Upon exiting the deferral program, the measurement of loan delinquency resumes where it had left off upon entry into the program.

(a) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as net charge-offs divided by average outstanding finance receivables and loans excluding loans measured at fair value and loans held-for-sale during the period for each loan category. 

Our net charge-offs from total consumer finance receivables and loans were $118 million and $521 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to $251 million and $653 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2019. Net charge-offs for our consumer automotive portfolio decreased by $136 million and $143 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020. The decreases were primarily driven by strong payment performance and delinquency trends through the pandemic, as well as a lower number of loans migrating to charge-off as a result of the COVID-19 loan deferral program. In addition, our net charge-offs continue to benefit from strong used vehicle prices which has reduced the realized loss impact in instances of default. Through much of the first quarter, our consumer automotive loan portfolio experienced strong overall credit performance, driven by favorable macroeconomic conditions including low unemployment and continued disciplined underwriting. During the second half of March and continuing into the second quarter economic conditions deteriorated as a result of COVID-19. While economic conditions have improved later in the second quarter and into the third quarter, and we have taken a number of actions including the utilization of loan modification programs to support our customers and manage credit risk, we may incur higher charge-offs in future periods as a result of continued economic dislocation resulting from the impacts of COVID-19. 

The following table summarizes total consumer loan originations for the periods shown. Total consumer loan originations include loans classified as finance receivables and loans and loans held-for-sale during the period.

(a) Excludes bulk loan purchases associated with our Mortgage Finance operations, and includes $845 million and $1.8 billion of loans originated as held-for-sale for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, and $220 million and $464 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2019. 

(b) Amounts relate to originations from our Ally Lending business, following the acquisition of Health Credit Services during the fourth quarter of 2019. 

Total consumer loan originations increased $1.1 billion and decreased $463 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared to the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2020, was primarily due to growth in the direct-to-consumer mortgage business driven by the lower interest rate environment, and higher used automotive originations, the majority of which was sourced from the Growth channel. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, was primarily due to decreased originations across all consumer automotive channels driven by the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, including the temporary shutdown or restriction of front end operations of automotive dealers during the second quarter of 2020. These restrictions, along with the industry-wide halt of new vehicle production, drove a significant decrease in industry automotive light vehicle sales. This decrease was partially offset by growth in the direct-to-consumer mortgage business driven by the lower interest rate environment, as well as origination volume from Ally Lending.

The following table shows the percentage of consumer automotive and consumer mortgage finance receivables and loans by state concentration based on amortized cost. Total consumer automotive loans were $73.8 billion and $72.4 billion at September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. Total consumer mortgage loans were $16.1 billion and $17.3 billion at September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively.

(a) Presentation is in descending order as a percentage of total consumer finance receivables and loans at September 30, 2020. 

We monitor our consumer loan portfolio for concentration risk across the states in which we lend. The highest concentrations of consumer loans are in California and Texas, which represented an aggregate of 24.8% and 24.9% of our total outstanding consumer finance receivables and loans at September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. Our consumer mortgage loan portfolio concentration within California, which is primarily composed of high-quality jumbo mortgage loans, generally aligns to the California share of jumbo mortgages nationally. 

Repossessed and Foreclosed Assets 

We classify an asset as repossessed or foreclosed, which is included in other assets on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, when physical possession of the collateral is taken. We dispose of the acquired collateral in a timely fashion in accordance with regulatory requirements. For more information on repossessed and foreclosed assets, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Repossessed consumer automotive loan assets in our Automotive Finance operations decreased $13 million from December 31, 2019, to $134 million at September 30, 2020. Foreclosed mortgage assets decreased $7 million from December 31, 2019, to $2 million at September 30, 2020, primarily due to the foreclosure moratorium that is currently in place. 

Commercial Credit Portfolio 

During the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, the credit performance of the commercial portfolio remained stable as nonperforming finance receivables and loans decreased, and our net charge-offs remained low. For information on our commercial credit risk practices and policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, and charge-offs, refer to Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

(a) Includes nonaccrual TDR loans of $125 million and $114 million at September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. 

(b) Loans are generally in nonaccrual status when principal or interest has been delinquent for 90 days or more, or when full collection is not expected. Refer to Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our accounting policies for finance receivables and loans. 

(c) Other commercial and industrial primarily includes senior secured commercial lending largely associated with our Corporate Finance operations. 

Total commercial finance receivables and loans outstanding decreased $10.4 billion from December 31, 2019, to $27.9 billion at September 30, 2020. Results primarily reflect a $10.6 billion decrease in our commercial automotive loan portfolio due to lower dealer inventory levels, driven by lower automotive production levels due to COVID-19 and the GM strike which occurred in September 2019. However, as new vehicle inventories have started to recover, our commercial automotive finance receivables and loans have increased $146 million during the third quarter of 2020. This decrease was partially offset by $195 million of growth in our Corporate Finance portfolio that was primarily driven by asset-based lending, mostly through our lender finance vertical, which provides asset managers with partial funding for their direct lending activities. 

Total commercial nonperforming finance receivables and loans were $150 million at September 30, 2020, reflecting a decrease of $65 million when compared to December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to no new automotive dealership defaults or impairments during the third quarter of 2020, and lower dealer inventory levels, as well as the upgrade of one exposure within our Corporate Finance portfolio to accrual status. Nonperforming commercial finance receivables and loans as a percentage of outstanding commercial finance receivables and loans decreased to 0.5% at September 30, 2020, compared to 0.6% at December 31, 2019. 

In response to the impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken significant actions to support our commercial automotive customers while prudently managing our credit risk exposure. For our commercial dealer customers that were current on all payment obligations, we offered a waiver of curtailments on wholesale floorplan loans, an increase in floorplan advance rates, a deferral of interest and insurance charges on wholesale borrowings, and a deferral of term loan payments from April through July 2020. Approximately 2,290 or 73% of eligible dealers requested at least one form of this assistance for at least one month as part of this program. Approximately 32% of eligible wholesale dealers deferred wholesale interest and insurance payments during the third quarter of 2020, which represented a decline from the first and second quarters. Dealers that elected to defer wholesale interest and insurance payments have the option to repay such balances over a 4- or 12-month period without additional interest charges or fees. As of September 30, 2020, approximately 29% of these enrolled dealers had opted for 4-month repayment terms, 69% had opted for 12-month repayment terms, and 2% had paid all deferred charges in full. Of the dealers that had not yet paid in full, 100% were current on their repayment terms. We have collected over one-third of all deferred wholesale interest and insurance charges through September 30, 2020, and in the aggregate, remittances from dealers exceed their scheduled repayment obligations. 

Total commercial TDRs outstanding at September 30, 2020, increased $79 million since December 31, 2019, to $200 million. The increase was primarily driven by the restructuring of three exposures within our Corporate Finance portfolio. Refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

Our net charge-offs from total commercial finance receivables and loans were $4 million and $45 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to net charge-offs of $16 million and $33 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2019. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2020, was primarily driven by the partial charge-off of a single exposure in our Corporate Finance portfolio during the three months ended September 30, 2019, that did not reoccur. This decrease was partially offset by the charge-offs of two exposures in our commercial automotive portfolio. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, was primarily driven by our Corporate Finance portfolio and included charge-offs related to two exposures, including the full charge-off of one exposure during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. These charge-offs were larger than the total charge-offs related to three exposures recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This increase was also impacted by the charge-offs of two exposures in our commercial automotive portfolio. 

Commercial Real Estate 

The commercial real estate portfolio consists of finance receivables and loans issued primarily to automotive dealers. Commercial real estate finance receivables and loans were $4.9 billion and $5.0 billion at September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively.

Commercial Criticized Exposure 

Finance receivables and loans classified as special mention, substandard, or doubtful are reported as criticized. These classifications are based on regulatory definitions and generally represent finance receivables and loans within our portfolio that have a higher default risk or have already defaulted. These finance receivables and loans require additional monitoring and review including specific actions to mitigate our potential loss. 

Total criticized exposures increased $229 million from December 31, 2019, to $4.5 billion at September 30, 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in special mention accounts within our Corporate Finance portfolio. The increase was mainly driven by the impact of COVID-19 on the operations of borrowers in several different industries. This increase was largely offset by lower dealer inventory levels in our commercial automotive portfolio driven by COVID-19-related production shutdowns during the second quarter of 2020, as well as continued lower production levels as automotive manufacturers work to return to pre-pandemic levels. 

The following table presents the percentage of total commercial criticized finance receivables and loans by industry concentration based on amortized cost.

Allowance for Loan Losses 

Implementation of CECL 

We adopted CECL on January 1, 2020, as further described in Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Upon implementation of CECL, we recognized a reduction to our opening retained earnings balance of approximately $1.0 billion, net of income tax, which reflects a pre-tax increase to the allowance for loan losses of approximately $1.3 billion. This increase is almost exclusively driven by our consumer automotive loan portfolio. 

We have elected to phase the estimated impact of CECL into regulatory capital in accordance with the interim final rule of the FRB and other U.S. banking agencies that became effective on March 31, 2020, and was subsequently clarified and adjusted in a final rule effective September 30, 2020. As a result, we will delay recognizing the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital until after a two-year deferral period, which for us extends through December 31, 2021. Beginning on January 1, 2022, we will be required to phase in 25% of the previously deferred estimated capital impact of CECL, with an additional 25% to be phased in at the beginning of each subsequent year until fully phased in by the first quarter of 2025. Refer to Note 17 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details about the impact of CECL on regulatory capital. 

The CECL standard introduced a new accounting model to measure credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized costs. In contrast to the previous incurred loss model, CECL requires credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost to be determined based on the total current expected credit losses over the life of the financial asset or group of assets. 

Under CECL, our modeling processes incorporate the following considerations: 

&#8226; a single forecast scenario for macroeconomic factors incorporated into the modeling process; 

&#8226; a 12-month reasonable and supportable forecast period for macroeconomic factors with a reversion to the historical mean on a straight-line basis over a 24-month period; and 

&#8226; data from the historical mean will be calculated from January 2008 through the most current period which includes data points from the most recent recessionary period. 

Our quantitatively determined allowance under CECL is impacted by certain forecasted economic factors as further described in Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. For example, macroeconomic variables that our consumer automotive allowance for loan losses is most sensitive to include national and state unemployment levels. Our process for determining the allowance for loan losses considers a borrower&#8217;s willingness and ability to pay and considers other factors, including loan modification programs. In addition to our quantitative allowance for credit losses, we also incorporate qualitative adjustments that may relate to idiosyncratic risks, changes in current economic conditions that may not be reflected in quantitatively derived results such as the impacts associated with COVID-19. 

COVID-19 Impacts 

During the second half of March 2020, the economy experienced a significant deterioration in the macroeconomic environment driven by the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in notable adverse changes to forecasted economic variables that are utilized in our modeling processes. Given the fact that the macroeconomic information utilized in our quantitative allowance processes did not fully reflect the rapidly evolving economic changes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we utilized our qualitative allowance framework to ensure the total reserve under CECL reflected the most current forecast of the broader macroeconomic environment. 

To help inform our forecast, we considered publicly published, broadly available stressed macroeconomic data including the Moody&#8217;s forecast from March 27, 2020, that reflected the most recent available information that considered the evolving impacts of developments from the COVID-19 pandemic as of March 31, 2020, in order to support the qualitative adjustments incorporated into our total allowance. Stressed macroeconomic variables that we utilized as of March 31, 2020, include the following, among others: unemployment rate approaching 10%, significant GDP contraction quarter-over-quarter, and declining new light vehicle sales. Our qualitatively determined allowance associated with deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook from COVID-19 resulted in provision expense of $602 million which was incremental to our modeled reserves. 

Through June 2020, forecasted economic variables utilized in our allowance modeling processes were updated to reflect the current macroeconomic environment and our future expectations which included (but were not limited to) the following: the unemployment rate rising to a peak of approximately 14%, declining to approximately 9% by the end of 2020, before subsequently migrating to our historical mean of approximately 6% by the middle of 2023, significant near-term GDP contraction, and a continuation of lower levels of new light vehicle sales. The updated economic forecast resulted in an increase in the allowance for loan losses informed through our modeling process as compared to the period ending March 31, 2020. Using our qualitative allowance framework, we reassessed and adjusted levels to reflect our current estimate of credit losses in our portfolios which considered among other things, idiosyncratic risks as well as performance of our portfolio subject to our deferral programs. 

Through September 2020, forecasted economic variables utilized in our allowance modeling processes were updated to reflect the current macroeconomic environment and our future expectations which included (but were not limited to) the following: the unemployment rate moderating to approximately 9% in September 2020 after reaching year-to-date highs of nearly 15% in April 2020, declining to approximately 8% by the end of 2020, before migrating downward to our historical mean of approximately 7% by the third quarter of 2023, a

significant near term recovery in GDP as measured on a quarter-over-quarter seasonally adjusted annualized rate basis, and a recovery of new light vehicle sales on a seasonally adjusted annualized rate basis of approximately 15 million units by the end of 2020. In addition to updating the macroeconomic variables for our quantitative processes, we reassessed reserves under our qualitative framework for potential adjustment during the quarter ended September 30, 2020. The improvement in the macroeconomic outlook through our modeling processes resulted in a decrease in reserves that was more than offset by other factors, specifically the significant increase in end of period balances in our consumer automotive portfolio. As a result, our overall allowance for loan losses increased $25 million from the prior quarter to $3.4 billion at September 30, 2020, representing 2.9% as a percentage of total finance receivables and loans, compared to 2.8% as of June 30, 2020, and compared to 2.5% as of March 31, 2020.

(a) Coverage percentages are based on the allowance for loan losses related to finance receivables and loans excluding those loans held at fair value as a percentage of the gross carrying value. 

The allowance for consumer loan losses at September 30, 2020, increased $2.0 billion compared to September 30, 2019, reflecting increases of $1.9 billion in the consumer automotive allowance and $67 million in the consumer other allowance, partially offset by a decrease of $5 million in the consumer mortgage allowance. The increase in our consumer allowance was primarily driven by our adoption of CECL, which resulted in a $1.3 billion increase to the allowance for loan losses. Additionally, our consumer allowance for loan losses increased as a result of the broad macroeconomic impact resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in the consumer mortgage allowance was primarily driven by the decrease in finance receivables of $938 million at September 30, 2020, compared to September 30, 2019. 

The allowance for commercial loan losses increased $148 million at September 30, 2020, compared to September 30, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by our commercial automotive and Corporate Finance portfolios due to reserve increases associated with higher expected losses due to COVID-19 driven market deterioration, partially offset by reserve decreases driven by approximately $11.5 billion of lower commercial automotive balances. 

The provision for consumer loan losses was $151 million and $1.1 billion for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to $259 million and $688 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2019. The decrease in provision expense for the three months ended September 30, 2020, was primarily driven by lower net charge-offs within our consumer automotive portfolio. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the increase in provision for credit losses was primarily driven by consumer automotive reserve increases associated with higher expected losses due to the broad macroeconomic impact resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, which were partially offset by lower net charge-offs within our consumer automotive portfolio. 

The provision for commercial loan losses decreased $8 million and increased $169 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2019. For the three months ended September 30, 2020, the decrease in provision for credit losses was primarily driven by reserve releases within our commercial automotive

The increase in provision expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, was primarily driven by reserve increases in our commercial portfolios associated with the broad macroeconomic impact resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, which were partially offset by reserve decreases driven by $11.5 billion of lower assets primarily within our floorplan balances.

Market Risk 

Our financing, investing, and insurance activities give rise to market risk, or the potential change in the value of our assets (including securities, assets held-for-sale, loans and operating leases) and liabilities (including deposits and debt) due to movements in market variables, such as interest rates, credit spreads, foreign-exchange rates, equity prices, and off-lease vehicle prices. 

The impact of changes in benchmark interest rates on our assets and liabilities (interest rate risk) represents an exposure to market risk. We primarily use interest rate derivatives to manage our interest rate risk exposure. 

The fair value of our credit-sensitive assets is also exposed to credit spread risk. Credit spread is the amount of additional return over the benchmark interest rates that an investor would demand for taking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument. Generally, an increase in credit spreads would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. 

We are also exposed to foreign-currency risk arising from foreign-currency denominated assets and liabilities, primarily in Canada. We enter into hedges to mitigate foreign exchange risk. 

We also have exposure to changes in the value of equity securities. We have exposure to equity securities with readily determinable fair values primarily related to our Insurance operations. For such equity securities, we use equity derivatives to manage our exposure to equity price fluctuations. In addition, we are exposed to changes in the value of other equity investments without readily determinable fair market values. Refer to Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We may experience changes in the valuation of these investments, which may cause volatility in our earnings. 

The composition of our balance sheet, including shorter-duration consumer automotive loans and variable-rate commercial loans, coupled with the continued funding shift toward retail deposits, partially mitigates market risk. Additionally, we maintain risk-management controls that measure and monitor market risk using a variety of analytical techniques including market value, sensitivity analysis, and value at risk models. Refer to Note 18 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

LIBOR Transition 

LIBOR is an important interest rate benchmark that is expected to be discontinued by the end of 2021. We recognize the significance of LIBOR cessation, and have devoted numerous resources throughout all levels of the organization since 2018 to actively identify, assess, monitor, and mitigate risks associated with this transition. Our LIBOR cessation program is also subject to the governance and oversight of 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

our Board through the RC and certain executive committees including the ALCO and the ERMC. For a more detailed discussion of our planned transition away from LIBOR, refer to the section titled Risk Management&#8212;LIBOR Transition in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform: Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, as further described in Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The final guidance issued by the FASB is intended to help facilitate the market transition from existing reference interest rates to alternative reference interest rates. This guidance provides temporary, optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The amendments provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The amendments primarily include relief related to contract modifications, hedging relationships, and it also provides a one-time election for the sale or transfer of debt securities classified as held-to-maturity. This guidance is effective immediately and the amendments may be applied prospectively through December 31, 2022. We are currently in the process of evaluating the amendments and we anticipate the final guidance will allow for greater flexibility in the transition away from LIBOR. 

Net Financing Revenue Sensitivity Analysis 

Interest rate risk represents one of our most significant exposures to market risk. We actively monitor the level of exposure to movements in interest rates and take actions to mitigate adverse impacts these movements may have on future earnings. We use a sensitivity analysis of net financing revenue as our primary metric to measure and manage the interest rate risk of our financial instruments. 

We prepare forward-looking baseline forecasts of net financing revenue taking into consideration anticipated future business growth, asset/liability positioning, and interest rates based on the implied forward curve. The analysis is highly dependent upon a variety of assumptions including the repricing characteristics of retail deposits with both contractual and non-contractual maturities. We continually monitor industry and competitive repricing activity along with other market factors when contemplating deposit pricing actions. 

Simulations are then used to assess changes in net financing revenue in multiple interest rate scenarios relative to the baseline forecast. The changes in net financing revenue relative to the baseline are defined as the sensitivity. Our simulations incorporate contractual cash flows and repricing characteristics for all assets, liabilities, and off-balance-sheet exposures and incorporate the effects of changing interest rates on the prepayment and attrition rates of certain assets and liabilities. Our simulation does not assume any specific future actions are taken to mitigate the impacts of changing interest rates. 

The net financing revenue sensitivity tests measure the potential change in our pretax net financing revenue over the following 12 months. We test a number of alternative rate scenarios, including immediate and gradual parallel shocks to the implied market forward curve. Management also evaluates nonparallel shocks to interest rates and stresses to certain term points on the yield curve in isolation to capture and monitor a number of risk types. Relative to our baseline forecast, which is based on the implied forward curve, our net financing revenue over the next 12 months would increase by $3 million if interest rates remain unchanged. 

The following table presents the pretax dollar impact to forecasted net financing revenue over the next 12 months assuming various shocks to the implied market forward curve as of September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019. 

Gradual (a) Instantaneous Change in interest rates ($ in millions) September 30, 2020 +200 basis points $ 171 &#160; $ 221 &#160;

+100 basis points 

(1) 7 -100 basis points 17 67 

(a) Gradual changes in interest rates are recognized over 12 months. 

(b) With rates at or near historical lows across the curve, a scenario with rates declining 25 basis points is being utilized, which management believes is more meaningful to understand exposure to lower rates in the current market rate environment rather than the down 100 basis point scenario. Our models currently assume rates do not go below zero. 

The implied forward rate curve was significantly lower across all tenors compared to December 31, 2019, as interest rates were at or near historical lows across the curve. The impact of this change is reflected in our baseline net financing revenue projections. As of September 30, 2020, the expected benefit of an upward instantaneous interest rate shock scenario has increased, primarily due to changes to our derivative hedging position, higher cash balances, as well as our continued shift in funding to retail deposits. 

The exposure in the downward instantaneous interest rate shock scenario is largely driven by mortgage prepayment risk and is muted as our models assume rates do not go below zero. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

Our risk position is influenced by the impact of hedging activity which primarily consists of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of certain fixed-rate assets and fixed-rate debt instruments, and pay-fixed interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges of certain floating-rate debt instruments. We also have the ability to utilize interest rate floor contracts designated as cash flow hedges on certain floating-rate assets. The size, maturity, and mix of our hedging activities are adjusted as our balance sheet, ALM objectives, and interest rate environment evolve over time. 

Operating Lease Residual Risk Management 

We are exposed to residual risk on vehicles in the consumer operating lease portfolio. This operating lease residual risk represents the possibility that the actual proceeds realized upon the sale of returned vehicles will be lower than the projection of these values used in establishing the pricing at lease inception. However, certain automotive manufacturers have provided their guarantee for portions of our residual exposure, as further described in Note 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Our operating lease portfolio, net of accumulated depreciation was $9.5 billion and $8.9 billion as of September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. The expected lease residual value of our operating lease portfolio at scheduled termination was $7.8 billion and $7.2 billion as of September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. For information on our valuation of automotive operating lease residuals including periodic revisions through adjustments to depreciation expense based on current and forecasted market conditions, refer to the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates &#8212; Valuation of Automotive Operating Lease Assets and Residuals within the MD&#38;A in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We recognized an average gain per vehicle of $2,437 and $810 for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to an average gain per vehicle of $944 and $773 for the same periods in 2019. The increases in remarketing performance were primarily due to continued new vehicle supply constraints and an increase in demand for used vehicles. The number of off-lease vehicles remarketed during the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, decreased 4% and 11%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019, primarily due to reduced early termination activity resulting from continued new vehicle supply constraints. 

To support our customers and help mitigate lease residual risk, we deferred lease payments without fees for up to 120 days for any consumer requesting assistance related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately 55,000 of our lease customers enrolled in this lease modification program, and approximately 60% of these customers were granted a 120-day deferral at the time of enrollment. As of September 30, 2020, substantially all of these customers had exited the program and of these approximately 2,900 had paid in full and terminated their leases. Of the customers that had exited the program with outstanding lease obligations, 94% were current on their lease obligations as of September 30, 2020. We also provided a program for and, in some cases, incentivized customers nearing their scheduled lease-end dates to extend their leases for up to an additional 180 days. Eligible customers who opted into this program during the early part of the second quarter were not charged for the first month of the extension, and the following months of the extended lease were offered under the terms of the existing lease contract. Approximately 8,500 customers had opted into an extension requiring additional payments, and as of September 30, 2020, approximately 4,500 remained enrolled in the program.

Liquidity Management, Funding, and Regulatory Capital 

Overview 

The purpose of liquidity management is to enable us to meet loan and operating lease demand, debt maturities, deposit withdrawals, and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions as well as periods of economic or financial stress. Our primary objective is to maintain cost-effective, stable and diverse sources of funding capable of sustaining the organization throughout all market cycles. Sources of funding include both retail and brokered deposits and secured and unsecured market-based funding across various maturity, interest rate, and investor profiles. Additional liquidity is available through a pool of unencumbered highly liquid securities, committed secured credit facilities, repurchase agreements, and advances from the FHLB of Pittsburgh. 

We define liquidity risk as the risk that an institution&#8217;s financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by the actual or perceived inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding or to easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions. Liquidity risk can arise from a variety of institution-specific or market-related events that could have a negative impact on cash flows available to the organization. Effective management of liquidity risk positions an organization to meet cash flow obligations caused by unanticipated events. Managing liquidity needs and contingent funding exposures has proven essential to the solvency of financial institutions. 

The ALCO, chaired by the Corporate Treasurer, is responsible for overseeing our funding and liquidity strategies. Corporate Treasury is responsible for managing our liquidity positions within limits approved by ALCO and the RC. As part of managing liquidity risk, Corporate Treasury prepares periodic forecasts depicting anticipated funding needs and sources of funds, executes our funding strategies, and manages liquidity under normal as well as more severely stressed macroeconomic environments. Oversight and monitoring of liquidity risk are provided by Independent Risk Management. 

Funding Strategy 

Liquidity and ongoing profitability are largely dependent on the timely and cost-effective access to retail deposits and funding in various segments of the capital markets. We focus on maintaining diversified funding sources across a broad base of depositors, lenders, and investors to meet liquidity needs throughout different economic cycles, including periods of financial distress. These funding sources include retail and brokered deposits, committed secured credit facilities, public and private asset-backed securitizations, unsecured debt, FHLB advances, whole-loan sales, demand notes, and repurchase agreements. Our access to diversified funding sources enhances funding flexibility and results in a more cost-effective funding strategy over the long term. We evaluate funding markets on an ongoing basis to achieve an appropriate balance of unsecured and secured funding sources and maturity profiles. 

We manage our funding to achieve a well-balanced portfolio across a spectrum of risk, maturity, and cost-of-funds characteristics. Optimizing funding at Ally Bank continues to be a key part of our long-term liquidity strategy. We optimize our funding sources at Ally Bank by growing retail deposits, maintaining active public and private securitization programs, managing a prudent maturity profile of our brokered deposit portfolio, utilizing repurchase agreements, and continuing to access funds from the FHLB. 

Essentially all asset originations are directed to Ally Bank to reduce parent company exposures and funding requirements, and to utilize our growing consumer deposit-taking capabilities. This allows us to use bank funding for an increasing proportion of our automotive finance and other assets and to provide a sustainable long-term funding channel for the business, while also improving the cost of funds for the enterprise. 

Liquidity Risk Management 

Multiple metrics are used to measure liquidity risk, manage the liquidity position, identify related trends, and monitor such trends and metrics against established limits. These metrics include comprehensive stress tests that measure the sufficiency of the liquidity portfolio over stressed horizons ranging from overnight to 12 months, stability ratios that measure longer-term structural liquidity, and concentration ratios that enable prudent funding diversification. In addition, we have established internal management routines designed to review all aspects of liquidity and funding plans, evaluate the adequacy of liquidity buffers, review stress testing results, and assist management in the execution of its funding strategy and risk-management accountabilities. 

Our liquidity stress testing is designed to allow us to operate our businesses and to meet our contractual and contingent obligations, including unsecured debt maturities, for at least 12 months, assuming our normal access to funding is disrupted by severe market-wide and enterprise-specific events. We maintain available liquidity in the form of cash, unencumbered highly liquid securities, and available committed secured credit facility capacity. This available liquidity is held at various legal entities, and is subject to regulatory restrictions and tax implications that may limit our ability to transfer funds across entities.

Recent Funding Developments 

During March 2020, the spread of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. This global health crisis has resulted in economic disruption and volatility in the capital markets. While credit spreads for longer-term funding sources such as unsecured debt and ABS issuance increased significantly initially, FRB actions in response to the disruptions reduced credit spreads and improved market liquidity. These actions included providing significant quantitative-easing programs, expanding the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility to include a wider range of securities, broadening the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, launching new funds and facilities to support employers, consumers and businesses, and establishing the Term Asset-Backed Loan Facility to facilitate ABS issuance of student, automotive, credit card, and small business loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration. We continue to closely monitor market conditions, and actions taken by banking agencies to support general market liquidity. In recent years, we have become less reliant on market-based funding and believe we have adequate liquidity to meet our near-term funding needs. However, it is not currently clear to what degree the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our future funding profile if market dislocation recurs. 

Key funding highlights from January 1, 2020, to date were as follows: 

&#8226; For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we accessed the unsecured debt capital markets and raised $2.3 billion through the issuance of senior notes, which provided additional liquidity at Ally Financial Inc. 

&#8226; We elected during the third quarter of 2020 to prepay and early terminate 13 FHLB advances with an aggregate principal balance of $2.5 billion to more cost-effectively manage liquidity at Ally Bank. 

&#8226; Our total capacity in committed secured credit facilities was reduced by $1.2 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, as we continue to shift our overall funding toward a greater mix of cost-effective deposit funding.

Deposits 

Ally Bank is a direct bank with no branch network that obtains retail deposits directly from customers through internet, telephone, mobile, and mail channels. These retail deposits provide our Automotive Finance, Mortgage Finance, and Corporate Finance operations as 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

well as Ally Lending with a stable and low-cost funding source. Retail deposits are a key driver of funding cost optimization and reduced reliance on capital markets-based funding. We believe retail deposits are less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility, or changes in credit ratings when compared to other funding sources. We have continued to expand our deposit gathering efforts through both direct and indirect marketing channels. Current retail deposit offerings consist of a variety of products including CDs, savings accounts, money-market accounts, IRA deposit products, as well as an interest checking product. In addition, we utilize brokered deposits, which are obtained through third-party intermediaries, including a deposit related to Ally Invest customer cash balances. 

The following table shows Ally Bank&#8217;s number of accounts and deposit balances as of the end of each of the last five quarters.

(a) Brokered deposit balances include a deposit related to Ally Invest customer cash balances deposited at Ally Bank by a third party of $1.8 billion as of both September 30, 2020, and June 30, 2020, $1.5 billion as of March 31, 2020, $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2019, and $1.1 billion as of September 30, 2019. 

(b) Other deposits include mortgage escrow and other deposits. 

During the first nine months of 2020, our total deposit base grew $14.2 billion, driven by continued growth in retail deposits, which was partially offset by a reduction in brokered deposits. Total retail deposits increased $17.1 billion, primarily within our online savings product, as we added approximately 242,000 retail deposit customers during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, and ended with more than 2.2 million total retail deposit customers at September 30, 2020. Strong retention rates and customer acquisition, reflecting the strength of the brand, continue to drive growth in retail deposits. During the third quarter of 2020, our retail deposit franchise continued to see robust quarterly growth, as we recorded the third largest quarterly balance growth and fourth largest quarterly customer growth in our history. Balance growth was driven by customers&#8217; persistent desire to build and maintain liquidity amidst economic uncertainty, as well as by broad economic stimulus measures and muted spending. This growth was partially offset by seasonal, tax-related outflows during the quarter. We continue to enhance our suite of online and mobile banking features, as we introduced a collection of smart savings tools to our online savings product in February 2020. In June 2020, Kiplinger named Ally Bank the &#8220;Best Internet Bank&#8221; for the fourth consecutive year, and in October 2020, MONEY Magazine named Ally the &#8220;Best Online Bank&#8221; for the third consecutive year. For additional information on our deposit funding by type, refer to Note 12 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Securitizations and Secured Financings 

While we primarily fund our business through deposits, we also utilize securitizations and secured funding to further diversify our funding sources. Securitizations and secured funding transactions, collectively referred to as securitization transactions, allow us to convert our automotive finance receivables and operating leases into cash earlier than what would have occurred in the normal course of business. We continue to remain active in the well-established securitization markets. Additionally, for consumer automotive loans and operating leases, the term structure of the transaction locks in funding for a specified pool of loans and operating leases, which creates an effective tool for managing interest rate and liquidity risk. For additional details surrounding our securitization activities, refer to the section titled Liquidity Management, Funding, and Regulatory Capital in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

During the first nine months of 2020, we raised $48 million through the completion of a term securitization transaction backed by consumer automotive loans. 

We manage securitization execution risk by maintaining a diverse domestic and foreign investor base and available capacity from committed secured credit facilities provided by banks. Our ability to access the unused capacity in these facilities depends on the availability of eligible assets to collateralize the incremental funding and, in some instances, on the execution of interest rate hedges. We maintain bilateral facilities, which fund our Automotive Finance operations. The facilities can be revolving in nature&#8212;generally having an original tenor ranging from 364 days to two years and allowing for additional funding during the commitment period&#8212;or they can be amortizing and not allow for any further funding after the commitment period. At September 30, 2020, all of our $1.4 billion of capacity was revolving and of this balance, $550 million was from facilities with a remaining tenor greater than 364 days. 

Our securitizations of commercial automotive loans are issued through a single master trust and include credit-enhancement triggers as well as early-repayment triggers, referred to as early amortization events. Following an early amortization event, principal collections on the loans in the applicable securitizations are applied to repay principal of the trust's asset-backed securities rather than to purchase newly originated loans. One of the early amortization events is based on the rates of inventory turnover at our dealer customers, referred to as payment rates. Because the COVID-19 pandemic is placing downward pressure on the automotive sales of dealers and therefore their rate of inventory turnover, an increased risk exists that an early amortization event could occur. In such a case, our ability to issue new securitizations out of this trust would be constrained or eliminated and our ability to fund commercial automotive loans through the securitization market 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

could be delayed while we establish a new trust. In addition, the mere occurrence of an early amortization event could impair our ability to access the securitization market or increase our cost to do so. At this time, none of these securitizations have experienced an early amortization event. 

The majority of our securitizations, including our secured bilateral financing facilities, involve consumer automotive loans. We retain exposure to the nonperformance of these loans through subordinated retained interests in the securitizations as well as obligations to repurchase loans affected by breaches of representations, warranties, or covenants. The secured bilateral financing facilities also include credit-enhancement triggers and revolving period termination events based on the nonperformance of loans. With the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affecting some of our consumer automotive customers and with a significant number of them having enrolled in our loan-deferral program, these securitizations may become more likely to experience a deterioration in loan performance and downgrades by rating agencies. In addition, the secured bilateral financing facilities may become more likely to experience the activation of credit-enhancement triggers and revolving period termination events. Any of these outcomes could have negative impacts on noteholders and us, including in our case a potential for higher pricing and less market access for future securitizations. 

We also have access to funding through advances with the FHLB. These advances are primarily secured by consumer mortgage finance receivables and loans and investment securities. As of September 30, 2020, we had pledged $20.9 billion of assets to the FHLB resulting in $16.5 billion in total funding capacity with $8.8 billion of debt outstanding. 

At September 30, 2020, $37.9 billion of our total assets were restricted as collateral for the payment of debt obligations accounted for as secured borrowings. Refer to Note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 

Unsecured Financings 

We obtain unsecured funding from the sale of floating-rate demand notes under our Demand Notes program. The holder has the option to require us to redeem these notes at any time without restriction. Demand Notes outstanding were $2.5 billion at September 30, 2020. We also have short-term and long-term unsecured debt outstanding from retail term note programs. These programs are composed of callable fixed-rate instruments with fixed-maturity dates and floating-rate notes. There were $334 million of retail term notes outstanding at September 30, 2020. The remainder of our unsecured debt is composed of institutional term debt. In April 2020, June 2020, and September 2020, we accessed the unsecured debt capital markets and raised $750 million, $800 million, and $750 million, respectively, through the issuance of senior notes. Refer to Note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our outstanding short-term borrowings and long-term unsecured debt. 

Other Secured and Unsecured Short-term Borrowings 

We have access to repurchase agreements. A repurchase agreement is a transaction in which the firm sells financial instruments to a buyer, typically in exchange for cash, and simultaneously enters into an agreement to repurchase the same or substantially the same financial instruments from the buyer at a stated price plus accrued interest at a future date. The securities sold in repurchase agreements include U.S. government and federal agency obligations. As of September 30, 2020, we had no debt outstanding under repurchase agreements. 

Additionally, we have access to the FRB Discount Window and can borrow funds to meet short-term liquidity demands. However, the FRB is not a primary source of funding for day-to-day business. Instead, it is a liquidity source that can be accessed in stressed environments or periods of market disruption. We had assets pledged and restricted as collateral to the FRB totaling $2.4 billion as of September 30, 2020. We had no debt outstanding with the FRB as of September 30, 2020. 

Guaranteed Securities 

Certain senior notes (collectively, the Guaranteed Notes) issued by Ally Financial Inc. (referred to within this section as the Parent) are unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by IB Finance, a subsidiary of the Parent and the direct parent of Ally Bank, and Ally US LLC, a subsidiary of the Parent (together, the Guarantors, and the guarantee provided by each such Guarantor, the Note Guarantees). The Guarantors are primary obligors with respect to payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all payment obligations of the Parent in respect of the Guaranteed Notes pursuant to the terms of the applicable indenture. At September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, the outstanding principal balance of the Guaranteed Notes was $2.0 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, with the last scheduled maturity to take place in 2031. 

The Note Guarantees rank equally in right of payment with the applicable Guarantor&#8217;s existing and future unsubordinated unsecured indebtedness and are subordinate to any secured indebtedness of the applicable Guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Note Guarantees are structurally subordinate to indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables and lease obligations, and in the case of Ally Bank, its deposits) of any nonguarantor subsidiaries of the applicable Guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets of such subsidiaries. 

The Note Guarantees and all other obligations of the Guarantors will terminate and be of no further force or effect (i) upon a permissible sale, disposition, or other transfer (including through merger or consolidation) of a majority of the equity interests (including any sale, disposition or other transfer following which the applicable Guarantor is no longer a subsidiary of the Parent), of the applicable Guarantor, or (ii) upon the discharge of the Parent&#8217;s obligations related to the Guaranteed Notes.

Cash Flows 

The following summarizes the activity reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. While this information may be helpful to highlight certain macro trends and business strategies, the cash flow analysis may not be as helpful when analyzing changes in our net earnings and net assets. We believe that in addition to the traditional cash flow analysis, the discussion related to liquidity, dividends, and ALM herein may provide more useful context in evaluating our liquidity position and related activity. 

Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.6 billion and $3.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Activity fell year-over-year, as results were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Net cash provided by investing activities was $11.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $3.1 billion for the same period in 2019. The increase was primarily due to a $11.7 billion increase in cash inflows related to originations and repayments of finance receivables and loans held-for-investment and other. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, commercial wholesale financing receivables outstanding decreased due to a reduction or temporary shutdown in manufacturer production as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with ongoing retail automotive sales, which reduced dealer stock levels. 

Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, was $2.6 billion, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $1.2 billion for the same period in 2019. The change was primarily attributable a decrease of $2.2 billion in net cash outflows related to repayments of long-term debt, and a decrease of $2.2 billion in net cash outflows related to short-term borrowings. These decreases were partially offset by a decrease in cash proceeds received from the issuance of long-term debt, consistent with our continued shift to more cost-efficient deposit funding. 

Capital Planning and Stress Tests 

As a Category IV firm, we are subject to supervisory stress testing on a two-year cycle and are exempted from company-run capital stress testing. We are also required to submit an annual capital plan to the FRB. Our annual capital plan must include an assessment of our expected uses and sources of capital and a description of all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon, including any issuance of a debt or equity capital instrument, any dividend or other capital distribution, and any similar action that the FRB determines could have an impact on our capital. The plan must also include a discussion of how we, under expected and stressful conditions, will maintain capital commensurate with our risks and above the minimum regulatory capital ratios, and will serve as a source of strength to Ally Bank. The FRB&#8217;s final rule introducing the stress capital buffer requirement, which is described in Note 17 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, made several changes to the CCAR process that applied beginning with the 2020 cycle. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

We received a non-objection to our 2018 capital plan in June 2018. We were not required to submit an annual capital plan to the FRB, participate in the supervisory stress test or CCAR, or conduct company-run capital stress tests during the 2019 cycle. Instead, our capital actions during the 2019 cycle were largely based on the results from our 2018 supervisory stress test. On April 1, 2019, our Board authorized an increase in our stock-repurchase program, permitting us to repurchase up to $1.25 billion of our common stock from time to time from the third quarter of 2019 through the second quarter of 2020. On March 17, 2020, in order to support the FRB's effort to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the U.S. economy and the financial system, we announced the voluntary suspension of our stock-repurchase program through its termination on June 30, 2020. Consistent with the FRB&#8217;s restrictions on common-stock repurchases for large firms such as Ally, described below, we do not currently plan to implement a new stock-repurchase program or repurchase shares of our common stock, except in connection with compensation plans, for the remainder of 2020. We repurchased $105 million of common stock during the first nine months of 2020. We retain the discretion, however, to implement such a program and repurchase common stock, subject to the FRB&#8217;s restrictions as summarized below. On October 6, 2020, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share of our common stock. Refer to Note 24 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the most recent dividend. 

We submitted our 2020 capital plan on April 3, 2020, which included planned capital distributions to common stockholders through share repurchases and cash dividends over the nine-quarter planning horizon. On June 25, 2020, the FRB provided us with the results of the supervisory stress test, additional industry-wide sensitivity analyses conducted in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and our preliminary stress capital buffer requirement. At the same time, the FRB announced its determination that changes in financial markets or the macroeconomic outlook could have a material effect on the risk profiles and financial conditions of firms subject to the capital-plan rule and that, as a result, the firms (including Ally) would be required to resubmit capital plans to the FRB within 45 days after receiving updated stress scenarios from the FRB. On September 17, 2020, the FRB released two updated scenarios&#8212;severely adverse and alternative severe. We updated our capital plan in light of firm-specific baseline and stress scenarios, as required, and submitted our updated plan to the FRB on November 2, 2020. On June 25, 2020, the FRB also announced several actions to ensure that large firms, such as Ally, remain resilient despite the economic uncertainty from the COVID-19 pandemic, including for the third quarter of 2020 (1) the suspension of repurchases by any firm of its common stock, except repurchases relating to issuances of common stock related to employee stock ownership plans, and (2) the disallowance of any increase by a firm in the amount of its common-stock dividends and the imposition of a common-stock dividend limit equal to the average of the firm&#8217;s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters. These restrictions have been extended for the fourth quarter of 2020 and may be further extended by the FRB on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Our ability to make capital distributions, including our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock, will continue to be subject to the FRB&#8217;s review and our internal governance requirements, including approval by our Board. The amount and size of any future dividends and share repurchases also will be subject to various factors, including Ally&#8217;s capital and liquidity positions, regulatory considerations, impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic, any accounting standards that affect capital or liquidity (including CECL), financial and operational performance, alternative uses of capital, common-stock price, and general market conditions, and may be suspended or resumed at any time. 

Regulatory Capital 

Refer to Note 17 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the section titled Selected Financial Data within this MD&#38;A. 

Credit Ratings 

The cost and availability of unsecured financing are influenced by credit ratings, which are intended to be an indicator of the creditworthiness of a particular company, security, or obligation. Lower ratings result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. This is particularly true for certain institutional investors whose investment guidelines require investment-grade ratings on term debt and the two highest rating categories for short-term debt (particularly money-market investors).

Rating agencies indicate that they base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, which may include capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, level and quality of earnings, and the current operating, legislative, and regulatory environment. Rating agencies themselves could make or be required to make substantial changes to their ratings policies and practices&#8212;particularly in response to legislative and regulatory changes. Potential changes in rating methodology, as well as in the legislative and regulatory environment, and the timing of those changes could impact our ratings, which as noted above could increase our borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital. 

A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, and the ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 

Insurance Financial Strength Ratings 

Substantially all of our Insurance operations have an FSR and an ICR from A.M. Best. The FSR is intended to be an indicator of the ability of the insurance company to meet its senior most obligations to policyholders. Lower ratings generally result in fewer opportunities to write business, as insureds, particularly large commercial insureds, and insurance companies purchasing reinsurance have guidelines requiring high FSR ratings. On September 25, 2020, A.M. Best affirmed the FSR for Ally Insurance Group of A- (excellent), affirmed the ICR of a-, and maintained a Stable outlook.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

We identified critical accounting estimates that, as a result of judgments, uncertainties, uniqueness, and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved could result in material changes to our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows under different conditions or using different assumptions. 

Our most critical accounting estimates are as follows: 

&#8226; Allowance for loan losses 

&#8226; Valuation of automotive lease assets and residuals 

&#8226; Fair value of financial instruments 

&#8226; Determination of provision for income taxes 

On January 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses . This guidance replaced the incurred loss methodology, which was used to calculate the allowance for loan losses as described in the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, with an expected lifetime loss methodology, as described in the Allowance for Loan Losses section below. 

During 2020, we did not substantively change any material aspect of our overall methodologies and processes used in developing the remaining critical accounting estimates from what was described in the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Refer to Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding the methodology used in calculating the provision for income taxes for interim financial reporting.

Allowance for Loan Losses 

We maintain an allowance for loan losses (the allowance) to reflect the net amount expected to be collected from our lending portfolios. The allowance is maintained at a level that management considers to be adequate based upon ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations using relevant available information, which includes both internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. Additions and reductions to the allowance are charged to current period earnings through the provision for credit losses; amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged directly against the allowance, net of amounts recovered on previously charged-off accounts. Expected recoveries do not exceed the total of amounts charged-off or expected to be charged-off. The allowance is measured using statistical models that are designed to correlate certain macroeconomic variables to expected future credit losses. The macroeconomic data used in the models is based on forecasted variables for the next 12 months. Beyond this forecast period, we revert to a historical average for each of the variables on a straight-line basis over 24 months. The allowance reflects management&#8217;s estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual term of our lending portfolio and involves significant judgment, which could materially affect the provision for credit losses and, therefore, net income. For additional information regarding our portfolio segments and classes, refer to Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The consumer portfolio segments consist of smaller-balance, homogeneous loans within our Automotive Finance operations, Mortgage Finance operations, and consumer unsecured lending operations which is included within Corporate and Other. The allowance model for each consumer portfolio segment is calculated using proprietary statistical models and other risk indicators applied to pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics. Loans that do not share similar risk characteristics are evaluated individually. For additional information regarding the allowance calculation for the consumer portfolio segments, refer to Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The commercial portfolio segment is primarily composed of larger-balance, nonhomogeneous exposures within our Automotive Finance operations and Corporate Finance operations. These loans generally do not have similar risk characteristics and, as a result, are primarily evaluated individually. Management establishes specific allowances for commercial loans based on the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loans&#8217; effective interest rate, or the observable market price or the fair value of collateral, whichever is determined to be the most appropriate. Estimated costs to sell the collateral on an undiscounted basis are included in the impairment measurement, when appropriate. Loans that share similar risk characteristics are pooled and evaluated collectively. For additional information regarding the allowance calculation for the commercial portfolio segment, refer to Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The determination of the allowance is influenced by numerous assumptions and many factors that may materially affect estimates of loss, including changes in LGD, PD, and rating migration. The critical assumptions underlying the allowance include: (i) segmentation of each portfolio based on common risk characteristics; (ii) the development of reasonable and supportable forecasts of future macroeconomic conditions; and (iii) evaluation by management of borrower, collateral, and geographic information. Management monitors the adequacy of the allowance and makes adjustments as the assumptions in the underlying analyses change to reflect an estimate of expected lifetime loan losses at the reporting date, based on the best information available at that time.
