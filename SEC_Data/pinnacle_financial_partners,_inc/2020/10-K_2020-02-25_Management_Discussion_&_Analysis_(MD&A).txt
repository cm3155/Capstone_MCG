 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following is a discussion of our financial condition at December 31, 2019 and 2018 and our results of operations for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019. The purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about our financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from our consolidated financial statements. The following discussion and analysis should be read along with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein. 

Overview 

General. Our fully diluted net income per common share for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $5.22 compared to fully diluted net income per common share of $4.64 and $2.70 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. At December 31, 2019, loans had increased by $2.1 billion as compared to December 31, 2018. The comparability of our financial condition and performance has been impacted by the acquisitions we have completed as well as the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Act") in December 2017, in each case as discussed below. 

Acquisitions. We acquired BNC Bancorp and its wholly owned bank subsidiary, Bank of North Carolina (together, BNC), on June 16, 2017. At acquisition date, BNC's net assets were fair valued at $602.7 million, including loans valued at $5.6 billion and deposits valued at $6.2 billion. This acquisition expanded our footprint into the Carolinas and Virginia. 

&#160; 

Each holder of BNC common stock (including restricted shares) received 0.5235 shares of Pinnacle Financial's common stock for each share of BNC common stock held by each shareholder on the closing date. We issued 27,687,100 shares of common stock and paid cash consideration of approximately $129,000, related to fractional shares, to the BNC shareholders. Included in the common stock issued were 136,890 assumed shares of unvested restricted stock that continued to vest in accordance with their original contractual terms. The fair value of these awards was $9.2 million, with $5.4 million attributable to precombination services provided by the recipients prior to the merger, that accordingly was included as merger consideration. 

We acquired all of the outstanding stock of Advocate Capital, Inc. (Advocate Capital) on July 2, 2019 for a cash price of $59 million. Advocate Capital's $134.3 million of indebtedness at the acquisition date was also paid off in connection with consummation of the acquisition. Advocate Capital is a finance firm headquartered in Nashville, TN which supports the financial needs of legal firms through both case expense financing and working capital lines of credit. At the acquisition date, Advocate Capital's net assets were initially recorded at a fair value of approximately $45.6 million, consisting mainly of loans receivable. The purchase price allocations for the acquisition of Advocate Capital are preliminary and will be finalized upon the receipt of final valuations on certain assets and liabilities. 

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law. Among other items, the Tax Act reduced the corporate statutory Federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, which resulted in a reduction of our blended statutory tax rate from 39.23% in 2017 to 26.14% in 2018 and 2019. As a result of such decrease, we recognized a charge of $31.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 resulting from the revaluation of our deferred tax assets. 

Results of operations. Our net interest income increased to $766.1 million for 2019 compared to $736.3 million for 2018 and $543.3 million for 2017. The increase in 2019 as compared to 2018 was largely the result of organic loan growth. Our acquisition of BNC favorably impacted our loan growth when comparing 2018 to 2017. The net interest margin (the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets) for 2019 was 3.46% compared to 3.68% and 3.76% for 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

Our provision for loan losses was $27.3 million for 2019 compared to $34.4 million in 2018 and $23.7 million in 2017. Provision expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 when compared to the comparable periods in 2018 and 2017 was primarily impacted by organic loan growth in our loan portfolio and by our internal assessment of the credit quality of the loan portfolio which included charge-offs of certain loans. Our net charge-offs were $16.1 million during 2019 compared to $18.0 million in 2018 and $15.4 million in 2017. 

Our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans increased from 0.47% at December 31, 2018 to 0.48% at December 31, 2019. The increase in the allowance as a percentage of total loans is primarily attributable to provision expense related to organic loan growth. 

&#160; 

Noninterest income for 2019 compared to 2018 increased by $63.0 million, or 31.3%. Noninterest income for 2018 compared to 2017 increased by $56.0 million, or 38.6%. The increase in noninterest income from 2019 to 2018 and 2018 to 2017 was largely due to an increase in income from our investment in Bankers Healthcare Group, LLC ("BHG"), which was $90.1 million for the year ended 

Table of Contents 

December 31, 2019 compared to $51.2 million and $38.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and for 2018 to 2017, the consummation of the BNC merger. Outside of our 49% investment in BHG and the BNC merger, increases in noninterest income in both comparable periods was attributable to increased transaction accounts and increased production in our fee-based products such as investments, insurance and trust resulting primarily from organic growth. Noninterest income was also impacted during the year ended December 31, 2019 by a $5.9 million in net pre-tax loss on the sale of $737.7 million of investment securities compared to a $2.3 million net pre-tax loss on the sale of $169.9 million of investment securities in 2018 and an $8.3 million net pre-tax loss on the sale of $363.9 million of investment securities in 2017 as we sought to restructure a portion of our securities portfolio in each period in preparation for changes in the yield curve during those periods. 

Noninterest expense for 2019 compared to 2018 increased by $52.3 million, or 11.5%. The majority of the increase was attributable to salaries and employee benefits expense which increased $41.7 million, primarily resulting from annual merit increases awarded in the first quarter of 2019 as well as the increase in our associate base with our continued hiring of experienced bankers throughout our footprint during the period. Expenses associated with our annual cash incentive plan were also higher in 2019 than in 2018 as we paid out incentives at 120% of target as compared to target-level payouts in 2018. We also realized increases in equipment and occupancy costs of $10.3 million in 2019 versus 2018. This change was in part due to a $3.2 million non-cash impairment charge incurred during the second quarter of 2019 related to the consolidation of five offices across our footprint. Additionally, we experienced increased expenses associated with technology improvements to enhance the infrastructure of our firm during the comparable periods and expect to incur additional costs in future periods as we continue to enhance our technology infrastructure. During 2019, we incurred no merger-related expenses compared to $8.3 million during 2018 as we finalized the acquisition, cultural and technological integration of BNC. Noninterest expense for 2018 compared to 2017 increased by $86.3 million, or 23.6%, primarily due to the inclusion of our expanded footprint in the Carolinas and Virginia for all of 2018 compared to just over six months of operations in 2017. With the exception of OREO and merger-related expenses, we realized increases in all noninterest expense categories in 2018 when compared to 2017. Salaries and employee benefits expense increased $62.0 million, primarily resulting from annual merit increases awarded in the first quarter of 2018 as well as the increase in our associate base primarily as a result of our merger with BNC, including their participation in the 2018 annual incentive program as compared to 2017, and continued hiring of experienced bankers throughout our footprint. We also realized increases in equipment and occupancy costs of $20.2 million in 2018 versus 2017 due to our expanded footprint. Additionally, other noninterest expense, which includes deposit and lending related expenses, investment and trust sales expenses and administrative expenses, increased $20.9 million in 2018 compared to 2017. Offsetting these increases was a decrease in merger-related expenses of $23.6 million in 2018 compared to 2017. There were no merger-related expenses recorded in the second half of 2018. 

&#160; 

The number of full-time equivalent employees increased from 2,132.0 at December 31, 2017 to 2,297.0 at December 31, 2018 and 2,487.0 at December 31, 2019. 

&#160; 

During the three years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded income tax expense of $96.7 million, $90.5 million and $124.0 million, respectively. Income tax expense for 2018 was impacted by the reduction in the statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% as a result of the Tax Act, which was signed into law in December 2017. The Tax Act also impacted income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 as our deferred tax assets were revalued as a result of such rate change, resulting in a charge of $31.5 million. Our effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, was 19.4%, 20.1% and 41.6%, respectively. 

Our efficiency ratio (the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income) was 49.1%, 48.3%, and 53.3% for the three years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The efficiency ratio measures the amount of expense that is incurred to generate a dollar of revenue. The efficiency ratio for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 was negatively impacted by losses on the sale of our non-prime automobile portfolio, the write-down of facilities and land acquired in the BNC acquisition that previously had been held for potential expansion, and a non-cash impairment charge related to the consolidation of five offices across our footprint during the year ended December 31, 2019. Net gains and losses on sales of securities impacted our efficiency ratios in each of 2019, 2018 and 2017. Increased revenue from increased interest earning assets in the 2019 period over the 2018 and 2017 periods and the absence of merger-related expenses in 2019 positively impacted our efficiency ratio in the 2019 period when compared to 2018 and 2017 periods. The efficiency ratio improved in 2018 as compared to 2017 primarily due to the completion in 2018 of the integration and technology conversion associated with the acquisition of BNC and the growth in interest earning assets. 

&#160; 

Net income for 2019 was $400.9 million compared to $359.4 million in net income for 2018 and $174.0 million in net income in 2017. Fully-diluted net income per common share was $5.22 for 2019 compared to $4.64 for 2018 and $2.70 for 2017. Net income and fully-diluted net income per common share in 2017 were each significantly and negatively impacted by the $31.5 million charge resulting from the revaluation of our deferred tax assets following the passage of the Tax Act, while net income and fully-diluted net income per common share in 2019 and 2018 each benefited from the reduced rate under the Tax Act and continued organic growth. Net income per common share was also positively impacted in 2018 and 2019 by the share repurchase program we commenced in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Financial Condition. &#160; Our loan balances increased by $2.1 billion during both 2019 and 2018. The increase in our outstanding loan balances during both 2019 and 2018 is largely due to the continued economic growth in our core markets, increases in the number of relationship managers, primarily in our commercial lending program, and increased focus on attracting new customers to our company. 

Total deposits increased from $18.8 billion at December 31, 2018 to $20.2 billion at December 31, 2019. Within our deposits, the ratio of core funding to total deposits decreased from 79.0% at December 31, 2018 to 76.2% at December 31, 2019. 

We believe we have hired experienced relationship managers that have significant client portfolios and longstanding reputations within the communities we serve. As such, we believe they will attract more relationship managers to our firm as well as loans and deposits from new and existing small-and middle-market clients particularly if the economies in our principal markets continue to expand. 

Capital and Liquidity. &#160; At December 31, 2019 and 2018, our capital ratios, including our bank's capital ratios, exceeded regulatory minimum capital requirements and those necessary to be considered well-capitalized under applicable federal regulations. From time to time, we may be required to support the capital needs of our bank subsidiary. At December 31, 2019, we had approximately $182.0 million of cash at the holding company which could be used to support our bank. We believe we have various capital raising techniques available to us to provide for the capital needs of our bank, including an established line of credit with another bank that can be utilized to provide up to $75 million of additional capital support to Pinnacle Bank, if needed. 

&#160; 

On November 13, 2018, Pinnacle Financial announced that its board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $100.0 million of Pinnacle Financial&#8217;s outstanding common stock and on October 15, 2019, the board approved an additional $100.0 million of repurchase authorization. The current repurchase program expires on March 31, 2020, with the additional $100 million authorization expiring on December 31, 2020. We repurchased 1,102,038 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $61.4 million in 2019 compared to 405,200 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $20.7 million in 2018. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The accounting principles we follow and our methods of applying these principles conform with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and with general practices within the banking industry. In connection with the application of those principles, we have made judgments and estimates which, in the case of the determination of our allowance for loan losses and the assessment of impairment of goodwill, has been critical to the determination of our financial position and results of operations. 

Allowance for Loan Losses (allowance). Our management assesses the adequacy of the allowance prior to the end of each calendar quarter. This assessment includes procedures to estimate the allowance and test the adequacy and appropriateness of the resulting balance. The level of the allowance is based upon management's evaluation of the loan portfolio, loan loss experience, asset quality trends, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers' ability to repay the loan (including the timing of future payment), the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, economic conditions, industry and peer bank loan quality indications and other pertinent factors, including regulatory recommendations. The level of allowance maintained is believed by management to be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries of amounts previously charged-off. Allocation of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management's judgment, is deemed to be uncollectible. 

Our allowance for loan loss assessment methodology was modified during the year ended December 31, 2017 to (i) extend the lookback period from 24 quarters to a period beginning January 1, 2006 to better capture the risk associated with this extended economic cycle, (ii) eliminate the use of risk ratings in the calculation of the loss rate and instead focus on loss rate by loan type and (iii) expand the economic variables used in the qualitative assessment to incorporate our expanded footprint. We also eliminated the use of a loss emergence period in light of the minimal population of losses available to evaluate that were previously being extrapolated to the full population of loans, and shifted the focus of our analysis to more of a quantitative model. There was no material impact on the adoption of the change in the allowance for loan loss assessment methodology. 

Our allowance for loan losses is composed of the result of two independent analyses pursuant to the provisions of ASC 450-20, Loss Contingencies and ASC 310-10-35, Receivables. The ASC 450-20 analysis is intended to quantify the inherent risks in our performing loan portfolio. The ASC 310-10-35 analysis includes a loan-by-loan analysis of impaired loans, including those reported as nonaccrual, troubled-debt restructurings and purchase credit impaired. 

In assessing the adequacy of the allowance, we also consider the results of our ongoing independent loan review process. We undertake this process both to ascertain those loans in the portfolio with elevated credit risk and to assist in our overall evaluation of the risk characteristics of the entire loan portfolio. Our loan review process includes the judgment of management, independent 

Table of Contents 

internal loan reviewers, and reviews that may have been conducted by third-party reviewers, primarily regulatory examiners. We incorporate relevant loan review results in the allowance. 

The ASC 450-20 component of the allowance for loan losses begins with a historical loss rate calculation for each loan pool with similar risk characteristics. The losses realized over a rolling four-quarter cycle are utilized to determine an annual loss rate for each loan pool for each quarter-end in our look-back period. The look-back period in our loss rate calculation begins with January 2006, as we believe the period from January 1, 2006 to present is more representative of this economic cycle. The loss rates for each category are then averaged and applied to the end of period loan portfolio balances to determine estimated losses. The loss rates provide a quantitative estimate of credit losses inherent in our end of period loan portfolio based on our actual loss experience. 

The estimated loan loss allocation for all loan segments also considers management's estimate of probable losses for a number of qualitative factors that have not been considered in the quantitative analysis. The qualitative categories and the measurements used to quantify the risks within each of these categories are subjectively selected by management, but measured by objective measurements period over period. The data for each measurement may be obtained from internal or external sources. The current period measurements are evaluated and assigned a factor commensurate with the current level of risk relative to past measurements over time. The resulting factor is applied to the non-impaired loan portfolio. This amount represents estimated probable inherent credit losses which exist, but have not yet been identified either in our risk rating or impairment process, as of the balance sheet date, and is based upon quarterly trend assessments in portfolio concentrations, policy exceptions, economic conditions, associate retention, independent loan review results, collateral considerations, credit quality, competition and regulatory requirements, enterprise wide risk assessments, and peer group credit quality. The qualitative allowance allocation, as determined by the processes noted above, is increased or decreased for each loan segment based on the assessment of these various qualitative factors. 

The allowance for loan losses for purchased loans is calculated similarly to that utilized for our legacy loans. Our accounting policy is to compare the computed allowance for loan losses for purchased loans to any remaining fair value adjustment on a loan-by-loan basis. If the computed allowance is greater than the remaining fair value adjustment, the excess is added to the allowance for loan losses by a provision for loan losses. 

The ASC 450-20 portion of the allowance also includes a small unallocated component. We believe that the unallocated amount is warranted for inherent factors that cannot be practically assigned to individual loan categories, such as the imprecision in the overall loss allocation measurement process, the subjectivity risk of not considering all relevant environmental categories and related measurements and imprecision in our credit risk ratings process. The appropriateness of the unallocated component of the allowance is assessed each quarter end based upon changes in the overall business environment not otherwise captured. 

The impaired loan allowance is determined pursuant to ASC 310-10-35. Loans are impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Collection of all amounts due according to the contractual terms means collecting all interest and principal payments of a loan as scheduled in the loan agreement. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change. Loan losses are charged off when management believes that the full collectability of the loan is unlikely. A loan may be partially charged-off after a "confirming event" has occurred which serves to validate that full repayment pursuant to the terms of the loan is unlikely. 

An impairment allowance is recognized if the fair value of the loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan (recorded investment in the loan is the principal balance plus any accrued interest, net of deferred loan fees or costs and unamortized premium or discount). The impairment is recognized through the provision for loan losses and is a component of the allowance. Loans that are impaired are recorded at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, or if the loan is collateral dependent, at the fair value of the collateral, less estimated disposal costs. If the loan is collateral dependent, the principal balance of the loan is charged-off in an amount equal to the impairment measurement. The fair value of collateral dependent loans is derived primarily from collateral appraisals performed by independent third-party appraisers. Management believes it follows appropriate accounting and regulatory guidance in determining impairment and accrual status of impaired loans. This analysis is completed for all individual loans greater than $1.0 million. The resulting allowance percentage by segment adjusted for specific trends identified, if applicable, is then applied to the remaining population of impaired loans. 

Pursuant to the guidance set forth in ASU 2011-02, A Creditor's Determination of Whether a Restructuring is a Troubled Debt Restructuring, the above impairment methodology is also applied to those loans identified as troubled debt restructurings. 

We then test the resulting allowance by comparing the balance in the allowance to historical trends and industry and peer information. Our management then evaluates the result of the procedures performed, including the results of our testing, and decides on the appropriateness of the balance of the allowance in its entirety. The audit committee of our board of directors approves the allowance for loan loss policy annually and reviews the methodology and approves the resultant allowance prior to the filing of quarterly and annual financial information.

While our policies and procedures used to estimate the allowance for loan losses, as well as the resultant provision for loan losses charged to operations, are considered adequate by management and are reviewed from time to time by our regulators, they are necessarily approximate and inherently imprecise. There are factors beyond our control, such as conditions in the local, national, and international economy, a local real estate market or particular industry conditions which may materially negatively impact our asset quality and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses and thus the resulting provision for loan losses. 

Effective January 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Measurement of Current Expected Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (CECL) , which will modify the accounting for the allowance for loan losses from an incurred loss model to an expected loss model, as discussed more fully under "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of this Report. 

&#160; 

Impairment of Goodwill. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. ASC 350, Intangibles &#8212; Goodwill and Other, provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity does a qualitative assessment and determines it is necessary, or if a qualitative assessment is not performed, it is required to perform a two-step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit (if any). If, based on a qualitative assessment, an entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is more than its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. The results of our qualitative assessment as of September 30, 2019, our annual assessment date, indicated that the fair value of our reporting unit was more than its carrying value, and accordingly, the two-step goodwill impairment test was not performed. 

&#160; 

Should our common stock experience a sustained price decline or other impairment indicators become known, additional impairment testing of goodwill may be required. Should it be determined in a future period that the goodwill has become impaired, then a charge to earnings will be recorded in the period such determination is made. While we believe that the assumptions utilized in our testing were appropriate, they may not reflect actual outcomes that could occur. Specific factors that could negatively impact the assumptions used include the following: a change in the control premium being realized in the market or a meaningful change in the number of mergers and acquisitions occurring; the amount of expense savings that may be realized in an acquisition scenario; significant fluctuations in our asset/liability balances or the composition of our balance sheet; a change in the overall valuation of the stock market, specifically bank stocks; performance of Southeast U.S. Banks; and Pinnacle Financial's performance relative to peers. Changing these assumptions, or any other key assumptions, could have a material impact on the amount of goodwill impairment, if any.

Net Interest Income. Net interest income represents the amount by which interest earned on various earning assets exceeds interest paid on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities and is the most significant component of our revenues. &#160; For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded net interest income of approximately $766.1 million, which resulted in a net interest margin of 3.46%. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded net interest income of approximately $736.3 million, which resulted in a net interest margin of 3.68%. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded net interest income of approximately $543.3 million, which resulted in a net interest margin of 3.76%. These increases in net interest income were attributable to the growth in our loan portfolio due to our merger with BNC, organic growth, and changes in the interest rates we receive on interest earning assets offset in part by increases in the volume and the rates we pay on deposits and our other funding sources. 

The following table sets forth the amount of our average balances, interest income or interest expense for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the average interest rate for total interest-earning assets and total interest-bearing liabilities, net interest spread and net interest margin for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019 (in thousands):

(1) Average balances of nonperforming loans are included in average loan balances. 

(2) Yields computed on tax-exempt instruments on a tax equivalent basis and include $29.0 million, $16.2 million and $12.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The tax-exempt benefit has been reduced by the projected impact of tax-exempt income that will be disallowed pursuant to IRS Regulations for the period presented. 

(3) Yields realized on interest-bearing assets less the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The net interest spread calculation excludes the impact of demand deposits. Had the impact of demand deposits been included, the net interest spread for the year ended December 31, 2019 would have been 3.41% compared to a net interest spread for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 of 3.65% and 3.73%, respectively.

(4) Net interest margin is the result of net interest income calculated on a tax-equivalent basis divided by average interest earning assets for the period. 

For the year ended December 31, 2019, our net interest spread was 3.06%, while the net interest margin was 3.46% compared to a net interest spread of 3.35% for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 3.53% for the year ended December 31, 2017, and a net interest margin of 3.68% and 3.76%, respectively. Although our net interest margin was positively impacted by yield expansion in our earning asset portfolio, these increases were offset by increases in our total funding costs and declining levels of positive impact from purchase accounting. 

During the year ended December 31, 2019, our earning asset yield increased by 7 basis points and 33 basis points, from the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, while total funding rates increased by 30 basis points and 42 basis points compared to the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in our funding costs was primarily caused by changes in the rate environment throughout all three periods presented, intense competition and increased use of and associated borrowing costs for noncore funding. The application of fair value accounting on the BNC accounts we acquired in our merger also positively impacted our net interest margin in 2019, 2018 and 2017, but will continue to become less impactful in future periods. 

We continue to deploy various asset liability management strategies to manage our risk to interest rate fluctuations. Pricing for creditworthy borrowers and meaningful depositors is very competitive in our markets and this competition has adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our margins. We anticipate that this challenging competitive environment will continue during 2020. We also expect the positive impact of purchase accounting on our net interest income will lessen in future periods, which will negatively affect our net interest margin in 2020. We have sought to mitigate much of the negative impact that reductions in short-term interest rates would have on our net interest margin through restructuring a portion of our investment securities portfolio, purchasing loan interest rate floors, and unwinding fixed-to-floating loan interest rate swaps during 2019. However, our net interest margin could be additionally impacted by future interest rate cuts if we are not able to lower deposit rates at a pace necessary to offset declines in our earning asset yields. We seek to fund increased loan volumes by growing our core deposits, but will utilize noncore funding to fund shortfalls, if any. To the extent that our dependence on noncore funding sources increases during 2020 our net interest margin would likely be negatively impacted as we may not be able to reduce the rates we pay on these deposits as quickly as we can on core deposits. 

Rate and Volume Analysis. &#160; Net interest income increased by $29.8 million between the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019 and by $193.0 million between the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018. The following is an analysis of the changes in our net interest income comparing the changes attributable to rates and those attributable to volumes (in thousands):

Changes in net interest income are attributed to either changes in average balances (volume change) or changes in average rates (rate change) for earning assets and sources of funds on which interest is received or paid. Volume change is calculated as change in volume times the previous rate while rate change is change in rate times the previous volume. The change attributed to rates and volumes (change in rate times change in volume) is considered above as a change in volume. 

Provision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish an allowance for loan losses that, in management's evaluation, we believe to be adequate to provide coverage for the inherent losses on outstanding loans. The provision for loan losses amounted to approximately $27.3 million, $34.4 million and $23.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

Impacting the provision for loan losses in any accounting period are several factors including the change in outstanding loan balances, the level of charge-offs and recoveries, the changes in the amount of impaired loans, results of regulatory examinations, credit quality comparison to peer banks, the industry at large, economic conditions both in our market areas and more broadly, and, ultimately, the results of our quarterly assessment of the inherent risks of our loan portfolio including past loan loss experience. 

Provision expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased as compared to 2018 and increased in 2018 as compared to 2017. Both the decrease in 2019 as compared to 2018 and the increase in 2018 as compared to 2017 were primarily impacted by organic growth in our loan portfolio and by our internal assessment of the credit quality of the loan portfolio which included charge-offs realized in our consumer portfolio, primarily related to non-prime automobile loans, and losses on loans to commercial borrowers in a variety of industries. 

Our allowance for loan losses is adjusted to an amount deemed appropriate to adequately cover probable losses in the loan portfolio based on our allowance for loan loss methodology. Our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans increased from 0.47% at December 31, 2018 to 0.48% at December 31, 2019. The slight increase in the allowance as a percentage of total loans is primarily attributable to provision expense associated with organic loan growth as our acquired loans, with remaining purchase accounting discounts associated with them, are becoming less impactful to our portfolio mix. The absolute level of our allowance for loan losses is largely driven by continued favorable credit experience in our portfolios and we believe it is supported by the strong economies present in markets in which we currently operate. 

&#160; 

Noninterest Income. &#160; Our noninterest income is composed of several components, some of which vary significantly between annual periods. Service charges on deposit accounts and other noninterest income generally reflect our growth, while investment services, fees from the origination of mortgage loans, swap fees and gains or losses on the sale of securities will often reflect market conditions and fluctuate from period to period. 

The following is our noninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 (in thousands):

The increase in service charges on deposit accounts in 2019 compared to 2018 and 2017 is primarily related to increased analysis fees due to an increase in the volume and number of commercial checking accounts resulting from organic growth in this product. 

Income from our wealth management groups (investments, insurance and trust) is also included in noninterest income. For the year ended December 31, 2019, commissions and fees from investment services at our financial advisory unit, Pinnacle Asset Management, a division of Pinnacle Bank, were $24.2 million, compared to $22.0 million at December 31, 2018 and $15.3 million at December 31, 2017, reflecting increases in brokerage assets and, for much of 2019, 2018 and 2017, year-over-year increases in the value of the stock market. At December 31, 2019, Pinnacle Asset Management was receiving commissions and fees in connection with approximately $4.6 billion in brokerage assets compared to $3.8 billion and $3.3 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Insurance commissions were approximately $9.3 million during 2019 and 2018 compared to $7.4 million during 2017. Additionally, at December 31, 2019, our trust department was receiving fees on approximately $2.9 billion and $1.7 billion of managed and custodied assets, respectively, compared to approximately $2.1 billion and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2018 and $1.8 billion and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2017. The growth in our wealth management businesses is attributable to our expanded distribution platform with the addition of associates across our footprint. 

Gains on mortgage loans sold, net, consists of fees from the origination and sale of mortgage loans. These mortgage fees are for loans primarily originated in our current markets that are subsequently sold to third-party investors. Substantially all of these loan sales transfer servicing rights to the buyer. Generally, mortgage origination fees increase in lower interest rate environments and more robust housing markets and decrease in rising interest rate environments and more challenging housing markets. Mortgage origination fees will fluctuate from period to period as the rate environment changes. Gains on mortgage loans sold, net, were $24.3 million, $14.6 million and $18.6 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The year-over-year growth in 2019 and decline in 2018 in net gains on the sale of mortgage loans was attributable to the impact of the interest rate environment on mortgage production during each respective period. We hedge a portion of our mortgage pipeline as part of a mandatory delivery program. The hedge is not designated as a hedge for GAAP purposes and, as such, changes in its fair value are recorded directly through the income statement. There is positive correlation between the dollar amount of the mortgage pipeline and the value of this hedge. Therefore, the change in the outstanding mortgage pipeline at the end of any reporting period will directly impact the amount of gain recorded for mortgage loans held for sale during that reporting period. At December 31, 2019, the mortgage pipeline included $124.2 million in loans expected to close in 2020 compared to $77.0 million in loans at December 31, 2018 expected to close in 2019, respectively. 

For the year ended December 31, 2019, investment gains (losses) on sales and impairments, net, represent a $5.9 million pre-tax loss we recognized upon the sale of $737.7 million of investment securities compared to a $2.3 million net pre-tax loss on the sale of $169.9 million of investment securities in 2018 and an $8.3 million net pre-tax loss on the sale of $363.9 million of investment securities in 2017 as we sought to restructure a portion of our securities portfolio in each period in preparation for changes in the yield curve during those periods. The loss recorded in 2017 also allowed us to capture an increased tax deduction in that period due to the reduction in corporate tax rates beginning in 2018 as a result of the passage of the Tax Act. 

Income from equity-method investment. Income from equity-method investment is comprised solely of income from our 49% equity-method investment in BHG. BHG is engaged in the origination of commerical and consumer loans primarily to healthcare providers and other professionals throughout the United States. The loans originated by BHG are either financed by secured borrowings or sold with limited or non-recourse to independent financial institutions and investors. BHG has expanded its operations to include commercial lending to other professional service firms such as attorneys, accountants and others. Through subsidiaries that it owns, it also has expanded into patient financing, which involves loans to individuals to finance medical expenses, particularly those to patients with high deductible health plans. 

Income from this equity-method investment was $90.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $51.2 million and $38.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increased level of contribution we have experienced from BHG in 2019 when compared to 2018 and 2017 reflects the positive results BHG has experienced as a result of enhancements to its business model, including its marketing efforts. Historically, BHG has sold the majority of the loans it originates to a network of bank purchasers through a combination of online auctions, direct sales and its direct purchase option. 

In the second half of 2019, BHG began retaining more loans on its balance sheet than historically had been the case in recent years. This change in its business model is likely to reduce BHG's revenue in 2020 compared to what it would have recognized had it continued to sell a larger percentage of its loans to its bank network of purchasers, however, we do anticipate an increase in revenues for BHG in 2020 when compared to 2019. We believe, however, over time this practice should produce a less volatile revenue stream than its gain on sale model going forward so long as credit losses remain in line with historical experience. This model of retaining more of the loans that it originates on its balance sheet will require BHG to access funding sources in amounts greater than were previously required under the gain on sale model. BHG has arranged warehouse line financing from multiple financial institutions to facilitate this shift in strategy but may require additional funding to expand its ability to retain more loans on its balance sheet. The

costs for this funding will likely reduce BHG's earnings in the near term in comparison to what it may have earned under its gain on sale model with similar origination volumes. 

Income from equity-method investment is recorded net of amortization expense associated with customer lists and other intangible assets of $1.9 million, $2.8 million and $3.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. At December 31, 2019, there were $8.8 million of these intangible assets that are expected to be amortized in lesser amounts over the next 16 years. Also included in income from equity-method investment, is accretion income associated with the fair value of certain of BHG's liabilities of $2.6 million, $2.9 million and $3.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. At December 31, 2019, there were $4.8 million of these liabilities that are expected to be accreted into income in lesser amounts over the next seven years. 

During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank received $51.3 million, $33.7 million and $21.7 million in dividends in the aggregate from BHG, which reduced the carrying amount of our investment in BHG while earnings from BHG increased the carrying amount of our investment in BHG. Our proportionate share of earnings from BHG are included in our consolidated tax return. Profits from intercompany transactions are eliminated. Earnings from BHG may fluctuate from period-to-period. 

As our ownership interest in BHG is 49% and our representatives do not occupy a majority of the seats on BHG's board of managers, we do not consolidate BHG's results of operations or financial position into our financial statements but record the net result of BHG's activities at our percentage ownership in income from equity-method investment in noninterest income. For the year ended December 31, 2019, BHG reported $366.5 million in gross revenues, net of substitution losses of $53.1 million, compared to $220.3 million and $160.2 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, net of substitution losses of $43.7 million and $42.5 million, respectively. The following discussion considers BHG's results of operations for 2019, 2018 and 2017 prior to consideration of our ownership interest. 

&#8226; Approximately $291.1 million, or 79.4%, of these revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 related to gains on the sale of commercial loans BHG had previously issued primarily to doctor, dentist and other medical practices compared to $175.8 million, or 79.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 and $127.2 million, or 79.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2017. BHG refers to this activity as its core product and at December 31, 2019 and 2018, BHG had loans held for sale totaling $208.1 million and $163.5 million, respectively. BHG typically funds these loans from cash reserves on its balance sheet. Subsequently, these core product loans are sold with no recourse to BHG to a network of community banks and other financial institutions at a premium to the par value of the loan. The purchaser may access a BHG cash reserve account of up to 3% of the loan balance to support loan payments. BHG retains no servicing or other responsibilities related to the core product loan once sold. As a result, this gain on sale premium represents BHG's compensation for absorbing the costs to originate the loan as well as marketing expenses associated with maintaining its business model. 

&#8226; At December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were $2.5 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, in core product loans previously sold by BHG that were actively serviced by BHG's network of bank purchasers. BHG, at its sole option, may also provide purchasers of these core product loans the ability to substitute the acquired loan with another more recently-issued BHG loan should the previously-acquired loan become at least 90-days past due as to its monthly payments. This substitution is subject to the purchaser having adhered to the standards of its purchase agreement with BHG. Additionally, all substitutions are subject to the approval by BHG's board of managers. As a result, the reacquired loans are deemed purchase credit impaired and recorded on BHG's balance sheet at the net present value of the loan's anticipated cash flows. BHG will then initiate collection efforts and attempt to restore the reacquired loan to performing status. As a result, BHG maintained a liability as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 of $118.0 million and $88.9 million, respectively, that represents an estimate of the future inherent losses for the outstanding core portfolio that may be subject to future substitution. This liability represents 4.7% of core product loans previously sold by BHG that remain outstanding as of both December 31, 2019 and 2018. 

&#8226; BHG will maintain loans on its balance sheet for a period of time prior to sale or transfer to a purchaser. Alternatively, BHG may elect to keep certain loans on its balance sheet through maturity. From time to time, BHG may hold a higher volume of these loans depending upon the timing of loan originations, their loan pipeline and market demand as well as the deployment of their business strategy. As previously discussed, BHG recently realigned their business model to retain more of their originated loans on their balance sheet. At December 31, 2019, BHG reported balance sheet loans totaling $454.7 million compared to $151.4 million as of December 31, 2018. A portion of these loans do not qualify for sale accounting and accordingly an offsetting secured borrowing liability has been recorded. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, BHG had $316.7 million and $150.4 million of secured borrowings associated with loans held for investment which did not qualify for sale accounting. Interest income and fees and amounted to $60.6 million, $32.5 million and $19.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

&#8226; BHG also sometimes refers loans to other financial institutions and, based on an agreement with the institution, earn a fee for doing so. Typically, these are loans that BHG believes would either be classified as consumer-type loans rather than commercial loans, fail to meet the credit underwriting standards of BHG but another institution will accept the loans or are to borrowers in certain geographic locations where BHG has elected not to do business. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, BHG recognized fee income of $2.3 million, $1.5 million and $6.5 million, respectively, from these activities. 

Included in other noninterest income are interchange and other consumer fees, gains from bank-owned life insurance, swap fees earned for the facilitation of derivative transactions for our clients, SBA loan sales, gains or losses on other equity investments and other noninterest income items. Interchange revenues increased in 2019 as a result of increased debit and credit card transactions as compared to the comparable periods in 2018 and 2017 resulting from the increase in customers during the respective periods. Other noninterest income included changes in the cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance which was $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $12.5 million and $7.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in earnings on these bank-owned life insurance policies resulted primarily from the purchase of $100.0 million of new policies during 2018 and $110.0 million of new policies purchased in 2019. The assets that support these policies are administered by the life insurance carriers and the income we recognize (i.e., increases or decreases in the cash surrender value of the policies) on these policies is dependent upon the crediting rates applied by the insurance carriers, which are subject to change at the discretion of the carriers, subject to any applicable floors. Earnings on these policies generally are not taxable. Loan swap fees and SBA loan sales are all included in other noninterest income and fluctuate based on the current market environment. Additionally, the carrying values of other equity investments are adjusted either upwards or downwards from the transaction price to reflect expected exit values as evidenced by financing and sale transactions with third parties, or when determination of a valuation adjustment is confirmed through ongoing reviews by senior investment managers.

The increase in total salaries and employee benefits expense in 2019 over 2018 and 2017 is primarily the result of an increase in the number of employees in 2019 over 2018 and 2017 and annual merit increases to base salaries. At December 31, 2019, our associate base had expanded to 2,487.0 full-time equivalent associates as compared to 2,297.0 and 2,132.0 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, primarily resulting from our efforts to continue to hire experienced bankers and other associates throughout our footprint. We expect salary and employee benefit expenses will continue to rise as we continue to hire experienced bankers and other associates across our franchise, including in the Atlanta, Georgia market in which we entered late in the fourth quarter of 2019. We also expect salaries and benefits expense will increase in 2020 when compared to 2019 due to our increased associate base and annual merit increases given in the first quarter of each fiscal year and as we continue to enhance the infrastructure around our operations to account for our increased size and geographic reach. 

Commissions expense represents compensation paid to our wealth management lines of business including investment services, trust, insurance and capital markets. Commissions expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 9.1% greater than in 2018 which was 67.0% greater than in 2017. The increase in 2019 as compared to 2018 and 2018 as compared to 2017 is primarily related to growth in our investment portfolio commissions. Commissions expense incurred related to the production of residential mortgages is recorded net of the related mortgage revenues. 

We believe that cash and equity incentives are a valuable tool in motivating an employee base that is focused on providing our clients effective financial advice and increasing shareholder value. As a result, and unlike many other financial institutions, historically all of our non-commissioned associates have participated in our annual cash incentive plan with a minimum targeted bonus equal to 10% of each associate's annual salary, and all of our associates participate in our equity compensation plans. Advocate Capital's associates did not participate in our company-wide plan in 2019 and will participate in an Advocate Capital plan in 2020. Under the 2019 annual cash incentive plan, the targeted level of incentive payments requires achievement of a certain soundness threshold and a targeted level of revenues and diluted earnings per share (subject to certain adjustments). To the extent that the soundness threshold is met and revenues and earnings are above or below the targeted amount, the aggregate incentive payments are increased or decreased. Historically, we have paid between 0% and 125% of our targeted incentives. In 2019, our cash incentives represented 120% of targeted incentive compensation compared to 100% in 2018 and 105% in 2017. Cash incentives for 2019 totaled $46.8 million, compared to $36.4 million in 2018 and $24.1 million in 2017. The increase in 2019 when compared to 2018 was primarily the result of the increase in the percentage of target of the payout from 100% in 2018 to 120% in 2019 as well as certain new associates that we had hired being able to participate in the annual cash incentive plan. The increase in 2018 when compared to 2017 was primarily the result of certain new associates that we had hired being able to participate in the annual cash incentive plan, particularly the BNC associates that did not participate in the company-wide plan in 2017. 

Also, included in cash and equity incentives for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, were approximately $11.9 million, $12.0 million and $10.3 million, respectively, of compensation expenses related to equity-based restricted share awards and approximately $9.3 million, $5.7 million and $6.3 million, respectively, of compensation expenses related to equity-based restricted share units with performance-based vesting criteria. We have not issued stock options since 2008. Under our equity incentive plans, we provide a broad-based equity incentive program for all associates. We believe that equity incentives provide a vehicle for all associates to become meaningful shareholders of Pinnacle Financial over an extended period of time and create a shareholder-centric culture throughout our organization. Our compensation expense associated with equity awards for 2019 increased when compared to 2018 and 2017 as a result of the additional associates we hired in those periods, including associates obtained in connection with the acquisitions of Advocate Capital and BNC as well as increases in the amount of performance units awarded to our senior associates. We expect our compensation expense associated with equity awards to increase in 2020 when compared to 2019 as a result of our intention to hire additional experienced financial advisors in 2020 as well as increases in the amount of performance units awarded to our senior associates . 

Employee benefits and other expenses include costs associated with our 401k plan, health insurance, payroll taxes and contract labor. These expenses increased by $1.9 million in 2019 compared to 2018 which increased by $13.3 million when compared to 2017. The increase in 2019 as compared to 2018 and 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily the result of the increase in full-time equivalent associates in each respective period. 

Equipment and occupancy expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 13.9% greater than in 2018 which was 37.3% greater than in 2017. Included in the year ended December 31, 2019 increase was a $3.2 million non-cash impairment charge incurred during the second quarter of 2019 related to the consolidation of five offices across our footprint. Additionally, we experienced increased expenses associated with technology improvements to enhance the infrastructure of our firm during the comparable periods and expect to incur additional costs in future periods as we continue to enhance our cybersecurity and operational infrastructure. The increase in 2018 as compared to 2017 is primarily due to our BNC merger, including the completion and opening of an office in North Carolina in 2018, and two new locations opened in our Tennessee markets in the latter part of 2017. We believe the number of our locations will increase over an extended period of time across our franchise and we have identified a location for our initial office in the Atlanta, Georgia metro area. In future periods, these expansions may lead to higher equipment and occupancy expenses as well as related increases in salaries and benefits expense.

Other real estate expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $4.2 million compared to $723,000 in 2018 and $1.1 million in 2017. The increase in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily the result of a $2.4 million write-down in the second quarter of 2019 of facilities and land acquired in the BNC acquisition that previously had been held for potential expansion. The decrease in 2018 compared to 2017 is related to the $12.7 million decrease in other real estate owned during the year ended December 31, 2018. 

Marketing and business development expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 13.1% greater than in 2018 which was 40.8% greater than in 2017. The primary source of the increases in 2019 as compared to 2018 is the associated marketing and business development expenses necessary to support the growth of our firm across our entire franchise in Tennessee, the Carolinas and Virginia. The primary source of the increase in 2018 as compared to 2017 is related to our merger with BNC and the associated marketing and business development expenses to support that expansion. We expect our marketing and business development expenses will increase in 2020, including as a result of our expansion into the Atlanta, Georgia metro market. 

&#160; 

Noninterest expense related to the amortization of intangibles was $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $10.5 million and $8.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in amortization expense in 2018 was attributable to an increase in amortizing intangibles resulting from our acquisitions in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The following table outlines our amortizing intangible assets, their initial valuations and their intangible lives as of December 31, 2019: 

##TABLE_START &#160; Year acquired Initial Valuation (in millions) Amortizable Life (in years) Remaining Value (in millions) Core Deposit Intangible: &#160; &#160; &#160; CapitalMark 2015 $ 6.2 &#160; 7 &#160; $ 0.9 &#160; Magna Bank 2015 3.2 &#160; 6 &#160; 0.3 &#160; Avenue 2016 8.8 &#160; 9 &#160; 3.3 &#160; BNC 2017 48.1 &#160; 10 &#160; 30.6 &#160; Book of Business Intangible: &#160; &#160; &#160; Miller Loughry Beach Insurance 2008 1.3 &#160; 20 &#160; 0.2 &#160; CapitalMark 2015 0.3 &#160; 16 &#160; 0.1 &#160; BNC Insurance 2017 0.4 &#160; 20 &#160; 0.3 &#160; BNC Trust 2017 1.9 &#160; 10 &#160; 1.4 &#160; Advocate Capital 2019 13.6 &#160; 13 &#160; 12.7 &#160; ##TABLE_END

These assets are being amortized on an accelerated basis which reflects the anticipated life of the underlying assets. Amortization expense related to these assets is estimated to decrease from $9.8 million per year to $5.4 million per year over the next five years with lesser amounts for the remaining amortization period. 

No merger-related expenses were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, merger-related expenses of $8.3 million and $31.8 million, respectively, were incurred associated with our acquisitions which occurred in, or prior to, those respective periods. Merger-related expenses in 2018 included costs to finalize the cultural and technical integrations related to our acquisition of BNC and associate retention packages. Merger-related expenses in 2017 primarily included the cost of the technical and cultural integration, lease termination fees, costs associated with the BNC branch rationalization plan we executed in 2017, the cost of certain assumed equity awards that vested upon the change in control, and retention bonuses paid to former BNC associates for their services during the conversion. Merger-related expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018, and 2017, also include the costs of technical conversions which were completed during, or prior to, those periods. Certain associate-related expenses such as retention bonuses are also included in these expenses. 

Total other noninterest expenses increased by $3.8 million to $71.7 million during 2019 when compared to 2018 and by $20.8 million to $67.9 million during 2018 when compared to 2017. Included in other noninterest expenses are deposit and lending related expenses, investment and trust sales expenses, audit, exam and insurance expense and administrative expenses. Deposit expenses decreased by $5.8 million in 2019 when compared to 2018 and increased by $9.7 million in 2018 when compared to 2017. The decrease in 2019 when compared to 2018 was largely related to reduced FDIC premiums, partially offset by an increase in volumes. The increase in 2018 when compared to 2017 was largely the result of increased volumes. Lending expenses increased by $5.1 million and $6.0 million, respectively, in 2019 when compared to 2018 and 2018 when compared to 2017 each as a result of increased volumes in those respective periods. Audit, exam and insurance expense is comprised of the fees associated with ongoing audit and regulatory exams of our operations as well as the cost of our corporate insurance. Increases in audit, exam and insurance expense in 2019 as compared to 2018 and 2017 is primarily related to increased regulation of our operations as a result of our increased asset size in each of the respective periods. Administrative and other expenses increased by $2.9 million to $18.9 million during 2019 when compared to 2018

and by $2.6 million to $16.0 million during 2018 when compared to 2017. A portion of that change resulted from franchise tax expense which increased $1.1 million in 2019 when compared to 2018 and by $1.4 million in 2018 when compared to 2017. The increased franchise tax expense is primarily the result our expanded tax base. 

Our efficiency ratio (the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income) was 49.1%, 48.3%, and 53.3% for the three years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The efficiency ratio for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018 was negatively impacted by $1.5 million of losses on the sale of our non-prime automobile portfolio, a $4.2 million write-down of facilities and land acquired in the BNC acquisition that previously had been held for potential expansion, and a $3.2 million non-cash impairment charge related to the consolidation of five offices across our footprint during the year ended December 31, 2019. Net gains and losses on sales of securities impacted our efficiency ratios in all periods, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Increased revenue from increased interest earning assets in the 2019 period over the 2018 and 2017 periods and the absence of merger-related expenses in 2019 positively impacted our efficiency ratio in the 2019 period when compared to 2018 and 2017 periods. The efficiency ratio improved in 2018 as compared to 2017 primarily due to the completion in 2018 of the integration and technology conversion associated with the acquisition of BNC and the growth in interest earning assets. 

&#160; 

Income Taxes. &#160; During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded income tax expense of $96.7 million compared to $90.5 million and $124.0 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. As a result of the Tax Act, in 2017 we recorded a non-cash charge of $31.5 million related to the revaluation of our net deferred tax assets due to the statutory federal income tax rate for corporate entities decreasing from 35 percent to 21 percent for 2018 and future periods. Our effective income tax rate was 19.4%, 20.1% and 41.6%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The reduction in 2018 was primarily due to the reduction in the federal statutory corporate tax rate following enactment of the Tax Act. Our effective tax rate differs from the combined federal and state income tax statutory rate in effect of 26.14% and 39.23%, during the respective periods, primarily due to our investments in bank-qualified municipal securities, tax benefits from our real estate investment trust and municipal investment subsidiaries, participation in Tennessee's Community Investment Tax Credit (CITC) program, tax benefits associated with share-based compensation, bank-owned life insurance and tax savings from our captive insurance subsidiary, offset in part by the limitation on deductibility of meals and entertainment expense, certain merger-related expenses and, in 2019 and 2018, non-deductible FDIC insurance premiums and non-deductible executive compensation. Impacting tax expense during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, was also our adoption on January 1, 2017 of FASB Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09, Stock Compensation Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Activity , which represented a change in accounting for the tax effects related to vesting of common shares and the exercise of stock options previously granted to our employees through our various equity compensation plans. This change resulted in a reduction in tax expense of $1.0 million, $3.0 million and $5.4 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 as the income tax effects related to settlements of share-based payment awards is now required to be reported as increases (or decreases) to income tax expense. Previously, income tax benefits at settlement of an award were reported as an increase (or decrease) to additional paid-in capital. 

Financial Condition 

Our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019 reflects an increase of $2.1 billion in outstanding loans to $19.8 billion and an increase of $1.3 billion in total deposits to $20.2 billion from December 31, 2018. Total assets were $27.8 billion at December 31, 2019 as compared to $25.0 billion at December 31, 2018. We acquired loans of $5.6 billion and deposits totaling $6.2 billion upon our acquisition of BNC in 2017. We acquired loans of $952.5 million and deposits totaling $966.7 million upon our acquisition of Avenue in 2016. Collectively, we acquired $1.3 billion in loans and $1.4 billion in deposits upon our acquisitions of CapitalMark and Magna in 2015. 

Loans. The composition of loans at December 31 for each of the past five years and the percentage (%) of each segment to total loans are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):

The composition of our loan portfolio changed due to our acquisition of BNC in 2017, which focused more on commercial real estate lending, including construction, than we did in our Tennessee markets. As we intend to focus on growth of the commercial and industrial segment across our franchise footprint, we continue to believe our commercial and industrial portfolio will again become a more substantial portion of our total loan portfolio. This focus was evident in 2018 and 2019, as the commercial and industrial segment represented 5.3% more of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2019 than it did at December 31, 2017. We will continue to focus on the growth of this segment in 2020 and future periods. 

The commercial real estate &#8211; mortgage category includes owner-occupied commercial real estate loans. At December 31, 2019, approximately 34.6% of the outstanding principal balance of our commercial real estate - mortgage loans was secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate properties. Owner-occupied commercial real estate is similar in many ways to our commercial and industrial lending in that these loans are generally made to businesses on the basis of the cash flows of the business rather than on the valuation of the real estate. Additionally, the construction and land development segment continues to be a meaningful portion of our portfolio and reflects the development in the local economies in which we operate and is diversified between commercial, residential and land. 

The following table classifies our fixed and variable rate loans at December 31, 2019 according to contractual maturities of (1) one year or less, (2) after one year through five years, and (3) after five years. The table also classifies our variable rate loans pursuant to the contractual repricing dates of the underlying loans (dollars in thousands):

Loan Origination Risk Management. We maintain lending policies and procedures designed to maximize lending opportunities within an acceptable level of risk. Management reviews and approves these policies and procedures on a regular basis. A reporting system supplements the review process by providing management with frequent reports related to loans in our portfolio, loan quality, concentrations of credit, loan delinquencies and non-performing loans. Diversification in the loan portfolio is measured and monitored as a means of managing risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions. 

Underwriting standards are designed to promote relationship banking rather than transactional banking. Management examines current and projected cash flows to determine the expected ability of a borrower to repay its obligations as agreed. Commercial and industrial loans are primarily underwritten based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and generally are collateralized by business assets and may have a personal guaranty of business principals. Collateral pledged may include the assets being financed or other assets such as accounts receivable, inventory or equipment. Some loans may be advanced on an unsecured basis. 

&#160;

Commercial real estate-mortgage loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial and industrial loans. These loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and are underwritten based on the ability of the property (in the case of income producing property), or the borrower's business (if owner-occupied) to generate sufficient cash flow to amortize the debt. Secondary emphasis is placed upon collateral value and the financial strength of guarantors, if any. Commercial real estate loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. As detailed in the discussion of real estate loans below, the properties securing our commercial real estate portfolio generally are diverse in terms of type and industry and we measure and monitor concentrations regularly. We believe this diversity helps reduce our exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single industry or type of real estate product. Management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on cash flow, collateral, geography and risk grade criteria. We also utilize third-party experts to provide insight and guidance about economic conditions and trends affecting market areas we serve. 

Construction loans are underwritten utilizing independent appraisals, sensitivity analysis of absorption and lease rates, financial analysis of the developers and property owners, and expectations of the permanent mortgage market, among other items. Construction loans are generally based upon estimates of costs and appraised value associated with the completed project, which may be inaccurate. Construction loans involve the disbursement of funds during construction with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project. Sources of repayment for these types of loans may be sales of developed property, refinancing in the permanent mortgage market, or an interim loan commitment from us until permanent financing is obtained. These loans are closely monitored by on-site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans because their ultimate repayment depends on the satisfactory completion of construction and is sensitive to interest rate changes, governmental regulation of real property, general economic conditions and the availability of long-term financing. 

We also originate consumer loans, including consumer real-estate loans, where we typically use a computer-based credit scoring analysis to supplement the underwriting process. To monitor and manage consumer loan risk, policies and procedures are developed and modified, as needed, jointly by line and staff personnel. This activity, coupled with relatively small loan amounts that are spread across many individual borrowers, seeks to minimize risk. Additionally, trend and outlook reports are reviewed by management on a regular basis. Underwriting standards for home equity loans are heavily influenced by statutory requirements. 

We also maintain an independent loan review department that reviews and validates the credit risk program on a periodic basis. Results of these reviews are presented to management and the audit and risk committees of our board of directors. The loan review process complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel, as well as our policies and procedures. 

Lending Concentrations. We periodically analyze our loan portfolio to determine if a concentration of credit risk exists to any one or more industries. We use broadly accepted industry classification systems in order to classify borrowers into various industry classifications. We have a credit exposure (loans outstanding plus unfunded commitments) exceeding 25% of Pinnacle Bank's total risk-based capital to borrowers in the following industries at December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands): 

##TABLE_START &#160; At December 31, 2019 &#160; Outstanding Principal Balances Unfunded Commitments Total exposure Total Exposure at December 31, 2018 Lessors of nonresidential buildings $ 3,681,897 &#160; $ 896,219 &#160; $ 4,578,116 &#160; $ 3,932,059 &#160; Lessors of residential buildings 951,295 &#160; 648,542 &#160; 1,599,837 &#160; 1,484,697 &#160; New housing for-sale builders 530,345 &#160; 560,258 &#160; 1,090,603 &#160; 1,100,989 &#160; Hotels and motels 805,957 &#160; 161,814 &#160; 967,771 &#160; 920,001 &#160; ##TABLE_END

Banking regulations have established guidelines for the construction ratio of less than 100% of total risk-based capital and for the non-owner occupied ratio of less than 300%. Should a bank&#8217;s ratios be in excess of these guidelines, banking regulations generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management. Both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by Pinnacle Bank&#8217;s total risk-based capital. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, Pinnacle Bank&#8217;s construction and land development loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital was 83.6% and 85.2%, respectively. Non-owner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans (including construction and loan development loans) was 268.3% and 277.7% for December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Pinnacle Bank was within the 100% and 300% guidelines throughout 2019 and has established what it believes to be appropriate controls to monitor its lending in these areas as it aims to keep the level of these loans to below the 100% and 300% thresholds though there may be periods where we exceed these levels if loan growth is more heavily weighted to these types of loans.

Performing Loans in Past Due Status. The following table is a summary of our accruing loans that were past due at least 30 days but less than 89 days and 90 days or more past due as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in thousands):

Potential Problem Loans. Potential problem loans amounted to approximately $276.0 million, or 1.4% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2019, compared to $176.3 million, or 1.0% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2018. Potential problem loans, which are not included in nonperforming loans, represent those loans with a well-defined weakness and where information about possible credit problems of borrowers has caused management to have doubts about the borrower's ability to comply with present repayment terms. This definition is believed to be substantially consistent with the standards established by Pinnacle Bank's primary regulators for loans classified as substandard or worse, but not considered nonperforming loans. Approximately $8.5 million of potential problem loans were past due at least 30 but less than 90 days as of December 31, 2019. 

Non-Performing Assets and Troubled Debt Restructurings. At December 31, 2019, we had $91.1 million in nonperforming assets compared to $103.2 million at December 31, 2018. Included in nonperforming assets were $61.6 million in nonperforming loans and $29.5 million in other real estate owned and other nonperforming assets at December 31, 2019 and $87.8 million in nonperforming loans and $15.4 million in other real estate owned and other nonperforming assets at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were $4.9 million and $5.9 million, respectively, of troubled debt restructurings that were performing as of the restructured date and remain on accrual status but are considered impaired loans pursuant to U.S. GAAP. 

All nonaccruing loans are reassigned to a special assets officer who was not responsible for originating the loan. The special assets officer is responsible for developing an action plan designed to minimize our future losses. Typically, these special assets officers review our loan files, interview prior officers assigned to the relationship, meet with borrowers, inspect collateral, reappraise collateral and/or consult with legal counsel. The special assets officer then recommends an action plan to a committee of senior associates including lenders and workout specialists, which could include foreclosing on collateral, restructuring the loan, issuing demand letters or other actions. 

We discontinue the accrual of interest income when (1) there is a significant deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower and full repayment of principal and interest is not expected or (2) the principal or interest is more than 90 days past due, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. During 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, we recognized $176,000, $469,000 and $95,000 of interest income from nonperforming loans, reflecting cash payments received from the borrower and our belief, at the time of payment, that the underlying collateral supported the carrying amount of the loans. 

Table of Contents 

Due to the weakening credit status of a borrower, we may elect to formally restructure certain loans to facilitate a repayment plan that seeks to minimize the potential losses, if any, that we might incur. These loans are considered troubled debt restructurings and are considered to be impaired loans pursuant to U.S. GAAP. If on nonaccruing status as of the date of restructuring, any restructured loan is included in the nonperforming loan balances as discussed above and is classified as an impaired loan. Loans that have been restructured that are on accrual status as of the restructure date are not included in nonperforming loans; however, such loans are still considered impaired. 

At December 31, 2019, we owned $29.5 million in other real estate which we had acquired, usually through foreclosure, or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, from borrowers compared to $15.2 million at December 31, 2018; the majority of this real estate is located within our principal markets. At December 31, 2019, OREO included $6.9 million of properties we acquired in connection with our acquisition of BNC that had previously been held for future expansion that were transferred to OREO in 2019. 

Allowance for Loan Losses (allowance). We maintain the allowance at a level that our management deems appropriate to adequately cover the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our allowance for loan losses was $94.8 million and $83.6 million, respectively, which our management deemed to be adequate at each of the respective dates. Our allowance for loan loss as a percentage of total loans has remained relatively flat from 0.47% at December 31, 2018 to 0.48% at December 31, 2019. The slight change in the allowance as a percentage of total loans is primarily attributable to provision expense associated with organic loan growth during 2019 when compared to 2018. The absolute level of our allowance for loan losses is largely driven by continued favorable credit experience in our larger portfolios and we believe it is supported by the strong economies present in the markets in which we currently operate. 

Also impacting the overall balance of our allowance for loan losses is fair value accounting on our acquired loan portfolios as no allowance for loan losses is assigned to acquired loans as of the date of acquisition; however, an allowance for loan losses is recorded for purchased loans that have experienced credit deterioration subsequent to acquisition or increases in balances outstanding. Our accounting policy is to compare the computed allowance for loan losses on a loan-by-loan basis for purchased loans to the remaining fair value adjustment. If the computed allowance at the loan level is greater than the remaining fair value adjustment, the excess is added to the allowance for loan losses by a charge to the provision for loan losses. The judgments and estimates associated with our allowance determination are described under "Critical Accounting Estimates" above. As of December 31, 2019, net loans included a net fair value discount of $55.1 million. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, the net fair value discount changed as follows:

(1) The accretable yield will be recorded as a component of interest income using the level-yield method based on the life of the underlying loans. 

(2) The nonaccretable yield is reduced as purchase credit impaired loans are settled. On January 1, 2020, any remaining nonaccretable yield will be reclassified to the allowance for credit losses in accordance with FASB ASC 2016-13 (CECL).

The allocation of the allowance for loan losses by category is determined based on historical loss experience for that category and qualitative factors applicable to each category of loans. The allocated loan loss attributable to impaired loans is included in the respective category above. The unallocated category is intended to allow for losses that are inherent in our portfolio that we have not yet identified or attributed to a specific risk factor and for modeling imprecision. Additional information on the allocation of the allowance between performing and impaired loans is provided in Note 5, "Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses", to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The following is a summary of changes in the allowance for loan losses for each of the years in the five-year period ended December 31, 2019 and the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans as of the end of each period (in thousands):

The decrease in the allowance for loan loss as a percentage of total loans over the last several years is primarily as a result of recording our acquired portfolios at fair value upon acquisition. Net charge-offs in the commercial and industrial portfolio are largely due to loans that were reported as nonperforming assets as of December 31, 2018, and for which further deterioration resulted in charge-offs during the year ended December 31, 2019. 

Table of Contents 

As noted in our critical accounting policies, management assesses the adequacy of the allowance at the end of each calendar quarter. This assessment includes procedures to estimate the allowance and test the adequacy and appropriateness of the resulting balance. The level of the allowance is based upon management's evaluation of the loan portfolios, past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, the views of Pinnacle Bank's regulators, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay (including the timing of future payments), the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, economic conditions, industry and peer bank loan quality indications and other pertinent factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change. 

Based upon our evaluation of the loan portfolio, we believe the allowance for loan losses to be adequate to absorb our estimate of inherent losses existing in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2019. While our policies and procedures used to estimate the allowance for loan losses, as well as the resultant provision for loan losses charged to operations, are considered adequate by management, they are necessarily approximate and imprecise. There are factors beyond our control, such as conditions in the local and national economy, local real estate market or a particular industry or borrower which may negatively impact, materially, our asset quality and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses and, thus, the resulting provision for loan losses. 

Investments. &#160; Our investment portfolio, consisting primarily of Federal agency bonds, state and municipal securities and mortgage-backed securities, amounted to $3.73 billion and $3.28 billion billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our investment to asset ratio has increased from 13.1% at December 31, 2018 to 13.4% at December 31, 2019. Our investment portfolio serves many purposes including serving as a stable source of income, collateral for public funds and as a potential liquidity source. During 2019, Pinnacle sold $737.7 million of investment securities for a net pre-tax loss of $5.9 million compared to $169.9 million of investment securities for a net pre-tax loss of $2.3 million during 2018 and $363.9 million of investment securities for a net pre-tax loss of $8.3 million during 2017. These sales were implemented as part of our efforts to reposition our investment portfolio to provide our balance sheet more protection from the rate environment in each respective period. The timing of the sales in 2017 also allowed us to capture an increased tax deduction in 2017 due to the reduction in corporate tax rates beginning in 2018 as a result of the passage of the Tax Act. During the third quarter of 2018, Pinnacle Financial transferred, at fair value, $179.8 million of municipal securities from the available-for-sale portfolio to the held-to-maturity portfolio to mitigate the impact of changes in fair value on our tangible book equity. The related net unrealized after tax losses of $2.2 million remained in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and will be amortized over the remaining life of the securities, offsetting the related amortization of discount on the transferred securities. No gains or losses were recognized at the time of transfer.

The following table shows the carrying value of investment securities according to contractual maturity classifications of (1) one year or less, (2) after one year through five years, (3) after five years through ten years, and (4) after ten years. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities of mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities because the mortgages or other assets underlying the securities may be called or prepaid with or without penalty. Therefore, these securities are not included in the maturity categories but are listed below these categories as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):

We computed yields using coupon interest, adding discount accretion or subtracting premium amortization, as appropriate, on a ratable basis over the life of each security. We computed the weighted average yield for each maturity range using the acquisition price of each security in that range. 

Deposits and Other Borrowings. We had approximately $20.2 billion of deposits at December 31, 2019 compared to $18.8 billion billion at December 31, 2018. Our deposits consist of noninterest and interest-bearing demand accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and time deposits. Additionally, we entered into agreements with certain customers to sell certain of our securities under agreements to repurchase the security the following day. These agreements (which are typically associated with comprehensive treasury management programs for our commercial clients and provide the client with short-term returns for their excess funds) amounted to $126.4 million at December 31, 2019 and $104.7 million at December 31, 2018. Average balances for these repurchase agreements were $117.5 million in 2019 and $129.9 million in 2018. Additionally, at December 31, 2019, we had borrowed $2.1 billion in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati (FHLB Cincinnati) compared to $1.4 billion billion at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019, we had an estimated $2.1 billion in additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB Cincinnati; however, incremental borrowings are made via a formal request by us and the subsequent approval by the FHLB Cincinnati. 

Generally, we have classified our funding base as either core funding or non-core funding as shown in the table below. The following table represents the balances of our deposits and other funding and the percentage of each type to the total at December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):

(1) The reciprocating categories consists of deposits we receive from a bank network (the Promontory network) in connection with deposits of our customers in excess of our FDIC coverage limit that we place with the Promontory network. 

As noted in the table above, our core funding as a percentage of total funding decreased from 79.0% at December 31, 2018 to 76.2% at December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of increased levels of brokered time deposits, advances from FHLB Cincinnati and subordinated debt.

When wholesale funding is necessary to complement the company's core deposit base, management determines which source is best suited to address both liquidity risk management and interest rate risk management objectives. We increased our exposure to brokered deposits and brokered time deposits in 2019 as a measure to diversify wholesale funding sources. Our Asset Liability Management Policy imposes limitations on overall wholesale funding reliance and on brokered deposit exposure specifically. Both our overall reliance on wholesale funding and exposure to brokered deposits and brokered time deposits were within those policy limitations as of December 31, 2019. 

Our funding policies impose limits on the amount of non-core funding we can utilize based on the non-core funding dependency ratio which is calculated pursuant to regulatory guidelines. Periodically, we may exceed our policy limitations, at which time management will develop plans to bring our funding sources back into compliance with our core funding ratios. At December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with our core funding policies. Though growing our core deposit base is a key strategic objective of our firm, our current growth plans contemplate that we may temporarily increase our non-core funding amounts from current levels, but we do not currently anticipate that such increases will exceed our internal policies. 

The amount of time deposits as of December 31, 2019 amounted to $3.9 billion. The following table, which includes core, non-core and reciprocal deposits, shows our time deposits in denominations of under $100,000 and those of denominations of $100,000 and greater by category based on time remaining until maturity of (1) three months or less, (2) over three but less than six months, (3) over six but less than twelve months and (4) over twelve months and the weighted average rate for each category (in thousands):

Subordinated debt and other borrowings. Pinnacle Bank receives advances from the FHLB Cincinnati, pursuant to the terms of various borrowing agreements, which assist it in the funding of its home mortgage and commercial real estate loan portfolios. Under the borrowing agreements with the FHLB Cincinnati, Pinnacle Bank has pledged certain qualifying residential mortgage loans and, pursuant to a blanket lien, all qualifying commercial mortgage loans as collateral. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, Pinnacle Financial had received advances from the FHLB Cincinnati totaling $2.1 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.

On September 11, 2019, we issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.13% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2029 (the 2029 Notes) in a public offering. From, and including, the date of issuance to, but excluding, September 15, 2024, the 2029 Notes will bear interest at an initial fixed rate of 4.13% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15, commencing on March 15, 2020. Thereafter, from September 15, 2024 through the maturity date, September 15, 2029, or earlier redemption date, the 2029 Notes will bear interest at a floating rate equal to the then-current three month LIBOR, plus 277.5 basis points for each quarterly interest period (subject to certain provisions regarding use of an alternative base rate upon certain LIBOR transition events), payable quarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on September 15, 2024. 

The offering and sale of the 2029 Notes yielded net proceeds of approximately $296.5 million after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses payable by us. We used approximately $8.8 million of such proceeds to redeem the previously outstanding Subordinated Note due October 15, 2023, which we assumed in the BNC merger and which carried an interest rate of 7.23% at the time of such redemption. We also used a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to redeem the outstanding principal and accrued interest of the $20.0 million aggregate principal amount of Avenue subordinated notes and $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of BNC subordinated notes effective January 1, 2020, each of which are listed in the table above as outstanding balances at December 31, 2019. We also intend to use the net proceeds of this offering to redeem the $130.0 million aggregate 

Table of Contents 

principal amount of subordinated notes issued by Pinnacle Bank listed in the table above after such notes become eligible for redemption on July 30, 2020. The redemption of the $130.0 million aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes issued by Pinnacle Bank is subject to receipt of all regulatory permissions for such redemption, which we have not yet sought, and our ultimate determination to redeem such notes after they become eligible for redemption. Pinnacle Bank is under no obligation to redeem its subordinated notes. At December 31, 2019 the weighted average interest rate on our trust preferred securities and related junior subordinated debt instruments and other subordinated debt agreements was 4.62%. Had these actual and anticipated subordinated note redemptions occurred in 2019, the weighted average rate on the remaining debt instruments would have been 4.36% at December 31, 2019. 

Capital Resources. &#160; At December 31, 2019 and 2018, our stockholders' equity amounted to $4.4 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively. The increase is primarily attributable to net income and other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2019, Pinnacle Bank's CET1 capital ratio was 11.2%, Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.2%, total capital ratio was 12.2% and Tier 1 leverage ratio was 10.5%, compared to 10.5%, 10.5%, 11.5% and 9.8% at December 31, 2018, respectively. At December 31, 2019, Pinnacle Financial's CET1 capital ratio was 9.7%, Tier 1 capital ratio was 9.7%, total capital ratio was 13.2% and Tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.1%, compared to 9.6%, 9.6%, 12.2% and 8.9% at December 31, 2018, respectively. 

We and our bank subsidiary are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can lead to certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, we and our bank subsidiary must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Our and Pinnacle Bank's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. 

Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require us and our bank subsidiary to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets, Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, total capital to risk-weighted assets and of Tier 1 capital to average assets. 

The final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's capital guidelines for U.S. banks (Basel III rules) became effective for us on January 1, 2015 with full compliance with all of the requirements being phased in over a multi-year schedule, and fully phased in by January 1, 2019. The minimum capital level requirements applicable to bank holding companies and banks subject to the rules are: (i) a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% for all institutions. The Basel III rules, also establish a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% (that was phased in over three years) above the regulatory minimum risk-based capital ratios. The capital conservation buffer was phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% and increased each year by a like percentage until fully implemented in January 2019. The net unrealized gain or loss on available-for-sale securities is not included in computing regulatory capital. Management believes, as of December 31, 2019, that we had met all capital adequacy requirements to which we are subject. 

In December 2017, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published the last version of the Basel III accord, generally referred to as &#8220;Basel IV.&#8221; The Basel Committee stated that a key objective of the revisions incorporated into the framework is to reduce excessive variability of risk-weighted assets (&#8220;RWA&#8221;), which will be accomplished by enhancing the robustness and risk sensitivity of the standardized approaches for credit risk and operational risk, which will facilitate the comparability of banks&#8217; capital ratios; constraining the use of internally modeled approaches; and complementing the risk-weighted capital ratio with a finalized leverage ratio and a revised and robust capital floor. Leadership of the federal banking agencies who are tasked with implementing Basel IV has indicated that it is considering how to appropriately apply these revisions in the United States. Although it is uncertain at this time, we anticipate some, if not all, of the Basel IV accord may be incorporated into the capital requirements framework applicable to us and Pinnacle Bank. 

Share Repurchase Program. On November 13, 2018, Pinnacle Financial announced that its board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $100.0 million of Pinnacle Financial&#8217;s outstanding common stock and increased it's authorization by $100.0 million on October 15, 2019. The original repurchase program expires on March 31, 2020 and the new program expires on December 31, 2020. Pinnacle Financial repurchased 1,102,038 shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $61.4 million in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. Share repurchases may be made from time to time, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, at the discretion of the management of Pinnacle Financial, after the board of directors of Pinnacle Financial authorizes a repurchase program. The approved share repurchase programs do not obligate Pinnacle Financial to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares, and the program may be extended, modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time. Stock repurchases generally are affected through open market purchases, and may be made through unsolicited negotiated transactions. The timing of these repurchases will depend on market conditions and other requirements.

Dividends. Pursuant to Tennessee banking law, Pinnacle Bank may not, without the prior consent of the TDFI, pay any dividends to us in a calendar year in excess of the total of its retained net profits for that year plus the retained net profits for the preceding two years. During the year ended December 31, 2019, Pinnacle Bank paid dividends of $114.0 million to us which was within the limits allowed by the TDFI. 

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid $50.2 million in dividends to common shareholders. On January 21, 2020 our board of directors declared a $0.16 quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders of approximately $12.3 million in aggregate that will be paid on February 28, 2020 to common shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 7, 2020. The amount and timing of all future dividend payments, if any, is subject to board discretion and will depend on our earnings, capital position, financial condition and other factors, including new regulatory capital requirements, as they become known to us. 

Market and Liquidity Risk Management 

Our objective is to manage assets and liabilities to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies. Our Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) is charged with the responsibility of monitoring these policies, which are designed to ensure acceptable composition of asset/liability mix. Two critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management. 

Interest Rate Sensitivity. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates. ALCO measures and evaluates the interest rate risk so that we can meet customer demands for various types of loans and deposits. ALCO determines the most appropriate amounts of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items. Measurements which we use to help us manage interest rate sensitivity include an earnings simulation model and an economic value of equity (EVE) model. 

Our interest rate sensitivity modeling incorporates a number of assumptions for both earnings simulation and EVE, including loan and deposit re-pricing characteristics, the rate of loan prepayments, etc. ALCO periodically reviews these assumptions for accuracy based on historical data and future expectations. Our ALCO policy requires that the base scenario assumes rates remain flat and is the scenario to which all others are compared in order to measure the change in net interest income and EVE. Policy limits are applied to the results of certain modeling scenarios. While the primary policy scenarios focus is on a twelve month time frame for the earnings simulations model, longer time horizons are also modeled. All policy scenarios assume a static volume forecast where the balance sheet is held constant, although other scenarios are modeled. 

Earnings simulation model. We believe interest rate risk is best measured by our earnings simulation modeling. Earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments are combined with forecasts of interest rates for the next 12 months and are combined with other factors in order to produce various earnings simulations over that same 12-month period. To limit interest rate risk, we have policy guidelines for our earnings at risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest income in both gradual and instantaneous changes to interest rates. 

While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in our analysis presented below to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Further, the earnings simulation model does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, hedging actions we might take, and changing product spreads that could mitigate any potential adverse impact of changes in interest rates. 

For instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates from a flat interest rate forecast over the next twelve months, assuming a static balance sheet, the following estimated changes are calculated: 

##TABLE_START Estimated % Change in Net Interest Income Over 12 Months Instantaneous Rate Change December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 100 bps increase (1.21)% &#160; 4.20% &#160; 200 bps increase (0.61)% &#160; 7.60% &#160; 100 bps decrease 0.56% &#160; (5.40)% &#160; ##TABLE_END

Table of Contents 

During 2019, short-term interest rate movements reversed direction as there were three 0.25% cuts in the Federal Funds Rate. These cuts followed an approximate three year period where the Federal Funds Rate had increased by 2.25%. Management responded in 2019 by repositioning the balance sheet&#8217;s sensitivity to market risk position so that it was better positioned for cuts in the short-term interest rate environment. That change in position is apparent when comparing the scenario results year-over-year in the table above. Management accomplished this change through the following actions, among others: 

&#8226; Purchased $2.8 billion of in-the-money interest rate floors for loans tied to the one-month LIBOR interest rate index; 

&#8226; Unwound $900 million of fair value hedges (receive variable rate/pay fixed rate) tied to our loan portfolio; 

&#8226; Extended the effective duration of our securities portfolio as well as boosting the portfolio&#8217;s level of protection against prepayment activity; and 

&#8226; Shortened the duration of our wholesale funding portfolio. 

The behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in the alternate interest rate scenarios set out in the table above is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. The projected impact on net interest income in the table above assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternative rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher-yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce the assumed benefit of those deposits. The projected impact on net interest income in the table above also assumes a "through-the-cycle" non-maturity deposit beta which may not be an accuracte predictor of actual deposit rate changes realized in scenarios of smaller and/or non-parallel interest rate movements. 

At December 31, 2019, our earnings simulation model indicated we were in compliance with our policies for interest rate scenarios for which we model as required by our board approved Asset Liability Policy. The board has suspended the requirement to model the down 200, 300 and 400 bps scenarios while 10 year maturity Treasury rates are below 2.0%, which was the case as of December 31, 2019. 

Economic value of equity model. While earnings simulation modeling attempts to determine the impact of a changing rate environment to our net interest income, our EVE model measures estimated changes to the economic values of our assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items as a result of interest rate changes. Economic values are determined by discounting expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, which establishes a base case EVE. We then shock rates as prescribed by our Asset Liability Policy and measure the sensitivity in EVE values for each of those shocked rate scenarios versus the base case. The Asset Liability Policy sets limits for those sensitivities. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, our EVE modeling calculated the following estimated changes in EVE due to instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates: 

##TABLE_START Instantaneous Rate Change December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 100 bps increase (4.00)% &#160; (1.20)% &#160; 200 bps increase (10.10)% &#160; (4.00)% &#160; 100 bps decrease 2.80% &#160; (1.80)% &#160; ##TABLE_END

While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current year). Further, EVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, hedging activities we might take, and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. 

At December 31, 2019, our EVE model indicated we were in compliance with our policies for all interest rate scenarios for which we model as required by our board approved Asset Liability Policy. The board has suspended the requirement to model the down 200, 300 and 400 bps scenarios while 10 year maturity Treasury rates are below 2.0%, which was the case as of December 31, 2019. 

Most likely earnings simulation models. We also analyze a most-likely earnings simulation scenario that projects the expected change in rates based on a forward yield curve adopted by management using expected balance sheet volumes forecasted by management. Separate growth assumptions are developed for loans, investments, deposits, etc. Other interest rate scenarios analyzed by management may include delayed rate shocks, yield curve steepening or flattening, or other variations in rate movements to further analyze or stress our balance sheet under various interest rate scenarios. Each scenario is evaluated by management and weighted to determine the most likely result. These processes assist management to better anticipate our financial results and, as a result, management may determine the need to invest in other operating strategies and tactics which might enhance results or better position the firm's balance sheet to reduce interest rate risk going forward.

Each of the above analyses may not, on its own, be an accurate indicator of how our net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. In addition, the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgage loans, have features (generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors) which limit changes in interest rates. Prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments. The ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates. ALCO reviews each of the above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with several different interest rate scenarios as part of its responsibility to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies. 

Management's model governance, model implementation and model validation processes and controls are subject to review in our regulatory examinations to ensure they are in compliance with the most recent regulatory guidelines and industry and regulatory practices. Management utilizes a respected, sophisticated third party asset liability modeling software to help ensure implementation of management's assumptions into the model are processed as intended in a robust manner. That said, there are numerous assumptions regarding financial instrument behavior that are integrated into the model. The assumptions are formulated by combining observations gleaned from our historical studies of financial instruments and our best estimations of how, if at all, these instruments may behave in the future given changes in economic conditions, technology, etc. These assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. Additionally, given the large number of assumptions built into the asset liability modeling software we and other firms utilize, it is difficult, to compare our results to other firms. 

ALCO may determine that Pinnacle Financial should over time become more or less asset or liability sensitive depending on the underlying balance sheet circumstances and our conclusions as to anticipated interest rate fluctuations in future periods. At present, ALCO has determined that its "most likely" rate scenario considers two decreases in short-term interest rates in the second half of 2020. Our "most likely" rate forecast is based primarily on information we acquire from a service which includes a consensus forecast of numerous interest rate benchmarks. We may implement additional actions designed to achieve our desired sensitivity position which could change from time to time. 

We have in the past used, and may in the future continue to use, derivative financial instruments as one tool to manage our interest rate sensitivity, including in our mortgage lending program, while continuing to meet the credit and deposit needs of our customers. For further details on the derivatives we currently use, see Note 14. "Derivative Instruments" in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

We may also enter into interest rate swaps to facilitate customer transactions and meet their financing needs. These swaps qualify as derivatives, even though they are not designated as hedging instruments. 

Liquidity Risk Management . The purpose of liquidity risk management is to ensure that there are sufficient cash flows to satisfy loan demand, deposit withdrawals, and our other needs. Traditional sources of liquidity for a bank include asset maturities and growth in core deposits. A bank may achieve its desired liquidity objectives from the management of its assets and liabilities and by internally generated funding through its operations. Funds invested in marketable instruments that can be readily sold and the continuous maturing of other earning assets are sources of liquidity from an asset perspective. The liability base provides sources of liquidity through attraction of increased deposits and borrowing funds from various other institutions. 

To assist in determining the adequacy of our liquidity, we perform a variety of liquidity stress tests including idiosyncratic, systemic and combined scenarios for both moderate and severe events. Liquidity is defined as the ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities. Liquidity management involves maintaining our ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of our customers, both depositors and borrowers. We seek to maintain a sufficiently liquid asset balance to ensure our ability to meet our obligations. The amount of the appropriate minimum liquid asset balance is determined through severe liquidity stress testing as measured by our liquidity coverage ratio calculation. At December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with our liquidity coverage ratio. 

Changes in interest rates also affect our liquidity position. We currently price deposits in response to market rates, and our management intends to continue this policy. If deposits are not priced in response to market rates, a loss of deposits could occur which would negatively affect our liquidity position.

Scheduled loan payments are a relatively stable source of funds, but loan payoffs and deposit flows fluctuate significantly, being influenced by interest rates, general economic conditions and competition. Additionally, debt security investments are subject to prepayment and call provisions that could accelerate their payoff prior to stated maturity. We attempt to price our deposit products to meet our asset/liability objectives consistent with local market conditions. Our ALCO is responsible for monitoring our ongoing liquidity needs. Our regulators also monitor our liquidity and capital resources on a periodic basis. 

As noted previously, Pinnacle Bank is a member of the FHLB Cincinnati and, pursuant to a borrowing agreement with the FHLB Cincinnati, has pledged certain assets pursuant to a blanket lien. As such, Pinnacle Bank may use the FHLB Cincinnati as a source of liquidity depending on the firm's ALCO strategies. Additionally, we may pledge additional qualifying assets or reduce the amount of pledged assets with the FHLB Cincinnati to increase or decrease our borrowing capacity at the FHLB Cincinnati. At December 31, 2019, we believe we had an estimated $2.1 billion in additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB Cincinnati; however, incremental borrowings are made via a formal request by Pinnacle Bank and the subsequent approval by the FHLB Cincinnati. 

Pinnacle Bank also has accommodations with upstream correspondent banks for unsecured short-term advances which aggregate $195.0 million. These accommodations have various covenants related to their term and availability, and in most cases must be repaid within less than a month. There were no outstanding borrowings under these agreements at December 31, 2019, or during the year then ended, although we test the availability of these accommodations annually. Pinnacle Bank also had approximately $3.4 billion in available Federal Reserve discount window lines of credit at December 31, 2019. 

At each of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had approximately $1.7 billion in brokered deposits. Historically, we have issued brokered certificates through several different brokerage houses based on competitive bid. Typically, these funds have been for varying maturities of up to two years and were issued at rates which were competitive to rates that we would be required to pay to attract similar deposits within many of our local markets as well as rates for FHLB Cincinnati advances of similar maturities. 

Banking regulators have defined additional liquidity guidelines, through the issuance of the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Modified LCR. These regulatory guidelines became effective January 2015 with phase in over subsequent years and require these large institutions to follow prescriptive guidance in determining an absolute level of a high quality liquid asset (HQLA) buffer that must be maintained on their balance sheets in order to withstand a potential liquidity crisis event. Although Pinnacle Financial follows the principles outlined in the Interagency Policy Statement on Liquidity Risk Management, issued March 2010, to determine its HQLA buffer, Pinnacle Financial is not currently subject to these regulations. However, these formulas could eventually be imposed on smaller banks, such as Pinnacle Bank, and require an increase in the absolute level of liquidity on our balance sheet, which could result in lower net interest margins for us in future periods. 

At December 31, 2019, we had no individually significant commitments for capital expenditures. But, we believe the number of our locations, including non-branch locations, will increase over an extended period of time across our footprint. In future periods, these expansions may lead to additional equipment and occupancy expenses as well as related increases in salaries and benefits expense. Additionally, we expect we will continue to incur costs associated with technology improvements to enhance the infrastructure of our firm.

Our short-term borrowings (borrowings which mature within the next fiscal year) consist primarily of securities sold under agreements to repurchase (these agreements are typically associated with comprehensive treasury management programs for our clients and provide them with short-term returns on their excess funds), FHLB Cincinnati advances and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.

Our management believes that we have adequate liquidity to meet all known contractual obligations and unfunded commitments, including loan commitments and reasonable borrower, depositor, and creditor requirements over the next twelve months. Our operating lease commitments are primarily related to our branch and headquarters facilities. The terms of these leases expire at various points ranging from 2020 through 2048. At December 31, 2019, our total minimum operating lease commitment was $100.1 million. Effective January 1, 2019, Pinnacle Financial adopted FASB ASC 842, which requires the recognition of a right of use asset and a lease liability generally equal to the present value of these minimum operating lease commitments. See Note 1. "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements" in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. &#160; At December 31, 2019, we had outstanding standby letters of credit of $203.6 million and unfunded loan commitments outstanding of $7.9 billion. Because these commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and many will expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment level does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. If needed to fund these outstanding commitments, Pinnacle Bank has the ability to liquidate Federal funds sold or securities available-for-sale, or on a short-term basis to borrow and purchase Federal funds from other financial institutions. The following table presents additional information about our unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2019, which by their terms, have contractual maturity dates subsequent to December 31, 2019 (in thousands):

We follow the same credit policies and underwriting practices when making these commitments as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. Each customer's creditworthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case basis and the amount of collateral obtained, if any, is based on management's credit evaluation of the customer. However, should the commitments be drawn upon and should our customers default on their resulting obligation to us, our maximum exposure to credit loss, without consideration of collateral, is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. At December 31, 2019, we had accrued $2.4 million for the inherent risks associated with off-balance sheet commitments. 

Risk Management 

As a financial institution, we take on a certain amount of risk in every business decision, transaction and activity. Risk management does not eliminate risk, but seeks to achieve an appropriate balance between risk and reward, including return, which is critical to optimizing shareholder value. Understanding our risks and managing them appropriately can enhance our ability to make better decisions, deliver on objectives, and improve performance.

Our board of directors and members of senior management have identified major categories of risk: credit risk, liquidity risk, strategic risk, reputational risk, operational risk (including IT, Cyber and BSA/AML), compliance risk, asset liability management risk, capital risk, HR employment practices risk and non-bank activities risk. In its oversight role of our risk management function, our board of directors, acting principally, but not exclusively, through a Risk Committee comprised solely of independent directors, focuses on the strategies, analyses and conclusions of management relating to identifying, understanding and managing risks so as to optimize total shareholder value, while balancing prudent business and safety and soundness considerations. The Risk Committee (or in some cases the full board of directors) fulfills the overarching oversight role for the risk management process, including approving risk appetite and tolerance levels, risk policies and limits, monitoring key and emerging risks, and reviewing risk assessment results. In addition, oversight of certain risk is allocated to other committees of the board of directors that meet regularly and report to our board of directors, including the Audit Committee and Human Resources and Compensation Committee. 

The Chief Risk Officer reports to the Chief Executive Officer and provides overall vision, direction and leadership regarding the enterprise risk management framework. The framework includes an Enterprise Wide Risk Management Committee, chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, and various management-level risk committees that focus on specific areas of risk management. The Enterprise Wide Risk Management Committee, which is comprised of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Chief Risk Officer, Chief Audit Executive, Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Credit Officer, provides management oversight of our enterprise-wide risk management program. Additional management-level risk committees are responsible for effective risk measurement, management and reporting of their respective risk categories. The Chief Risk Officer is an active member of each of the management-level risk committees. 

Our board of directors has adopted a risk appetite statement that seeks to balance the amount of risk we are willing take as we seek to achieve our financial performance objectives, i.e. returns. As such, our board of directors, principally acting through the Risk Committee, routinely monitors a host of risk metrics from both business and operational units, as well as by risk category, in an effort to appropriately balance the manner in which our performance aligns with our risk appetite. The Risk Committee and members of senior management, including the Chief Risk Officer, review assessments of our risk ratings within each of our key areas of risk on a regular basis. The Chief Risk Officer&#8217;s report to the Risk Committee includes the assessment of level and direction of risk within each key area, an assessment of critical factors that influence firm risks as well as the status of risk actions management is taking to mitigate and control key risks. These reviews are done in an effort to ensure performance alignment with our risk appetite, and where appropriate, trigger adjustments to applicable business strategies and tactics where risks approach our desired risk tolerance limits. 

We support our risk management process through a governance structure involving our board of directors and senior management. The Risk Committee strives to ensure that business decisions are executed within appropriate risk tolerances. The Risk Committee is responsible for overseeing senior management&#8217;s establishment and operation of our risk framework and our strategic and capital plans are aligned with the risk appetite approved by our board of directors. The Risk Committee serves as the primary point of contact between our board of directors and the Enterprise Wide Risk Management Committee. Management-level risk committees are responsible for effective risk measurement, managing and reporting of their respective risk categories. 

Risk appetite is an integral element of our business and capital planning processes through our Risk Committee and Enterprise Wide Risk Management Committee. We use our risk appetite processes to promote appropriate alignment of risk, capital and performance tactics, while also considering risk capacity and appetite constraints from both financial and non-financial risks. Our Risk Committee, in collaboration with our Enterprise Wide Risk Management Committee, approves our risk appetite on an annual basis, or more frequently, as needed to reflect changes in the risk environment, with the goal of ensuring that our risk appetite remains consistent with our strategic plans and business operations, regulatory environment and our shareholders' expectations. Reports relating to our risk appetite and strategic plans, and our ongoing monitoring thereof, are regularly presented to our various management-level risk oversight and planning committees and periodically reported up to the Risk Committee of our board of directors. 

As noted above, we have an Enterprise Wide Risk Management Committee comprised of key members of senior management. The purpose of this committee is to provide regular oversight of specific areas of risk within the tolerances and framework established by our Risk Committee and board of directors. The Enterprise Wide Risk Management Committee reports on a regular basis to the Risk Committee of our board of directors regarding our enterprise-wide risk profile and other significant risk management issues. Our Chief Risk Officer is responsible for the design and implementation of our enterprise-wide risk management strategy and framework and through his work with other senior associates seeks to ensure the coordinated and consistent implementation of risk management initiatives and strategies on a day-to-day basis.

Various departments within Pinnacle Bank, working with our Chief Risk Officer, are responsible for developing policies and procedures to effectively monitor risks within their areas. For instance, our compliance department is responsible for developing policies and procedures and monitoring compliance with applicable laws and regulations while our information technology department is responsible for maintaining a risk assessment of our information and cyber security risks and ensuring appropriate controls are in place to manage and control such risks, including designing appropriate testing plans to ensure the integrity of information and cyber security controls. Further, our audit function (including our internal audit function) performs an independent assessment of our internal controls environment and plays an integral role in testing the operation of the internal controls systems and reporting findings to management and our Audit Committee. Both the Risk Committee and Audit Committee of our board of directors regularly report on risk-related matters to the full board of directors. In addition, both the Risk Committee of our board of directors and our Enterprise Wide Risk Management Committee regularly assess our enterprise-wide risk profile and provide guidance on actions needed to address key and emerging risk issues. 

Our board of directors believes that our enterprise-wide risk management process is effective and enables the board of directors to: 

&#8226; assess the quality of the information we receive; 

&#8226; understand the businesses, investments and financial, accounting, legal, regulatory and strategic considerations and the risks that we face; 

&#8226; oversee and assess how senior management evaluates and manages risk; and 

&#8226; assess appropriately the quality of our enterprise-wide risk management process. 

Impact of Inflation 

The consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and practices within the banking industry which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than the effects of general levels of inflation.
