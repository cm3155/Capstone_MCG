 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following is a discussion of our financial condition at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 and our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. The purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about our financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from our consolidated financial statements. The following discussion and analysis should be read along with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein and the risk factors discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 (Form 10-K) and the other reports we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission since we filed that Form 10-K. 

Overview 

General. Our diluted net income per common share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $1.91 and $5.42, respectively, compared to $1.75 and $5.05, respectively, for the same periods in 2021. At September 30, 2022, loans increased to $27.7 billion, as compared to $23.4 billion at December 31, 2021, and total deposits increased to $33.7 billion at September 30, 2022 from $31.3 billion at December 31, 2021. 

Results of Operations. Our net interest income increased to $305.8 million and $809.8 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $237.5 million and $693.6 million, respectively, for the same periods in the prior year, representing increases of $68.2 million and $116.2 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 when compared to the comparable periods in 2021, this increase was largely the result of organic loan growth and yield expansion in our earning asset portfolio. Partially offsetting the increase was a decrease in the interest and fees related to PPP loans and discount accretion associated with fair value adjustments as well as the rising cost of funds in the quarter and year-to-date periods in 2022. The net interest margin (the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 was 3.47% and 3.18%, respectively, compared to 3.03% and 3.05%, respectively, for the same periods in 2021 and reflects the rising short-term interest rate environment, including the impact of exceeding substantially all of our loan floors during the second and third quarters of 2022, and the deployment of excess funds in higher yielding loans offset in part by the diminishing impact of loans made and fees recognized pursuant to the PPP, declining levels of positive impact from purchase accounting as well as the competitive rate environments for loans and deposits in our markets. 

Our provision for credit losses was $27.5 million and $43.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $3.4 million and $13.5 million for the same periods in 2021. The increase in provision expense as compared to the same periods in 2021 is primarily due to growth in the loan portfolio and the developing uncertain economic environment. Also contributing to the provision expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were net charge-offs totaling $11.0 million and $14.8 million, respectively, compared to $9.3 million and $30.6 million for the same periods in 2021. 

Noninterest income increased by $710,000, or 0.7%, and $38.8 million, or 13.1%, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. The growth was in part attributable to an increase in wealth management revenues which were $19.4 million and $61.9 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $17.3 million and $49.8 million, respectively, in the same periods in the prior year as well as an increase in income from our equity method investment in BHG of $10.9 million, or 35.9%, and $33.0 million, or 36.1%, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in the prior year. Service charges on deposit accounts decreased $529,000 and increased $4.9 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 due to fluctuations in transaction volumes in these accounts and the previously disclosed changes to our firm's insufficient funds and overdraft programs during the third quarter of 2022. Additionally, the carrying values of other equity investments we have made are adjusted either upwards or downwards from the transaction price to reflect expected exit values as evidenced by financing and sale transactions with third parties, or when determination of a valuation adjustment is confirmed through financial reports provided by the portfolio managers of the investments. Income related to these investments decreased $7.9 million and $9.9 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 when compared to the same periods in the prior year as we experienced greater increases in certain of our venture fund investment valuations, due to changes in the valuations in their underlying portfolios, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 than was the case in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. Loan swap fees decreased by $392,000 and increased by $1.2 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same periods in 2021 due primarily to a change in the volume of activity resulting from the then current interest rate environments. The other components of other noninterest income increased $1.9 million and $11.1 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 is largely the result of a $5.5 million gain on remeasurement of our previously held equity investment in JB&#38;B Capital, LLC (JB&#38;B), resulting from our bank subsidiary's acquisition on March 1, 2022 of the 80% equity interests of JB&#38;B it did not previously own. The increases we experienced in certain noninterest income items were offset by a significant decline in gains on mortgage loans sold, net, which decreased by $6.7 million and $20.8 million, respectively, for the three 

and nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same periods in the prior year as increases in the rate environment and declines in housing inventory in our markets negatively impacted both refinancing and new purchase originations. 

Noninterest expense increased by $30.4 million, or 18.0%, and $88.3 million, or 18.0%, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. Impacting noninterest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same prior year periods were increases of $17.5 million and $52.4 million, respectively, in salaries and employee benefits. The change in salaries and employee benefits was primarily the result of an increase in our associate base to 3,184.5 full-time equivalent associates at September 30, 2022 versus 2,769.5 at September 30, 2021 as well as annual merit increases effective in January 2022. Also contributing to the increase, were equity compensation expenses which were up $3.9 million and $13.1 million, respectively, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same prior year periods. Noninterest expense categories, other than salaries and employee benefits, were $69.3 million and $199.6 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to $56.4 million and $163.7 million, respectively, during three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. 

Our efficiency ratio (the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income) was 48.5% and 50.5%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to 49.4% and 49.5%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. The efficiency ratio measures the amount of expense that is incurred to generate a dollar of revenue. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, we recorded income tax expense of $35.2 million and $99.7 million, respectively, compared to $32.8 million and $91.7 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. Our effective tax rate for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 was 19.1%, compared to 19.4% and 18.9%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. Our tax rate in each period was impacted by among other things the vesting and exercise of equity-based awards previously granted under our equity-based compensation program. For the three months ended September 30, 2022, no excess tax benefits or expenses were recognized. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we recognized excess tax benefits of $2.9 million. Comparatively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, we recognized excess tax benefits of $334,000 and $2.2 million, respectively. 

Financial Condition. Loans increased $4.3 billion, or 18.4%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, when compared to December 31, 2021. The increase is primarily the result of loans made to borrowers that principally operate or are located in our core markets, including the markets in which we recently expanded, increases in the number of relationship advisors we employ and continued focus on attracting new customers to our company offset in part by the $360.4 million decrease in the amount of PPP loans in our portfolio during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as these loans were paid down or forgiven by the SBA. Loan growth was also positively impacted during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 by the addition of certain specialty lending groups, including franchise lending and equipment lease financing. Total deposits were $33.7 billion at September 30, 2022, compared to $31.3 billion at December 31, 2021, an increase of $2.4 billion, or 7.6%. Interest-bearing core deposit growth during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, increased approximately $1.4 billion, or 4.9% from December 31, 2021, as a result of our intentional focus on gathering and retaining these core deposits. 

At September 30, 2022, our allowance for credit losses was $288.1 million compared to $263.2 million at December 31, 2021. The increase in the allowance for credit losses is largely the result of growth in the loan portfolio and the developing uncertain economic environment. 

Capital and Liquidity. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our capital ratios, including our bank's capital ratios, exceeded regulatory minimum capital requirements and those necessary to be considered well-capitalized under applicable federal regulations. See Note 10. Regulatory Matters in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our capital ratios. From time to time we may be required to support the capital needs of our bank (Pinnacle Bank). At September 30, 2022, we had approximately $158.4 million of cash at the parent company that could be used to support our bank. 

On January 19, 2021, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $125.0 million of our outstanding common stock. The authorization for this program remained in effect through March 31, 2022. On January 18, 2022, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $125.0 million of our common stock which commenced upon the expiration of the share repurchase program that expired on March 31, 2022. The new authorization is to remain in effect through March 31, 2023. We did not repurchase any shares under either share repurchase program during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 or 2021, respectively.

Results of Operations 

Net Interest Income. Net interest income represents the amount by which interest earned on various earning assets exceeds interest paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities and is the most significant component of our revenues. Net interest income totaled $305.8 million and $809.8 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $237.5 million and $693.6 million, respectively, for the same periods in the prior year, representing increases of $68.2 million and $116.2 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 when compared to the comparable periods in 2021, 

this increase was largely the result of organic loan growth and yield expansion in our earning asset portfolio. Partially offsetting the increase was a decrease in the interest and fees related to PPP loans and discount accretion associated with fair value adjustments as well as the rising cost of funds in the quarter and year-to-date periods in 2022. 

The following tables set forth the amount of our average balances, interest income or interest expense for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the average interest rate for interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, net interest spread and net interest margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands):

The tax-exempt benefit has been reduced by the projected impact of tax-exempt income that will be disallowed pursuant to IRS Regulations as of and for the then current period presented. 

(3) Yields realized on interest-bearing assets less the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The net interest spread calculation excludes the impact of demand deposits. Had the impact of demand deposits been included, the net interest spread for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 would have been 3.16% compared to a net interest spread of 3.03% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. 

(4) Net interest margin is the result of annualized net interest income calculated on a tax-equivalent basis divided by average interest-earning assets for the period. 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, our net interest margin was 3.47% and 3.18%, respectively, compared to 3.03% and 3.05%, respectively, for the same periods in 2021. Our net interest margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 reflects the rising short-term interest rate environment, including the impact of exceeding substantially all of our loan floors during the second and third quarters of 2022, and the deployment of excess funds in higher yielding loans offset in part by the diminishing impact of loans made and fees recognized pursuant to the PPP, declining levels of positive impact from purchase accounting as well as the competitive rate environments for loans and deposits in our markets. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, our earning asset yield increased by 88 basis points and 23 basis points, respectively, from the same periods in the prior year. Conversely, our total funding rates, led by increases in interest-bearing deposits rates, increased by 45 basis points and 10 basis points, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in the prior 

year. In September 2022, the Federal Reserve again raised short-term interest rates by 75 basis points and our current expectation is another 125 basis point increase during the remainder of 2022. Given that substantially all of the loan floors on our adjustable rate loans were exceeded in the second and third quarters of 2022, these subsequent rate increases should contribute to expansion in our net interest margin during the remainder of 2022 when compared to comparable periods in 2021. 

We continue to deploy various asset liability management strategies to manage our risk to interest rate fluctuations. The additional on-balance sheet liquidity that we accumulated primarily due to government stimulus efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic has largely runoff as of September 30, 2022. As a result, we do not anticipate excess liquidity negatively impacting our net interest margin going forward as much as it did in 2020, 2021 and through the first half of 2022. Our &#8216;most likely&#8217; forecast has short-term interest rates moving higher during the last quarter of 2022. However, there is much uncertainty in the interest rate futures markets due to the currently high level of inflation present in the economy, the pace of the rate tightening cycle being led by the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee and what risks these present for a recession to occur in the near-term. To help hedge against a potential &#8220;pivot&#8221; to a monetary easing cycle and the associated reduction in short-term interest rates, management entered into several interest rate floor and interest rate collar balance sheet hedging transactions in October 2022. These are designed to reduce downside risk to the net interest margin should short-term interest rates fall while minimally impacting the net interest margin should short-term interest rates rise. These hedging strategies are reflected in our net-interest-income at risk modeling results as of September 30, 2022. 

Provision for Credit Losses. The provision for credit losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish an allowance for credit losses that, in management's evaluation, is adequate to provide coverage for all expected credit losses. Our provision for credit losses was $27.5 million and $43.1 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $3.4 million and $13.5 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2021. The provision for credit losses is impacted by growth in our loan portfolio, recent historical and projected future economic conditions, our internal assessment of the credit quality of the loan portfolio, and net charge-offs. The increase in provision expense as compared to the same periods in 2021 is primarily due to growth in the loan portfolio and the developing uncertain economic environment. Also contributing to the provision expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were net charge-offs totaling $11.0 million and $14.8 million, respectively, compared to $9.3 million and $30.6 million for the same periods in 2021. 

Noninterest Income. &#160; Our noninterest income is composed of several components, some of which vary significantly between quarterly and annual periods. Service charges on deposit accounts and other noninterest income generally reflect customer growth trends, while fees from our wealth management departments, gains on mortgage loans sold, gains and losses on the sale of securities and gains or losses related to our efforts to mitigate risks associated with interest rate volatility will often reflect financial market conditions or our asset/liability management efforts and fluctuate from period to period. 

The following is a summary of our noninterest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands): 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 - 2021 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 - 2021 &#160; 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) Noninterest income: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Service charges on deposit accounts $ 10,906 $ 11,435 (4.6)% $ 33,552 $ 28,648 17.1% Investment services 10,780 9,648 11.7% 34,676 26,836 29.2% Insurance sales commissions 2,928 2,557 14.5% 9,518 8,188 16.2% Gains on mortgage loans sold, net 1,117 7,814 (85.7)% 7,333 28,180 (74.0)% Investment gains on sales of securities, net 217 &#8212; NM 156 366 (57.4)% Trust fees 5,706 5,049 13.0% 17,744 14,798 19.9% Income from equity method investment 41,341 30,409 35.9% 124,461 91,430 36.1% Other noninterest income: Interchange and other consumer fees 17,642 15,298 15.3% 51,488 42,026 22.5% Bank-owned life insurance 5,658 4,741 19.3% 15,418 14,210 8.5% Loan swap fees 1,187 1,579 (24.8)% 4,629 3,467 33.5% SBA loan sales 1,576 3,814 (58.7)% 6,234 9,503 (34.4)% Income from other equity investments 725 8,604 (91.6)% 9,104 19,000 (52.1)% Other noninterest income 5,022 3,147 59.6% 19,490 8,359 &#62;100% Total other noninterest income 31,810 37,183 (14.5)% 106,363 96,565 10.1% Total noninterest income $ 104,805 $ 104,095 0.7% $ 333,803 $ 295,011 13.1% 

The decrease in service charges on deposit accounts in the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021 relates to the previously disclosed changes to our firm's insufficient funds and overdraft programs during the third quarter of 2022. The increase in service charges on deposit accounts in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021 is the result of increased transaction volumes in commercial checking accounts which we believe is the result of the increased economic activity in our markets. We continue to expect future service charge revenues to be negatively impacted by the changes to our insufficient funds programs as was reflected in our third quarter 2022 balances. 

Income from our wealth management groups (investments, insurance and trust) is also included in noninterest income and has fluctuated during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 due in large part to market volatility. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, commissions and fees from investment services at our financial advisory unit, Pinnacle Asset Management, a division of Pinnacle Bank, and fees from our wealth advisory group, PNFP Capital Markets, Inc., increased by $1.1 million and $7.8 million, respectively, when compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, Pinnacle Asset Management was receiving commissions and fees in connection with approximately $7.2 billion and $6.6 billion, respectively, in brokerage assets. The increases in these fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 when compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 were the result of among other things an increase in investment and transaction advisory fees from PNFP Capital Markets, Inc. which increased $2.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Revenues from the sale of insurance products by our insurance subsidiaries for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased by $371,000 and $1.3 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. Included in insurance revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $1.4 million of contingent income that was based on 2021 sales production and claims experience compared to $953,000 recorded in the same period in the prior year. Additionally, at both September 30, 2022 and 2021, our trust department was receiving fees on approximately $4.2 billion of managed assets. We believe the improvement in the results of our wealth management businesses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 when compared to the comparable periods in 2021 is primarily attributable to an increased number of wealth management advisors and corresponding client acquisition. 

Gains on mortgage loans sold, net, consists of fees from the origination and sale of mortgage loans. These mortgage fees are for loans primarily originated in our current markets that are subsequently sold to third-party investors. Substantially all of these loan sales transfer servicing rights to the buyer. Generally, mortgage origination fees increase in lower interest rate environments and more robust housing markets and decrease in rising interest rate environments and more challenging housing markets. Mortgage origination fees will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as the rate environment changes. Gains on mortgage loans sold, net, were $1.1 million and $7.3 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $7.8 million and $28.2 million, respectively, for the same periods in the prior year. This decrease is the direct result of the increases in the rate environment negatively impacting both refinancing and new purchase originations. We hedge a portion of our mortgage pipeline as part of a mandatory delivery program whereby the hedge protects against changes in the fair value of the pipeline. The hedge is not designated as a hedge for GAAP purposes and, as such, changes in its fair value are recorded directly through the income statement. The change in the fair value of the outstanding mortgage pipeline at the end of any reporting period will directly impact the amount of gain recorded for mortgage loans held for sale during that reporting period. At September 30, 2022, the mortgage pipeline included $74.7 million in loans expected to close in 2022 compared to $210.4 million in loans at September 30, 2021 expected to close in 2021. 

Investment gains and losses on sales, net, represent the net gains and losses on sales of investment securities in our available-for-sale securities portfolio during the periods noted. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, $26.6 million and $29.5 million, respectively, of securities were sold for a net gain of $217,000 and $156,000,respectively, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021, when we sold no securities and the nine months ended September 30, 2021, when we sold $2.2 million of securities for a net gain of $366,000. 

Income from equity-method investment. Income from equity-method investment is comprised solely of income from our 49% equity-method investment in BHG. Prior to September 30, 2022, we held a portion of this investment at Pinnacle Financial and a portion at Pinnacle Bank. Effective September 30, 2022, Pinnacle Financial contributed 100% of the equity interests of BHG owned by it to Pinnacle Bank. BHG is engaged in the origination of commercial and consumer loans largely to healthcare providers and other skilled professionals throughout the United States. The loans originated by BHG are either financed by secured borrowings or sold to independent financial institutions and investors. 

Income from this equity-method investment was $41.3 million and $124.5 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $30.4 million and $91.4 million, respectively, for the same periods last year. Historically, BHG has sold the majority of the loans it originates to a network of bank purchasers through a combination of online auctions, direct sales and its direct purchase option. In recent years, BHG began an effort to retain more loans on its balance sheet. BHG&#8217;s decision to sell loans through its auction platform or retain loans on its balance sheet will be impacted by a variety of factors, including interest rates. In a 

rising rate environment, it may choose to sell more loans through its auction platform if the cost of financing loans on its balance sheet is not as attractive as a sale through its auction platform. Since 2020, BHG has completed six securitizations totaling $2.1 billion, with the latest securitization of $412 million having been completed in the third quarter of 2022. 

Income from equity-method investment is recorded net of amortization expense associated with customer lists and other intangible assets of $128,000 and $384,000, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $188,000 and $564,000, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. At September 30, 2022, there wer e $6.4 million of th ese intangible assets that are expected to be amortized in lesser amounts over the next 13 years. Also included in income from equity-method investment is accretion income associated with the fair valuation of certain of BHG's liabilities of $164,000 and $595,000, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to $349,000 and $1.2 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. At September 30, 2022, there were $600,000 of these liabilities that are expected to accrete into income in lesser amounts over the next four years. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank received dividends of $18.6 million and $59.4 million, respectively, from BHG in the aggregate compared to $16.8 million and $66.2 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. Dividends from BHG during such periods reduced the carrying amount of our investment in BHG, while earnings from BHG during such periods increased the carrying amount of our investment in BHG. Profits from intercompany transactions are eliminated. Our proportionate share of earnings from BHG is included in our consolidated tax return. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, Pinnacle Bank purchased loans from BHG of $49.6 million and $125.6 million, respectively, compared to loan purchases of $75.8 million and $200.7 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. These loans were purchased at par pursuant to BHG's joint venture loan program whereby BHG and Pinnacle Bank share proportionately in the credit risk of the acquired loans based on the rate on the loan and the rate of the purchase. The yield on this portfolio to Pinnacle Bank is anticipated to be between 4.50% and 6.00% per annum. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there were $374.3 million and $319.1 million, respectively, of BHG joint venture program loans held by Pinnacle Bank. 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, BHG reported $293.4 million and $830.0 million, respectively, in revenues, net of substitution losses of $25.6 million and $63.7 million, respectively, compared to revenues of $192.2 million and $528.8 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, net of substitution losses of $21.5 million and $75.0 million, respectively. Earnings from BHG are likely to fluctuate from period-to-period. Approximately $167.6 million and $505.6 million, respectively, of BHG's revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 related to gains on the sale of commercial and consumer loans compared to $134.6 million and $378.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. These loans have typically been sold by BHG with no recourse to a network of community banks and other financial institutions at a premium to the par value of the loan, although the purchaser may access a BHG cash reserve account of up to 3% of the loan balance to support loan payments. BHG retains no servicing or other responsibilities related to the core product loan once sold. As a result, this gain on sale premium represents BHG's compensation for absorbing the costs to originate the loan as well as marketing expenses associated with maintaining its business model. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, there were $5.1 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, of these loans previously sold by BHG that were being actively serviced by BHG's network of bank purchasers. BHG, at its sole option, may also provide purchasers of these loans the ability to substitute the acquired loan with another more recently-issued BHG loan should the previously-acquired loan become at least 90-days past due as to its monthly payments. As a result, BHG maintained a liability as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 of $270.3 million and $231.4 million, respectively, that represents an estimate of the future inherent losses for the outstanding core portfolio that may be subject to future substitution due to payment default or loan prepayment. This liability represents 5.3% and 5.7%, respectively, of core product loans previously sold by BHG that remain outstanding as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in this liability as a percentage of core product loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the comparable period ended September 30, 2021 was principally the result of a partial release of the reserve BHG recorded in 2020 related to the economic disruption associated with the COVID-19 pandemic which adversely impacted physician and dental practices in a material manner in 2020 and into 2021. 

In addition to these loans that BHG sells into its auction market, at September 30, 2022, BHG reported loans that remained on BHG's balance sheet totaling $3.3 billion compared to $1.9 billion as of September 30, 2021. A portion of these loans do not qualify for sale accounting and accordingly an offsetting secured borrowing liability has been recorded. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, BHG had $2.4 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, of secured borrowings associated with loans held for investment. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, BHG reported allowance for loan losses totaling $101.3 million and $41.5 million, respectively, with respect to the loans on its balance sheet. We anticipate that BHG will increase the level of allowance for loan losses for the remainder of 2022 given the current macroeconomic environment. BHG records its allowance for loan losses under the incurred loss method, but will be required to adopt CECL effective October 1, 2023. Interest income and fees associated with these on-balance sheet loans amounted to $116.3 million and $297.6 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $57.4 million and $136.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. 

Included in our other noninterest income are interchange and other consumer fees, gains from bank-owned life insurance, swap fees earned for the facilitation of derivative transactions for our clients, SBA loan sales, gains or losses on other equity investments and other noninterest income items. Interchange revenues increased 15.3% and 22.5%, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same periods in 2021 due to increased commercial credit card volumes period-over-period as compared to 2021. Other noninterest income included changes in the cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance which was $5.7 million and $15.4 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $4.7 million and $14.2 million, respectively, in the same periods in the prior year. The assets that support these policies are administered by the life insurance carriers and the income we recognize (i.e., increases or decreases in the cash surrender value of the policies) on these policies is dependent upon the crediting rates applied by the insurance carriers, which are subject to change at the discretion of the carriers, subject to any applicable floors. Earnings on these policies generally are not taxable. During the first nine months of 2022, we purchased an additional $100 million of bank owned life insurance. SBA loan sales are included in other noninterest income and decreased by $2.2 million and $3.3 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 when compared to the same periods in the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to the changing market conditions during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021 as SBA loan sales generally fluctuate based on general market conditions. Additionally, the carrying values of other equity investments we have made are adjusted either upwards or downwards from the transaction price to reflect expected exit values as evidenced by financing and sale transactions with third parties, or when determination of a valuation adjustment is confirmed through financial reports provided by the portfolio managers of the investments. Income related to these investments decreased $7.9 million and $9.9 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 when compared to the same periods in the prior year as we experienced greater increases in certain of our venture fund investment valuations, due to changes in the valuations in their underlying portfolios, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 than was the case in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. Loan swap fees decreased by $392,000 and increased by $1.2 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same periods in 2021 due primarily to a change in the volume of activity resulting from the then current interest rate environments. The other components of other noninterest income increased $1.9 million and $11.1 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 is largely the result of a $5.5 million gain on remeasurement of our previously held equity investment in JB&#38;B, resulting from our bank subsidiary's acquisition on March 1, 2022 of the 80% equity interests of JB&#38;B it did not previously own. 

Noninterest Expense. &#160; Noninterest expense consists of salaries and employee benefits, equipment and occupancy expenses, other real estate expenses, and other operating expenses. The following is a summary of our noninterest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands): 

&#160; Three Months Ended September 30, 2022-2021 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022-2021 &#160; 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) Noninterest expense: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Salaries and employee benefits: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Salaries $ 74,776 $ 61,382 21.8% $ 214,323 $ 177,593 20.7% Commissions 6,188 6,097 1.5% 18,763 16,273 15.3% Cash and equity incentives 30,747 30,169 1.9% 88,449 85,103 3.9% Employee benefits and other 18,199 14,758 23.3% 56,838 46,989 21.0% Total salaries and employee benefits 129,910 112,406 15.6% 378,373 325,958 16.1% Equipment and occupancy 27,886 23,712 17.6% 80,343 70,253 14.4% Other real estate (income) expense, net (90) (79) (13.9%) 101 (749) &#62;100% Marketing and other business development 4,958 3,325 49.1% 13,494 8,326 62.1% Postage and supplies 2,795 2,083 34.2% 7,486 6,004 24.7% Amortization of intangibles 1,951 2,088 (6.6%) 5,873 6,461 (9.1%) Other noninterest expense: Deposit related expense 6,689 5,754 16.2% 21,062 19,599 7.5% Lending related expense 13,224 10,137 30.5% 39,063 27,553 41.8% Wealth management related expense 590 464 27.2% 1,843 1,409 30.8% Other noninterest expense 11,340 8,961 26.5% 30,314 24,873 21.9% Total other noninterest expense 31,843 25,316 25.8% 92,282 73,434 25.7% Total noninterest expense $ 199,253 $ 168,851 18.0% $ 577,952 $ 489,687 18.0% 

Total salaries and employee benefits expenses increased $17.5 million and $52.4 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. The change in salaries and employee benefits was largely the result of an increase in our associate base in 2022 versus 2021 as well as annual merit increases effective in January 2022. Our associate base increased to 3,184.5 full-time equivalent associates at September 30, 2022 from 2,769.5 at September 30, 2021. We expect salary and benefit expenses in the fourth quarter of 2022 to increase when compared to the comparable period in 2021 as we continue our focus on hiring experienced bankers in all of our markets. 

We believe that cash and equity incentives are a valuable tool in motivating an associate base that is focused on providing our clients effective financial advice and increasing shareholder value. As a result, and unlike many other financial institutions, all of our bank's non-commissioned associates participate in our annual cash incentive plan with a minimum targeted bonus equal to 10% of each associate's annual salary, and all of our bank's associates participate in our equity compensation plans. Under the 2022 annual cash incentive plan, the targeted level of incentive payments requires achievement of a certain soundness threshold and a targeted level of quarterly pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) and annual earnings per common share (subject to certain adjustments). To the extent that the soundness threshold is met and PPNR and earnings per common share are above or below the targeted amount, the aggregate incentive payments are increased or decreased. Historically, we have paid between 0% and 125% of our targeted incentives. For 2022, maximum payouts under the plan could reach 125% of target compared to 160% of target for 2021. Through both the third quarter of 2022 and 2021, we accrued incentive costs for the cash incentive plan at maximum payout of our targeted awards of 125% and 160%, respectively. 

Also included in employee benefits and other expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were approximately $10.7 million and $30.9 million, respectively, of compensation expenses related to equity-based awards for restricted shares, restricted stock units and performance stock unit awards, compared to $6.8 million and $17.8 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. Under our equity incentive plans, we provide a broad-based equity incentive program for all of our bank's associates. We believe that equity incentives provide a vehicle for all associates to become meaningful shareholders of Pinnacle Financial over an extended period of time and create a shareholder-centric culture throughout our organization. Our compensation expense associated with equity awards with time-based vesting criteria is likely to continue to increase during the remainder of 2022 when compared to 2021 as a result of the increased number of associates and our intention to hire additional experienced financial advisors. Compensation expense associated with our performance-based vesting awards will continue to be impacted by our performance in 2022 and will likely be higher than the comparable prior year period during the remainder of 2022 as the amount of performance-based vesting awards granted in 2022 was greater than those granted in the prior year. Through the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, we have accrued for that portion of our performance awards with performance tied to 2022 at above-target payout. 

Employee benefits and other expenses were $18.2 million and $56.8 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $14.8 million and $47.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and include costs associated with our 401k plan, health insurance and payroll taxes. These costs fluctuate based on changes in our associate base and the level of participation in these programs by our associates. Costs associated with our health insurance and 401k plan programs increased $1.4 million and $4.4 million, respectively, in the aggregate during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 when compared to the same periods in 2021. These increases reflect the increase in our associate base in the respective periods, and in the case of our health insurance costs, increases in the premiums we paid for this coverage in 2022 compared to 2021 premium levels. 

Equipment and occupancy expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were $27.9 million and $80.3 million, respectively, compared to $23.7 million and $70.3 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. The increases are in part the result of the three new office locations that we opened after September 30, 2021, one in Georgia, one in west Tennessee and the other in the southern part of North Carolina. We expect to incur additional costs in future periods as we continue to enhance and expand our current locations, including in our new markets, and further develop our technology infrastructure. Additionally, during 2021, we announced our intention to move our corporate headquarters to an office tower under construction in Nashville, where we will be a founding partner and sponsor of the project. This move is currently planned for 2025 and will impact equipment and occupancy costs as we plan for this move. 

Other real estate income and expenses, net, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 was a benefit of $90,000 and expense of $101,000, respectively, as compared to benefits of $79,000 and $749,000, respectively, for the same periods in the prior year. 

Marketing and business development expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $5.0 million and $13.5 million, respectively, compared to $3.3 million and $8.3 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. The primary source of the increase for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same periods in 

2021 is the result of increased associate engagement as we brought back in-person orientation and associate meetings beginning in the first quarter of 2022 and increased client engagement as pandemic-related restrictions lapsed. We expect these costs to rise modestly and return to more normalized levels during the remainder of 2022 and into 2023 taking into account anticipated increases associated with the associates we have hired since December 31, 2019. 

Intangible amortization expense was $2.0 million and $5.9 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $2.1 million and $6.5 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2021. The following table outlines our amortizing intangible assets, their initial valuation and amortizable lives at September 30, 2022: 

&#160; Year acquired Initial Valuation &#160;(in millions) Amortizable Life (in years) Remaining Value (in millions) Core Deposit Intangible: &#160; &#160; &#160; Avenue 2016 $ 8.8 9 $ 0.8 BNC 2017 48.1 10 17.4 Book of Business Intangible: &#160; &#160; &#160; Miller Loughry Beach Insurance 2008 $ 1.3 20 $ 0.1 CapitalMark 2015 0.3 16 0.1 BNC Insurance 2017 0.4 20 0.2 BNC Trust 2017 1.9 10 0.9 Advocate Capital 2019 13.6 13 6.7 JB&#38;B Capital 2022 6.7 10 6.1 

These assets are being amortized on an accelerated basis which reflects the anticipated life of the underlying assets. Annual amortization expense of these intangibles is estimated to decrease from $7.2 million to $3.7 million per year over the next five years with lesser amounts for the remaining amortization period. 

Other noninterest expenses, which consists primarily of deposit, lending, wealth management and administrative expenses increased by $6.5 million and $18.8 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 when compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. Lending related expense increased by $3.1 million and $11.5 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 when compared to the same periods in the prior year. This increase is primarily the result of increased expense associated with our consumer and commercial credit card programs for which transaction volumes also increased in the respective period. Deposit related expense increased by $935,000 and $1.4 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 when compared to the same periods in 2021. Wealth management related expenses increased $126,000 and $434,000, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 when compared to the same periods in 2021 due primarily to an increased number of accounts being serviced by these areas. Other noninterest expenses increased $2.4 million and $5.4 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same periods in 2021 due in part to increases in consultant fees, contributions and other miscellaneous expense items. 

Our efficiency ratio (the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income) was 48.5% and 50.5%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to 49.4% and 49.5%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. The efficiency ratio for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 was negatively impacted in part by increased noninterest expense during the periods as a result of increased salaries and employee benefits and a decrease in the amount of gains on mortgage loans sold offset, in part, by increased income from our equity method investment in BHG and the impact of a rising interest rate environment. 

Income Taxes. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, we recorded income tax expense of $35.2 million and $99.7 million, respectively, compared to $32.8 million and $91.7 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. Our effective tax rate for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 was 19.1% compared 19.4% and 18.9%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. Our effective tax rate differs from the combined federal and state income tax statutory rate in effect of 26.14% primarily due to our investments in bank-qualified municipal securities, tax benefits from our real estate investment trust subsidiary, participation in Tennessee's Community Investment Tax Credit (CITC) program, tax benefits associated with share-based compensation, bank-owned life insurance and our captive insurance subsidiary, offset in part by the limitation on deductibility of meals and entertainment expense, non-deductible FDIC insurance premiums and non-deductible executive compensation. Our tax rate in each period was also impacted by the vesting and exercise of equity-based awards previously granted under our equity-based compensation program. For the three months ended September 30, 2022, no excess tax benefits or expenses were recognized. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we recognized excess tax benefits of $2.9 million. Comparatively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, we recognized excess tax benefits of $334,000 and $2.2 million, respectively. 

Financial Condition 

Our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2022 reflects an increase in total loans outstanding to $27.7 billion compared to $23.4 billion at December 31, 2021. Total deposits increased by $2.4 billion to $33.7 billion between December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022. Total assets were $41.0 billion at September 30, 2022 compared to $38.5 billion at December 31, 2021. 

Loans. The composition of loans at September 30, 2022 and at December 31, 2021 and the percentage (%) of each classification to total loans are summarized as follows (in thousands): &#160; September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 &#160; Amount Percent Amount Percent Commercial real estate: Owner occupied $ 3,426,271 12.4 % $ 3,048,822 13.0 % Non-owner occupied 6,164,981 22.2 % 5,221,704 22.3 % Consumer real estate &#8211; mortgage 4,271,913 15.4 % 3,680,684 15.7 % Construction and land development 3,548,970 12.8 % 2,903,017 12.4 % Commercial and industrial 9,748,994 35.2 % 8,074,546 34.5 % Consumer and other 550,565 2.0 % 485,489 2.1 % Total loans $ 27,711,694 100.0 % $ 23,414,262 100.0 % 

At September 30, 2022, our loan portfolio composition had changed modestly from the composition at December 31, 2021 with commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending generally continuing to make up the largest segments of our portfolio. At September 30, 2022, approximately 35.7% of the outstanding principal balance of our commercial real estate loans was secured by owner occupied commercial real estate properties, compared to 36.9% at December 31, 2021. Owner occupied commercial real estate is similar in many ways to our commercial and industrial lending in that these loans are generally made to businesses on the basis of the cash flows of the business rather than on the valuation of the real estate. Additionally, the construction and land development loan segment continues to be a meaningful portion of our portfolio and reflects the development and growth of the local communities in which we operate and is diversified between commercial, residential and land. 

Banking regulations have established guidelines for the construction ratio of less than 100% of total risk-based capital and for the non-owner occupied ratio of less than 300% of total risk-based capital. Should a bank&#8217;s ratios be in excess of these guidelines, banking regulations generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management. Both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by Pinnacle Bank&#8217;s total risk-based capital. At September 30, 2022, Pinnacle Bank&#8217;s construction and land development loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital was 85.4% compared to 79.1% at December 31, 2021. Construction and land development, non-owner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital were 244.0% and 234.1% as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. At September 30, 2022, Pinnacle Bank was within the 100% and 300% guidelines and has established what it believes to be appropriate controls to monitor its lending in these areas as it aims to keep the level of these loans to below the 100% and 300% thresholds. 

The following table presents the maturity distribution of our loan portfolio by loan segment at September 30, 2022 according to contractual maturities of (1) one year or less, (2) after one but within five years, (3) after five but within fifteen years and (4) after fifteen years. The table also presents the portion of loans by loan segment that have fixed interest rates or variable interest rates that fluctuate over the life of the loans in accordance with changes in an interest rate index (dollars in thousands):

The above information does not consider the impact of scheduled principal payments. 

Loans in Past Due Status. The following table is a summary of our loans that were past due at least 30 days but less than 89 days and 90 days or more past due as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 (in thousands):

Potential Problem Loans. Potential problem loans, which are not included in nonperforming assets, amounted to approximately $59.3 million, or 0.2% of total loans at September 30, 2022, compared to $109.6 million, or 0.5% of total loans at December 31, 2021. Potential problem loans represent those loans with a well-defined weakness and where information about possible credit problems of borrowers has caused management to have doubts about the borrower's ability to comply with present repayment terms. This definition is believed to be substantially consistent with the standards established by Pinnacle Bank's primary regulators, for loans classified as substandard, or worse, but not considered nonperforming loans. None of the potential problem loans were past due at least 30 days but less than 90 days as of September 30, 2022. 

Nonperforming Assets and Troubled Debt Restructurings. At September 30, 2022, we had $41.9 million in nonperforming assets compared to $40.1 million at December 31, 2021. Included in nonperforming assets were $34.1 million in nonaccrual loans and $7.8 

million in OREO and other nonperforming assets at September 30, 2022 and $31.6 million in nonaccrual loans and $8.5 million in OREO and other nonperforming assets at December 31, 2021. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there were $2.2 million and $2.4 million, respectively, of troubled debt restructurings, all of which were accruing as of the restructured date and remain on accrual status. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans (ACL). On January 1, 2020, we adopted FASB ASU 2016-13, which introduced the current expected credit losses (CECL) methodology and required us to estimate all expected credit losses over the remaining life of our loan portfolio. Accordingly, the ACL represents an amount that, in management's evaluation, is adequate to provide coverage for all expected future credit losses on outstanding loans. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our ACL was approximately $288.1 million and $263.2 million, respectively, which our management believed to be adequate at each of the respective dates. Our ACL as a percentage of total loans, inclusive of PPP loans, was 1.04% at September 30, 2022, down from 1.12% at December 31, 2021. No ACL has been recorded for PPP loans as they are fully guaranteed by the SBA. 

Our CECL models rely largely on recent historical and projected future macroeconomic conditions to estimate future credit losses. Macroeconomic factors used in the model include the national unemployment rate, gross domestic product, the commercial real estate price index and certain U.S. Treasury interest rates. Projections of these macroeconomic factors, obtained from an independent third party, are utilized to predict quarterly rates of default. 

Under the CECL methodology, the allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics, and for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with the collectively evaluated pools, evaluations are performed on an individual basis. 

Losses are predicted over a period of time determined to be reasonable and supportable, and at the end of the reasonable and supportable period losses are reverted to long term historical averages. At September 30, 2022, a reasonable and supportable period of twenty-four months was utilized for all loan segments followed by a twelve month straight line reversion period to long term averages. 

The following table sets forth, based on management's estimate, the allocation of the allowance for credit losses on loans to categories of loans and loan balances by category and the percentage of loans in each category to total loans and allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans within each loan category as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 (in thousands):

(1) Net charge-offs for the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2022 have been annualized. 

Pinnacle Financial's management assesses the adequacy of the ACL on a quarterly basis. This assessment includes procedures to estimate the ACL and test the adequacy and appropriateness of the resulting balance. The level of the ACL is based upon management's evaluation of historical default and loss experience, current and projected economic conditions, asset quality trends, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers' ability to repay the loan (including the timing of future payments), the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, industry and peer bank loan quality indications and other pertinent factors, including regulatory recommendations. The ACL is increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries of amounts previously charged-off. 

Based upon our evaluation of the loan portfolio, we believe the ACL to be adequate to absorb our estimate of expected future credit losses on loans outstanding at September 30, 2022. While our policies and procedures used to estimate the ACL as well as the resultant provision for credit losses charged to operations are considered adequate by management, they are necessarily approximate and imprecise. There are factors beyond our control, such as conditions in the local and national economy, local real estate markets or a particular industry or borrower which may negatively impact, materially, our asset quality and the adequacy of our ACL and, thus, the resulting provision for credit losses. 

Investments. Our investment securities portfolio, consisting primarily of Federal agency bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and state and municipal securities, amounted to $6.5 billion at September 30, 2022 compared to $6.1 billion at December 31, 2021. Our investment portfolio serves many purposes including serving as a stable source of income, as collateral for public funds deposits and as a potential liquidity source. A summary of our investment portfolio at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 follows: 

&#160; September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Weighted average life 11.70 years 6.26 years Effective duration* 4.85% 4.07% Tax equivalent yield 2.66% 2.08% 

(*) The metric is presented net of fair value hedges tied to certain investment portfolio holdings. The effective duration of the investment portfolio without the fair value hedges as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was 6.65% and 5.21%, respectively. 

Restricted Cash. Our restricted cash balances totaled approximately $18.6 million at September 30, 2022, compared to $82.5 million at December 31, 2021. This restricted cash is maintained at other financial institutions as collateral primarily for our derivative portfolio. The decrease in restricted cash is attributable primarily to a decrease in collateral requirements on certain derivative instruments for which the fair value has increased. See Note 8. Derivative Instruments in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 

Securities Purchased with Agreement to Resell. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had $529.0 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, in securities purchased with agreement to resell. This balance is the result of repurchase agreement transactions with financial institution counterparties. During 2021, these investments allowed us to deploy some of our excess liquidity position into instruments that improved the return on funds in the then current historically low interest rate environment. During 2022, we have opted to exit certain of these transactions to both fund our loan growth as well as repay certain FHLB advances to best support our firm in the current rising rate environment. 

Deposits and Other Borrowings. We had approximately $33.7 billion of deposits at September 30, 2022 compared to $31.3 billion at December 31, 2021. Our deposits consist of noninterest and interest-bearing demand accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and time deposits. Additionally, we routinely enter into agreements with certain customers to sell certain securities under 

agreements to repurchase the security the following day. These agreements (which are typically associated with comprehensive treasury management programs for our clients and provide them with short-term returns for their excess funds) amounted to $190.6 million at September 30, 2022 and $152.6 million at December 31, 2021. Additionally, at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, Pinnacle Bank had borrowed $889.2 million and $888.7 million, respectively, in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati (FHLB). At September 30, 2022, Pinnacle Bank had approximately $3.7 billion in additional availability with the FHLB; however, incremental borrowings are subject to applicable collateral requirements and are made in a formal request by Pinnacle Bank and the subsequent approval by the FHLB. 

Generally, we have classified our funding base as either core funding or noncore funding as shown in the table below. The following table represents the balances of our deposits and other funding, the average rate paid for each type and the percentage of each type to the total at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 (in thousands):

(1) The reciprocating categories consists of deposits we receive from a bank network (the IntraFi network) in connection with deposits of our customers in excess of our FDIC coverage limit that we place with the IntraFi network. 

As noted in the table above, our core funding as a percentage of total funding declined slightly moving from 89.5% at December 31, 2021 to 87.4% at September 30, 2022 but remained well above internal policies. We remain optimistic that we will be able to grow our levels of core funding as needed during the remainder of 2022 and into 2023 to fund our balance sheet in a sound manner. We created and implemented several deposit gathering initiatives in 2022 as part of our annual strategic planning process in anticipation of the more challenging deposit gathering environment we are seeing develop in the fourth quarter of 2022 and into 2023 as M2 money supply levels are projected to decline. When wholesale funding is necessary to complement the company's core deposit base, management determines which source is best suited to address both liquidity risk management and interest rate risk management objectives. Our Asset Liability Management Policy imposes limitations on overall wholesale funding reliance and on brokered deposit exposure specifically. Both our overall reliance on wholesale funding and exposure to brokered deposits and brokered time deposits were within those policy limitations as of September 30, 2022. 

The amount of time deposits as of September 30, 2022 amounted to $2.9 billion. The following table shows our time deposits in denominations of less than $250,000 and in denominations of $250,000 and greater by category based on time remaining until maturity and the weighted average rate for each category as of September 30, 2022 (in thousands):

Subordinated debt and other borrowings. Pinnacle Bank receives advances from the FHLB pursuant to the terms of various borrowing agreements which assist it in the funding of its home mortgage and commercial real estate loan portfolios. Under the borrowing agreements with the FHLB, Pinnacle Bank has pledged certain qualifying residential mortgage loans and, pursuant to a blanket lien, all qualifying commercial mortgage loans as collateral. At September 30, 2022, Pinnacle Bank had received advances from the FHLB totaling $1.3 billion. At September 30, 2022, the scheduled maturities of FHLB advances and interest rates are as follows (in thousands):

We have established, or through acquisition acquired, twelve statutory business trusts which were established to issue 30-year trust preferred securities and certain other subordinated debt agreements. These securities qualify as Tier 2 capital subject to annual phase outs beginning five years from maturity. These instruments are outlined below (in thousands):

On July 30, 2021, Pinnacle Bank redeemed $130.0 million aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes due July 30, 2025. Additionally, Pinnacle Financial redeemed $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes due November 16, 2026 on November 16, 2021. The redemptions were funded with existing cash on hand. Pursuant to regulatory guidelines, once the maturity date on subordinated notes is within five years, a portion of the notes will no longer be eligible to be included in regulatory capital, with an additional portion being excluded each year over the five year period approaching maturity. 

Capital Resources. At both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our shareholders' equity amounted to $5.3 billion. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, shareholders' equity was negatively impacted by accumulated other comprehensive losses on our available-for-sale securities portfolio that were caused by the rising short-term interest rate environment. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our capital ratios, including our bank's capital ratios, exceeded regulatory minimum capital requirements and those necessary to be considered well-capitalized under applicable federal regulations. See Note 10. Regulatory Matters in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our capital ratios. From time to time we may be required to support the capital needs of our bank (Pinnacle Bank). At September 30, 2022, we had approximately $158.4 million of cash at the parent company that could be used to support our bank. 

Share Repurchase Program. On January 19, 2021, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $125.0 million of our outstanding common stock. The authorization for this program remained in effect through March 31, 2022. On January 18, 2022, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $125.0 million of our common stock which commenced upon the expiration of the share repurchase program that expired on March 31, 2022. The new authorization is to remain in effect through March 31, 2023. We did not repurchase any shares under either share repurchase program during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 or 2021, respectively. 

Dividends. Pursuant to Tennessee banking law, our bank may not, without the prior consent of the Commissioner of the TDFI, pay any dividends to us in a calendar year in excess of the total of our bank's retained net profits for that year plus the retained net profits for the preceding two years, which was $929.1 million at September 30, 2022. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the bank paid dividends of $75.0 million to us which is within the limits allowed by the TDFI. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, we paid $17.1 million and $51.1 million, respectively, in dividends to our common shareholders and $3.8 million and $11.4 million, respectively, in dividends on our Series B Preferred Stock. On October 18, 2022, our board of directors declared a $0.22 per share quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders which should approximate $17.1 million in aggregate dividend payments that are expected to be paid on November 25, 2022 to common shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 4, 2022. Additionally, on that same day, our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of approximately $3.8 million, or $16.88 per share (or $0.422 per depositary share), on the Series B Preferred Stock payable on December 1, 2022 to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 16, 2022. The amount and timing of all future dividend payments, if any, is subject to board discretion and will depend on our earnings, capital position, financial condition and other factors, including, if necessary, our receipt of dividends from Pinnacle Bank, regulatory capital requirements, as they become known to us and receipt of any regulatory approvals that may become required as a result of our and our bank subsidiary's financial results. 

Market and Liquidity Risk Management 

Our objective is to manage assets and liabilities to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies. Our Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) is charged with the responsibility of monitoring these policies, which are designed to ensure acceptable composition of asset/liability mix. Two critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management. 

Interest Rate Sensitivity. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates. ALCO measures and evaluates the interest rate risk so that we can meet customer demands for various types of loans and deposits. ALCO determines the most appropriate amounts of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items. Measurements which we use to help us manage interest rate sensitivity include an earnings simulation model and an economic value of equity (EVE) model. 

Our interest rate sensitivity modeling incorporates a number of assumptions for both earnings simulation and EVE, including loan and deposit re-pricing characteristics, the rate of loan prepayments, etc. ALCO periodically reviews these assumptions for accuracy based on historical data and future expectations. Our ALCO policy requires that the base scenario assumes rates remain flat and is the scenario to which all others are compared in order to measure the change in net interest income and EVE. Policy limits are applied to the results of certain modeling scenarios. While the primary policy scenarios focus is on a twelve month time frame for the earnings simulations model, longer time horizons are also modeled. All policy scenarios assume a static volume forecast where the balance sheet is held constant, although other scenarios are modeled. 

There were several noteworthy factors when comparing the results of both the earnings simulation and the economic value of equity modeling results as of September 30, 2022 to the modeling results as of September 30, 2021: 

&#8226; The Federal Reserve increased the Federal Funds target rate by 300 basis points since December 31, 2021, which brought nearly all floating-rate loans above contractual interest-rate floors. 

&#8226; The fixed-rate PPP loan portfolio declined $698 million with most proceeds transitioning to floating-rate assets. 

&#8226; Short term floating-rate assets comprised of interest-bearing cash and repurchase agreements decreased $1.6 billion. 

&#8226; In October 2022, interest rate floor and collar derivatives with a notional value of $1.8 billion were added to the balance sheet to mitigate earnings-at-risk in a falling interest rate scenario. The impact of these derivatives is included in each of the earnings simulation and economic equity models below. 

Earnings simulation model. We believe interest rate risk is best measured by our earnings simulation modeling. Earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments are combined with forecasts of interest rates for the next 12 months and are combined with other factors in order to produce various earnings simulations over that same 12-month period. To limit interest rate risk, we have policy guidelines for our earnings at risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest income in both gradual and instantaneous changes to interest rates. For instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates from management's flat interest rate forecast over the next twelve months, assuming a static balance sheet, the following estimated changes are calculated: 

Estimated % Change in Net Interest Income Over 12 Months 

September 30, 2022* 

September 30, 2021* 

Instantaneous Rate Change 

300 bps increase 

3.26 % 8.92 % 

200 bps increase 

1.74 % 5.79 % 

100 bps increase 

0.56 % 2.22 % 

100 bps decrease 

(2.90) % (2.14) % 

200 bps decrease 

(6.81) % (2.86) % 

300 bps decrease 

(14.77) % (3.39) % 

*: Negative interest rates are not contemplated in these scenarios. The Treasury curve and all short-term rate indices, such as Fed Funds, LIBOR, etc., are assumed to be zero bound. 

While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Further, the earnings simulation model does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, hedging activities we might take and changing product spreads that could mitigate any potential adverse impact of changes in interest rates. 

The behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios set out in the table above is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. The projected impact on net interest income in the table above assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternative rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher-yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce the assumed benefit of those deposits. The projected impact on net interest income in the table above also assumes a "through-the-cycle" non-maturity deposit beta which may not be an accurate predictor of actual deposit rate changes realized in scenarios of smaller and/or non-parallel interest rate movements. 

At September 30, 2022, our earnings simulation model indicated we were in compliance with our policies for all interest rate scenarios for which we model as required by our board approved Asset Liability Policy. 

Economic value of equity model. While earnings simulation modeling attempts to determine the impact of a changing rate environment to our net interest income, our EVE model measures estimated changes to the economic values of our assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items as a result of interest rate changes. Economic values are determined by discounting expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, which establishes a base case EVE. We then shock rates as prescribed by our Asset Liability Policy and measure the sensitivity in EVE values for each of those shocked rate scenarios versus the base case. The Asset Liability Policy sets limits for those sensitivities. At September 30, 2022, our EVE modeling calculated the following estimated changes in EVE due to instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates: 

September 30, 2022* 

September 30, 2021* 

Instantaneous Rate Change 

300 bps increase 

(20.11) % (12.34)% 

200 bps increase 

(13.86) % (7.97) % 

100 bps increase 

(7.08) % (2.70) % 

100 bps decrease 

4.87 % (6.90) % 

200 bps decrease 

2.06 % (8.11) % 

300 bps decrease 

(1.60) % (7.99) % 

*: Negative interest rates are not contemplated in these scenarios. The Treasury curve and all short-term rate indices, such as Fed Funds, LIBOR, etc., are assumed to be zero bound. Funds, LIBOR, etc., are assumed to be zed. 

While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current year). Further, EVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, hedging activities we might take and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. 

At September 30, 2022, our EVE model indicated we were in compliance with our policies for all interest rate scenarios for which we model as required by our board approved Asset Liability Policy. 

Most likely earnings simulation models. We also analyze a most-likely earnings simulation scenario that projects the expected change in rates based on a forward yield curve adopted by management using expected balance sheet volumes forecasted by management. Separate growth assumptions are developed for loans, investments, deposits, etc. Other interest rate scenarios analyzed by management may include delayed rate shocks, yield curve steepening or flattening, or other variations in rate movements to further analyze or stress our balance sheet under various interest rate scenarios. Each scenario is evaluated by management. These processes assist management to better anticipate our financial results and, as a result, management may determine the need to invest in other operating strategies and tactics which might enhance results or better position the firm's balance sheet to reduce interest rate risk going forward. 

Each of the above analyses may not, on its own, be an accurate indicator of how our net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. In addition, the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgage loans, have features (generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors) 

which limit changes in interest rates. Prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments. The ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates. ALCO reviews each of the above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with several different interest rate scenarios as part of its responsibility to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies. 

Management's model governance, model implementation and model validation processes and controls are subject to review in our regulatory examinations to ensure they are in compliance with the most recent regulatory guidelines and industry and regulatory practices. Management utilizes a respected, sophisticated third party asset liability modeling software to help ensure implementation of management's assumptions into the model are processed as intended in a robust manner. That said, there are numerous assumptions regarding financial instrument behavior that are integrated into the model. The assumptions are formulated by combining observations gleaned from our historical studies of financial instruments and our best estimations of how these instruments may behave in the future given changes in economic conditions, technology, etc. These assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. Additionally, given the large number of assumptions built into our asset liability modeling software, it is difficult, at best, to compare our results to other firms. 

ALCO may determine that Pinnacle Financial should over time become more or less asset or liability sensitive depending on the underlying balance sheet circumstances and our conclusions as to anticipated interest rate fluctuations in future periods. At present, ALCO has determined that its "most likely" rate scenario assumes an additional 125 basis point increase in the Federal Funds Rate during 2022. Our "most likely" rate forecast is based primarily on information we acquire from a service which includes a consensus forecast of numerous interest rate benchmarks. We may implement additional actions designed to achieve our desired sensitivity position which could change from time to time. 

We have in the past used, and may in the future continue to use, derivative financial instruments as one tool to manage our interest rate sensitivity, including in our mortgage lending program, while continuing to meet the credit and deposit needs of our customers. For further details on the derivatives we currently use, see Note 8. Derivative Instruments in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 

We may also enter into interest rate swaps to facilitate customer transactions and meet their financing needs. These swaps qualify as derivatives, even though they are not designated as hedging instruments. 

Liquidity Risk Management . The purpose of liquidity risk management is to ensure that there are sufficient cash flows to satisfy loan demand, deposit withdrawals, and our other needs. Traditional sources of liquidity for a bank include asset maturities and growth in core deposits. A bank may achieve its desired liquidity objectives from the management of its assets and liabilities and by internally generated funding through its operations. Funds invested in marketable instruments that can be readily sold and the continuous maturing of other earning assets are sources of liquidity from an asset perspective. The liability base provides sources of liquidity through attraction of increased deposits and borrowing funds from various other institutions. 

To assist in determining the adequacy of our liquidity, we perform a variety of liquidity stress tests including idiosyncratic, systemic and combined scenarios for both moderate and severe events. Liquidity is defined as the ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities. Liquidity management involves maintaining our ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of our customers, both depositors and borrowers. We seek to maintain a sufficiently liquid asset balance to ensure our ability to meet our obligations. The amount of the appropriate minimum liquid asset balance is determined through severe liquidity stress testing as measured by our liquidity coverage ratio calculation. At September 30, 2022, we were in compliance with our liquidity coverage ratio. 

Changes in interest rates also affect our liquidity position. We currently price deposits in response to market rates, and our management intends to continue this policy. If deposits are not priced in response to market rates, a loss of deposits could occur which would negatively affect our liquidity position. 

Scheduled loan payments are a relatively stable source of funds, but loan payoffs and deposit flows fluctuate significantly, being influenced by interest rates, general economic conditions and competition. Additionally, debt security investments are subject to prepayment and call provisions that could accelerate their payoff prior to stated maturity. We attempt to price our deposit products to meet our asset/liability objectives consistent with local market conditions. Our ALCO is responsible for monitoring our ongoing liquidity needs. Our regulators also monitor our liquidity and capital resources on a periodic basis. 

As noted previously, Pinnacle Bank is a member of the FHLB Cincinnati and, pursuant to a borrowing agreement with the FHLB Cincinnati, has pledged certain assets pursuant to a blanket lien. As such, Pinnacle Bank may use the FHLB Cincinnati as a source of 

liquidity depending on the firm's ALCO strategies. Additionally, we may pledge additional qualifying assets or reduce the amount of pledged assets with the FHLB Cincinnati to increase or decrease our borrowing capacity at the FHLB Cincinnati. At September 30, 2022, we believe we had an estimated $3.7 billion in additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB Cincinnati; however, incremental borrowings are made via a formal request by Pinnacle Bank and the subsequent approval by the FHLB Cincinnati. 

Pinnacle Bank also has accommodations with upstream correspondent banks for unsecured short-term advances which aggregate $155.0 million. These accommodations have various covenants related to their term and availability, and in most cases must be repaid within less than one month. There were no outstanding borrowings under these agreements at September 30, 2022, or during the three months then ended, although we test the availability of these accommodations periodically. Pinnacle Bank also had approximately $5.1 billion in available Federal Reserve discount window lines of credit at September 30, 2022. 

At September 30, 2022, excluding reciprocating time and money market deposits issued through the IntraFiNetwork, we had approximately $2.1 billion in brokered deposits. Historically, we have issued brokered certificates through several different brokerage houses based on competitive bid. During 2020, and in response to the uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we intentionally increased our levels of on-balance sheet liquidity. Core deposit growth during 2021 increased such that we were able to prepay certain wholesale maturities while maintaining an elevated level of on-balance sheet liquidity. We intend to continue to prepay and/or let mature wholesale funding as core deposit levels allow. 

Banking regulators have defined additional liquidity guidelines, through the issuance of the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Modified LCR. These regulatory guidelines became effective January 2015 with phase in over subsequent years and require these large institutions to follow prescriptive guidance in determining an absolute level of a high quality liquid asset (HQLA) buffer that must be maintained on their balance sheets in order to withstand a potential liquidity crisis event. Although Pinnacle Financial follows the principles outlined in the Interagency Policy Statement on Liquidity Risk Management, issued March 2010, to determine its HQLA buffer, Pinnacle Financial is not currently subject to these regulations. However, these formulas could eventually be imposed on smaller banks, such as Pinnacle Bank, and require an increase in the absolute level of liquidity on our balance sheet, which could result in lower net interest margins for us in future periods. 

At September 30, 2022, we had no individually significant commitments for capital expenditures. But, we believe the number of our locations, including non-branch locations, will increase over an extended period of time across our footprint, including the markets to which we have recently expanded, and that certain of our locations will be in need of required renovations. In future periods, these expansions and renovation projects may lead to additional equipment and occupancy expenses as well as related increases in salaries and benefits expense. Additionally, we expect we will continue to incur costs associated with technology improvements to enhance the infrastructure of our firm. 

Our short-term borrowings (borrowings which mature within the next fiscal year) consist primarily of securities sold under agreements to repurchase (these agreements are typically associated with comprehensive treasury management programs for our clients and provide them with short-term returns on their excess funds). 

We have certain contractual obligations as of September 30, 2022, which by their terms have a contractual maturity and termination dates subsequent to September 30, 2022. Each of these commitments is noted throughout Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis . Our management believes that we have adequate liquidity to meet all known contractual obligations and unfunded commitments, including loan commitments and reasonable borrower, depositor, and creditor requirements over the next twelve months and that we will have adequate liquidity to meet our obligations over a longer-term as well. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. &#160; At September 30, 2022, we had outstanding standby letters of credit of $333.3 million and unfunded loan commitments outstanding of $15.5 billion. Because these commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and many will expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment level does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. If needed to fund these outstanding commitments, Pinnacle Bank has the ability to liquidate federal funds sold or securities available-for-sale, or on a short-term basis to borrow and purchase federal funds from other financial institutions. 

We follow the same credit policies and underwriting practices when making these commitments as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. Each customer's creditworthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case basis and the amount of collateral obtained, if any, is based on management's credit evaluation of the customer. However, should the commitments be drawn upon and should our customers default on their resulting obligation to us, our maximum exposure to credit loss, without consideration of collateral, is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. At September 30, 2022, we had accrued reserves of $24.5 million related to expected credit losses associated with off-balance sheet commitments.
