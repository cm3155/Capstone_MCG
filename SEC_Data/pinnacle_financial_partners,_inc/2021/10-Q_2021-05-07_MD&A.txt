 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following is a discussion of our financial condition at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 and our results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. The purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about our financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from our consolidated financial statements. The following discussion and analysis should be read along with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein and the risk factors discussed in Part II, Item 1A - Risk Factors , herein as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 (Form 10-K) and the other reports we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission since we filed that Form 10-K. 

Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic 

The outbreak and spread of a novel strain of the coronavirus or, COVID-19, has created a global public health crisis that has resulted in unprecedented uncertainty, volatility and disruption in financial markets and in governmental, commercial and consumer activity in the United States and globally, including the markets that we serve. These actions included the decision by the Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee to lower the target for the federal funds rate to a range of between zero to 0.25% on March 15, 2020. This action followed a prior reduction of the targeted federal funds rate to a range of 1.0% to 1.25% on March 3, 2020. 

We have been intentional in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure strength in our balance sheet, including, initially, increases in liquidity and reserves. As a part of this intentional response, we conducted an extensive loan review and re-risk grading process in 2020. During the second quarter of 2020, we performed an in-depth review of all risk-graded loans greater than $1.0 million for which we had granted the borrower the ability to defer the payment of principal and/or interest for a period of up to 90 days following the COVID-19 outbreak. We also performed an in-depth review of all of our hotel and retail commercial real estate loans greater than $1.0 million regardless of their receipt of deferral. During the third quarter of 2020, our focus broadened to include the other segments of the portfolio that are risk rated that we did not re-risk grade during the second quarter. This extensive re-underwriting effort included our pass grade loans with exposures greater than $2.0 million and watch list, criticized or classified loans with exposures greater than $500,000. During the fourth quarter of 2020 and again in the first quarter of 2021, we performed a follow-up in-depth review of hotel loans $1.0 million and greater, all non-pass grade exposures greater than $500,000 and a comprehensive review of loans with a low pass risk grade known to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Additionally throughout 2020 and into 2021 in response to the pandemic, we have continued to adjust our business practices, including restricting employee travel, encouraging employees to work from home where possible, offering, until recently, drive-thru only service at certain of our locations with specific needs facilitated by appointment, implementing social distancing guidelines within our offices and continuing to hold regular meetings of our pandemic response team. Many of these measures remain in place due to the continued prevalence of the virus, though, in April 2021, we began re-opening our customer locations and bringing employees back into the office with a phased approach. 

On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ("CARES") Act was signed into law. It contains substantial tax and spending provisions intended to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act included the Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP"), a program designed to aid small- and medium-sized businesses, sole proprietors and other self-employed persons through federally guaranteed loans distributed through banks. These loans were intended to guarantee eight to 24 weeks of payroll and other costs to provide support to participating businesses and increase the ability of these businesses to retain workers. In addition, these loans are fully guaranteed by the SBA, carry a term of two or five years, dependent on the date originated, and a 1.0% annualized interest rate. On December 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act ("Coronavirus Relief Act") was signed into law. It contains significant additional relief programs, including the authorization of a second round of PPP. As of March 31, 2021, under the PPP, we had submitted applications and received funding of approximately $3.3 billion, of which, approximately $1.0 billion had received forgiveness as of that date. We believe that we were effective in each round of the PPP in assisting the small businesses in our markets that continue to be impacted by the pandemic. Inclusive of fees from the SBA, our yield on PPP loans during the first quarter of 2021 was 4.51%. 

As a result of the pandemic, we also implemented a short-term loan modification program to provide temporary payment relief to certain of our borrowers. This program allowed for a deferral of principal and/or interest payments for 90 days, which may have been extended for an additional 90 days, for a maximum of 180 days on a cumulative and successive basis. For borrowers requiring a longer-term modification following the short-term loan modification program, we worked with eligible borrowers to modify such loans under Section 4013 of the CARES Act. The outstanding balance at March 31, 2021 of loans which have received these Section 4013 modifications was approximately $835.1 million compared to approximately $825.6 million at December 31, 2020. 

We believe our response to the pandemic has allowed and continues to allow us to appropriately support our associates and clients and their communities. The COVID-19 pandemic along with the implementation of CECL contributed to an increased provision for credit losses in 2020 and an extended duration of economic disruption resulting from the virus could lead to increased net charge-offs and continued elevated levels of provisioning expense. We continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19, the administration, efficacy and public acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines, the effects of the CARES Act, Coronavirus Relief Act, American Relief Act and the prospects for additional fiscal stimulus programs closely; COVID-19 continues to spread throughout the United States, and cases, hospitalizations and deaths in some of our markets remain elevated and recently new variants or mutations of the virus have begun to emerge that in some cases appear to be more contagious than the original virus. Accordingly, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our operations and the operations of certain of our customers, though in the first quarter of 2021 the impact appears to be lessening as the average number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths in most of our markets have started to decline and the number of residents in our markets that have been vaccinated against the virus continues to rise; however, our ability and the ability of our customers to recover from the pandemic remains uncertain and will depend on continued reductions in the number and severity of COVID-19 cases in our markets and improvement in economic conditions in our markets, including as a result of continued government support of those individuals and businesses most adversely impacted by the virus. 

Overview 

Our diluted net income per common share for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was $1.61, compared to $0.37 for the same period in 2020. At March 31, 2021, reflecting the significant number of loans we had originated under the PPP, loans had increased to $23.1 billion, as compared to $22.4 billion at December 31, 2020, and total deposits increased to $28.3 billion at March 31, 2021 from $27.7 billion at December 31, 2020. 

Results of Operations. Our net interest income increased to $222.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to $193.6 million for the same period in the prior year, representing an increase of $29.3 million. For the three months ended March 31, 2021 when compared to the comparable period in 2020, this increase was largely the result of lower cost of funds, the impact of both interest and fees related to PPP loans and our pay down of a portion of the additional liquidity we acquired in 2020 in response to the economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as organic loan growth during the comparable periods. The net interest margin (the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets) for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was 3.02% compared to 3.28% for the same period in 2020 and reflects the impact of loans made pursuant to the PPP and our acquisition and subsequent pay down of additional on-balance sheet liquidity as noted above, the decline in short-term interest rates, declining levels of positive impact from purchase accounting and the competitive rate environments for loans and deposits in our markets. 

Our provision for credit losses was $7.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to $99.9 million for the same period in 2020. The higher level of provision expense during the three months ended March 31, 2020 was largely the result of the anticipated economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the first quarter of 2020 is primarily due to anticipated improvements in economic conditions. Also contributing to the provision expense in the first quarter of 2020 and 2021 was an increase in net charge-offs, which totaled $11.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to $10.2 million for the same period in 2020. 

At March 31, 2021, our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans, inclusive of PPP loans, was 1.22% compared to 1.27% at December 31, 2020. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses is largely the result of improvements in the macroeconomic forecasts utilized by our CECL models to estimate future credit losses. 

Noninterest income increased by $22.3 million, or 31.7%, during the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. The growth in noninterest income was in large part attributable to an increase in income from our equity method investment in BHG of $13.4 million, or 85.7%, during the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year as well as gains on mortgage loans sold, net, which increased by $5.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the favorable interest rate environment and housing markets in our markets as well as our increased number of mortgage originators in the respective periods. These increases were offset in part by a decline in wealth management revenues of $16.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to $16.6 million in the same period in the prior year as well as the recording of net gains on sales of securities during the three months ended March 31, 2020 of $463,000 with no gains being recorded during the same period in 2021. Other noninterest income, which is the result of fee revenue lines of business other than those noted above, increased during the three months ended March 31, 2021 by $5.6 million when compared to the same period in the prior year largely as a result of gains on other equity investments. 

Noninterest expense increased by $17.3 million, or 12.6%, during the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. Impacting noninterest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to the same prior year period was a $22.2 million increase in salaries and employee benefits. The change in salaries and employee benefits was the result of an increase in our associate base in the first quarter of 2021 versus the first quarter of 2020, annual merit increases as well as 

the accrual of both our cash and equity incentive plans at above-target payout during the three months ended March 31, 2021 versus an accrual at below-target payout under such plans during the same period in 2020. Also impacting noninterest expense in the first quarter of 2020 were lending related costs related to an increase in our off-balance sheet reserves. The higher level of expense related to off-balance sheet reserves is due to the effect that macroeconomic factors impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic had on our CECL models during the three months ended March 31, 2020 subsequent to the implementation of CECL effective January 1, 2020. No such additional expense was booked in the first quarter of 2021. 

Our efficiency ratio (the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income) was 49.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to 52.0% for the same period in 2020. The efficiency ratio measures the amount of expense that is incurred to generate a dollar of revenue. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2021, we recorded income tax expense of $28.2 million compared to an income tax benefit of $1.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was 18.4% compared to a benefit of 6.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2020. Our tax expense in the first three months of 2020 was impacted by the increased provision for credit losses we recorded during that quarter as discussed above, a portion of which was recorded as a discrete item of total income tax in the first quarter of 2020 and contributed a tax benefit of $22.4 million. Our tax rate in each period was also impacted by the vesting and exercise of equity-based awards previously granted under our equity-based compensation program, resulting in the recognition of tax benefits of $1.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to tax benefits of $862,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2020. 

Financial Condition. &#160; Net loans increased $662.2 million, or 3.0%, during the three months ended March 31, 2021, when compared to December 31, 2020. Contributing to increased loan volumes during the three months ended March 31, 2021, were approximately $424.5 million of loans issued through the SBA's PPP, net of forgiveness. The remainder of the increase is primarily the result of loans made to borrowers that principally operate or are located in our core markets, increases in the number of relationship advisors we employ and continued focus on attracting new customers to our company. Total deposits were $28.3 billion at March 31, 2021, compared to $27.7 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $587.4 million, or 2.1%. Deposit growth during the period was likely aided by our clients' continued desire to build liquidity to support their businesses through the COVID-19 pandemic, proceeds from the PPP and other government stimulus programs and current stock market conditions, but was also due in part to our intentional emphasis on gathering low-cost core deposits during both periods. 

Capital and Liquidity. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, our capital ratios, including our bank's capital ratios, exceeded regulatory minimum capital requirements and those necessary to be considered well-capitalized under applicable federal regulations. See Note 10. Regulatory Matters in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our capital ratios. From time to time we may be required to support the capital needs of our bank (Pinnacle Bank). At March 31, 2021, we had approximately $296.8 million of cash at the parent company that could be used to support our bank. 

During the second quarter of 2020, we issued 9.0 million depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of our 6.75% fixed rate non-cumulative, perpetual preferred stock, Series B (Series B Preferred Stock) in a registered public offering to both retail and institutional investors. Net proceeds from the transaction after underwriting discounts and offering expenses payable by us were approximately $217.1 million. The net proceeds were retained at Pinnacle Financial and the remaining portion thereof is available to support our capital needs and other obligations, including payments related to our outstanding indebtedness, to support the capital needs and other obligations of our bank and for other general corporate purposes. Additionally, we believe we have various capital raising techniques available to us to provide for the capital needs of our company and bank, such as a subordinated debt offering or entering into a new revolving credit facility with another financial institution. We also periodically evaluate capital markets conditions to identify opportunities to access those markets if necessary or prudent to support our capital levels. 

During the quarter ended March 31, 2020, we repurchased approximately 1.0 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $50.8 million under our previously authorized share repurchase agreement. Our last purchase of shares of our common stock under the prior share repurchase program occurred on March 19, 2020, as we suspended the program due to uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and it remained suspended until its expiration on December 31, 2020. On January 19, 2021, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $125.0 million of our outstanding common stock. The authorization for this program will remain in effect through March 31, 2022. We did not repurchase any shares under our current share repurchase program during the three months ended March 31, 2021. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The accounting principles we follow and our methods of applying these principles conform with U.S. GAAP and with general practices within the banking industry. On January 1, 2020, we adopted FASB ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) which significantly changes our methodology for determining our allowance for credit losses, and ASU 2017-04 , Intangibles &#8211; Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment which simplifies our process for performing goodwill impairment testing. There have been no other significant changes to our Critical Accounting Estimates as described in our Form 10-K.

Results of Operations 

Net Interest Income. Net interest income represents the amount by which interest earned on various earning assets exceeds interest paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities and is the most significant component of our revenues. Net interest income totaled $222.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to $193.6 million for the same period in the prior year, representing an increase of $29.3 million. For the three months ended March 31, 2021 when compared to the comparable period in 

2020, this increase was largely the result of lower cost of funds, the impact of both interest and fees related to the PPP and our pay down of a portion of the additional liquidity we acquired in 2020 in response to the economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as organic loan growth during the comparable periods offset in part by yield compression in our earning asset portfolio. 

The following tables set forth the amount of our average balances, interest income or interest expense for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the average interest rate for interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, net interest spread and net interest margin for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands):

The tax-exempt benefit has been reduced by the projected impact of tax-exempt income that will be disallowed pursuant to IRS Regulations as of and for the period presented. 

(3) Yields realized on interest-bearing assets less the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The net interest spread calculation excludes the impact of demand deposits. Had the impact of demand deposits been included, the net interest spread for the three months ended March 31, 2021 would have been 3.00% compared to a net interest spread of 3.22% for the three months ended March 31, 2020. 

(4) Net interest margin is the result of annualized net interest income calculated on a tax-equivalent basis divided by average interest-earning assets for the period. 

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, our net interest margin was 3.02% compared to 3.28% for the same period in 2020. Our net interest margin for the three months ended March 31, 2021 reflects the impact of loans made pursuant to the PPP and our acquisition and subsequent pay down of additional on-balance sheet liquidity as noted above, the continued historically low levels for short-term interest rates, declining levels of positive impact from purchase accounting and the competitive rate environments for loans and deposits in our markets. More specifically, our net interest margin was negatively impacted by yield compression in our earning asset portfolio due to a declining macroeconomic interest rate environment, which included a 150 basis points reduction in the federal funds rate in March 2020. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, our earning asset yield decreased by 100 basis points from the same period in the prior year. Our total funding rates decreased by 79 basis points compared to the same period in the prior year. 

We continue to deploy various asset liability management strategies to manage our risk to interest rate fluctuations. Pricing for creditworthy borrowers and meaningful depositors is very competitive in our markets and this competition has adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our margins. We believe this challenging competitive environment will continue throughout 2021, even during a time of economic uncertainty due to COVID-19. Our strategy of adding additional on-balance sheet liquidity to aid in managing through the early uncertainties of COVID-19, as well as the meaningful increase in core deposit inflows we experienced in 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 has and will continue to negatively impact the net interest margin until on-balance sheet liquidity returns to more normalized levels. 

Provision for Credit Losses. The provision for credit losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish an allowance for credit losses that, in management's evaluation, is adequate to provide coverage for all expected credit losses. The provision for credit losses amounted to $7.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to $99.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. Provision expense is impacted by growth in our loan portfolio, recent historical and projected future economic conditions, our internal assessment of the credit quality of the loan portfolio, and net charge-offs. The higher provision expense during the first quarter of 2020 as compared to the first quarter of 2021 was the result of the anticipated economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast to the deterioration in the economic outlook that occurred during the first quarter of 2020, projected economic conditions improved during the first quarter of 2021 resulting in the decrease in provision expense. Also contributing to provision expense in both periods are net charge-offs, which totaled $11.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to $10.2 million for the same period in 2020. 

Noninterest Income. &#160; Our noninterest income is composed of several components, some of which vary significantly between quarterly and annual periods. Service charges on deposit accounts and other noninterest income generally reflect customer growth trends, while fees from our wealth management departments, gains on mortgage loans sold, gains and losses on the sale of securities and gains or losses related to our efforts to mitigate risks associated with interest rate volatility will often reflect financial market conditions and fluctuate from period to period. 

The following is a summary of our noninterest income for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands): 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 - 2020 &#160; 2021 2020 Increase (Decrease) Noninterest income: &#160; &#160; &#160; Service charges on deposit accounts $ 8,307 $ 9,032 (8.0)% Investment services 8,191 9,239 (11.3)% Insurance sales commissions 3,225 3,240 (0.5)% Gains on mortgage loans sold, net 13,666 8,583 59.2% Investment gains on sales of securities, net &#8212; 463 (100.0)% Trust fees 4,687 4,170 12.4% Income from equity method investment 28,950 15,592 85.7% Other noninterest income: Interchange and other consumer fees 12,592 9,969 26.3% Bank-owned life insurance 4,726 4,652 1.6% Loan swap fees 903 2,187 (58.7)% SBA loan sales 1,855 1,341 38.3% Gains (losses) on other equity investments 3,440 (174) &#62; 100% Other noninterest income 2,167 2,083 4.0% Total other noninterest income 25,683 20,058 28.0% Total noninterest income $ 92,709 $ 70,377 31.7% 

The decrease in service charges on deposit accounts in the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020 relates to a decline in analysis fees, including fee waivers, due to the low transaction volumes in commercial checking accounts which we believe is related to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Income from our wealth management groups (investments, insurance and trust) is also included in noninterest income. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, commissions and fees from investment services at our financial advisory unit, Pinnacle Asset Management, a division of Pinnacle Bank, and fees from our wealth advisory group, PNFP Capital Markets, Inc., decreased by $1.0 million to $8.2 million when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. At March 31, 2021 and 2020, Pinnacle Asset Management was receiving commissions and fees in connection with approximately $6.0 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively, in brokerage assets. These fees increased $1.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021 when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020 and were offset by a decline in investment advisory fees from PNFP Capital Markets, Inc. which decreased $2.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. Revenues from the sale of insurance products by our insurance subsidiaries for the three months ended March 31, 2021 decreased by $15,000 compared to the same period in the prior year. Included in insurance revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was $918,000 of contingent income received in the first quarter of 2021 that was based on 2020 sales production and claims experience compared to $1.1 million recorded in the same period in the prior year. Additionally, at March 31, 2021, our trust department was receiving fees on approximately $3.4 billion of managed assets compared to $2.7 billion at March 31, 2020, reflecting organic growth and increased market valuations. We believe the change in our wealth management businesses during the three months ended March 31, 2021 when compared to the comparable period in 2020 is primarily attributable to market volatility resulting from the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and its ongoing impact. 

Gains on mortgage loans sold, net, consists of fees from the origination and sale of mortgage loans. These mortgage fees are for loans primarily originated in our current markets that are subsequently sold to third-party investors. Substantially all of these loan sales transfer servicing rights to the buyer. Generally, mortgage origination fees increase in lower interest rate environments and more robust housing markets and decrease in rising interest rate environments and more challenging housing markets. Mortgage origination fees will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as the rate environment changes. Gains on mortgage loans sold, net, were $13.7 million, for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to $8.6 million for the same period in the prior year. This sizeable increase is the direct result of the current interest rate environment and the strong markets in which we operate. We hedge a portion of our mortgage pipeline as part of a mandatory delivery program. The hedge is not designated as a hedge for GAAP purposes and, as such, changes in its fair value are recorded directly through the income statement. There is a positive correlation between the dollar amount of the mortgage pipeline and the value of this hedge. Therefore, the change in the outstanding mortgage pipeline at the end of any reporting period will directly impact the amount of gain recorded for mortgage loans held for sale during that reporting period. At March 31, 2021, the mortgage pipeline included $264.3 million in loans expected to close in 2021 compared to $288.6 million in loans at March 31, 2020 expected to close in 2020. 

Investment gains and losses on sales, net represent the net gains and losses on sales of investment securities in our available-for-sale securities portfolio during the periods noted. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, no securities were sold for gains or losses compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020, when we sold approximately $30.2 million of securities for a net gain of $463,000. 

Income from equity-method investment. Income from equity-method investment is comprised solely of income from our 49% equity-method investment in BHG. BHG is engaged in the origination of commercial and consumer loans primarily to healthcare providers and other professionals throughout the United States. The loans originated by BHG are either financed by secured borrowings or sold without recourse to independent financial institutions and investors. BHG has expanded its operations to include commercial lending to other professional service firms such as attorneys, accountants and others. 

Income from this equity-method investment was $29.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to $15.6 million for the same period last year. Historically, BHG has sold the majority of the loans its originates to a network of bank purchasers through a combination of online auctions, direct sales and its direct purchase option. In the second half of 2019, BHG began retaining more loans on its balance sheet than historically had been the case in recent years. As a result of the economic disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, BHG, throughout 2020 and through the first quarter of 2021, sold more loans through its auction platform than we had previously anticipated and will likely continue to slow its transition to holding more loans on its balance sheet as the effects of COVID-19 are monitored. In the third quarter of 2020, BHG completed its first securitization of approximately $160 million in notes backed by commercial and consumer loans on its balance sheet to provide additional funding. 

Income from equity-method investment is recorded net of amortization expense associated with customer lists and other intangible assets of $188,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to $293,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2020. At March 31, 2021, there wer e $7.4 million of th ese intangible assets that are expected to be amortized in lesser amounts over the next 14 years. Also included in income from equity-method investment is accretion income associated with the fair valuation of certain of BHG's liabilities of $452,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to $564,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2020. At March 31, 2021, there were $2.2 million of these liabilities that are expected to accrete into income in lesser amounts over the next five years. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2021, Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank received $10.0 million in dividends from BHG in the aggregate. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank received dividends of $8.0 million in the aggregate. Dividends from BHG during such periods reduced the carrying amount of our investment in BHG, while earnings from BHG during such periods increased the carrying amount of our investment in BHG. Profits from intercompany transactions are eliminated. Our proportionate share of earnings from BHG is included in our consolidated tax return. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, Pinnacle Bank purchased $74.6 million in loans from BHG at par pursuant to BHG's joint venture loan program whereby BHG and Pinnacle share proportionately in the credit risk of the acquired loans based on the rate on the loan and the rate of the purchase. The yield on this portfolio to Pinnacle Bank is anticipated to be 4.75% per annum. No loans were purchased from BHG by Pinnacle Bank for the three months ended March 31, 2020. 

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, BHG reported $157.6 million in revenues, net of substitution losses of $28.6 million, compared to revenues of $97.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, net of substitution losses of $16.3 million. Earnings from BHG are likely to fluctuate from period-to-period. Approximately $116.0 million of BHG's revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2021 related to gains on the sale of commercial loans compared to $69.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. These loans have typically been sold by BHG with no recourse to a network of community banks and other financial institutions at a premium to the par value of the loan. The purchaser may access a BHG cash reserve account of up to 3% of the loan balance to support loan payments. BHG retains no servicing or other responsibilities related to the core product loan once sold. As a result, this gain on sale premium represents BHG's compensation for absorbing the costs to originate the loan as well as marketing expenses associated with maintaining its business model. At March 31, 2021 and 2020, there were $3.9 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, of these loans previously sold by BHG that were being actively serviced by BHG's network of bank purchasers. BHG, at its sole option, may also provide purchasers of these loans the ability to substitute the acquired loan with another more recently-issued BHG loan should the previously-acquired loan become at least 90-days past due as to its monthly payments. As a result, BHG maintained a liability as of March 31, 2021 and 2020 of $296.0 million and $179.0 million, respectively, that represents an estimate of the future inherent losses for the outstanding core portfolio that may be subject to future substitution due to payment default or loan prepayment. This liability represents 7.6% and 6.4%, respectively, of core product loans previously sold by BHG that remain outstanding as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in this liability in the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the period ended March 31, 2020 was principally the result of the economic disruption associated with the COVID-19 pandemic which adversely impacted physician and dental practices in a material manner. 

In addition to these loans that BHG sells into its auction market, at March 31, 2021, BHG reported loans that remained on BHG's balance sheet totaling $1.3 billion compared to $735.2 million as of March 31, 2020. A portion of these loans do not qualify for sale accounting and accordingly an offsetting secured borrowing liability has been recorded. At March 31, 2021 and 2020, BHG had $785.6 million and $361.8 million, respectively, of secured borrowings associated with loans held for investment which did not qualify for sale accounting. At March 31, 2021 and 2020, BHG reported allowance for loan losses totaling $24.7 million and $9.2 million, respectively. Interest income and fees amounted to $34.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to $24.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. 

Included in our other noninterest income are interchange and other consumer fees, gains from bank-owned life insurance, swap fees earned for the facilitation of derivative transactions for our clients, SBA loan sales, gains or losses on other equity investments and other noninterest income items. Interchange revenues increased during the three months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 due to increased debit and credit card transactions period-over-period and unused line fees during the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020. Other noninterest income included changes in the cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance which was $4.7 million for each of the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. The assets that support these policies are administered by the life insurance carriers and the income we recognize (i.e., increases or decreases in the cash surrender value of the policies) on these policies is dependent upon the crediting rates applied by the insurance carriers, which are subject to change at the discretion of the carriers, subject to any applicable floors. Earnings on these policies generally are not taxable. Loan swap fees decreased by $1.3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 due primarily to a change in the volume of activity resulting from the current interest rate environment. SBA loan sales are also included in other noninterest income and fluctuate based on the current market environment. Additionally, the carrying values of other equity investments are adjusted either upwards or downwards from the transaction price to reflect expected exit values as evidenced by financing and sale transactions with third parties, or when determination of a valuation adjustment is confirmed through ongoing 

reviews by senior investment managers. Income related to these investments increased $3.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021 when compared to the same period in the prior year. The other components of other noninterest income increased only slightly during the three months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 and includes all other noninterest income not included in the above noted categories. 

Noninterest Expense. &#160; Noninterest expense consists of salaries and employee benefits, equipment and occupancy expenses, other real estate expenses, and other operating expenses. The following is a summary of our noninterest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands): 

&#160; Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 - 2020 &#160; 2021 2020 Increase (Decrease) Noninterest expense: &#160; &#160; &#160; Salaries and employee benefits: &#160; &#160; &#160; Salaries $ 57,589 $ 52,176 10.4% Commissions 4,723 3,983 18.6% Cash and equity incentives 23,642 10,280 130.0% Employee benefits and other 16,774 14,041 19.5% Total salaries and employee benefits 102,728 80,480 27.6% Equipment and occupancy 23,220 20,978 10.7% Other real estate expense, net (13) 2,415 (100.5%) Marketing and other business development 2,349 3,251 (27.7%) Postage and supplies 1,806 1,990 (9.2%) Amortization of intangibles 2,206 2,520 (12.5%) Other noninterest expense: Deposit related expense 6,804 5,238 29.9% Lending related expense 7,782 12,068 (35.5%) Wealth management related expense 435 558 (22.0%) Other noninterest expense 7,379 7,851 (6.0%) Total other noninterest expense 22,400 25,715 (12.9%) Total noninterest expense $ 154,696 $ 137,349 12.6% 

Total salaries and employee benefits expenses increased $22.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. The change in salaries and employee benefits was the result of an increase in our associate base in 2021 versus 2020, annual merit raises as well as the accrual of our cash incentive plan at above-target payout during the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to an accrual at below-target payout due to the effects of COVID-19 on our anticipated earnings and performance during the three months ended March 31, 2020. At March 31, 2021, our associate base was 2,621.0 full-time equivalent associates as compared to 2,562.0 at March 31, 2020. We expect salary and benefit expenses will rise in 2021 compared to 2020 as we continue our focus on hiring experienced bankers in all of our markets, particularly if we continue to accrue cash and equity incentives at above-target payout based on anticipated earnings and performance in 2021. 

We believe that cash and equity incentives are a valuable tool in motivating an associate base that is focused on providing our clients effective financial advice and increasing shareholder value. As a result, and unlike many other financial institutions, all of our bank's non-commissioned associates participate in our annual cash incentive plan with a minimum targeted bonus equal to 10% of each associate's annual salary, and all of our bank's associates participate in our equity compensation plans. Under the 2021 annual cash incentive plan, the targeted level of incentive payments requires achievement of a certain soundness threshold and a targeted level of quarterly pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) and annual earnings per share (subject to certain adjustments). To the extent that the soundness threshold is met and PPNR and earnings per share are above or below the targeted amount, the aggregate incentive payments are increased or decreased. Historically, we have paid between 0% and 125% of our targeted incentives. For 2021, maximum payouts under the plan could reach 160% of target. Through the first quarter of 2021, we have accrued incentive costs for the cash incentive plan in 2021 at greater than 100% of our targeted awards. 

Also included in employee benefits and other expense for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were approximately $5.4 million of compensation expenses related to equity-based awards for restricted shares, restricted stock unit and performance stock unit awards, compared to $5.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. Under our equity incentive plans, we provide a broad-based equity incentive program for all of our bank's associates. We believe that equity incentives provide a vehicle for all associates to 

become meaningful shareholders of Pinnacle Financial over an extended period of time and create a shareholder-centric culture throughout our organization. Our compensation expense associated with equity awards for the three months ended March 31, 2021 changed only modestly when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. Our compensation expense associated with equity awards with time-based vesting criteria is likely to continue to increase during the remainder of 2021 when compared to 2020 as a result of the increased number of associates and our intention to hire additional experienced financial advisors. Compensation expense associated with our performance-based vesting awards will continue to be impacted by our performance in 2021 and will likely be higher than the comparable prior year period during the remainder of 2021 as beginning in the second quarter of 2020 and for the remainder of the year we accrued for those awards at below-target levels. 

Employee benefits and other expenses were $16.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to $14.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and include costs associated with our 401k plan, health insurance and payroll taxes. These costs fluctuate based on changes in our associate base and the level of participation in these programs by our associates. Costs associated with our health insurance and 401k plan programs increased $2.0 million in the aggregate during the three months ended March 31, 2021 when compared to the same period in 2020. 

Equipment and occupancy expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were $23.2 million compared to $21.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. These costs were generally consistent between periods though we expect to incur additional costs in future periods as we continue to enhance both our current locations and our technology infrastructure. During the first quarter of 2021, a single new office location was opened in the North Carolina market. 

Other real estate income and expenses, net, for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were benefits of $13,000 as compared to expenses of $2.4 million for the same period in the prior year. Included in the quarter ended March 31, 2020 were writedowns of previously foreclosed upon properties to market value based on updated appraisals obtained during that same time period. 

Marketing and business development expense for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was $2.3 million compared to $3.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The primary source of the decrease for the three months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 continues to be the result of limited in-person client meetings and business development expenses as a result of the restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Intangible amortization expense was $2.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to $2.5 million for the same period in 2020. The following table outlines our amortizing intangible assets, their initial valuation and amortizable lives at March 31, 2021: 

&#160; Year acquired Initial Valuation &#160;(in millions) Amortizable Life (in years) Remaining Value (in millions) Core Deposit Intangible: &#160; &#160; &#160; CapitalMark 2015 $ 6.2 7 $ 0.2 Magna Bank 2015 3.2 6 0.1 Avenue 2016 8.8 9 2.0 BNC 2017 48.1 10 24.1 Book of Business Intangible: &#160; &#160; &#160; Miller Loughry Beach Insurance 2008 $ 1.3 20 $ 0.2 CapitalMark 2015 0.3 16 0.1 BNC Insurance 2017 0.4 20 0.3 BNC Trust 2017 1.9 10 1.2 Advocate Capital 2019 13.6 13 9.8 

These assets are being amortized on an accelerated basis which reflects the anticipated life of the underlying assets. Amortization expense of these intangibles is estimated to decrease from $8.1 million to $4.7 million per year over the next five years with lesser amounts for the remaining amortization period. 

Other noninterest expenses, which consists primarily of deposit, lending, wealth management and administrative expenses decreased by $3.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. Deposit related expense increased by $1.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021 when compared to the same period in 2020 largely the result of increased FDIC assessment costs primarily due to the firm's increased asset base. Lending-related expenses decreased $4.3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021 when compared to the same period in 2020. This decrease is primarily the result of the effect that macroeconomic factors impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic had on our CECL models during 

the three months ended March 31, 2020 following the implementation of CECL effective January 1, 2020. As a result of improving economic conditions, we did not build additional reserves during the three months ended March 31, 2021. Wealth management related expenses and other noninterest expenses each remained relatively flat for the three months ended March 31, 2021 when compared to the same period in 2020. 

Our efficiency ratio (the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income) was 49.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to 52.0% for the same period in 2020. The efficiency ratio measures the amount of expense that is incurred to generate a dollar of revenue. The efficiency ratio for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 was impacted in part by increased noninterest expense during the period as a result increased salaries and employee benefits as a result of accrual of our cash and equity incentives at above target levels during the quarter, gains on mortgage loans sold and income from our equity method investment in BHG. 

Income Taxes. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, we recorded income tax expense of $28.2 million compared to an income tax benefit of $1.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was 18.4% compared to a benefit of 6.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2020. Our effective tax rate differs from the combined federal and state income tax statutory rate in effect of 26.14% primarily due to our investments in bank-qualified municipal securities, tax benefits from our real estate investment trust subsidiary, participation in Tennessee's Community Investment Tax Credit (CITC) program, tax benefits associated with share-based compensation, bank-owned life insurance and our captive insurance subsidiary, offset in part by the limitation on deductibility of meals and entertainment expense, non-deductible FDIC insurance premiums and non-deductible executive compensation. Our tax expense in the three months ended March 31, 2020 was impacted by the provision expense recorded in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which was recorded in the first quarter of 2020 as a discrete item of total income tax and contributed a tax benefit of $22.4 million. Our tax rate in each period was also impacted by the vesting and exercise of equity-based awards previously granted under our equity-based compensation program, resulting in the recognition of tax benefits of $1.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to tax benefits of $862,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2020. 

Financial Condition 

Our consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2021 reflects an increase in total loans outstanding to $23.1 billion compared to $22.4 billion at December 31, 2020. Total deposits increased by $587.4 million between December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021. Total assets were $35.3 billion at March 31, 2021 compared to $34.9 billion at December 31, 2020. 

Loans. The composition of loans at March 31, 2021 and at December 31, 2020 and the percentage (%) of each classification to total loans are summarized as follows (in thousands): &#160; March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 &#160; Amount Percent Amount Percent Commercial real estate: Owner-occupied $ 2,869,785 12.5 % $ 2,802,227 12.5 % Non-owner occupied 5,573,181 24.1 % 5,203,384 23.2 % Consumer real estate &#8211; mortgage 3,086,916 13.4 % 3,099,172 13.8 % Construction and land development 2,568,969 11.1 % 2,901,746 12.9 % Commercial and industrial 8,576,528 37.1 % 8,038,457 35.9 % Consumer and other 411,322 1.8 % 379,515 1.7 % Total loans $ 23,086,701 100.0 % 1 $ 22,424,501 100.0 % 

At March 31, 2021, our loan portfolio composition had changed modestly from the composition at December 31, 2020 principally as a result of the PPP loans, which are classified as commercial and industrial loans, though commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending generally continue to make up the largest segments of our portfolio. At March 31, 2021, approximately 34.0% of the outstanding principal balance of our commercial real estate loans was secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate properties, compared to 35.0% at December 31, 2020. Owner-occupied commercial real estate is similar in many ways to our commercial and industrial lending in that these loans are generally made to businesses on the basis of the cash flows of the business rather than on the valuation of the real estate. Additionally, the construction and land development loan segment continues to be a meaningful portion of our portfolio and reflects the development and growth of the local communities in which we operate and is diversified between commercial, residential and land. 

Banking regulations have established guidelines for the construction ratio of less than 100% of total risk-based capital and for the non-owner occupied ratio of less than 300% of total risk-based capital. Should a bank&#8217;s ratios be in excess of these guidelines, banking 

regulations generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management. Both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by Pinnacle Bank&#8217;s total risk-based capital. At March 31, 2021, Pinnacle Bank&#8217;s construction and land development loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital was 76.0% compared to 89.0% at December 31, 2020. Construction and land development, non-owner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital were 256.0% and 264.0% as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. At March 31, 2021, Pinnacle Bank was within the 100% and 300% guidelines and has established what it believes to be appropriate controls to monitor its lending in these areas as it aims to keep the level of these loans to below the 100% and 300% thresholds. 

The following table classifies our fixed and variable rate loans at March 31, 2021 according to contractual maturities of (1) one year or less, (2) after one year through five years, and (3) after five years. The table also classifies our variable rate loans pursuant to the contractual repricing dates of the underlying loans (in thousands):

Loans in Past Due Status. &#160; The following table is a summary of our loans that were past due at least 30 days but less than 89 days and 90 days or more past due as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 (in thousands): 

&#160; March 31, December 31, Loans past due 30 to 89 days: 2021 2020 Commercial real estate: Owner occupied $ 1,975 $ 3,606 Non-owner occupied 1,714 6,946 Consumer real estate &#8211; mortgage 6,093 9,187 Construction and land development 137 696 Commercial and industrial 13,808 26,079 Consumer and other 1,020 1,088 Total loans past due 30 to 89 days $ 24,747 $ 47,602 Loans past due 90 days or more: &#160; Commercial real estate: Owner occupied $ 2,957 $ 1,860 Non-owner occupied 2,526 3,861 Consumer real estate &#8211; mortgage 5,816 6,274 Construction and land development 383 736 Commercial and industrial 4,377 4,408 Consumer and other 342 304 Total loans past due 90 days or more $ 16,401 $ 17,443 Ratios: &#160; Loans past due 30 to 89 days as a percentage of total loans 0.11 % 0.21 % Loans past due 90 days or more as a percentage of total loans 0.07 % 0.08 % Total loans in past due status as a percentage of total loans 0.18 % 0.29 % 

Potential Problem Loans. Potential problem loans, which are not included in nonperforming assets, amounted to approximately $160.8 million, or 0.7% of total loans at March 31, 2021, compared to $173.5 million, or 0.8% of total loans at December 31, 2020. Potential problem loans represent those loans with a well-defined weakness and where information about possible credit problems of borrowers has caused management to have doubts about the borrower's ability to comply with present repayment terms. This definition is believed to be substantially consistent with the standards established by Pinnacle Bank's primary regulators, for loans classified as substandard, excluding the impact of substandard nonaccrual loans and substandard troubled debt restructurings. Troubled debt restructurings are not included in potential problem loans. Approximately $6.5 million of potential problem loans were past due at least 30 days but less than 90 days as of March 31, 2021. 

Nonperforming Assets and Troubled Debt Restructurings. At March 31, 2021, we had $82.8 million in nonperforming assets compared to $86.2 million at December 31, 2020. Included in nonperforming assets were $72.1 million in nonaccrual loans and $10.7 million in OREO and other nonperforming assets at March 31, 2021 and $73.8 million in nonaccrual loans and $12.4 million in OREO and other nonperforming assets at December 31, 2020. At both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, there were $2.5 million of troubled debt restructurings, all of which were accruing as of the restructured date and remain on accrual status. 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact to its customers, Pinnacle Bank implemented a short-term modification program in accordance with interagency regulatory guidance to provide temporary payment relief to those borrowers directly impacted by COVID-19 who were not more than 30 days past due at the time of modification. This program allows for a deferral of payments of principal and/or interest for 90 days, which Pinnacle Bank may extend for an additional 90 days, for a maximum of 180 days on a cumulative and successive basis. Pursuant to the interagency regulatory guidance, Pinnacle Financial may elect to not classify loans for which these deferrals were granted as TDRs. 

In addition to the short-term modification program implemented by Pinnacle Bank, as discussed above, Section 4013 of the CARES Act and bank regulatory interagency guidance gave entities temporary relief from the accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs indicating that a lender could conclude that the modifications are not a troubled debt restructuring if the borrower was less than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019. We have followed the guidance under the CARES Act and the interagency guidance related to these loan modifications. At March 31, 2021, we had approximately $835.1 million in loans modified under Section 4013 of the CARES Act, compared to approximately $825.6 million at December 31, 2020. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans (allowance). On January 1, 2020, we adopted FASB ASU 2016-13, which introduced the current expected credit losses (CECL) methodology and required us to estimate all expected credit losses over the remaining life of our loan portfolio. Accordingly, the allowance for credit losses represents an amount that, in management's evaluation, is adequate to provide coverage for all expected future credit losses on outstanding loans. As of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, our allowance for credit losses was approximately $280.9 million and $285.1 million, respectively, which our management believes to be adequate at each of the respective dates. Our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans, inclusive of PPP loans, was 1.22% at March 31, 2021, down from 1.27% at December 31, 2020. No allowance for credit losses has been recorded for PPP loans as they are fully guaranteed by the SBA. 

The decrease in the allowance for credit losses is largely the result of the improvements in the macroeconomic forecast. Our CECL models rely largely on recent historical and projected future macroeconomic conditions to estimate future credit losses. Macroeconomic factors used in the model include the national unemployment rate, gross domestic product, the commercial real estate price index and certain U.S. Treasury interest rates. Projections of these macroeconomic factors, obtained from an independent third party, are utilized to predict quarterly rates of default. These macroeconomic factors experienced significant deterioration during the first six months of 2020, resulting in a significant increase in our allowance for credit losses during the same period. Though these factors improved during the second half of 2020 and through the first quarter of 2021, should they deteriorate in future periods our modeling may require increased levels of provision expense over those recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2021. 

Under the CECL methodology the allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics, and for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with the collectively evaluated pools, evaluations are performed on an individual basis. Losses are predicted over a period of time determined to be reasonable and supportable, and at the end of the reasonable and supportable period losses are reverted to long term historical averages. At March 31, 2021, reasonable and supportable periods of 18 months were utilized for all loan segments followed by a 12 month straight line reversion period to long term averages. 

The following table sets forth, based on management's estimate, the allocation of the allowance for credit losses to categories of loans as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 and the percentage of loans in each category to total loans (in thousands): 

&#160; March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 &#160; Amount Percent Amount Percent Commercial real estate: Owner occupied $ 22,065 12.5 % $ 23,298 12.5 % Non-owner occupied 80,519 24.1 % 79,132 23.2 % Consumer real estate - mortgage 30,199 13.4 % 33,304 13.8 % Construction and land development 37,642 11.1 % 42,408 12.9 % Commercial and industrial 101,076 37.1 % 98,423 35.9 % Consumer and other 9,380 1.8 % 8,485 1.7 % Total allowance for credit losses on loans $ 280,881 100.0 % $ 285,050 100.0 % 

The following is a summary of changes in the allowance for credit losses on loans for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the ratio of the allowance for credit losses on loans to total loans as of the end of each period (in thousands): &#160; Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 Year ended December 31, 2020 Balance at beginning of period $ 285,050 $ 94,777 Impact of adopting ASC 326 &#8212; 38,102 Provision for credit losses on loans 7,228 191,542 Charged-off loans: Commercial real estate: Owner occupied (697) (2,598) Non-owner occupied (140) (546) Consumer real estate &#8211; mortgage (371) (3,478) Construction and land development (367) &#8212; Commercial and industrial (11,749) (38,718) Consumer and other loans (950) (3,993) Total charged-off loans (14,274) (49,333) Recoveries of previously charged-off loans: Commercial real estate: Owner occupied 602 1,317 Non-owner occupied 12 911 Consumer real estate &#8211; mortgage 365 1,493 Construction and land development 37 147 Commercial and industrial 1,206 4,540 Consumer and other loans 655 1,554 Total recoveries of previously charged-off loans 2,877 9,962 Net charge-offs (11,397) (39,371) Balance at end of period $ 280,881 $ 285,050 Ratio of allowance for credit losses on loans to total loans outstanding at end of period 1.22 % 1.27 %

Pinnacle Financial's management assesses the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis. This assessment includes procedures to estimate the allowance and test the adequacy and appropriateness of the resulting balance. The level of the allowance is based upon management's evaluation of historical default and loss experience, current and projected economic conditions, asset quality trends, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers' ability to repay the loan (including the timing of future payments), the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, industry and peer bank loan quality indications and other pertinent factors, including regulatory recommendations. The allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries of amounts previously charged-off. Based upon our evaluation of the loan portfolio, we believe the allowance for credit losses to be adequate to absorb our estimate of expected future credit losses on loans outstanding at March 31, 2021. While our policies and procedures used to estimate the allowance for credit losses as well as the resultant provision for credit losses charged to operations are considered adequate by management, they are necessarily approximate 

and imprecise. There are factors beyond our control, such as conditions in the local and national economy, local real estate market or a particular industry or borrower which may negatively impact, materially, our asset quality and the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses and, thus, the resulting provision for credit losses. In particular, the length and severity of the economic disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic and the speed with which the economy will recover is difficult to predict and each may be worse than we have estimated, which could cause our provision for credit losses to be negatively impacted for the duration of the pandemic and its aftermath. We believe borrowers that operate in the restaurant, entertainment, hospitality and retail sectors, including owners of commercial real estate properties and hotels, continue to be the most likely to be negatively impacted by the economic disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, though other borrowers have been, and are likely to continue to be, negatively impacted as well. If the strict social distancing practices or safer-at-home directives that were initially implemented in response to the spread of COVID-19 were to return, these impacts could be more severe than currently anticipated. 

Investments. &#160; Our investment portfolio, consisting primarily of Federal agency bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and state and municipal securities amounted to $4.7 billion and $4.6 billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Our investment portfolio serves many purposes including serving as a stable source of income, as collateral for public funds deposits and as a potential liquidity source. A summary of our investment portfolio at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 follows: 

&#160; March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Weighted average life 6.87 years 6.51 years Effective duration* 4.79% 4.35% Tax equivalent yield 2.29% 2.28% 

(*) The metric is presented net of fair value hedges tied to certain investment portfolio holdings. The effective duration of the investment portfolio without the fair value hedges as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was 5.79% and 5.45%, respectively. 

Restricted Cash. Our restricted cash balances totaled approximately $162.8 million at March 31, 2021, compared to $223.8 million at December 31, 2020. This restricted cash is maintained at other financial institutions as collateral primarily for our derivative portfolio. The decrease in restricted cash is attributable primarily to a decrease in collateral requirements on certain derivative instruments for which the fair value has increased. See Note 8. Derivative Instruments in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 

Securities Purchased with Agreement to Resell. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, we entered into a $450.0 million repurchase agreement transaction with a financial institution counterparty. This investment deploys some of our liquidity position into an instrument that improves the return on those funds in the current low rate environment. Additionally, we believe it positions us more favorably for a potential rising interest rate environment in the future. 

Deposits and Other Borrowings. We had approximately $28.3 billion of deposits at March 31, 2021 compared to $27.7 billion at December 31, 2020. Our deposits consist of noninterest and interest-bearing demand accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and time deposits. Additionally, we routinely enter into agreements with certain customers to sell certain securities under agreements to repurchase the security the following day. These agreements (which are typically associated with comprehensive treasury management programs for our clients and provide them with short-term returns for their excess funds) amounted to $172.1 million at March 31, 2021 and $128.2 million at December 31, 2020. Additionally, at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, Pinnacle Bank had borrowed $888.1 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati (FHLB). At March 31, 2021, Pinnacle Bank had approximately $2.9 billion in additional availability with the FHLB; however, incremental borrowings are subject to applicable collateral requirements and are made in a formal request by Pinnacle Bank and the subsequent approval by the FHLB. 

Generally, we have classified our funding base as either core funding or noncore funding as shown in the table below. The following table represents the balances of our deposits and other funding and the percentage of each type to the total at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020:

(1) The reciprocating categories consists of deposits we receive from a bank network (the Promontory network) in connection with deposits of our customers in excess of our FDIC coverage limit that we place with the Promontory network. 

As noted in the table above, our core funding as a percentage of total funding increased from 79.5% at December 31, 2020 to 83.2% at March 31, 2021, primarily as a result of the significant increase in deposits estimated to have been funded, in part, by PPP loans and other government stimulus payments, and decreases in wholesale funding that was intentionally utilized to build on-balance sheet liquidity as we prepared for the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Competition for core deposits in our markets remains very competitive and we anticipate that our percentage of non-core funding is likely to increase as PPP loan funds and stimulus monies are utilized. 

When wholesale funding is necessary to complement the company's core deposit base, management determines which source is best suited to address both liquidity risk management and interest rate risk management objectives. Our Asset Liability Management Policy imposes limitations on overall wholesale funding reliance and on brokered deposit exposure specifically. Both our overall reliance on wholesale funding and exposure to brokered deposits and brokered time deposits were within those policy limitations as of March 31, 2021. 

Our funding policies impose limits on the amount of non-core funding we can utilize based on the non-core funding dependency ratio which is calculated pursuant to regulatory guidelines. Periodically, we may exceed our policy limitations, at which time management will develop plans to bring our funding sources back into compliance with our core funding ratios. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with our core funding policies. Though growing our core deposit base is a key strategic objective of our firm and we experienced meaningful growth in core deposits in the first three months of 2021, we may increase our non-core funding amounts from current levels if we need to do so to fund growth or increase levels of on-balance sheet liquidity, but we do not currently anticipate that such increases will exceed the limits we have established in our internal policies for total levels of non-core funding. 

The amount of time deposits as of March 31, 2021 amounted to $3.0 billion. The following table shows our time deposits in denominations of less than $250,000 and in denominations of $250,000 and greater by category based on time remaining until maturity and the weighted average rate for each category as of March 31, 2021 (in thousands):

Subordinated debt and other borrowings. We have established, or through acquisition acquired, twelve statutory business trusts which were established to issue 30-year trust preferred securities and certain other subordinated debt agreements. These securities qualify as Tier 2 capital subject to annual phase outs beginning five years from maturity. On April 22, 2020, we established a credit facility with the Federal Reserve Bank in conjunction with the PPP, with available borrowing capacity equal to the outstanding balance of PPP loans, which totaled approximately $2.2 billion at March 31, 2021. There are no amounts outstanding on this facility at March 31, 2021.

We presently intend to redeem the $130.0 million aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes issued by Pinnacle Bank listed in the table above later this year. We are also evaluating the redemption of the $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes issued by Pinnacle Financial listed in the table above later this year. The redemption of each tranche of subordinated notes is subject to receipt of all regulatory permissions for such redemption, which we have not yet sought, and our ultimate determination to redeem such notes. Neither Pinnacle Bank nor Pinnacle Financial is under any obligation to redeem these subordinated notes. 

Capital Resources. At March 31, 2021, our shareholders' equity amounted to $5.0 billion compared to $4.9 billion at December 31, 2020. During the second quarter of 2020, we issued 9.0 million depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of Series B Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share of Series B Preferred Stock in a registered public offering to both retail and institutional investors. Net proceeds from the transaction after underwriting discounts and offering costs were approximately $217.1 million. The net proceeds were initially retained by Pinnacle Financial and the remaining net proceeds are available to support our obligations including payments related to our outstanding indebtedness and dividend payments on the Series B preferred stock, to support the capital needs of our company and our bank, and for other general corporate purposes. For additional information regarding our capital and shareholders&#8217; equity, see Note 10. Regulatory Matters in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 

Share Repurchase Program. During the quarter ended March 31, 2020, we repurchased approximately 1.0 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $50.8 million under our previously authorized share repurchase agreement. Our last purchase of shares of our common stock under the prior share repurchase program occurred on March 19, 2020, as we suspended the program due to uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and it remained suspended until its expiration on December 31, 2020. On January 19, 2021, our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program for up to $125.0 million of our outstanding common stock. The authorization for this program will remain in effect through March 31, 2022. We purchased no shares under our current program in the first three months of 2021. 

Dividends. Pursuant to Tennessee banking law, our bank may not, without the prior consent of the TDFI, pay any dividends to us in a calendar year in excess of the total of our bank's retained net profits for that year plus the retained net profits for the preceding two years, which was $574.3 million at March 31, 2021. Our bank did not pay dividends to us during the three months ended March 31, 2021. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2021, we paid $13.9 million in dividends to our common shareholders and $3.8 million in dividends on our Series B preferred stock. On April 20, 2021, our board of directors declared a $0.18 per share quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders which should approximate $14.0 million in aggregate dividend payments that are expected to be paid on May 28, 2021 to common shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 7, 2021. Additionally, on that same day, our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of approximately $3.8 million, or $16.88 per share (or $0.422 per depositary share), on the Series B preferred stock payable on June 1, 2021 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 17, 2021. The amount and timing of all future dividend payments, if any, is subject to board discretion and will depend on our earnings, capital position, financial condition and other factors, including, if necessary, our receipt of dividends from Pinnacle Bank, regulatory capital requirements, as they become known to us and receipt of any regulatory approvals that may become required as a result of our and our bank subsidiary's financial results. 

Market and Liquidity Risk Management 

Our objective is to manage assets and liabilities to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies. Our Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) is charged with the responsibility of monitoring these policies, which are designed to ensure acceptable composition of asset/liability mix. Two critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management. 

Interest Rate Sensitivity. &#160; In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates. ALCO measures and evaluates the interest rate risk so that we can meet customer demands for various types of loans and deposits. ALCO determines the most appropriate amounts of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items. Measurements which we use to help us manage interest rate sensitivity include an earnings simulation model and an economic value of equity (EVE) model. 

Our interest rate sensitivity modeling incorporates a number of assumptions for both earnings simulation and EVE, including loan and deposit re-pricing characteristics, the rate of loan prepayments, etc. ALCO periodically reviews these assumptions for accuracy based on historical data and future expectations. Our ALCO policy requires that the base scenario assumes rates remain flat and is the scenario to which all others are compared in order to measure the change in net interest income and EVE. Policy limits are applied to the results of certain modeling scenarios. While the primary policy scenarios focus is on a twelve month time frame for the earnings simulations model, longer time horizons are also modeled. All policy scenarios assume a static volume forecast where the balance sheet is held constant, although other scenarios are modeled. 

Earnings simulation model. We believe interest rate risk is best measured by our earnings simulation modeling. Earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments are combined with forecasts of interest rates for the next 12 months and are combined with other factors in order to produce various earnings simulations over that same 12-month period. To limit interest rate risk, we have policy guidelines for our earnings at risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest income in both gradual and instantaneous changes to interest rates. For instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates from management's flat interest rate forecast over the next twelve months, assuming a static balance sheet, the following estimated changes are calculated: Estimated % Change in Net Interest Income Over 12 Months March 31, 2021* Instantaneous Rate Change 100 bps increase (1.0 %) 200 bps increase (1.2 %) 100 bps decrease (0.2 %) 

*: Negative interest rates are not contemplated in these scenarios. The Treasury curve and all short-term rate indices, such as Fed Funds, LIBOR, etc., are assumed to be zero bound. 

While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Further, the earnings simulation model does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, hedging activities we might take and changing product spreads that could mitigate any potential adverse impact of changes in interest rates. 

The behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios set out in the table above is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. The projected impact on net interest income in the table above assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternative rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher-yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce the assumed benefit of those deposits. The projected impact on net interest income in the table above also assumes a "through-the-cycle" non-maturity deposit beta which may not be an accurate predictor of actual deposit rate changes realized in scenarios of smaller and/or non-parallel interest rate movements. 

At March 31, 2021, our earnings simulation model indicated we were in compliance with our policies for interest rate scenarios for which we model as required by our board approved Asset Liability Policy. 

Economic value of equity model. While earnings simulation modeling attempts to determine the impact of a changing rate environment to our net interest income, our EVE model measures estimated changes to the economic values of our assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items as a result of interest rate changes. Economic values are determined by discounting expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, which establishes a base case EVE. We then shock rates as prescribed by our Asset Liability Policy and measure the sensitivity in EVE values for each of those shocked rate scenarios versus the base case. The Asset Liability Policy sets limits for those sensitivities. At March 31, 2021, our EVE modeling calculated the following estimated changes in EVE due to instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates: March 31, 2021* Instantaneous Rate Change 100 bps increase (5.7 %) 200 bps increase (10.5 %) 100 bps decrease (2.1 %) 

*: Negative interest rates are not contemplated in these scenarios. The Treasury curve and all short-term rate indices, such as Fed Funds, LIBOR, etc., are assumed to be zero bound. 

While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current year). Further, EVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, hedging activities we might take and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. 

At March 31, 2021, our EVE model indicated we were in compliance with our policies for all interest rate scenarios for which we model as required by our board approved Asset Liability Policy. 

Most likely earnings simulation models. We also analyze a most-likely earnings simulation scenario that projects the expected change in rates based on a forward yield curve adopted by management using expected balance sheet volumes forecasted by management. Separate growth assumptions are developed for loans, investments, deposits, etc. Other interest rate scenarios analyzed by management may include delayed rate shocks, yield curve steepening or flattening, or other variations in rate movements to further analyze or stress our balance sheet under various interest rate scenarios. Each scenario is evaluated by management. These processes assist management to better anticipate our financial results and, as a result, management may determine the need to invest in other operating strategies and tactics which might enhance results or better position the firm's balance sheet to reduce interest rate risk going forward. 

Each of the above analyses may not, on its own, be an accurate indicator of how our net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. In addition, the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgage loans, have features (generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors) which limit changes in interest rates. Prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments. The ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates. ALCO reviews each of the above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with several different interest rate scenarios as part of its responsibility to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies. 

Management's model governance, model implementation and model validation processes and controls are subject to review in our regulatory examinations to ensure they are in compliance with the most recent regulatory guidelines and industry and regulatory practices. Management utilizes a respected, sophisticated third party asset liability modeling software to help ensure implementation of management's assumptions into the model are processed as intended in a robust manner. That said, there are numerous assumptions regarding financial instrument behavior that are integrated into the model. The assumptions are formulated by combining observations gleaned from our historical studies of financial instruments and our best estimations of how, if at all, these instruments may behave in the future given changes in economic conditions, technology, etc. These assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. Additionally, given the large number of assumptions built into our asset liability modeling software, it is difficult, at best, to compare our results to other firms. 

ALCO may determine that Pinnacle Financial should over time become more or less asset or liability sensitive depending on the underlying balance sheet circumstances and our conclusions as to anticipated interest rate fluctuations in future periods. At present, ALCO has determined that its "most likely" rate scenario considers no change in short-term interest rates throughout the remainder of 2021. Our "most likely" rate forecast is based primarily on information we acquire from a service which includes a consensus forecast of numerous interest rate benchmarks. We may implement additional actions designed to achieve our desired sensitivity position which could change from time to time. 

We have in the past used, and may in the future continue to use, derivative financial instruments as one tool to manage our interest rate sensitivity, including in our mortgage lending program, while continuing to meet the credit and deposit needs of our customers. For further details on the derivatives we currently use, see Note 8. Derivative Instruments in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 

We may also enter into interest rate swaps to facilitate customer transactions and meet their financing needs. These swaps qualify as derivatives, even though they are not designated as hedging instruments. 

Liquidity Risk Management . The purpose of liquidity risk management is to ensure that there are sufficient cash flows to satisfy loan demand, deposit withdrawals, and our other needs. Traditional sources of liquidity for a bank include asset maturities and growth in core deposits. A bank may achieve its desired liquidity objectives from the management of its assets and liabilities and by internally generated funding through its operations. Funds invested in marketable instruments that can be readily sold and the continuous maturing of other earning assets are sources of liquidity from an asset perspective. The liability base provides sources of liquidity through attraction of increased deposits and borrowing funds from various other institutions. 

To assist in determining the adequacy of our liquidity, we perform a variety of liquidity stress tests including idiosyncratic, systemic and combined scenarios for both moderate and severe events. Liquidity is defined as the ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities. Liquidity management involves maintaining our ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of our customers, both depositors and borrowers. We seek to maintain a sufficiently liquid asset balance to ensure our ability to meet our obligations. The amount of the appropriate minimum liquid asset balance is determined through severe liquidity stress testing as measured by our liquidity coverage ratio calculation. At March 31, 2021, we were in compliance with our internal policies related to liquidity coverage ratio. 

Changes in interest rates also affect our liquidity position. We currently price deposits in response to market rates. If deposits are not priced in response to market rates, a loss of deposits, particularly noncore deposit, could occur which would negatively affect our liquidity position. 

Scheduled loan payments are a relatively stable source of funds, but loan payoffs and deposit flows fluctuate significantly, being influenced by interest rates, general economic conditions and competition. Additionally, debt security investments are subject to prepayment and call provisions that could accelerate their payoff prior to stated maturity. We attempt to price our deposit products to meet our asset/liability objectives consistent with local market conditions. Our ALCO is responsible for monitoring our ongoing liquidity needs. Our regulators also monitor our liquidity and capital resources on a periodic basis. 

In addition, our bank is a member of the FHLB Cincinnati. As a result, our bank receives advances from the FHLB Cincinnati, pursuant to the terms of various borrowing agreements, which support our funding needs. Under the borrowing agreements with the FHLB Cincinnati, our bank has pledged certain qualifying residential mortgage loans and, pursuant to a blanket lien, all qualifying commercial mortgage loans as collateral. As such, Pinnacle Bank may use the FHLB Cincinnati as a source of liquidity depending on its ALCO strategies. Additionally, we may pledge additional qualifying assets, reduce the amount of pledged assets or experience changes in the value of pledged assets with the FHLB Cincinnati to increase or decrease our borrowing capacity with the FHLB Cincinnati. At March 31, 2021, we estimate we had $2.9 billion in additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB Cincinnati. However, incremental borrowings are made via a formal request by Pinnacle Bank and the subsequent approval by the FHLB Cincinnati. At March 31, 2021, our bank had received advances from the FHLB Cincinnati totaling $888.1 million. At March 31, 2021, the scheduled maturities of Pinnacle Bank's FHLB Cincinnati advances and interest rates are as follows (in thousands): 

Scheduled Maturities Amount Interest Rates (1) 

2021 $ &#8212; &#8212;% 2022 &#8212; &#8212;% 2023 &#8212; &#8212;% 2024 &#8212; &#8212;% 2025 116,250 0.56% Thereafter 775,013 2.15% 891,263 Deferred costs (3,148) Total Federal Home Loan Bank advances $ 888,115 Weighted average interest rate 1.94% 

(1) Some FHLB Cincinnati advances include variable interest rates and could increase in the future. The table reflects rates in effect as of March 31, 2021. 

Pinnacle Bank also has accommodations with upstream correspondent banks available for unsecured short-term advances which aggregate $195 million. These accommodations have various covenants related to their term and availability, and in most cases must be repaid within a month of borrowing. We had no outstanding borrowings at March 31, 2021 under these agreements. Our bank also had approximately $2.9 billion in available Federal Reserve discount window lines of credit at March 31, 2021. 

At March 31, 2021, excluding reciprocating time and money market deposits issued through the Promontory Network, we had $2.6 billion of brokered deposits. Historically, we have issued brokered certificates of deposit through several different brokerage houses based on competitive bid. During 2020, and in response to the uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we intentionally increased our levels of on-balance sheet liquidity. During the first quarter of 2020, this increase was funded by a combination of increased core deposits, increased borrowings from the FHLB Cincinnati and increases in brokered time deposits. Core deposit growth during the remainder of 2020 and through the first quarter of 2021 increased such that we were able to prepay certain wholesale maturities while maintaining an elevated level of on-balance sheet liquidity. We intend to prepay and/or let mature wholesale funding as core deposit growth allows over the next few quarters. 

Banking regulators have defined additional liquidity guidelines, through the issuance of the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Modified LCR. These regulatory guidelines became effective January 2015 with phase in over subsequent years and require these large institutions to follow prescriptive guidance in determining an absolute level of a high quality liquid asset (HQLA) buffer 

that must be maintained on their balance sheets in order to withstand a potential liquidity crisis event. Although Pinnacle Financial follows the principles outlined in the Interagency Policy Statement on Liquidity Risk Management, issued March 2010, to determine its HQLA buffer, Pinnacle Financial is not currently subject to these regulations. However, these formulas could eventually be imposed on smaller banks, such as Pinnacle Bank, and require an increase in the absolute level of liquidity on our balance sheet, which could result in lower net interest margins for us in future periods. 

At March 31, 2021, we had no individually significant commitments for capital expenditures. But, we believe the number of our locations, including non-branch locations, will increase over an extended period of time across our footprint and that certain of our locations will be in need of required renovations. In future periods, these expansions and renovation projects may lead to additional equipment and occupancy expenses as well as related increases in salaries and benefits expense. Additionally, we expect we will continue to incur costs associated with technology improvements to enhance the infrastructure of our firm. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. &#160; At March 31, 2021, we had outstanding standby letters of credit of $237.7 million and unfunded loan commitments outstanding of $10.2 billion. Because these commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and many will expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment level does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. If needed to fund these outstanding commitments, Pinnacle Bank has the ability to liquidate Federal funds sold or, on a short-term basis, to borrow and purchase Federal funds from other financial institutions. 

Impact of Inflation 

The consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and practices within the banking industry which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than the effects of general levels of inflation.
