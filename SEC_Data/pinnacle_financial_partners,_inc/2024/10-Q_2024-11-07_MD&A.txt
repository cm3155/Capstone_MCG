 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following is a discussion of our financial condition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about our financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from our consolidated financial statements. The following discussion and analysis should be read along with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein and the risk factors discussed elsewhere in this report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (Form 10-K) and the other reports we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission since we filed that Form 10-K. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "Pinnacle Financial," "we," "our," or similar terms refer to Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc. and, where appropriate, its subsidiaries. 

Overview 

General. Our diluted net income per common share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $1.86 and $4.08, respectively, compared to $1.69 and $5.99, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. At September 30, 2024, loans increased to $34.3 billion as compared to $32.7 billion at December 31, 2023, and total deposits increased to $41.0 billion at September 30, 2024 from $38.5 billion at December 31, 2023. 

Results of Operations. Our net interest income increased to $351.5 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $317.2 million and $944.9 million, respectively, for the same periods in the prior year, representing an increase of $34.3 million, or 10.8%, and $56.9 million, or 6.0%, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the comparable periods in 2023, this increase was largely the result of organic loan growth and yield expansion in our earning asset portfolio. Partially offsetting these increases in net interest income were continued increases in cost of funds compared to the prior year's comparable periods. The net interest margin (the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.22% and 3.14%, respectively, compared to 3.06% and 3.22%, respectively, for the same periods in 2023 and reflects a full-quarter impact of the capital optimization initiatives and balance sheet restructuring completed in the second quarter of 2024 as well as increased average earning asset balances and the intentional focus of our relationship managers on obtaining appropriate pricing on new and renewing loans and keeping our deposit pricing contained as well as the stability of our noninterest bearing deposit balances during the quarter. 

Our provision for credit losses was $26.3 million and $90.9 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $26.8 million and $77.3 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. Provision expense is relatively flat in the comparable three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The change in provision expense for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 is primarily the result of specific reserves associated with a $38 million loan which was previously identified as a problem loan that was placed on nonaccrual in the fourth quarter of 2023. Also impacting provision expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were net charge-offs totaling $18.3 million and $57.5 million, respectively, compared to $18.1 million and $35.2 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. Negatively impacting net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2024 was the deterioration of a single commercial and industrial loan which resulted in a charge-off of $9.0 million. In addition, in the second quarter of 2024 the continued deterioration of the value of the underlying collateral of an owner-occupied commercial real estate loan resulted in a charge-off of $10.3 million. The increase in charge-offs in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 is primarily the result of the combination of the charge-off of these two loans. 

Noninterest income increased by $24.4 million, or 26.9%, and decreased by $94.5 million, or 26.7%, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. Income from our wealth management groups (investments, insurance and trust) reflect strong revenue growth increasing $6.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. Service charges on deposit accounts also reflect strong revenue growth with an increase of $3.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. Interchange and other consumer fees also positively impacted noninterest income with an increase of $1.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. Income related to bank-owned life insurance also positively impacted noninterest income during the three months ended September 30, 2024 with an increase of $4.4 million when compared to the same period in 2023 primarily attributable to restructuring activities initiated late in 2023. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2024, we recognized $1.8 million in gains on the sale of fixed assets. These increases were offset in part by a decrease in income related to our equity method investment in BHG of $8.6 million, or 34.4%, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease in noninterest income is due primarily to the intentional repositioning of a portion of our securities portfolio with the goal of meaningfully enhancing its future performance with the sale of approximately $822.7 million of available-for-sale securities at a net loss of $72.1 million. Additionally, negatively impacting noninterest income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023 was a decline in income from our equity method investment in BHG of $19.9 million, or 28.0%. Also significantly contributing to the decline in noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were gains on the sale of fixed assets of $85.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily the result of the sale-leaseback transaction which was completed in the second quarter of 2023. These declines were offset in part for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 by the recognition of a mortgage servicing asset associated with our Freddie Mac Small Business Lending (SBL) platform of approximately $11.8 million during the first quarter of 2024, which has been reflected in other noninterest income. Also positively impacting noninterest income were wealth management revenues of $83.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $69.3 million in the same period in the prior year. 

Noninterest expense increased by $46.1 million, or 21.6%, and $136.5, or 21.4%, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Impacting noninterest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same prior year periods was an increase of $29.9 million and $57.9 million, respectively, in salaries and employee benefits. The increase in salaries and employee benefits was primarily the result of an increase in our associate base to 3,516.5 full-time equivalent associates at September 30, 2024 versus 3,329.5 at September 30, 2023, as well as annual merit increases effective in January 2024 and increases in cash and equity incentive accruals due to our belief at September 30, 2024 that we were likely to achieve a payout percentage under our annual cash incentive plan in 2024 that would be higher than what we paid out under our 2023 annual cash incentive plan and under our performance-based vesting restricted stock unit awards based on estimated performance through September 30, 2024. Noninterest expense categories, other than salaries and employee benefits, were $99.1 million and $316.7 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $82.9 million and $238.1 million, respectively, during three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, increases of 19.5% and 33.0%, respectively. The three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same 2023 periods were impacted by changes in equipment and occupancy costs and lending and deposit-related expenses. Equipment and occupancy costs were $42.6 million and $123.2 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $36.9 million and $101.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and were negatively impacted by the overall growth in our infrastructure, additional locations added, new technology implemented and, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, higher levels of lease expense as a result of the execution of the sale-leaseback transaction in the second quarter of 2023. Lending-related expenses were $17.7 million and $44.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $12.5 million and $37.2 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and were negatively impacted by the loss protection fees of $2.1 million associated with the execution of a credit default swap during the second quarter of 2024. Deposit-related expenses were $15.9 million and $52.9 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $14.1 million and $36.2 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Impacting deposit-related expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a $6.8 million increase in the FDIC special assessment which was originally estimated in the fourth quarter of 2023 and was revised in 2024. Additionally impacting the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 were approximately $27.6 million in fees paid during the second quarter of 2024 to terminate an agreement to resell $500.0 million of securities we had previously purchased. 

Our efficiency ratio (the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income) was 55.6% and 61.3%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 52.3% and 49.0%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The efficiency ratio measures the amount of expense that is incurred to generate a dollar of revenue. Our efficiency ratio during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 was both positively and negatively impacted by the changes to net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense discussed above. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded income tax expense of $34.5 million and $73.6 million, respectively, compared to $35.4 million and $118.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 19.0% and 18.5%, respectively, compared to 21.1% and 20.2%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our tax rate in each period was impacted by, among other things, the vesting and exercise of equity-based awards previously granted under our equity-based compensation program. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized excess tax benefits of $131,000 and $2.6 million, respectively, in connection with the vesting and exercise of such equity-based awards compared to tax expense of $16,000 and excess tax benefits of $241,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in excess tax benefits recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was the primary reason for the decrease in the effective tax rate between periods.

Financial Condition. Loans increased $1.6 billion, or 5.0%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to December 31, 2023. The increase is primarily the result of loans made to borrowers that principally operate or are located in the markets in which we have recently entered or expanded our presence, increases in the number of relationship advisors we employ and continued focus on attracting new customers to our company. Loan growth was also positively impacted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 by the continued growth of certain specialty lending groups, including franchise lending and equipment lease financing. During 2023, we made the intentional decision to continue the tightening of our underwriting, particularly in construction and commercial real estate (CRE) investment property. We expect that to continue through the end of 2024 and our loan growth rates over such period should reflect this tightening. Total deposits were $41.0 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to $38.5 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of $2.4 billion, or 6.3%. Interest-bearing deposits grew during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, by approximately $1.3 billion, or 11.0%, from December 31, 2023, as a result of our intentional focus on gathering and retaining these deposits. 

At September 30, 2024, our allowance for credit losses was $391.5 million compared to $353.1 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in the allowance for credit losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of specific reserves associated with a $38 million loan which was previously identified as a problem loan that was placed on nonaccrual in the fourth quarter of 2023 and an overall increase in loan loss reserves due to the impact of the changing macroeconomic environment on our CECL models. Additionally, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 net charge-offs were $18.3 million and $57.5 million, respectively, compared to $18.1 million and $35.2 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. Negatively impacting net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2024 was the deterioration of a single commercial and industrial loan which resulted in a charge-off of $9.0 million. In addition, in the second quarter of 2024 the continued deterioration of the value of the underlying collateral of an owner-occupied commercial real estate loan resulted in a charge-off of $10.3 million. The increase in charge-offs in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 is primarily the result of the combination of the charge-off of these two loans. 

Capital and Liquidity. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our capital ratios, including our bank's capital ratios, exceeded regulatory minimum capital requirements and those necessary to be considered well-capitalized under applicable federal regulations. See Note 11. Regulatory Matters in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Form 10-Q) for additional information regarding our capital ratios. From time to time we may be required to support the capital needs of our bank (Pinnacle Bank). At September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $192.0 million of cash that could be used to support our bank. We believe we have various capital raising techniques available to us to provide for the capital needs of our company and bank, such as issuing subordinated debt or entering into a revolving credit facility with a financial institution. We also periodically evaluate capital markets conditions to identify opportunities to access those markets if necessary or prudent to support our capital levels. 

On January 16, 2024, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $125.0 million of our common stock which commenced upon the expiration of the previously authorized share repurchase program that expired on March 31, 2024. The new authorization is to remain in effect through March 31, 2025. We did not repurchase any shares under either share repurchase program during 2023 or the first nine months of 2024.

Results of Operations 

Net Interest Income. Net interest income represents the amount by which interest earned on various interest-earning assets exceeds interest paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities and is the most significant component of our revenues. Net interest income totaled $351.5 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $317.2 million and $944.9 million, respectively, for the same periods in the prior year, representing increases of $34.3 million, or 10.8%, and $56.9 million, or 6.0%, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the comparable periods in 2023, this increase was largely the result of organic loan growth and yield expansion in our earning asset portfolio. Partially offsetting these increases in net interest income were continued increases in cost of funds compared to the prior year's comparable periods. 

The following tables set forth the amount of our average balances, interest income or interest expense for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the average interest rate for interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, net interest spread and net interest margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in thousands):

(1) Average balances of nonperforming loans, consumer loans held-for-sale and commercial loans held-for-sale are included in the above amounts. 

(2) Yields computed on tax-exempt instruments on a tax equivalent basis and include $35.6 million of taxable equivalent income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $34.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The tax-exempt benefit has been reduced by the projected impact of tax-exempt income that will be disallowed pursuant to IRS Regulations as of and for the then current period presented. 

(3) Yields realized on interest-bearing assets less the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The net interest spread calculation excludes the impact of demand deposits. Had the impact of demand deposits been included, the net interest spread for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have been 3.00% compared to a net interest spread of 3.11% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

(4) Net interest margin is the result of annualized net interest income calculated on a tax-equivalent basis divided by average interest-earning assets for the period. 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net interest margin was 3.22% and 3.14%, respectively, compared to 3.06% and 3.22%, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. The expansion in our net interest margin during the comparable three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, is the result of continued average loan yield improvement and the impact of the restructuring of our investment securities portfolio during the second quarter of 2024. The compression in our net interest margin during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023 reflects the rise in cost of funds due to the elevated short-term interest rate environment, the competitive rate environments for deposits in our markets and increased reliance on brokered deposits and other sources of wholesale funding. The prior inversion of the yield curve, where short term interest rates rise above intermediate and long-term rates and which began easing in the third quarter of 2024 and reversed in September 2024, has also resulted in asset yields increasing at a slower pace than the cost of funds during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 relative to September 30, 2023. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our earning asset yield increased by 32 basis points and 47 basis points, respectively, from the same periods in the prior year. Conversely, our total funding rates, led by increases in interest-bearing deposits rates, increased by 18 basis points and 58 basis points, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in the prior year. 

We seek to fund increased loan volumes by growing our core deposits, but, subject to internal policy limits on the amount of wholesale funding we may maintain, will utilize wholesale funding to fund shortfalls, if any, or provide additional liquidity. To the extent that our dependence on wholesale funding sources increases, as was the case during the year ended December 31, 2023, our net interest margin would likely be negatively impacted as we may not be able to reduce the rates we pay on these deposits as quickly as we can on core deposits as rates have and may continue to decline. 

We continue to deploy various asset liability management strategies to manage our risk to interest rate fluctuations. During 2023, the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates by 100 basis points. Our &#8216;most likely&#8217; forecast for short-term rates through 2024 at the time of our most recent ALCO meeting was mostly consistent with the federal funds futures market&#8217;s expectations for rate movements at that time but there is uncertainty in the interest rate futures markets. Thus far in 2024, the Federal Reserve has reduced short-term interest rates by 50 basis points. 

Provision for Credit Losses. The provision for credit losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish an allowance for credit losses that, in management's evaluation, is adequate to provide coverage for all expected credit losses. Our provision for credit losses was $26.3 million and $90.9 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $26.8 million and $77.3 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. The provision for credit losses is impacted by growth in our loan portfolio, recent historical and projected future economic conditions, our internal assessment of the credit quality of the loan portfolio and net charge-offs. The change in provision expense for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 is primarily the result of reserves associated with a $38 million loan which was previously identified as a problem loan and was placed on nonaccrual in the fourth quarter of 2023. Also impacting provision expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were net charge-offs totaling $18.3 million and $57.5 million, respectively, compared to $18.1 million and $35.2 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. Negatively impacting net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2024 was the deterioration of a single commercial and industrial loan which resulted in a charge-off of $9.0 million. In addition, in the second quarter of 2024 the continued deterioration of the value of the underlying collateral of an owner-occupied commercial real estate loan resulted in a charge-off of $10.3 million. The increase in charge-offs in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 is primarily the result of the combination of the charge-off of these two loans. 

Noninterest Income. &#160; Our noninterest income is composed of several components, some of which vary significantly between quarterly and annual periods. Service charges on deposit accounts and other noninterest income generally reflect our growth, while investment services, fees from the origination of mortgage loans, swap fees and gains or losses on the sale of securities will often reflect financial market conditions or our asset/liability management efforts and fluctuate from period to period. 

The following is a summary of our noninterest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 - 2023 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 - 2023 &#160; 2024 2023 Increase (Decrease) 2024 2023 Increase (Decrease) Noninterest income: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Service charges on deposit accounts $ 16,217 $ 12,665 28.0% $ 44,219 $ 36,563 20.9% Investment services 17,868 13,253 34.8% 48,339 39,022 23.9% Insurance sales commissions 3,286 2,882 14.0% 10,853 10,598 2.4% Gains on mortgage loans sold, net 2,643 2,012 31.4% 8,792 5,632 56.1% Investment losses on sales of securities, net &#8212; (9,727) &#62;100% (72,103) (19,688) &#62;(100%) Trust fees 8,383 6,640 26.3% 24,121 19,696 22.5% Income from equity method investment 16,379 24,967 (34.4)% 51,102 70,970 (28.0)% Gain on sale of fixed assets 1,837 87 &#62;100% 2,220 85,946 (97.4)% Other noninterest income: Interchange and other consumer fees 19,939 18,156 9.8% 58,162 52,222 11.4% Bank-owned life insurance 10,172 5,822 74.7% 29,870 17,132 74.4% Loan swap fees 2,798 1,461 91.5% 4,638 5,443 (14.8)% SBA loan sales 1,207 725 66.5% 4,875 2,897 68.3% Income from other equity investments 6,226 5,837 6.7% 12,375 9,511 30.1% Other noninterest income 8,287 6,017 37.7% 32,170 18,221 76.6% Total other noninterest income 48,629 38,018 27.9% 142,090 105,426 34.8% Total noninterest income $ 115,242 $ 90,797 26.9% $ 259,633 $ 354,165 (26.7)% 

Our fee categories of wealth management and service charges on deposit accounts, including interchange and other consumer fees, reflect strong revenue growth. The increase in service charges on deposit accounts of $3.6 million, or 28.0%, and $7.7 million, or 20.9%, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily attributable to revenues from commercial deposit accounts, including analysis fee revenue, as well as increased consumer check card fees reflective of growth in our deposit accounts and the economic strength of our markets. 

Income from our wealth management groups (investments, insurance and trust) is also included in noninterest income and was impacted in part during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 by market volatility. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, commissions and fees from investment services at our financial advisory unit, Pinnacle Asset Management, a division of Pinnacle Bank, and fees from our wealth advisory group, PNFP Capital Markets, Inc., increased by approximately $4.6 million and $9.3 million, respectively, when compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, Pinnacle Asset Management was receiving commissions and fees in connection with approximately $12.8 billion and $9.0 billion, respectively, in brokerage assets. Revenues from the sale of insurance products by our insurance subsidiaries for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by $404,000 and $255,000, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. Included in insurance revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $1.0 million of contingent income that was recorded in the period but based on 2023 sales production and claims experience compared to $1.7 million recorded in the same period in the prior year that was based on 2022 sales production and claims experience. Additionally, at September 30, 2024 our trust department was receiving fees on approximately $6.8 billion of managed assets compared to $5.0 billion at September 30, 2023. We believe the improvement of $6.8 million, or 29.7%, and $14.0 million, or 20.2%, respectively, in income from our wealth management lines of business during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily the result of an increase in the number of wealth management advisors, a significant percentage of whom are located in our newer markets and the strong performance of the broader market in 2024. 

Gains on mortgage loans sold, net, consists of fees from the origination and sale of mortgage loans. These mortgage fees are for loans primarily originated in our current markets that are subsequently sold to third-party investors. Substantially all of these loan sales transfer servicing rights to the buyer. Generally, mortgage origination fees increase in lower interest rate environments and more robust housing markets and decrease in rising or higher interest rate environments and more challenging housing markets. Mortgage origination fees will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as the rate environment changes. Gains on mortgage loans sold, net, were $2.6 million and $8.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $2.0 million and $5.6 million for the same periods in the prior year. Similar to wealth management, the increase in mortgage fee income was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of mortgage bankers, a significant percentage of whom are located in our newer markets. We hedge a portion of our mortgage pipeline as part of a mandatory delivery program whereby the hedge protects against changes in the fair value of the pipeline. The hedge is not designated as a hedge for U.S. GAAP purposes and, as such, changes in its fair value are recorded directly through the income statement. The change in the fair value of the outstanding mortgage pipeline at the end of any reporting period will directly impact the amount of gain recorded for mortgage loans held for sale during that reporting period. At September 30, 2024, the mortgage pipeline included $91.9 million in loans expected to close in 2024 compared to $81.6 million in loans at September 30, 2023 expected to close in 2023. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, $822.7 million of investment securities were sold in our available-for-sale securities portfolio compared to $303.1 million of investment securities sold in our available-for-sale securities portfolio during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net losses on the sale of these investment securities were $72.1 million and $19.7 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. In both periods, these securities were sold in an effort to reposition our securities portfolio to enhance future earning potential. 

For any securities classified as available-for-sale that are in an unrealized loss position at the balance sheet date, we assess whether or not we intend to sell the security, or more likely than not will be required to sell the security, before recovery of its amortized cost basis which would require a write-down to fair value through net income. Because we currently do not intend to sell those available-for-sale securities that have an unrealized loss at September 30, 2024, and it is not more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the securities before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, we have determined that no write-down is necessary. 

Income from equity-method investment. Income from equity-method investment is comprised solely of income from Pinnacle Bank's 49% equity-method investment in BHG. BHG is engaged in the origination of commercial and consumer loans largely to healthcare providers and other skilled professionals throughout the United States. The loans originated by BHG are either financed by secured borrowings or sold to independent financial institutions and investors. 

Income from this equity-method investment was $16.4 million and $51.1 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $25.0 million and $71.0 million, respectively, for the same periods last year. In 2019, BHG began retaining more loans on its balance sheet. For much of its history, BHG has sold the majority of the loans it originates to a network of bank purchasers through a combination of online auctions, direct sales and its direct purchase option. BHG&#8217;s decision to sell loans through its auction platform (or, recently, directly to institutional investors) or retain loans on its balance sheet will be impacted by a variety of factors, including interest rates, credit experience and demand levels from the community bank network of buyers and institutional buyers to whom BHG markets these loans. In a rising or elevated rate environment, BHG may choose to sell more loans if the cost of financing loans on its balance sheet is not as attractive as a sale, either directly to asset managers or through its auction platform while in a falling or low rate environment it may choose to retain more loans on its balance sheet if funding alternatives for doing so are attractive. During 2023 and the first nine months of 2024, BHG sold loans totaling approximately $950 million and $546 million, respectively, directly to asset managers. Since 2020, BHG has completed nine securitizations totaling $2.9 billion, with the latest securitization of approximately $300 million having been completed in the first quarter of 2024. BHG also entered into funding facilities in the fourth quarter of 2022, first quarter of 2023 and third quarter of 2024 including facilities with U.S. asset managers with outstanding balances of $438 million and $506 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and an annualized interest rate at September 30, 2024 of approximately 7.78%. These facilities, which are secured by loans on BHG's balance sheet, represent incremental funding sources to BHG. We anticipate that BHG will complete additional securitizations in the future or otherwise establish other borrowing facilities to facilitate the retention of additional loans on BHG's balance sheet. 

Income from equity-method investment is recorded net of amortization expense associated with customer lists and other intangible assets associated with Pinnacle Bank's investment in BHG of $60,000 and $178,000, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $88,000 and $262,000, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2024, there wer e $5.8 million of th ese intangible assets that are expected to be amortized in lesser amounts over the next 12 years. Also included in income from equity-method investment is accretion income associated with the fair valuation of certain of BHG's liabilities of $34,000 and $108,000, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $43,000 and $183,000, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2024, there were $100,000 of these liabilities that are expected to accrete into income in lesser amounts over the next three years. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Pinnacle Bank received dividends of $24.8 million and $71.7 million, respectively, from BHG compared to $5.6 million and $33.2 million, respectively, received during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Dividends from BHG during such periods reduced the carrying amount of Pinnacle Bank's investment in BHG, while earnings from BHG during such periods increased the carrying amount of Pinnacle Bank's investment in BHG. Profits from intercompany transactions are eliminated. Our proportionate share of earnings from BHG is included in our consolidated tax return. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, Pinnacle Bank purchased no loans from BHG. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were $177.7 million and $263.0 million, respectively, of BHG joint venture program loans held by Pinnacle Bank. These loans were purchased at par from BHG by Pinnacle Bank and BHG and Pinnacle Bank share proportionately in the credit risk of the acquired loans based on the rate on the loan and the rate of the purchase. The yield on this portfolio to Pinnacle Bank is between 4.50% and 6.00% per annum. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Pinnacle Bank sold $10.2 million and $30.7 million, respectively, of BHG joint venture program loans back to BHG at par. 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, BHG reported $202.1 million and $708.2 million, respectively, in revenues, net of substitution and prepayment losses of $112.5 million and $273.2 million, respectively, compared to revenues of $311.3 million and $924.6 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, net of substitution and prepayment losses of $52.4 million and $194.7 million, respectively. Earnings from BHG are likely to fluctuate from period-to-period. Approximately $65.1 million and $267.0 million, respectively, or 32.2% and 37.7%, respectively, of BHG's revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to gains on the sale of commercial and consumer loans compared to $147.9 million and $451.0 million, respectively, or 47.5% and 48.8%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. These loans have typically been sold by BHG with no recourse to a network of community banks and other financial institutions at a premium to the par value of the loan, although the purchaser may access a BHG cash reserve account of up to 3% of the loan balance to support loan payments. BHG retains no servicing or other responsibilities related to the core product loan once sold. As a result, this gain on sale premium represents BHG's compensation for absorbing the costs to originate the loan as well as marketing expenses associated with maintaining its business model. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, BHG sold loans to its network of community banks and other financial institutions totaling $793 million and $2.4 billion, respectively, compared to $1.0 billion and $3.2 billion during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were $7.3 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively, of these loans previously sold by BHG that were being actively serviced by the purchasing banks. BHG, at its sole option, may also provide purchasers of these loans the ability to substitute the acquired loan with another more recently-issued BHG loan should the previously-acquired loan become at least 90-days past due as to its monthly payments. As a result, BHG maintained a liability as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 of $453.5 million and $350.3 million, respectively, that represents an estimate of the future inherent losses for the outstanding core portfolio that may be subject to future substitution due to payment default or prepayment. This liability represents 6.2% and 5.5%, respectively, of core product loans previously sold by BHG that remain outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in the dollar amount of this liability during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the comparable period ended September 30, 2023 was principally the result of an increase in the amount of loans previously sold by BHG to financial institutions that remain outstanding, BHG's historical loss experience with these loans and BHG management's estimate of future substitution losses due to economic uncertainty. 

In addition to these loans that BHG sells into its auction market or directly to institutional investors, at September 30, 2024, BHG reported loans that remained on BHG's balance sheet totaling $3.0 billion compared to $3.6 billion as of September 30, 2023. The decrease in BHG's loans held on the balance sheet at September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023 is primarily due to strong demand from purchasers in its community bank network of buyers which has led BHG to prioritize loan sales over retaining the loans. A portion of these loans do not qualify for sale accounting and accordingly an offsetting secured borrowing liability has been recorded. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, BHG had $2.2 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, of secured borrowings associated with loans held for investment. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, BHG reported an allowance for credit losses totaling $236.9 million and $213.5 million, respectively, with respect to the loans on its balance sheet. The increase in allowance for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was principally the result of the uncertain economic environment, increased levels of losses on these loans and BHG's adoption of CECL on October 1, 2023. Prior to October 1, 2023, BHG recorded its allowance for loan losses under the incurred loss method. Interest income and fees associated with these on-balance sheet loans amounted to $126.5 million and $392.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $142.2 million and $428.9 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Gains on the sale of fixed assets were $1.8 million and $2.2 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $87,000 and $85.9 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The gains on the sale of fixed assets during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily the result of a gain on the sale of one asset during the third quarter of 2024. The gains on the sale of fixed assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily the result of the sale-leaseback transaction which was completed in the second quarter of 2023. 

Included in our other noninterest income are interchange and other consumer fees, gains from bank-owned life insurance, swap fees earned for the facilitation of derivative transactions for our clients, Small Business Administration (SBA) loan sales and other noninterest income items. Interchange revenues increased 9.8% and 11.4%, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023 as a result of increased commercial and merchant credit card usage. Other noninterest income also includes changes in the cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance (BOLI) which was $10.2 million and $29.9 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $5.8 million and $17.1 million, respectively, in the same periods in the prior year. The assets that support these policies are administered by the life insurance carriers and the income we recognize (i.e., increases or decreases in the cash surrender value of the policies) on these policies is dependent upon the crediting rates applied by the insurance carriers, which are subject to change at the discretion of the carriers, subject to any applicable floors. Earnings on these policies generally are not taxable. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we restructured approximately $740 million of BOLI contracts held by various insurance carries. The increase in BOLI revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the comparable period in 2023 is a direct result of this restructuring and death benefit proceeds we received during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Loan swap fees increased $1.3 million and decreased $805,000, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023. SBA loan sales are included in other noninterest income and increased by $482,000 and $2.0 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same periods in the prior year. The change in both loan swap fees and SBA loan sales are most directly impacted by the changing market conditions during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, the carrying values of other equity investments are adjusted either upwards or downwards from the transaction price to reflect expected exit values as evidenced by financing and sale transactions with third parties, or when determination of a valuation adjustment is confirmed through financial reports provided by the portfolio managers of the investment. Income related to these investments increased $389,000 and $2.9 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same periods in the prior year. The year-over-year increase for the nine-month period is primarily the result of earnings from a solar equity investment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same prior year period. The other components of other noninterest income increased $2.3 million and $13.9 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily the result of recognition during the first quarter of 2024 of an $11.8 million mortgage servicing right associated with our Freddie Mac SBL platform. 

Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense consists of salaries and employee benefits, equipment and occupancy expenses, other real estate expenses and other operating expenses. The following is a summary of our noninterest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 

&#160; Three Months Ended September 30, 2024-2023 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024-2023 &#160; 2024 2023 Increase (Decrease) 2024 2023 Increase (Decrease) Noninterest expense: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Salaries and employee benefits: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Salaries and commissions $ 103,354 $ 91,421 13.1% $ 301,560 $ 269,144 12.0% Cash and equity incentives 33,513 18,520 81.0% 85,697 64,944 32.0% Employee benefits and other 23,367 20,403 14.5% 69,104 64,407 7.3% Total salaries and employee benefits 160,234 130,344 22.9% 456,361 398,495 14.5% Equipment and occupancy 42,564 36,900 15.3% 123,246 100,959 22.1% Other real estate expense, net 56 33 69.7% 162 190 (14.7%) Marketing and other business development 5,599 5,479 2.2% 18,500 17,085 8.3% Postage and supplies 2,965 2,621 13.1% 8,871 8,303 6.8% Amortization of intangibles 1,558 1,765 (11.7%) 4,710 5,339 (11.8%) Other noninterest expense: Deposit related expense 15,891 14,138 12.4% 52,886 36,158 46.3% Lending related expense 17,729 12,508 41.7% 43,959 37,165 18.3% Wealth management related expense 807 734 9.9% 2,585 2,239 15.5% Other noninterest expense 11,916 8,711 36.8% 61,793 30,668 &#62;100% Total other noninterest expense 46,343 36,091 28.4% 161,223 106,230 51.8% Total noninterest expense $ 259,319 $ 213,233 21.6% $ 773,073 $ 636,601 21.4% 

Total salaries and employee benefits expenses increased $29.9 million and $57.9 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. The change in salaries and employee benefits was largely the result of an increase in our associate base in 2024 versus 2023 as well as annual merit increases effective in January 2024 and increased cash and equity incentive expenses. Our associate base increased to 3,516.5 full-time equivalent associates at September 30, 2024 from 3,329.5 at September 30, 2023. We expect total salary and benefit expenses for the year ended 2024 to increase when compared to the comparable period in 2023 as we continue our focus on hiring experienced bankers in all of our markets. 

We believe that cash and equity incentives are a valuable tool in motivating an associate base that is focused on providing our clients effective financial advice and increasing shareholder value. As a result, and unlike many other financial institutions, all of our bank's non-commissioned associates participate in our annual cash incentive plan with a minimum targeted bonus equal to 10% of each associate's annual salary, and all of our bank's associates participate in our equity compensation plans. Under the 2024 annual cash incentive plan, the targeted level of incentive payments requires achievement of a certain soundness threshold and a targeted level of annual earnings per common share and annual revenues (subject to certain adjustments). To the extent that the soundness threshold is met and earnings per common share and revenues are above or below the targeted amount, the aggregate incentive payments are increased or decreased. Historically, we have paid between 0% and 125% of our targeted incentives. For 2024, our annual incentive plan provides for maximum payouts of up to 125% of target. 

Cash incentive expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled $23.1 million and $54.3 million, respectively, compared to $8.4 million and $35.4 million, respectively, during the same prior year periods due to an increased number of associates and our estimate at September 30, 2024 that we are likely to achieve a payout percentage under our annual cash incentive plan in 2024 that would be higher than what we paid out under our annual cash incentive plan in 2023. 

Also included in cash and equity incentives for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately $4.5 million and $13.5 million, respectively, of compensation expenses related to equity-based restricted share awards compared to $4.2 million and $12.5 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 as well as approximately $5.9 million and $17.9 million, respectively, of compensation expenses related to equity-based restricted share units with either time-based or performance-based vesting criteria compared to $5.9 million and $17.1 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 relative to the comparable periods in 2023 is due, in part, to our estimated performance under our performance-based restricted share unit awards through September 30, 2024. Under our equity incentive plans, we provide a broad-based equity incentive program for all of our bank's associates, a significant percentage of which is performance-based for our senior executive officers. We believe that equity incentives provide a vehicle for all associates to become meaningful shareholders of Pinnacle Financial over an extended period of time and create a shareholder-centric culture throughout our organization. 

Employee benefits and other expenses include costs associated with our 401k plan, health insurance, payroll taxes and contract labor. These expenses increased by $3.0 million and $4.7 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same prior year periods. These increases reflect the increase in our associate base in the respective periods. 

Equipment and occupancy expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $42.6 million and $123.2 million, respectively, compared to $36.9 million and $101.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is in large part due to the sale-leaseback transaction completed in the second quarter of 2023. Also impacting equipment and occupancy expense were costs associated with the opening of eight new locations across our footprint during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the opening of five new locations during the comparable period in 2023. The planned relocation of our corporate headquarters to a new location in early 2025 has also impacted equipment and occupancy expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and we expect the costs associated with this relocation to increase as we approach our relocation date, which we expect will begin in the first quarter of 2025. 

Marketing and business development expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $5.6 million and $18.5 million, respectively, compared to $5.5 million and $17.1 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. We continue to expect these costs to rise modestly in 2024 when compared to 2023 taking into account anticipated increases associated with the associates we have hired in the last twelve months and expect to hire during the remainder of 2024. 

Intangible amortization expense was $1.6 million and $4.7 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $1.8 million and $5.3 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. The following table outlines our amortizing intangible assets, their initial valuation and amortizable lives at September 30, 2024: 

&#160; Year acquired Initial Valuation &#160;(in millions) Amortizable Life (in years) Remaining Value (in millions) Core Deposit Intangible: &#160; &#160; &#160; Avenue 2016 $ 8.8 9 $ 0.1 BNC 2017 48.1 10 9.5 Book of Business Intangible: &#160; &#160; &#160; Miller Loughry Beach Insurance 2008 $ 1.3 20 $ 0.1 CapitalMark 2015 0.3 16 0.1 BNC Insurance 2017 0.4 20 0.2 BNC Trust 2017 1.9 10 0.5 Advocate Capital 2019 13.6 13 4.0 JB&#38;B Capital 2022 6.7 10 4.5 Sweeney Asset Management 2022 0.8 10 0.7 

These assets are being amortized on an accelerated basis which reflects the anticipated life of the underlying assets. Annual amortization expense of these intangibles is estimated to decrease from $5.7 million to $1.1 million per year over the next five years with lesser amounts for the remaining amortization period. 

Other noninterest expenses, which consists primarily of deposit, lending, wealth management and administrative expenses increased by $10.3 million and $55.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary increase in other noninterest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same prior year period is the result of approximately $27.6 million in fees paid during the second quarter of 2024 for the termination of an agreement to resell securities previously purchased. Additionally, deposit related expense increased by $1.8 million and $16.7 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase is due in part to increased FDIC insurance assessments which were $200,000 and $11.9 million, respectively, higher in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 than in the same prior year periods. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, deposit related expenses included a $6.8 million estimate of the special assessment expected to be assessed by the FDIC as it seeks to recover losses incurred by the Deposit Insurance Fund associated with the multiple high-profile bank failures which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. This amount was in addition to the initial estimate of $29.0 million we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023 related to this special assessment. Lending related expense, which represents costs associated with loan origination as well as operation of our credit card program, increased by $5.2 million and $6.8 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same periods in the prior year as a result of increased costs related to credit card reward programs and by the loss protection fees of $2.1 million associated with the execution of a credit default swap during the second quarter of 2024. Wealth management related expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 grew $73,000 and $346,000, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023. 

Our efficiency ratio (the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income) was 55.6% and 61.3%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 52.3% and 49.0%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our efficiency ratio during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 was both positively and negatively impacted by the changes to net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense discussed above, with the most significant impact during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 the result of the losses we experienced in connection with the repositioning of our securities portfolio completed during the second quarter of 2024. 

Income Taxes. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded income tax expense of $34.5 million and $73.6 million, respectively, compared to $35.4 million and $118.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 19.0% and 18.5%, respectively, compared to 21.1% and 20.2%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective tax rate differs from the combined federal and state income tax statutory rate in effect of 25.00% at September 30, 2024 and 2023 primarily due to our investments in bank-qualified municipal securities, tax benefits from our real estate investment trust subsidiary, participation in Tennessee's Community Investment Tax Credit program, tax benefits associated with share-based compensation and bank-owned life insurance, offset in part by the limitation on deductibility of meals and entertainment expense, non-deductible FDIC insurance premiums and non-deductible executive compensation. Our tax rate in each period was also impacted by the vesting and exercise of equity-based awards previously granted under our equity-based compensation program. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized excess tax benefits of $131,000 and $2.6 million, respectively, compared to tax expense of $16,000 and excess tax benefits of $241,000, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 with respect to the vesting of equity-based awards and the exercise of employee stock options. The increase in excess tax benefits recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023 was a primary reason for the decrease in the effective tax rate between periods. 

Financial Condition 

Our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024 reflects an increase in total loans outstanding to $34.3 billion compared to $32.7 billion at December 31, 2023. Total deposits increased by $2.4 billion to $41.0 billion between December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024. Total assets were $50.7 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to $48.0 billion at December 31, 2023. 

Loans. The composition of loans at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023 and the percentage (%) of each classification to total loans are summarized as follows (in thousands): &#160; September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 &#160; Amount Percent Amount Percent Commercial real estate: Owner occupied $ 4,264,743 12.4 % $ 4,044,896 12.4 % Non-owner occupied 8,132,388 23.7 % 7,535,494 23.1 % Consumer real estate &#8211; mortgage 4,907,766 14.3 % 4,851,531 14.8 % Construction and land development 3,486,504 10.2 % 4,041,081 12.4 % Commercial and industrial 12,986,865 37.9 % 11,666,691 35.7 % Consumer and other 530,044 1.5 % 536,398 1.6 % Total loans $ 34,308,310 100.0 % $ 32,676,091 100.0 % 

At September 30, 2024, our loan portfolio composition had changed slightly from the composition at December 31, 2023 with commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending generally continuing to make up the largest segments of our portfolio. At September 30, 2024, approximately 34.4% of the outstanding principal balance of our commercial real estate loans was secured by owner occupied commercial real estate properties compared to 34.9% at December 31, 2023. Owner occupied commercial real estate is similar in many ways to our commercial and industrial lending in that these loans are generally made to businesses on the basis of the cash flows of the business rather than on the valuation of the real estate. We are pursuing reduced levels of commercial real estate loans by significantly limiting growth in these loan segments until certain benchmarks are achieved. 

Lending Concentrations. We periodically analyze our loan portfolio to determine if a concentration of credit risk exists to any one or more industries. We use broadly accepted industry classification systems in order to classify borrowers into various industry classifications. We have a credit exposure (loans outstanding plus unfunded commitments) exceeding 25% of Pinnacle Bank's total risk-based capital to borrowers in the following industries at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands): 

&#160; September 30, 2024 &#160; &#160; Outstanding Principal Balances Unfunded Commitments Total exposure Total Exposure at December 31, 2023 Lessors of nonresidential buildings $ 4,578,913 $ 872,139 $ 5,451,052 $ 5,916,335 Lessors of residential buildings 2,278,972 609,958 2,888,930 3,179,041 New Housing For-Sale Builders 562,830 806,163 1,368,993 1,396,653 Music Publishers 862,574 307,707 1,170,281 1,219,781 

Banking regulations have established guidelines for the construction ratio of less than 100% of total risk-based capital and for the non-owner occupied ratio of less than 300% of total risk-based capital. Should a bank&#8217;s ratios be in excess of these guidelines, banking regulations generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management. Both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by Pinnacle Bank&#8217;s total risk-based capital. At September 30, 2024, Pinnacle Bank&#8217;s construction and land development loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital were 68.2% compared to 84.2% at December 31, 2023. Construction and land development, non-owner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital were 243.3% and 259.0% as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Over time, we have targeted a non-owner occupied commercial real estate, multifamily and construction and land development loans to total risk-based capital ratio of less than 225% and construction and land development loans to total risk-based capital ratio of less than 70%. At September 30, 2024, Pinnacle Bank was below the target for construction and land development loans and as such began considering originating new loans using a measured underwriting process, focusing on high-quality developer clients primarily focused in the industrial and multifamily CRE segments. Pinnacle Bank believes it has established appropriate controls to monitor and regulate its lending in these areas as it aims to keep the level of these loans to below the 100% and 300% thresholds. 

The following table presents the maturity distribution of our loan portfolio by loan segment at September 30, 2024 according to contractual maturities of (1) one year or less, (2) after one but within five years, (3) after five but within fifteen years and (4) after fifteen years. The table also presents the portion of loans by loan segment that have fixed interest rates or variable interest rates that fluctuate over the life of the loans in accordance with changes in an interest rate index (dollars in thousands):

The above information does not consider the impact of scheduled principal payments. Loans totaling $1.3 billion at their contractual floor or ceiling rate at September 30, 2024 are presented as fixed interest rate loans in the table above. 

Loans in Past Due Status. The following table is a summary of our loans that were past due at least 30 days but less than 89 days and 90 days or more past due as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands): 

&#160; September 30, December 31, 2024 2023 Loans past due 30 to 89 days: Commercial real estate: Owner occupied $ 9,983 $ 2,178 Non-owner occupied 974 41,066 Consumer real estate &#8211; mortgage 21,293 22,937 Construction and land development 67 649 Commercial and industrial 21,849 42,418 Consumer and other 6,035 7,154 Total loans past due 30 to 89 days $ 60,201 $ 116,402 Loans past due 90 days or more: &#160; Commercial real estate: Owner occupied $ 3,629 $ 3,398 Non-owner occupied 38,413 153 Consumer real estate &#8211; mortgage 17,479 10,824 Construction and land development 2,696 608 Commercial and industrial 18,584 16,890 Consumer and other 1,204 1,496 Total loans past due 90 days or more $ 82,005 $ 33,369 Ratios: &#160; Loans past due 30 to 89 days as a percentage of total loans 0.17 % 0.36 % Loans past due 90 days or more as a percentage of total loans 0.24 % 0.10 % Total loans in past due status as a percentage of total loans 0.41 % 0.46 % 

Potential Problem Loans. Potential problem loans, which are not included in nonperforming assets, amounted to approximately $48.2 million, or 0.1% of total loans at September 30, 2024, compared to $127.4 million, or 0.4% of total loans at December 31, 2023. Potential problem loans represent those loans with a well-defined weakness and where information about possible credit problems of borrowers has caused management to have doubts about the borrower's ability to comply with present repayment terms. This definition is believed to be substantially consistent with the standards established by Pinnacle Bank's primary regulators, for loans classified as substandard, or worse, but not considered nonperforming loans. Potential problem loans totaling $5.2 million were past due at least 30 days but less than 90 days as of September 30, 2024. 

Nonperforming Assets and Modified Loans. At September 30, 2024, we had $120.1 million in nonperforming assets compared to $86.6 million at December 31, 2023. Included in nonperforming assets were $119.3 million in nonaccrual loans, or 0.34% of total loans, and $823,000 in OREO and other nonperforming assets at September 30, 2024 and $82.3 million in nonaccrual loans, or 0.25% of total loans, and $4.3 million in OREO and other nonperforming assets at December 31, 2023. The change in nonaccrual loans at September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023 is largely the result of an increased amount of commercial and industrial and consumer real estate loans being assigned to nonaccrual status. At September 30, 2024, there were $31.7 million of modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, of which $28.5 million were accruing as of the modification date and remain on accrual status. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans (ACL). The current expected credit losses (CECL) methodology requires us to estimate all expected credit losses over the remaining life of our loan portfolio. Accordingly, the ACL represents an amount that, in management's evaluation, is adequate to provide coverage for all expected future credit losses on outstanding loans as of the date of its calculation. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our ACL was approximately $391.5 million and $353.1 million, respectively, which our management believed to be adequate at each of the respective dates. Our ACL as a percentage of total loans was 1.14% at September 30, 2024 compared to 1.08% at December 31, 2023. The increase in the ACL since December 31, 2023 is primarily the result of reserves associated with a $38 million loan which was previously identified as a problem loan and was placed on nonaccrual in the fourth quarter of 2023 and an overall increase in credit loss reserves for loans due to the impact of the changing macroeconomic environment on our CECL model. 

Our CECL models rely largely on recent historical and projected future macroeconomic conditions to estimate future credit losses. Macroeconomic factors used in the model include the unadjusted and seasonally adjusted national unemployment rate, GDP, commercial property price index, consumer credit, commercial real estate price index, household debt ratio, household financial obligations ratio and certain home price indices. Projections of these macroeconomic factors, obtained from an independent third party, are utilized to predict quarterly rates of default. 

Under the CECL methodology, the allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics, and for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with the collectively evaluated pools, evaluations are performed on an individual basis. Losses are predicted over a period of time determined to be reasonable and supportable, and at the end of the reasonable and supportable period losses are reverted to long term historical averages. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, a reasonable and supportable period of fifteen months was utilized for all loan segments followed by a twelve month straight line reversion period to long term averages. 

The following table sets forth, based on management's estimate, the allocation of the allowance for credit losses on loans to categories of loans, loan balances by category, the percentage of loans in each category to total loans and allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans within each loan category as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands):

Pinnacle Financial's management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses on loans on a quarterly basis. This assessment includes procedures to estimate the allowance and test the adequacy and appropriateness of the resulting balance. The level of the allowance is based upon management's evaluation of historical default and loss experience, current and projected economic conditions, asset quality trends, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers' ability to repay the loan (including the timing of future payments), the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, industry and peer bank loan quality indications and other pertinent factors, including regulatory recommendations. The allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries of amounts previously charged-off. 

Based upon our evaluation of the loan portfolio, we believe the allowance for credit losses on loans to be adequate to absorb our estimate of expected future credit losses on loans outstanding at September 30, 2024. While our policies and procedures used to estimate the allowance for credit losses as well as the resultant provision for credit losses charged to operations are considered adequate by management, they are necessarily approximate and imprecise. There are factors beyond our control, such as conditions in the local and national economy, local real estate market or a particular industry or borrower which may negatively impact, materially, our asset quality and the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses and, thus, the resulting provision for credit losses. 

Investments. Our investment securities portfolio, consisting primarily of U.S. Treasury securities, Federal agency bonds, mortgage-backed securities and state and municipal securities, amounted to $8.3 billion and $7.3 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our investment portfolio serves many purposes including serving as a stable source of income, as collateral for public funds deposits and as a potential liquidity source. A summary of our investment portfolio at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 follows: 

&#160; September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Weighted average life 9.11 years 8.05 years Effective duration* 1.99% 2.93% Tax equivalent yield 4.58% 4.12% 

(*) The metric is presented net of fair value hedges tied to certain investment portfolio holdings. The effective duration of the investment portfolio without the fair value hedges as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 6.18% and 6.19%, respectively. 

Restricted Cash. Our restricted cash balances totaled approximately $193.8 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $86.9 million at December 31, 2023. This restricted cash is maintained at other financial institutions as collateral primarily for our derivative portfolio. The increase in restricted cash is attributable primarily to a increase in collateral requirements on certain derivative instruments for which the fair value has decreased. See Note 9. Derivative Instruments in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 

Securities Purchased with Agreement to Resell. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had $66.5 million and $558.0 million, respectively, in securities purchased with agreement to resell. This balance is the result of repurchase agreement transactions with financial institution counterparties. During the second quarter of 2024, we terminated an agreement to resell $500.0 million of securities purchased with an agreement to resell to reposition these funds into higher yielding assets. In connection with terminating the agreement, we paid approximately $27.6 million in fees. We initially secured these investments to allow us to deploy some of our excess liquidity position into instruments that improved the return on funds in the then current historically low interest rate environment. The remaining repurchase agreements are set to mature in 2026. 

Deposits and Other Borrowings. We had approximately $41.0 billion of deposits at September 30, 2024 compared to $38.5 billion at December 31, 2023. Our deposits consist of noninterest and interest-bearing demand accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and time deposits. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we estimate that we had approximately $15.0 billion and $11.1 billion, respectively, in uninsured deposits, which are the portion of deposit accounts that exceed the FDIC insurance limit. We estimate that we had approximately $2.4 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, in our uninsured deposits at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which were collateralized at those dates. We routinely enter into agreements with certain customers to sell certain securities under agreements to repurchase the security the following day. These agreements (which are typically associated with comprehensive treasury management programs for our clients and provide them with short-term returns for their excess funds) amounted to $210.0 million at September 30, 2024 and $209.5 million at December 31, 2023. Additionally, at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Pinnacle Bank had borrowed $2.1 billion in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati (FHLB). The amount of FHLB advances at each date was impacted by our decision in the first half of 2023 to increase our levels of on-balance sheet liquidity in response to the current economic environment and its impact on the banking sector following the failures of multiple high-profile banking institutions. At September 30, 2024, Pinnacle Bank had approximately $3.0 billion in additional availability with the FHLB; however, incremental borrowings are subject to applicable collateral requirements and are made in a formal request by Pinnacle Bank and the subsequent approval by the FHLB. 

Generally, we have classified our funding base as either core funding or noncore funding as shown in the table below. The following table represents the balances of our deposits and other funding, the average rate paid for each type and the percentage of each type to the total at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands):

(1) The reciprocating categories consists of time and money market deposits we receive from a bank network (the IntraFi network) in connection with deposits of our customers in excess of our FDIC coverage limit that we place with the IntraFi network. Regulatory guidance defines reciprocating deposits in a portfolio of a bank of our size over and above $5.0 billion as noncore funding. However, we have witnessed no distinction in the behavior of the deposits in our portfolio over and above $5.0 billion versus the deposits up to $5.0 billion. Therefore, we have included the entire portfolio of reciprocating deposits in the table above as core funding. 

As noted in the table above, our core funding as a percentage of total funding increased slightly, moving from 81.7% at December 31, 2023 to 81.8% at September 30, 2024 and remained above internal policies. We experienced a mix shift in deposits during 2023 as a result of the multiple high-profile bank failures in the first half of 2023 as certain of our depositors opted for additional insurance by way of the reciprocating deposit accounts we offer through the IntraFi network and certain of our depositors moved their deposits out of non-interest bearing accounts and into interest-bearing accounts to take advantage of increased rates. Thus far in 2024, our noninterest bearing deposit accounts have stabilized. Additionally, we continue to create and implement new and enhanced deposit gathering initiatives each year as part of our annual strategic planning process in recognition of the more challenging deposit gathering environment we are currently experiencing. When wholesale funding is necessary to complement our core deposit base, management determines which source is best suited to address both liquidity risk management and interest rate risk management objectives. Our Asset Liability Management Policy imposes limitations on overall wholesale funding reliance and on brokered deposit exposure specifically. Both our overall reliance on wholesale funding and exposure to brokered deposits and brokered time deposits were within those policy limitations as of September 30, 2024. 

The amount of time deposits as of September 30, 2024 amounted to $4.9 billion. The following table shows our time deposits in denominations of less than $250,000 and in denominations of $250,000 and greater by category based on time remaining until maturity and the weighted average rate for each category as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands):

Subordinated debt and other borrowings. Pinnacle Bank receives advances from the FHLB pursuant to the terms of various borrowing agreements which assist it in the funding of its home mortgage and commercial real estate loan portfolios. Under the borrowing agreements with the FHLB, Pinnacle Bank has pledged certain qualifying residential mortgage loans and, pursuant to a blanket lien, all qualifying commercial mortgage loans as collateral. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Pinnacle Bank had received advances from the FHLB totaling $2.1 billion. At September 30, 2024, the scheduled maturities of FHLB advances and interest rates are as follows (in thousands):

We have established, or through acquisition acquired, twelve statutory business trusts which were established to issue 30-year trust preferred securities and certain other subordinated debt agreements. From time to time we, or our bank subsidiary, have issued subordinated notes to enhance our capital positions. These trust-preferred securities and subordinated notes qualify as Tier 2 capital subject to annual phase outs, with such phase outs beginning five years from maturity, as is the case with the subordinated notes we issued in September 2019 beginning in the third quarter of 2024. These instruments are outlined below (in thousands):

Capital Resources. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our shareholders' equity amounted to $6.3 billion and $6.0 billion, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our capital ratios, including our bank's capital ratios, exceeded regulatory minimum capital requirements and those necessary to be considered well-capitalized under applicable federal regulations. See Note 11. Regulatory Matters in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our capital ratios. 

During the second quarter of 2024, we executed a credit default swap arrangement (CDS) with a notional amount of $86.5 million with a counterparty which equaled 5 percent of a reference pool of $1.7 billion of first lien consumer real estate - mortgage loans whereby the counterparty has assumed the first-loss position for these loans up to approximately $86.5 million in aggregate losses. We pay to the counterparty an annual loss protection fee equal to 7.95% of the corresponding notional amount of the CDS, for as long as the loans in the reference pool remain outstanding. The notional amount of the CDS will decline over time as the loans in the reference portfolio are paid down, mature or the investor absorbs the first loss portion of any loan losses on those loans. Additionally, and in accordance with regulatory guidelines, during the second quarter of 2024 we implemented enhanced control processes with respect to certain commercial loans which permits recharacterization of these loans in order to reduce the risk weights assigned to these loans. As a result, the loans subject to the CDS and the loans where risk ratings were able to be recharacterized now qualify for reduced risk weights pursuant to risk-based capital guidelines. The benefits of these reductions in risk weighting offset the impact to regulatory capital of the $72.1 million net loss on sale of approximately $822.7 million of investment securities and the approximately $27.6 million in fees related to the termination of the agreement to resell securities previously purchased recognized in conjunction with the repositioning of our securities portfolio in the second quarter of 2024. 

From time to time we may be required to support the capital needs of our bank (Pinnacle Bank). At September 30, 2024, we had approximately $192.0 million of cash at the parent company that could be used to support our bank. We believe we have various capital raising techniques available to us to provide for the capital needs of our company and bank, such as issuing subordinated debt or entering into a revolving credit facility with a financial institution. We also periodically evaluate capital markets conditions to identify opportunities to access those markets if necessary or prudent to support our capital levels. 

Share Repurchase Program. On January 17, 2023, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $125.0 million of our outstanding common stock. The authorization for this program remained in effect through March 31, 2024. On January 16, 2024, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $125.0 million of our common stock which commenced upon the expiration of the share repurchase program that expired on March 31, 2024. The new authorization is to remain in effect through March 31, 2025. We did not repurchase any shares under either share repurchase program during 2023 or the first nine months of 2024. 

Dividends. Pursuant to Tennessee banking law, our bank may not, without the prior consent of the Commissioner of the TDFI, pay any dividends to us in a calendar year in excess of the total of our bank's retained net profits for that year plus the retained net profits for the preceding two years, which was $1.2 billion at September 30, 2024. Additionally, approval by regulatory authorities is required if the effect of dividends declared would cause the regulatory capital of Pinnacle Bank to fall below specified minimum levels. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the bank paid dividends of $80.3 million to us which is within the limits allowed by banking regulations. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid $17.2 million and $51.8 million, respectively, in dividends to our common shareholders and $3.8 million and $11.4 million, respectively, in dividends on our Series B Preferred Stock. On October 15, 2024, our board of directors declared a $0.22 per share quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders which should approximate $17.2 million in aggregate dividend payments that are expected to be paid on November 29, 2024 to common shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 1, 2024. Additionally, on that same day, our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of approximately $3.8 million, or $16.88 per share (or $0.422 per depositary share), on the Series B Preferred Stock payable on December 1, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 16, 2024. The amount and timing of all future dividend payments, if any, is subject to board discretion and will depend on our earnings, capital position, financial condition and other factors, including, if necessary, our receipt of dividends from Pinnacle Bank, regulatory capital requirements, as they become known to us and receipt of any regulatory approvals that may become required as a result of our and our bank subsidiary's financial results. 

Market and Liquidity Risk Management 

Our objective is to manage assets and liabilities to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies. Our Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) is charged with the responsibility of monitoring these policies, which are designed to ensure acceptable composition of asset/liability mix. Two critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management. 

Interest Rate Sensitivity. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates. ALCO measures and evaluates the interest rate risk so that we can meet customer demands for various types of loans and deposits. ALCO determines the most appropriate amounts of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items. Measurements which we use to help us manage interest rate sensitivity include an earnings simulation model and an economic value of equity (EVE) model. 

Our interest rate sensitivity modeling incorporates a number of assumptions for both earnings simulation and EVE, including loan and deposit re-pricing characteristics, the rate of loan prepayments, etc. ALCO periodically reviews these assumptions for accuracy based on historical data and future expectations. Our ALCO policy requires that the base scenario assumes rates remain flat and is the scenario to which all others are compared in order to measure the change in net interest income and EVE. Policy limits are applied to the results of certain modeling scenarios. While the primary policy scenarios focus on a twelve month time frame for the earnings simulations model, longer time horizons are also modeled. All policy scenarios assume a static volume forecast where the balance sheet is held constant, although other scenarios are modeled. 

Earnings simulation model. We believe interest rate risk is best measured by our earnings simulation modeling. Earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments are combined with forecasts of interest rates for the next 12 months and are combined with other factors in order to produce various earnings simulations over that same 12-month period. To limit interest rate risk, we have policy guidelines for our earnings at risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest income in both gradual and instantaneous changes to interest rates. For instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates from management's flat interest rate forecast over the next twelve months, assuming a static balance sheet, the following estimated changes are calculated:

September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 

Instantaneous Rate Change 

300 bps increase 

(0.66)% 5.94% 

200 bps increase 

(0.21)% 4.41%

0.33% (2.37)% 

200 bps decrease 

1.16% (3.81)% 

300 bps decrease 

0.24% (5.52)% 

While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Further, the earnings simulation model does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, hedging activities we might take and changing product spreads that could mitigate any potential adverse impact of changes in interest rates. 

The change in interest rate sensitivity between September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024 set out in the table above is due to factors impacting both the asset and liability side of the balance sheet. Over the past year, floating-rate, short-term liquidity decreased as a percent of interest-earning assets while non-maturity deposits indexed to the federal funds rate increased as a percent of interest-bearing liabilities. These two factors were the primary drivers behind reduced asset sensitivity and a more neutral interest rate position at September 30, 2024 as compared to September 30, 2023. 

At September 30, 2024, our earnings simulation model indicated we were in compliance with our policies for interest rate scenarios for which we model as required by our board approved Asset Liability Policy. 

Economic value of equity model . While earnings simulation modeling attempts to determine the impact of a changing rate environment to our net interest income, our EVE model measures estimated changes to the economic values of our assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items as a result of interest rate changes. Economic values are determined by discounting expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, which establishes a base case EVE. We then shock rates as prescribed by our Asset Liability Policy and measure the sensitivity in EVE values for each of those shocked rate scenarios versus the base case. The Asset Liability Policy sets limits for those sensitivities. At September 30, 2024, our EVE modeling calculated the following estimated changes in EVE due to instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates: 

September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 

Instantaneous Rate Change 

300 bps increase 

(18.02)% (17.32)% 

200 bps increase 

(12.33)% (12.03)% 

100 bps increase 

(6.38)% (6.25)% 

100 bps decrease 

5.22% 6.78% 

200 bps decrease 

0.03% 11.40% 

300 bps decrease 

(3.89)% 4.54% 

While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current year). Further, EVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, hedging activities we might take and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. 

At September 30, 2024, our EVE model indicated we were in compliance with our policies for all interest rate scenarios for which we model as required by our board approved Asset Liability Policy. 

Most likely earnings simulation models . We also analyze a most-likely earnings simulation scenario that projects the expected change in rates based on a forward yield curve adopted by management using expected balance sheet volumes forecasted by management. Separate growth assumptions are developed for loans, investments, deposits, etc. Other interest rate scenarios analyzed by management may include delayed rate shocks, yield curve steepening or flattening, or other variations in rate movements to further analyze or stress our balance sheet under various interest rate scenarios. Each scenario is evaluated by management. These processes assist management to better anticipate our financial results and, as a result, management may determine the need to invest in other operating strategies and tactics which might enhance results or better position the firm's balance sheet to reduce interest rate risk going forward. 

Each of the above analyses may not, on its own, be an accurate indicator of how our net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. In addition, the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgage loans, have features (generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors) which limit changes in interest rates. Prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments. The ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising or elevated interest rates. ALCO reviews each of the above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with several different interest rate scenarios as part of its responsibility to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing and capital policies. 

Management's model governance, model implementation and model validation processes and controls are subject to review in our regulatory examinations to ensure they are in compliance with the most recent regulatory guidelines and industry and regulatory practices. Management utilizes a respected, sophisticated third party asset liability modeling software to help ensure implementation of management's assumptions into the model are processed as intended in a robust manner. That said, there are numerous assumptions regarding financial instrument behavior that are integrated into the model. The assumptions are formulated by combining observations gleaned from our historical studies of financial instruments and our best estimations of how these instruments may behave in the future given changes in economic conditions, technology, etc. These assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. Additionally, given the large number of assumptions built into our asset liability modeling software, it is difficult, at best, to compare our results to other firms. 

ALCO may determine that Pinnacle Financial should over time become more or less asset or liability sensitive depending on the underlying balance sheet circumstances and our conclusions as to anticipated interest rate fluctuations in future periods. At present, ALCO has determined that its "most likely" rate scenario assumes two 25 basis point decreases in the Federal Funds Rate during the fourth quarter of 2024. Our "most likely" rate forecast is based primarily on information we acquire from a service which includes a consensus forecast of numerous interest rate benchmarks. We may implement additional actions designed to achieve our desired sensitivity position which could change from time to time. 

We have in the past used, and may in the future continue to use, derivative financial instruments as one tool to manage our interest rate sensitivity, including in our mortgage lending program, while continuing to meet the credit and deposit needs of our customers. For further details on the derivatives we currently use, see Note 9. Derivative Instruments in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 

We may also enter into interest rate swaps to facilitate customer transactions and meet their financing needs. These swaps qualify as derivatives, even though they are not designated as hedging instruments. 

Liquidity Risk Management . The purpose of liquidity risk management is to ensure that there are sufficient cash flows to satisfy loan demand, deposit withdrawals, and our other needs. Traditional sources of liquidity for a bank include asset maturities and growth in core deposits. A bank may achieve its desired liquidity objectives from the management of its assets and liabilities and by internally generated funding through its operations. Funds invested in marketable instruments that can be readily sold and the continuous maturing of other earning assets are sources of liquidity from an asset perspective. The liability base provides sources of liquidity through attraction of increased deposits and borrowing funds from various other institutions. 

To assist in determining the adequacy of our liquidity, we perform a variety of liquidity stress tests including idiosyncratic, systemic and combined scenarios for both moderate and severe events. Liquidity is defined as the ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities. Liquidity management involves maintaining our ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of our customers, both depositors and borrowers. We seek to maintain a sufficiently liquid asset balance to ensure our ability to meet our obligations. The amount of the appropriate minimum liquid asset balance is determined through severe liquidity stress testing as measured by our liquidity coverage ratio calculation. At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with our liquidity coverage ratio. 

Changes in interest rates also affect our liquidity position. We currently price deposits in response to market rates, and our management intends to continue this policy. If deposits are not priced in response to market rates, a loss of deposits could occur which would negatively affect our liquidity position. 

Scheduled loan payments are a relatively stable source of funds, but loan payoffs and deposit flows fluctuate significantly, being influenced by interest rates, general economic conditions and competition. Additionally, debt security investments are subject to prepayment and call provisions that could accelerate their payoff prior to stated maturity. Our financial advisors attempt to price our deposit products to meet our asset/liability objectives consistent with local market conditions. Our ALCO is responsible for monitoring our ongoing liquidity needs. Our regulators also monitor our liquidity and capital resources on a periodic basis. 

As noted previously, Pinnacle Bank is a member of the FHLB and, pursuant to a borrowing agreement with the FHLB, has pledged certain assets pursuant to a blanket lien. As such, Pinnacle Bank may use the FHLB as a source of liquidity depending on the firm's ALCO strategies. Additionally, we may pledge additional qualifying assets or reduce the amount of pledged assets with the FHLB to increase or decrease our borrowing capacity at the FHLB. At September 30, 2024, we believe we had an estimated $3.0 billion in additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB; however, incremental borrowings are made via a formal request by Pinnacle Bank and the subsequent approval by the FHLB. 

Pinnacle Bank also has accommodations with upstream correspondent banks for unsecured short-term advances which aggregate $105.0 million. These accommodations have various covenants related to their term and availability, and in most cases must be repaid within less than one month. There were no outstanding borrowings under these agreements at September 30, 2024, or during the period then ended, although we test the availability of these accommodations periodically. Pinnacle Bank also had approximately $6.5 billion in available Federal Reserve discount window lines of credit at September 30, 2024. 

At September 30, 2024, excluding reciprocating time and money market deposits issued through the IntraFi network, we had approximately $3.2 billion in brokered deposits and $12.6 billion in uninsured and uncollateralized deposits. Historically, we have issued brokered certificates through several different brokerage houses based on competitive bid. 

Banking regulators have defined additional liquidity guidelines, through the issuance of the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Modified LCR. These regulatory guidelines became effective January 2015 with phase in over subsequent years and require these large institutions to follow prescriptive guidance in determining an absolute level of a high quality liquid asset (HQLA) buffer that must be maintained on their balance sheets in order to withstand a potential liquidity crisis event. Although Pinnacle Financial follows the principles outlined in the Interagency Policy Statement on Liquidity Risk Management, issued March 2010, to determine its HQLA buffer, Pinnacle Financial is not currently subject to these regulations. However, these formulas could eventually be imposed on smaller banks, such as Pinnacle Bank, and require an increase in the absolute level of liquidity on our balance sheet, which could result in lower net interest margins for us in future periods. 

At September 30, 2024, we had no individually significant commitments for capital expenditures. However, we believe the relocation of our headquarters in early 2025 does, as a whole, constitute a significant commitment for capital expenditure. We expect overall capital expenditures related to the relocation to approximate $47 million, inclusive of amounts we have already incurred, substantially all of which we expect to incur through mid-year 2025. As of September 30, 2024, we had incurred $36.8 million of capital expenditure for the relocation project. Additionally, expansion of our locations, including non-branch locations, will increase over an extended period of time across our footprint, including the markets to which we have recently expanded, and certain of our locations will be in need of required renovations. In future periods, these expansions and renovation projects may lead to additional equipment and occupancy expenses as well as related increases in salaries and benefits expense. In addition to the above noted expenditures, if we were to breach the terms of one of the leases entered into in the sale-leaseback transaction and the counterparty terminated the lease in accordance with its terms, we may be forced to expend significant amounts of capital expenditures to lease, procure and build or renovate a suitable replacement office. Additionally, we expect we will continue to incur costs associated with planned technology improvements to enhance the infrastructure of our firm. 

Our short-term borrowings (borrowings which mature within the next fiscal year) consist primarily of securities sold under agreements to repurchase (these agreements are typically associated with comprehensive treasury management programs for our clients and provide them with short-term returns on their excess funds). 

We have certain contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024, which by their terms have a contractual maturity and termination dates subsequent to September 30, 2024. Each of these commitments is noted throughout Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis . Our management believes that we have adequate liquidity to meet all known contractual obligations and unfunded commitments, including loan commitments and reasonable borrower, depositor and creditor requirements over the next twelve months and that we will have adequate liquidity to meet our obligations over a longer-term as well. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding standby letters of credit of $380.1 million and unfunded loan commitments outstanding of $14.4 billion. Because these commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and many will expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment level does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. If needed to fund these outstanding commitments, Pinnacle Bank has the ability to liquidate securities available-for-sale, or on a short-term basis, to borrow and purchase federal funds from other financial institutions. 

We follow the same credit policies and underwriting practices when making these commitments as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. Each customer's creditworthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case basis and the amount of collateral obtained, if any, is based on management's credit evaluation of the customer. However, should the commitments be drawn upon and should our customers default on their resulting obligation to us, our maximum exposure to credit loss, without consideration of collateral, is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. At September 30, 2024, we had accrued reserves of $12.5 million related to expected credit losses associated with off-balance sheet commitments.
