This Quarterly Report, including the Financial Review and the Financial Statements and related Notes, contains forward-looking statements, 
which may include forecasts of our financial results and condition, expectations for our operations and business, and our assumptions for those 
forecasts and expectations. Do not unduly rely on forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking 
statements due to several factors. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements are 
described in this Report, including in the “Forward-Looking Statements” section, and in the “Risk Factors” and “Regulation and Supervision” 
sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 (2020 Form 10-K). 

When we refer to “Wells Fargo,” “the Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us” in this Report, we mean Wells Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries 
(consolidated). When we refer to the “Parent,” we mean Wells Fargo & Company. See the Glossary of Acronyms for definitions of terms used

Financial Review 

Overview 

Wells Fargo & Company is a leading financial services company 
that has approximately $1.9 trillion in assets and proudly serves 
one in three U.S. households and more than 10% of all middle 
market companies and small businesses in the U.S. We provide a 
diversified set of banking, investment and mortgage products 
and services, as well as consumer and commercial finance, 
through our four reportable operating segments: Consumer 
Banking and Lending, Commercial Banking, Corporate and 
Investment Banking, and Wealth and Investment Management. 
Wells Fargo ranked No. 30 on Fortune’s 2020 rankings of 
America’s largest corporations. We ranked fourth in assets and 
third in the market value of our common stock among all U.S. 
banks at March 31, 2021. 

Wells Fargo’s top priority remains meeting its regulatory 
requirements to build the right foundation for all that lies ahead. 
The Company is subject to a number of consent orders and other 
regulatory actions, which may require the Company, among 
other things, to undertake certain changes to its business, 
operations, products and services, and risk management 
practices. Addressing these regulatory actions is expected to 
take multiple years, and we may experience issues or delays along 
the way in satisfying their requirements. Issues or delays with 
one regulatory action could affect our progress on others, and 
failure to satisfy the requirements of a regulatory action on a 
timely basis could result in additional penalties, enforcement 
actions, and other negative consequences. While we still have 
significant work to do, the Company is committed to devoting 
the resources necessary to operate with strong business 
practices and controls, maintain the highest level of integrity, and 
have an appropriate culture in place. 

Federal Reserve Board Consent Order Regarding 
Governance Oversight and Compliance and Operational 
Risk Management 
On February 2, 2018, the Company entered into a consent order 
with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
(FRB). As required by the consent order, the Company’s Board of 
Directors (Board) submitted to the FRB a plan to further enhance 
the Board’s governance and oversight of the Company, and the 
Company submitted to the FRB a plan to further improve the 
Company’s compliance and operational risk management 
program. The Company continues to engage with the FRB as the 
Company works to address the consent order provisions. The 
consent order also requires the Company, following the FRB’s 
acceptance and approval of the plans and the Company’s 
adoption and implementation of the plans, to complete an initial 
third-party review of the enhancements and improvements 
provided for in the plans. Until this third-party review is complete 

and the plans are approved and implemented to the satisfaction 
of the FRB, the Company’s total consolidated assets as defined 
under the consent order will be limited to the level as of 
December 31, 2017. Compliance with this asset cap is measured 
on a two-quarter daily average basis to allow for management of 
temporary fluctuations. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on 
April 8, 2020, the FRB amended the consent order to allow the 
Company to exclude from the asset cap any on-balance sheet 
exposure resulting from loans made by the Company in 
connection with the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck 
Protection Program and the FRB’s Main Street Lending Program. 
As required under the amendment to the consent order, to the 
extent the Company chooses to exclude these exposures from 
the asset cap, certain fees and other economic benefits received 
by the Company from loans made in connection with these 
programs shall be transferred to the U.S. Treasury or to non-
profit organizations approved by the FRB that support small 
businesses. As of March 31, 2021, the Company had not excluded 
these exposures from the asset cap. After removal of the asset 
cap, a second third-party review must also be conducted to 
assess the efficacy and sustainability of the enhancements and 
improvements. 

Consent Orders with the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 
Regarding Compliance Risk Management Program, 
Automobile Collateral Protection Insurance Policies, and 
Mortgage Interest Rate Lock Extensions 
On April 20, 2018, the Company entered into consent orders 
with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the 
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to pay an 
aggregate of $1 billion in civil money penalties to resolve matters 
regarding the Company’s compliance risk management program 
and past practices involving certain automobile collateral 
protection insurance (CPI) policies and certain mortgage interest 
rate lock extensions. As required by the consent orders, the 
Company submitted to the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-wide 
compliance risk management plan and a plan to enhance the 
Company’s internal audit program with respect to federal 
consumer financial law and the terms of the consent orders. In 
addition, as required by the consent orders, the Company 
submitted for non-objection plans to remediate customers 
affected by the automobile collateral protection insurance and 
mortgage interest rate lock matters, as well as a plan for the 
management of remediation activities conducted by the 
Company. The Company continues to work to address the 
provisions of the consent orders. The Company has not yet 
satisfied certain aspects of the consent orders, and as a result, we

believe regulators may impose additional penalties or take other 
enforcement actions. 

Retail Sales Practices Matters 
In September 2016, we announced settlements with the CFPB, 
the OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney, and 
entered into related consent orders with the CFPB and the OCC, 
in connection with allegations that some of our retail customers 
received products and services they did not request. As a result, it 
remains a top priority to rebuild trust through a comprehensive 
action plan that includes making things right for our customers, 
employees, and other stakeholders, and building a better 
Company for the future. Our priority of rebuilding trust has 
included numerous actions focused on identifying potential 
financial harm to customers resulting from these matters and 
providing remediation. 

For additional information regarding retail sales practices 
matters, including related legal matters, see the “Risk Factors” 
section in our 2020 Form 10-K and Note 13 (Legal Actions) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Other Customer Remediation Activities 
Our priority of rebuilding trust has also included an effort to 
identify other areas or instances where customers may have 
experienced financial harm, provide remediation as appropriate, 
and implement additional operational and control procedures. 
We are working with our regulatory agencies in this effort. We 
have previously disclosed key areas of focus as part of our 
rebuilding trust efforts and are in the process of providing 
remediation for those matters. We have accrued for the probable 
and estimable remediation costs related to our rebuilding trust 
efforts, which amounts may change based on additional facts and 
information, as well as ongoing reviews and communications with 
our regulators. 

As our ongoing reviews continue, it is possible that in the 
future we may identify additional items or areas of potential 
concern. To the extent issues are identified, we will continue to 
assess any customer harm and provide remediation as 
appropriate. For additional information, including related legal 
and regulatory risk, see the “Risk Factors” section in our 2020 
Form 10-K and Note 13 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements 
in this Report. 

Recent Developments 
Efficiency Initiatives 
We are pursuing various initiatives to reduce expenses and create 
a more efficient and streamlined organization. Actions from 
these initiatives may include (i) reorganizing and simplifying 
business processes and structures to improve internal operations 
and the customer experience, (ii) reducing headcount, (iii) 
optimizing third-party spending, including for our technology 
infrastructure, and (iv) rationalizing our branch and 
administrative locations, which may include consolidations and 
closures. In first quarter 2021, we recognized a limited amount of 
restructuring charges within noninterest expense in our 
consolidated statement of income as a result of these initiatives. 
For additional information, see Note 19 (Restructuring Charges) 
to Financial Statements in this Report. 

COVID-19 Pandemic 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been working 
diligently to protect employee safety while continuing to carry 
out Wells Fargo’s role as a provider of essential services to the 
public. We have taken comprehensive steps to help customers, 
employees and communities. 

We have strong levels of capital and liquidity, and we remain 
focused on delivering for our customers and communities to get 
through these unprecedented times. 

PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM  The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, 
and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) created funding for the 
Small Business Administration’s (SBA) loan program providing 
forgiveness of up to the full principal amount of qualifying loans 
guaranteed under a program called the Paycheck Protection 
Program (PPP). Since its inception, we have funded 
approximately 264,000 loans under the PPP totaling 
$13.2 billion, and more than $1.0 billion of principal forgiveness 
has been provided on qualifying PPP loans. We deferred 
approximately $420 million of SBA processing fees in 2020 that 
will be recognized as interest income over the terms of the loans. 
We voluntarily committed to donate all of the gross processing 
fees received from PPP loans funded in 2020. Through March 31, 
2021, we donated approximately $125 million of these 
processing fees to non-profit organizations that support small 
businesses. We funded $2.8 billion of PPP loans in first quarter 
2021. For this latest round in first quarter 2021, we deferred 
approximately $200 million of SBA processing fees that will be 
recognized as interest income over the terms of the loans. We 
have committed to donate any net profits related to PPP loans 
funded in 2021. For additional information on the CARES Act and 
the PPP, see the “Overview – Recent Developments – COVID-19 
Pandemic” section in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

LIBOR Transition 
The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is a widely-
referenced benchmark rate, which is published in five currencies 
and a range of tenors, and seeks to estimate the cost at which 
banks can borrow on an unsecured basis from other banks. On 
March 5, 2021, the Financial Conduct Authority and the 
administrator of LIBOR announced that LIBOR will no longer be 
published on a representative basis after December 31, 2021, 
with the exception of the most commonly used tenors of U.S. 
dollar (USD) LIBOR which will no longer be published on a 
representative basis after June 30, 2023. Federal banking 
agencies have issued guidance strongly encouraging banking 
organizations to cease using USD LIBOR as a reference rate in 
new contracts as soon as practicable and in any event by 
December 31, 2021. 

For information on the amount of our LIBOR-linked assets 

and liabilities, as well as initiatives created by our LIBOR 
Transition Office in an effort to mitigate the risks associated with 
a transition away from LIBOR, see the “Overview – Recent 
Developments – LIBOR Transition” section in our 2020 Form 
10-K. For information regarding the risks and potential impact of 
LIBOR or any other referenced financial metric being significantly 
changed, replaced or discontinued, see the “Risk Factors” section 
in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Capital Actions and Restrictions 
On March 25, 2021, the FRB announced that it was extending 
measures it previously announced limiting capital distributions 
by large bank holding companies (BHCs), including Wells Fargo, 
subject to certain exceptions. The FRB has generally authorized, 
among other things, BHCs to pay common stock dividends and 
make share repurchases that, in the aggregate, do not exceed an 
amount equal to the average of the BHC’s net income for the 
four preceding calendar quarters, so long as the BHC does not 
increase the amount of its common stock dividend from the level 
paid in second quarter 2020. The FRB also announced that if a 
BHC remains above all of its minimum risk-based capital

requirements in this year's supervisory stress test, these 
additional limitations on capital distributions will end for that 
BHC after June 30, 2021. For additional information about 
capital planning, including the FRB’s recent announcement on 
capital distributions, see the “Capital Management – Capital 
Planning and Stress Testing” section in this Report. 

Business and Portfolio Divestitures 
On February 23, 2021, we announced an agreement to sell 
Wells Fargo Asset Management for a purchase price of 
$2.1 billion. As part of the transaction, we will own a 9.9% equity 
interest and continue to serve as a client and distribution partner. 

On March 23, 2021, we announced an agreement to sell our 
Corporate Trust Services business for a purchase price of 
$750 million. Both transactions are expected to close in the 
second half of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions. 
In first quarter 2021, we completed the first phase of the 
previously announced sale of our student loan portfolio, which 
resulted in a $208 million gain included in other noninterest 
income and a $104 million goodwill write-down included in other 
noninterest expense. In April 2021, we completed the sale of 
substantially all of the remaining portfolio, which will result in a 
$147 million gain and a $79 million write-down of the remaining 
goodwill in second quarter 2021.

In first quarter 2021, we generated $4.7 billion of net income and 
diluted earnings per common share (EPS) of $1.05, compared 
with $653 million of net income and EPS of $0.01 in the same 
period a year ago. Financial performance for first quarter 2021, 
compared with the same period a year ago, included the 
following: 
• 

total revenue increased due to higher net gains from equity 
securities and mortgage banking income, partially offset by 
lower net interest income; 
provision for credit losses decreased reflecting lower net 
charge-offs and improvements in the economic 
environment; 
noninterest expense increased due to higher personnel 
expense, partially offset by lower operating losses and lower 
professional and outside services expense; 
average loans decreased due to paydowns exceeding 
originations in the residential mortgage and credit card 
portfolios, weak demand for commercial loans, and the 
reclassification of student loans, included in other consumer 
loans, to loans held for sale after the announced sale of the 
portfolio in fourth quarter 2020; and 
average deposits increased driven by growth in consumer 
deposits in the Consumer Banking and Lending and Wealth 
and Investment Management (WIM) operating segments 
due to customers' preferences for liquidity given the 
economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 
pandemic, government stimulus programs, and lower 
consumer spending, partially offset by actions taken to 
manage under the asset cap which reduced deposits in the 
Corporate and Investment Banking operating segment and 
Corporate.

Capital and Liquidity 
We maintained a strong capital position in first quarter 2021, 
with total equity of $188.3 billion at March 31, 2021, compared 
with $185.9 billion at December 31, 2020. Our liquidity and 
regulatory capital ratios remained strong at March 31, 2021, 
including: 
• 

our liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) was 127%, which 
continued to exceed the regulatory minimum of 100%; 
our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio was 11.85%, which 
continued to exceed both the regulatory requirement of 9% 
and our current internal target of 10%; and 
our eligible external total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) as a 
percentage of total risk-weighted assets was 25.18%, 
compared with the regulatory requirement of 21.50%. 
See the “Capital Management” and the “Risk Management – 

• 

• 

Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding” 
sections in this Report for additional information regarding our 
capital and liquidity, including the calculation of our regulatory 
capital and liquidity amounts. 

Credit Quality 
Credit quality was impacted by the improving economic 
environment. 
• 

The allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans of 
$18.0 billion at March 31, 2021, decreased $1.7 billion from 
December 31, 2020. 

•  Our provision for credit losses for loans was $(1.1) billion in 

first quarter 2021, down from $3.8 billion in the same period 
a year ago. The decrease in the ACL for loans and the 
provision for credit losses in first quarter 2021, compared 
with the same period a year ago, reflected improvements in 
the economic environment.

Overview (continued) 

• 

• 

• 

The allowance coverage for total loans was 2.09% at 
March 31, 2021, compared with 2.22% at December 31, 
2020. 
Commercial portfolio net loan charge-offs were 
$149 million, or 13 basis points of average commercial loans, 
in first quarter 2021, compared with net loan charge-offs of 
$324 million, or 25 basis points, in the same period a year 
ago, predominantly driven by lower losses in our commercial 
and industrial portfolio primarily within the oil, gas and 
pipelines industry, partially offset by increased losses in the 
real estate mortgage and construction portfolios. 
Consumer portfolio net loan charge-offs were $364 million, 
or 37 basis points of average consumer loans, in first quarter 

2021, compared with net loan charge-offs of $585 million, 
or 53 basis points, in the same period a year ago, driven by 
lower losses in all consumer loan portfolios as a result of 
payment deferral activities and government stimulus 
programs instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

•  Nonperforming assets (NPAs) of $8.2 billion at March 31, 
2021, decreased $692 million, or 8%, from December 31, 
2020, predominantly driven by decreases in our commercial 
and industrial portfolio, primarily within the oil, gas and 
pipelines industry, commercial real estate mortgage, and 
residential mortgage portfolios reflecting improvements in 
the economic environment. NPAs represented 0.95% of 
total loans at March 31, 2021. 

Earnings Performance 

Wells Fargo net income for first quarter 2021 was $4.7 billion 
($1.05 diluted EPS), compared with $653 million ($0.01 diluted 
EPS) for first quarter 2020. Net income increased in first quarter 
2021, compared with the same period a year ago, predominantly 
due to a $5.1 billion decrease in provision for credit losses and a 
$2.9 billion increase in noninterest income, partially offset by a 
$2.5 billion decrease in net interest income and a $941 million 
increase in noninterest expense. 

Net Interest Income 
Net interest income and net interest margin decreased in first 
quarter 2021, compared with the same period a year ago, driven 
by a repricing of the balance sheet, lower loan balances primarily 
due to soft demand and elevated prepayments, as well as 
unfavorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting results, and higher 
mortgage-backed securities premium amortization. 

Table 1 presents the individual components of net interest 

income and the net interest margin. Net interest income and the 
net interest margin are presented on a taxable-equivalent basis 
in Table 1 to consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-
exempt loans and debt and equity securities based on a 21% 
federal statutory tax rate for the periods ended March 31, 2021 
and 2020. 

For additional information about net interest income and 

net interest margin, see the “Earnings Performance – Net 
Interest Income” section in our 2020 Form 10-K.

In first quarter 2021, trust and investment management fees and asset-based brokerage fees were combined into a single line item for investment advisory and other asset-based fees, and 
brokerage commissions and other brokerage services fees were combined into a single line item for commissions and brokerage services fees. Prior period balances have been revised to conform with 
the current period presentation. 

First quarter 2021 vs. first quarter 2020 

impact from changes in interest rates, more than offset by 
less favorable hedge results. 

Deposit-related fees decreased driven by: 
• 

higher average consumer deposit account balances due to 
the economic slowdown and government stimulus programs 
associated with the COVID-19 pandemic; and 
higher fee waivers and reversals as part of our actions to 
support customers during the COVID-19 pandemic; 

• 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher treasury management fees on commercial accounts 
driven by a lower earnings credit rate due to the lower 
interest rate environment. 

• 

• 

Investment advisory and other asset-based fees increased 
reflecting higher market valuations on client investment assets. 

For additional information on certain client investment 
assets, see the “Earnings Performance – Operating Segment 
Results – Wealth and Investment Management – WIM Advisory 
Assets” and “Earnings Performance – Operating Segment 
Results – Corporate – Wells Fargo Asset Management (WFAM) 
Assets Under Management” sections in this Report. 

Commissions and brokerage services fees decreased driven by 
lower transactional revenue due to higher customer activity in 
first quarter 2020 reflecting the economic uncertainty 
associated with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Investment banking fees increased driven by higher advisory 
fees and equity and debt origination fees. 

Card fees increased reflecting lower credit card rewards costs, 
partially offset by lower late fees due to higher payment rates. 

Servicing income, net decreased reflecting: 
• 

lower servicing fees due to a lower balance of loans serviced 
for others resulting from continued prepayments; and 
lower income from mortgage servicing right (MSR) valuation 
changes and related hedges, which reflected a favorable 

•

Net gains on mortgage loan originations/sales increased 
driven by: 
• 
• 

higher margins in our retail production channel; 
higher residential real estate held for sale (HFS) origination 
volumes in our retail production channel; 
higher gains related to the re-securitization of loans we 
purchased from Government National Mortgage Association 
(GNMA) loan securitization pools in 2020; and 
higher gains due to losses in first quarter 2020 driven by the 
impact of interest rate volatility on hedging activities 
associated with our residential mortgage loans held for sale 
portfolio and pipeline, as well as valuation losses on certain 
residential and commercial loans held for sale due to market 
conditions. 

For additional information on servicing income and net gains 

on mortgage loan originations/sales, see Note 9 (Mortgage 
Banking Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Net gains from trading activities increased reflecting: 
• 

higher client demand for asset-backed finance products, 
other credit products, and municipal bonds; 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower client demand for interest rate products and lower 
revenue in equities and commodities. 

Net gains on debt securities decreased due to lower gains from 
the sales of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and 
municipal bonds as a result of decreased sales volumes. 

Net gains (losses) from equity securities increased driven by: 
• 

lower impairment of $920 million on equity securities due to 
the market impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in first 
quarter 2020; 
losses in first quarter 2020 on deferred compensation plan 
investments (largely offset in personnel expense). Refer to

Table 3a presents results for our deferred compensation 
plan and related hedges. In second quarter 2020, we entered 
into arrangements to transition our economic hedges of the 
deferred compensation plan liabilities from equity securities to 
derivative instruments. As a result of this transition, changes in 
fair value of derivatives used to economically hedge the deferred 
compensation plan are reported in personnel expense rather 
than in net gains (losses) from equity securities within 
noninterest income. For additional information on the 
derivatives used in the economic hedges, see Note 14 
(Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Technology, telecommunications and equipment expense 
increased due to higher expense for technology contracts and 
higher telecommunications expense related to the COVID-19 
pandemic. 

Occupancy expense increased due to additional cleaning fees, 
supplies, and equipment expenses related to the COVID-19 
pandemic. 

Operating losses decreased driven by lower expense for 
litigation accruals and customer remediation accruals. 

Professional and outside services expense decreased driven by 
reduced project spending due to efficiency initiatives. 

Lease expense decreased due to a reduction in the size of the 
operating lease asset portfolio.

Earnings Performance (continued) 

Advertising and promotion expense decreased driven by 
reduced marketing and brand campaign volumes due to the 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Restructuring charges increased related to our efficiency 
initiatives that began in third quarter 2020. For additional 
information on restructuring charges, see Note 19 
(Restructuring Charges) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Other expenses increased driven by: 
• 

a write-down of goodwill in first quarter 2021 related to the 
sale of a portion of our student loan portfolio; 
higher charitable donations expense driven by the donation 
of PPP processing fees; and 
higher Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) 
deposit assessment expense driven by a higher assessment 
rate; 

• 

• 

partially offset by: 
• 

a reduction in business travel and company events due to 
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Income Tax Expense 
Income tax expense was $326 million in first quarter 2021, 
compared with $159 million in the same period a year ago, driven 
by higher pre-tax income. The effective income tax rate was 6.4% 
for first quarter 2021, compared with 19.5% for the same period 
a year ago. Income tax expense for first quarter 2021 included 
net discrete income tax benefits of $154 million related mainly 
to the resolution of prior period matters with tax authorities. 
Income tax expense for first quarter 2020 included net discrete 
income tax expense of $141 million driven by the accounting for 
stock compensation activity, the net impact of accounting for 
uncertain tax positions, and the outcome of U.S. federal income 
tax examinations. 

Operating Segment Results 
Our management reporting is organized into four reportable 
operating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending; 
Commercial Banking; Corporate and Investment Banking; and 
Wealth and Investment Management. All other business 
activities that are not included in the reportable operating 
segments have been included in Corporate. For additional 
information, see Table 4. We define our reportable operating 
segments by type of product and customer segment, and their 
results are based on our management reporting process. The 
management reporting process measures the performance of 
the reportable operating segments based on the Company’s 
management structure, and the results are regularly reviewed by 
our Chief Executive Officer and Operating Committee. The 
management reporting process is based on U.S. GAAP and 
includes specific adjustments, such as funds transfer pricing for 
asset/liability management, shared revenues and expenses, and 
taxable-equivalent adjustments to consistently reflect income 
from taxable and tax-exempt sources, which allows management 
to assess performance consistently across the operating 
segments. 

In February 2021, we announced an agreement to sell Wells 

Fargo Asset Management and moved the business from the 
Wealth and Investment Management operating segment to 
Corporate. Prior period balances have been revised to conform 
with the current period presentation. This change did not impact 
the previously reported consolidated financial results of the 
Company. 

Funds Transfer Pricing  Corporate treasury manages a funds 
transfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, 
liquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating 
segments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a 
funding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in 
net interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or 
credits is recognized in corporate treasury. 

Revenue and Expense Sharing  When lines of business jointly 
serve customers, the line of business that is responsible for 
providing the product or service recognizes revenue or expense 
with a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line of 
business based on established internal revenue-sharing 
agreements. 

When a line of business uses a service provided by another 
line of business or enterprise function (included in Corporate), 
expense is generally allocated based on the cost and use of the 
service provided. 

Taxable-Equivalent Adjustments  Taxable-equivalent 
adjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and 
debt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-
equivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for low-
income housing and renewable energy investments are included 
in noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts 
to income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are included in 
Corporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment 
Banking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company’s 
consolidated financial results. 

Allocated Capital  Reportable operating segments are allocated 
capital under a risk-sensitive framework that is primarily based 
on aspects of our regulatory capital requirements, and the 
assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are 
periodically assessed and revised. Management believes that 
return on allocated capital is a useful financial measure because it 
enables management, investors, and others to assess a 
reportable operating segment’s use of capital. 

Selected Metrics  We present certain financial and nonfinancial 
metrics that management uses when evaluating reportable 
operating segment results. Management believes that these 
metrics are useful to investors and others to assess the 
performance, customer growth, and trends of reportable

All other business activities that are not included in the reportable operating segments have been included in Corporate. For additional information, see the "Corporate" section below. In 
February 2021, we announced an agreement to sell Wells Fargo Asset Management and moved the business from the Wealth and Investment Management operating segment to Corporate. Prior 
period balances have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. 
Taxable-equivalent adjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and debt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-equivalent adjustments related to income tax 
credits for low-income housing and renewable energy investments are included in noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts to income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are 
included in Corporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment Banking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company’s consolidated financial results.

NM – Not meaningful 
(1) 

Return on allocated capital is segment net income (loss) applicable to common stock divided by segment average allocated capital. Segment net income (loss) applicable to common stock is segment 
net income (loss) less allocated preferred stock dividends. 
Efficiency ratio is segment noninterest expense divided by segment total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income). 
Digital and mobile active customers is the number of consumer and small business customers who have logged on via a digital or mobile device, respectively, in the prior 90 days. Digital active 
customers includes both online and mobile customers. 
Deposit spread is (i) the internal funds transfer pricing credit on segment deposits minus interest paid to customers for segment deposits, divided by (ii) average segment deposits. 
Debit card purchase volume and transactions reflect combined activity for both consumer and business debit card purchases. 
Excludes residential mortgage loans subserviced for others. 
Excludes residential mortgage loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and loans held for sale. 
Beginning in second quarter 2020, customer payment deferral activities instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may have delayed the recognition of delinquencies for those customers 
who would have otherwise moved into past due status. 
Excludes certain private label new account openings.

First quarter 2021 vs. first quarter 2020 

Provision for credit losses decreased driven by an improving 
economic environment. 

Revenue was largely unchanged reflecting: 
• 

higher card fees driven by lower credit card rewards costs, 
partially offset by lower late fees due to higher payment 
rates; and 
higher mortgage banking noninterest income driven by 
higher HFS origination volumes and higher margins in our 
retail production channel, partially offset by lower servicing 
income due to lower servicing fees on lower balances of 
loans serviced for others and lower income from MSR 
valuation changes and related hedges; 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower net interest income reflecting the lower interest rate 
environment and lower loan balances as paydowns exceeded 
originations; 
lower deposit-related fees driven by higher average 
consumer deposit account balances due to the economic 
slowdown associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, as well 
as fee waivers and reversals as part of our actions to support 
customers during the COVID-19 pandemic; and 
lower other income driven by lower gains on loan sales. 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

Noninterest expense was largely unchanged reflecting: 
• 

higher charitable donations expense due to the donation of 
PPP processing fees; 
higher FDIC deposit assessment expense driven by a higher 
assessment rate; 
higher expense allocated from enterprise functions, 
reflecting risk management and technology support; and 
higher personnel expense driven by higher revenue-related 
compensation in Home Lending, partially offset by lower 
branch staffing expense related to efficiency initiatives in 
Consumer and Small Business Banking;

lower operating losses due to lower expense for litigation 
and customer remediation accruals; and 
lower advertising and promotion expense.

First quarter 2021 vs. first quarter 2020 

Total loans (average and period-end) decreased as growth in 
small business loans driven by loans funded under the PPP was 
more than offset by paydowns exceeding originations in the 
home lending, credit card, and personal lending portfolios. Home 
lending loan balances were also impacted by actions taken in 
2020 to suspend certain non-conforming residential mortgage 
and home equity originations. 

Total deposits (average and period-end) increased driven by 
government stimulus programs and lower consumer spending 
due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Commercial Banking provides financial solutions to private, 
family owned and certain public companies. Products and 
services include banking and credit products across multiple 
industry sectors and municipalities, secured lending and lease 
products, and treasury management. In March 2021, we 

announced an agreement to sell our Corporate Trust Services 
business and expect to move the business from the Commercial 
Banking operating segment to Corporate in second quarter 
2021. Table 5c and Table 5d provide additional information for 
Commercial Banking.

First quarter 2021 vs. first quarter 2020 

Revenue decreased driven by: 
• 

lower net interest income reflecting the lower interest rate 
environment and lower average loan balances; and 
lower lease income reflecting a reduction in the size of the 
operating lease asset portfolio; 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher other noninterest income due to impairments on 
equity securities in first quarter 2020; and 
higher treasury management fees on commercial accounts, 
included in deposit-related fees, driven by a lower earnings 
credit rate due to the lower interest rate environment.

Provision for credit losses decreased driven by an improving 
economic environment. 

Noninterest expense increased driven by: 
• 

higher expenses allocated from enterprise functions, 
including higher technology expenses; 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower spending related to efficiency initiatives, including 
lower personnel expense from reduced headcount; 
lower professional and outside services expense reflecting 
decreased project-related expense; and 
lower lease expense reflecting a reduction in the size of the 
operating lease asset portfolio.

Total loans (average and period-end) decreased driven by lower

paydowns reflecting continued client liquidity and strength in the 
capital markets. 

Total deposits (average) increased due to government stimulus 
programs, customers’ preferences for liquidity given the 
economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, 
and lower investment spending.

Earnings Performance (continued) 

Noninterest expense decreased driven by: 
• 

lower operating losses due to lower expense for litigation 
accruals and customer remediation accruals; 
lower expenses allocated from enterprise functions 
reflecting lower spending due to efficiency initiatives; and 
a reduction in business travel and company events due to 
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; 

• 

• 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher personnel expense on revenue-related incentive 
compensation.

Total assets (average and period-end) decreased 
predominantly due to a decline in trading-related assets 
reflecting continued actions to manage under the asset cap and a 
decline in loan balances driven by lower demand due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic and higher paydowns reflecting continued 
client liquidity and strength in the capital markets. 

Total deposits (average and period-end) decreased reflecting 
continued actions to manage under the asset cap.

NM – Not meaningful 
(1) 

In first quarter 2021, trust and investment management fees and asset-based brokerage fees were combined into a single line item for investment advisory and other asset-based fees, and 
brokerage commissions and other brokerage services fees were combined into a single line item for commissions and brokerage services fees. Prior period balances have been revised to conform with 
the current period presentation. 
Represents annualized total revenue divided by average total financial and wealth advisors for the period. 

(2) 

First quarter 2021 vs. first quarter 2020 

Revenue increased driven by: 
• 

higher investment advisory and other asset-based fees 
driven by higher market valuations on WIM advisory assets; 
and 
higher deferred compensation plan investment results 
included in other noninterest income (largely offset by 
personnel expense); 

• 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower net interest income reflecting the lower interest rate 
environment, partially offset by higher average deposit 
balances. 

Provision for credit losses decreased driven by an improving 
economic environment. 

Noninterest expense increased due to higher personnel expense 
driven by higher revenue-related compensation and higher 
deferred compensation expense (largely offset by net gains from 
equity securities). 

Total deposits (average and period-end) increased primarily due 
to growth in brokerage clients’ cash balances.

Earnings Performance (continued) 

WIM Advisory Assets  In addition to transactional accounts, 
WIM offers advisory account relationships to brokerage 
customers. Fees from advisory accounts are based on a 
percentage of the market value of the assets as of the beginning 
of the quarter, which vary across the account types based on the 
distinct services provided, and are affected by investment 
performance as well as asset inflows and outflows. Advisory 
accounts include assets that are financial advisor-directed and 
separately managed by third-party managers, as well as certain 
client-directed brokerage assets where we earn a fee for advisory 
and other services, but do not have investment discretion. 

Table 5h:  WIM Advisory Assets 

WIM also manages personal trust and other assets for high 
net worth clients, with fee income earned based on a percentage 
of the market value of these assets. Table 5h presents advisory 
assets activity by WIM line of business for first quarter 2021 and 
2020. Management believes that advisory assets is a useful 
metric because it allows management, investors, and others to 
assess how changes in asset amounts may impact the generation 
of certain asset-based fees. 

For first quarter 2021 and 2020, the average fee rate by 

account type ranged from 50 to 120 basis points.

Corporate includes corporate treasury and enterprise functions, 
net of allocations (including funds transfer pricing, capital, 
liquidity and certain expenses), in support of the reportable 
operating segments, as well as our investment portfolio and 
affiliated venture capital and private equity partnerships. In 
addition, Corporate includes all restructuring charges related to 
our efficiency initiatives. See Note 19 (Restructuring Charges) to 
Financial Statements in this Report for additional information on 
restructuring charges. Corporate also includes certain lines of

consistent with the long-term strategic goals of the Company, 
including our student loan and rail car leasing businesses, as well 
as results for previously divested businesses. In February 2021, 
we announced an agreement to sell Wells Fargo Asset 
Management and moved the business from the Wealth and 
Investment Management operating segment to Corporate. Prior 
period balances have been revised to conform with the current

Reflects results attributable to noncontrolling interests predominantly associated with the Company’s consolidated venture capital investments. 
Beginning in first quarter 2021, employees who were notified of displacement remained as headcount in their respective operating segment rather than included in Corporate. 

First quarter 2021 vs. first quarter 2020 

Revenue increased driven by: 
• 

higher gains on equity securities due to impairments in first 
quarter 2020 related to our affiliated venture capital and 
private equity partnerships; 
higher deferred compensation plan investment results 
(largely offset by personnel expense); and 
a gain on the sale of a portion of our student loan portfolio in 
first quarter 2021; 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower net interest income reflecting the lower interest rate 
environment and unfavorable hedge ineffectiveness 
accounting results; and 
lower gains on debt securities due to decreased sales 
volumes. 

Provision for credit losses decreased driven by an improving 
economic environment. 

Noninterest expense increased due to: 
• 

higher stock-based compensation on higher market 
valuations; 
higher deferred compensation plan expense; and 
a write-down of goodwill in first quarter 2021 related to the 
sale of a portion of our student loan portfolio;

As of March 31, 2021, our rail car leasing business had long-

lived operating lease assets (as a lessor) of $5.6 billion, which was 
net of $1.8 billion of accumulated depreciation. The average age 
of our rail cars is 21 years and the rail cars are typically leased 
under short-term leases of 3 to 5 years. Our three largest 
concentrations, which represented 55% of our rail car fleet as of 
March 31, 2021, were rail cars used for the transportation of 
agricultural grain, coal, and cement/sand products. Impairments 
may result in the future based on changing economic and market 
conditions affecting the long-term demand and utility of specific 
types of rail cars. Our assumptions for impairment are sensitive 
to estimated utilization and rental rates, as well as the estimated 
economic life of the leased asset. For more information on the 
accounting for impairment of operating lease assets, see Note 1 
(Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial 
Statements in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Corporate includes assets under management (AUM) and 
assets under administration (AUA) for Institutional Retirement 
and Trust (IRT) client assets of $22 billion and $668 billion, 
respectively, at March 31, 2021, which we continue to administer 
at the direction of the buyer pursuant to a transition services 
agreement. The transition services agreement has been 
extended and will now terminate no later than December 2021. 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower professional and outside services expense driven by 
reduced project spending due to efficiency initiatives.

Total assets (average and period-end) increased due to:

deposits from the reportable operating segments; and 
an increase in held-to-maturity debt securities related to

partially offset by: 
• 

a decline in available-for-sale debt securities related to 
portfolio rebalancing to manage liquidity and interest rate 
risk; 
a decline in equity securities due to the transition from 
equity securities to derivative instruments for economic 
hedges of the deferred compensation plan liabilities in 
second quarter 2020 and a reduction in Federal Home Loan 
Bank stock; and 
a decline in loans due to the sale of a portion of our student

Wells Fargo Asset Management (WFAM) Assets Under 
Management  We earn investment advisory and other asset-
based fees from managing and administering assets through 
WFAM, which offers Wells Fargo proprietary mutual funds and 
manages institutional separate accounts. Generally, we earn fees 
from AUM where we have discretionary management authority 
over the investments and generate fees as a percentage of the 
market value of the AUM. WFAM assets under management 
consist of equity, alternative, balanced, fixed income, money 
market, and stable value, and include client assets that are 
managed or sub-advised on behalf of other Wells Fargo lines of 
business. Table 5k presents WFAM AUM activity for first quarter 
2021 and 2020. Management believes that AUM is a useful 
metric because it allows management, investors, and others to 
assess how changes in asset amounts may impact the generation 
of certain asset-based fees.

Balance Sheet Analysis 

At March 31, 2021, our assets totaled $1.96 trillion, up 
$4.4 billion from December 31, 2020. 

The following discussion provides additional information 
about the major components of our consolidated balance sheet.

Represents amortized cost of the securities, net of the allowance for credit losses of $41 million and $28 million related to available-for-sale debt securities and $89 million and $41 million related to 
held-to-maturity debt securities at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020. 
Available-for-sale debt securities are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. 
Held-to-maturity debt securities are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses. 

The total net unrealized gains on AFS and HTM debt 
securities decreased from December 31, 2020, driven by higher 
interest rates, partially offset by tighter credit spreads. See Note 
3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities) to 
Financial Statements in this Report for additional information on 
AFS and HTM debt securities, including a summary of debt 
securities by security type. 

Loan Portfolios 
Table 7 provides a summary of total outstanding loans by 
portfolio segment. Commercial loans were relatively flat 
compared with December 31, 2020. Consumer loans decreased 
from December 31, 2020, due to: 
• 

paydowns exceeding originations in residential mortgage 
loans; and 
seasonally lower credit card balances.

available-for-sale (AFS) and held-to-maturity (HTM) debt 
securities. See the “Balance Sheet Analysis – Available-for-Sale 
and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities” section in our 2020 Form 
10-K for information on our investment management objectives 
and practices and the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability 
Management” section in this Report for information on liquidity 
and interest rate risk. 

The fair value of AFS debt securities decreased from 
December 31, 2020, as purchases were more than offset by 
runoff, sales and transfers to HTM debt securities due to actions 
taken to reposition the overall portfolio for capital management 
purposes. 

The net amortized cost of HTM debt securities increased 

from December 31, 2020, as purchases and transfers from AFS 
debt securities were partially offset by runoff. 

At March 31, 2021, 93% of the combined AFS and HTM debt 
securities portfolio was rated AA- or above. Ratings are based on 
external ratings where available and, where not available, based 
on internal credit grades.

Balance Sheet Analysis (continued) 

Deposits 
Deposits increased from December 31, 2020, reflecting: 
• 

consumer customers’ preferences for liquidity given the 
economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 
pandemic, government stimulus programs, and lower 
customer spending, as well as seasonality for items such as 
income tax refunds; 

partially offset by: 
• 

actions taken to manage under the asset cap resulting in 
declines in time deposits, such as brokered certificates of

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

In the ordinary course of business, we engage in financial 
transactions that are not recorded on the consolidated balance 
sheet, or may be recorded on the consolidated balance sheet in 
amounts that are different from the full contract or notional 
amount of the transaction. Our off-balance sheet arrangements 
include commitments to lend and purchase debt and equity 
securities, transactions with unconsolidated entities, guarantees, 
derivatives, and other commitments. These transactions are 
designed to (1) meet the financial needs of customers, (2) 
manage our credit, market or liquidity risks, and/or (3) diversify 
our funding sources. 

Commitments to Lend 
We enter into commitments to lend to customers, which are 
usually at a stated interest rate, if funded, and for specific 
purposes and time periods. When we enter into commitments, 
we are exposed to credit risk. The maximum credit risk for these 
commitments will generally be lower than the contractual 
amount because a significant portion of these commitments are 
not funded. For additional information, see Note 4 (Loans and 
Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in 
this Report. 

Transactions with Unconsolidated Entities 
In the normal course of business, we enter into various types of 
on- and off-balance sheet transactions with special purpose 
entities (SPEs), which are corporations, trusts, limited liability 
companies or partnerships that are established for a limited 
purpose. Generally, SPEs are formed in connection with 
securitization transactions and are considered variable interest 
entities (VIEs). For additional information, see Note 8 
(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Guarantees and Other Arrangements 
Guarantees are contracts that contingently require us to make 
payments to a guaranteed party based on an event or a change in 
an underlying asset, liability, rate or index. Guarantees are 
generally in the form of standby letters of credit, direct pay 
letters of credit, written options, recourse obligations, exchange 
and clearing house guarantees, indemnifications, and other types 
of similar arrangements. For additional information, see Note 11 
(Guarantees and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements 
in this Report. 

Commitments to Purchase Debt and Equity Securities 
We enter into commitments to purchase securities under resale 
agreements. We also may enter into commitments to purchase 
debt and equity securities to provide capital for customers’ 
funding, liquidity or other future needs. For additional 
information, see Note 11 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) 
to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Derivatives 
We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including 
interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to 
assist customers with their risk management objectives. 
Derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at 
fair value, and volume can be measured in terms of the notional 
amount, which is generally not exchanged, but is used only as the 
basis on which interest and other payments are determined. The 
notional amount is not recorded on the consolidated balance 
sheet and is not, when viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure 
of the risk profile of the instruments. For additional information, 
see Note 14 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Risk Management 

Wells Fargo manages a variety of risks that can significantly 
affect our financial performance and our ability to meet the 
expectations of our customers, shareholders, regulators and 
other stakeholders. For additional information about how we 
manage risk, see the “Risk Management” section in our 2020 
Form 10-K. The discussion that follows supplements our 
discussion of the management of certain risks contained in the 
“Risk Management” section in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Credit Risk Management 
We define credit risk as the risk of loss associated with a 
borrower or counterparty default (failure to meet obligations in 
accordance with agreed upon terms). Credit risk exists with many 
of our assets and exposures such as debt security holdings, 
certain derivatives, and loans. 

The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight 

responsibility for credit risk. A Credit Subcommittee of the Risk 
Committee assists the Risk Committee in providing oversight of 
credit risk. At the management level, Credit Risk, which is part of 
IRM, has oversight responsibility for credit risk. Credit Risk 
reports to the CRO and supports periodic reports related to 
credit risk provided to the Board’s Risk Committee or its Credit 
Subcommittee. 

Loan Portfolio 
Our loan portfolios represent the largest component of assets on 
our consolidated balance sheet for which we have credit risk. 
Table 9 presents our total loans outstanding by portfolio 
segment and class of financing receivable.

Our credit risk management oversight process is governed 

centrally, but provides for direct management and accountability 
by our lines of business. Our overall credit process includes 
comprehensive credit policies, disciplined credit underwriting, 
frequent and detailed risk measurement and modeling, extensive 
credit training programs, and a continual loan review and audit 
process. 

A key to our credit risk management is adherence to a well-
controlled underwriting process, which we believe is appropriate 
for the needs of our customers as well as investors who purchase 
the loans or securities collateralized by the loans. 

Credit Quality Overview  Credit quality in first quarter 2021 
reflected continued improvement in the economic environment. 
In particular: 
•  Nonaccrual loans were $8.1 billion at March 31, 2021, down 
from $8.7 billion at December 31, 2020. Commercial 
nonaccrual loans decreased to $4.2 billion at March 31, 
2021, compared with $4.8 billion at December 31, 2020, and 
consumer nonaccrual loans declined to $3.8 billion at 
March 31, 2021, compared with $3.9 billion at December 31, 
2020. Nonaccrual loans represented 0.93% of total loans at 
March 31, 2021, compared with 0.98% at December 31, 
2020. 

•  Net loan charge-offs as a percentage of our average 

commercial and consumer loan portfolios were 0.13% and 
0.37%, respectively, in first quarter 2021, compared with 
0.25% and 0.53% in first quarter 2020. 
Loans that are not government insured/guaranteed and 
90 days or more past due and still accruing were 
$269 million and $598 million in our commercial and 
consumer portfolios, respectively, at March 31, 2021, 
compared with $78 million and $612 million at 
December 31, 2020.

We manage our credit risk by establishing what we believe 

are sound credit policies for underwriting new business, while 
monitoring and reviewing the performance of our existing loan 
portfolios. We employ various credit risk management and 
monitoring activities to mitigate risks associated with multiple 
risk factors affecting loans we hold including: 

•  Our provision for credit losses for loans was $(1.1) billion in 
first quarter 2021, compared with $3.8 billion for the same 
period a year ago. 
The ACL for loans decreased to $18.0 billion, or 2.09% of 
total loans, at March 31, 2021, compared with $19.7 billion, 
or 2.22%, at December 31, 2020. 

•

quality trends follows.

COVID-Related Lending Accommodations  During 2020, we 
provided accommodations to customers in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, including payment deferrals, and other 
expanded assistance for mortgage, credit card, auto, small 
business, personal and commercial lending customers. With the 
exception of residential mortgage-related accommodation 
programs, the COVID-related lending accommodations 
instituted during 2020 were no longer offered as of December 
31, 2020. Residential mortgage accommodation programs, 
which continued during first quarter 2021, offered payment 
deferrals for up to a total of 18 months. Table 10 summarizes the 
unpaid principal balance (UPB) of consumer loans that received 
accommodations under loan modification programs established 
to assist customers with the economic impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic (COVID-related modifications) and that remained in a 
deferral period as of March 31, 2021. 

Based on guidance in the CARES Act and the Interagency 

Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial 
Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus 
(Revised) issued by federal banking regulators in April 2020 (the 
Interagency Statement), both of which we elected to apply, loan 
modifications related to COVID-19 and that meet certain other 
criteria are exempt from troubled debt restructuring (TDR) 
classification. Additionally, our election to apply the TDR relief 
provided by the CARES Act and the Interagency Statement 
impacts our regulatory capital ratios as these loan modifications

related to COVID-19 are not adjusted to a higher risk-weighting 
normally required with TDR classification. At March 31, 2021, 
substantially all residential mortgage loans that were in a deferral 
period, excluding those that were government insured/ 
guaranteed, met the criteria for TDR relief and were therefore 
not classified as TDRs. For additional information regarding the

Customer payment deferral activities instituted in response 

to the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to delay the 
recognition of net charge-offs, delinquencies, and nonaccrual 
status for those customers who would have otherwise moved 
into past due or nonaccrual status. Customer loans that are not 
further modified upon exit from the deferral period may be 
placed on nonaccrual status or charged-off in accordance with 
our policies if customers are unable to resume making payments 
in accordance with the contractual terms of their agreement. As 
of March 31, 2021, substantially all of our consumer loans were 
current after exiting the deferral period. For additional 
information about our COVID-related modifications, see the

Significant Loan Portfolio Reviews  Measuring and monitoring 
our credit risk is an ongoing process that tracks delinquencies, 
collateral values, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores, economic 
trends by geographic areas, loan-level risk grading for certain 
portfolios (typically commercial) and other indications of credit 
risk. Our credit risk monitoring process is designed to enable 
early identification of developing risk and to support our 
determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses. The 
following discussion provides additional characteristics and 
analysis of our significant portfolios. See Note 4 (Loans and 
Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in 
this Report for more analysis and credit metric information for 
each of the following portfolios. 

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASE FINANCING  For 
purposes of portfolio risk management, we aggregate 
commercial and industrial loans and lease financing according 
to market segmentation and standard industry codes. We 
generally subject commercial and industrial loans and lease 

financing to individual risk assessment using our internal 
borrower and collateral quality ratings. Our ratings are aligned to 
regulatory definitions of pass and criticized categories with 
criticized segmented among special mention, substandard, 
doubtful and loss categories. 

We had $18.0 billion of the commercial and industrial loan 
and lease financing portfolio internally classified as criticized in 
accordance with regulatory guidance at March 31, 2021, 
compared with $19.3 billion at December 31, 2020. The change 
was driven by decreases in the oil, gas and pipelines, technology, 
telecom and media, and financials except banks industries 
reflecting improvement in the economic environment. 

The majority of our commercial and industrial loans and 
lease financing portfolio is secured by short-term assets, such as 
accounts receivable, inventory and debt securities, as well as 
long-lived assets, such as equipment and other business assets. 
Generally, the primary source of repayment for this portfolio is 
the operating cash flows of customers, with the collateral

(2)  No other single industry had total loans in excess of $3.8 billion at both March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020. 

Loans to financials except banks, our largest industry 

concentration, is predominantly comprised of loans to 
investment firms, financial vehicles, and nonbank creditors. We 
had $84.5 billion and $80.0 billion of loans originated by our 
Asset Backed Finance (ABF) and Financial Institution Group (FIG) 
lines of business at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, 
respectively. These loans include: (i) loans to customers related 
to their subscription or capital calls, (ii) loans to nonbank lenders 
collateralized by commercial loans, and (iii) loans to originators or 
servicers of financial assets collateralized by residential real 
estate or other consumer loans such as credit cards, auto loans 
and leases, student loans and other financial assets eligible for 
the securitization market. These ABF and FIG loans are limited to 
a percentage of the value of the underlying financial assets 
considering underlying credit risk, asset duration, and ongoing 
performance. These ABF and FIG loans may also have other 
features to manage credit risk such as cross-collateralization, 
credit enhancements, and contractual re-margining of collateral 
supporting the loans. In addition, loans to financials except banks 
included collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) in loan form, all of 
which were rated AA or above, of $8.1 billion and $7.9 billion at 
March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. We had a 
prime brokerage relationship with Archegos Capital 
Management, which was closed out as of March 31, 2021. We did 
not experience losses related to closing out our exposure. 

Oil, gas and pipelines loans included $6.8 billion and 
$7.5 billion of senior secured loans outstanding at March 31, 
2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. Oil, gas and 

pipelines nonaccrual loans decreased at March 31, 2021, 
compared with December 31, 2020, driven by loan payoffs. 

We continue to perform escalated credit monitoring for 

certain industries that we consider to be directly and 
most adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Our commercial and industrial loans and lease financing 

portfolio also includes non-U.S. loans of $70.1 billion and 
$63.8 billion at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, 
respectively. Significant industry concentrations of non-U.S. 
loans at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively, 
included: 
• 

$42.5 billion and $36.2 billion in the financials except banks 
category; 
$13.0 billion and $12.8 billion in the banks category; and 
$1.7 billion and $1.6 billion in the oil, gas and pipelines 
category.

center property types and reflected the economic impact of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the significant uncertainty related 
to the duration and severity of the economic impact of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, the credit quality of certain property types 
within our CRE loan portfolio, such as retail, hotel/motel, office 
buildings, and shopping centers, could continue to be adversely 
affected. 

The total CRE loan portfolio decreased $794 million from 
December 31, 2020, driven by a decrease in CRE mortgage loans 
predominantly related to the office, retail (excluding shopping 

center), and shopping center property types. The CRE loan 
portfolio included $8.7 billion of non-U.S. CRE loans at 
March 31, 2021. The portfolio is diversified both geographically 
and by property type. The largest geographic concentrations of 
CRE loans are in California, New York, Florida and Texas, which

Risk Management – Credit Risk Management (continued) 

NON-U.S. LOANS  Our classification of non-U.S. loans is based on 
whether the borrower’s primary address is outside of the United 
States. At March 31, 2021, non-U.S. loans totaled $79.1 billion, 
representing approximately 9% of our total consolidated loans 
outstanding, compared with $72.9 billion, or approximately 8% of 
our total consolidated loans outstanding, at December 31, 2020. 
Non-U.S. loans were approximately 4% of our total consolidated 
assets at both March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020. 

COUNTRY RISK EXPOSURE  Our country risk monitoring process 
incorporates centralized monitoring of economic, political, social, 
legal, and transfer risks in countries where we do or plan to do 
business, along with frequent dialogue with our customers, 
counterparties and regulatory agencies. We establish exposure 
limits for each country through a centralized oversight process 
based on customer needs, and through consideration of the 
relevant and distinct risk of each country. We monitor exposures 
closely and adjust our country limits in response to changing 
conditions. We evaluate our individual country risk exposure 
based on our assessment of the borrower’s ability to repay, which 
gives consideration for allowable transfers of risk, such as 
guarantees and collateral, and may be different from the 
reporting based on the borrower’s primary address. 

Table 13:  Select Country Exposures 

Our largest single country exposure outside the U.S. at 

March 31, 2021, was the United Kingdom, which totaled 
$36.1 billion, or approximately 2% of our total assets, and 
included $8.8 billion of sovereign claims. Our United Kingdom 
sovereign claims arise predominantly from deposits we have 
placed with the Bank of England pursuant to regulatory 
requirements in support of our London branch. 

Table 13 provides information regarding our top 20 
exposures by country (excluding the U.S.), based on our 
assessment of risk, which gives consideration to the country of 
any guarantors and/or underlying collateral. With respect to 
Table 13: 
• 

Lending and deposits exposure includes outstanding loans, 
unfunded credit commitments, and deposits with non-U.S. 
banks. These balances are presented prior to the deduction 
of allowance for credit losses or collateral received under the 
terms of the credit agreements, if any. 
Securities exposure represents debt and equity securities of 
non-U.S. issuers. Long and short positions are netted, and 
net short positions are reflected as negative exposure. 
•  Derivatives and other exposure represents foreign exchange 
contracts, derivative contracts, securities resale agreements, 
and securities lending agreements.

Total non-sovereign exposure comprised $46.8 billion exposure to financial institutions and $43.5 billion to non-financial corporations at March 31, 2021. 

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS  Our residential mortgage loan 
portfolio is comprised of 1-4 family first and junior lien mortgage 
loans. Residential mortgage – first lien loans comprised 92% of 
the total residential mortgage loan portfolio at both March 31, 
2021, and December 31, 2020. 

The residential mortgage loan portfolio includes some loans 

with adjustable-rate features and some with an interest-only 
feature as part of the loan terms. Interest-only loans were 
approximately 3% of total loans at both March 31, 2021, and 
December 31, 2020. We believe our origination process 
appropriately addresses our adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) 
reset risk across our residential mortgage loan portfolios and our 
ACL for loans considers this risk. We do not offer option ARM 
products, nor do we offer variable-rate mortgage products with 

fixed payment amounts, commonly referred to within the 
financial services industry as negative amortizing mortgage 
loans. 

We continue to modify residential mortgage loans to assist 

homeowners and other borrowers experiencing financial 
difficulties. For additional information on our modification 
programs, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management 
– Residential Mortgage Loans” section in our 2020 Form 10-K. 
For additional information on customer accommodations, 
including loan modifications, in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management 
– COVID-Related Lending Accommodations” section in this 
Report.

We monitor changes in real estate values and underlying 
economic or market conditions for all geographic areas of our 
residential mortgage portfolios as part of our credit risk 
management process. Our underwriting and periodic review of 
loans and lines secured by residential real estate collateral 
includes original appraisals adjusted for the change in Home Price 
Index (HPI) or estimates from automated valuation models 
(AVMs) to support property values. Additional information about 
appraisals, AVMs, and our policy for their use can be found in 
Note 4 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to 
Financial Statements in this Report and the “Risk Management – 
Credit Risk Management – Residential Mortgage Loans” section 
in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Part of our credit monitoring includes tracking delinquency, 
current FICO scores and loan/combined loan to collateral values 
(LTV/CLTV) on the entire residential mortgage loan portfolio. 
Excluding government insured/guaranteed loans, these credit 
risk indicators on the residential mortgage portfolio were: 

• 

• 

Loans 30 days or more delinquent at March 31, 2021, 
totaled $4.1 billion, or 1% of total mortgages, compared 
with $4.7 billion, or 2%, at December 31, 2020. Customer 
payment deferral activities instituted in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic could continue to delay the recognition 
of delinquencies; 
Loans with FICO scores lower than 640 totaled $4.9 billion, 
or 2% of total mortgages at March 31, 2021, compared with 
$5.6 billion, or 2%, at December 31, 2020; and 

•  Mortgages with a LTV/CLTV greater than 100% totaled 

$1.3 billion at March 31, 2021, or less than 1% of total 
mortgages, compared with $1.6 billion, or 1%, at December 
31, 2020. 

Information regarding credit quality indicators can be found 

in Note 4 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to

Residential Mortgage – First Lien Portfolio  Our total residential 
mortgage – first lien portfolio decreased $22.3 billion from 
December 31, 2020, driven by loan paydowns as a result of the 
low interest rate environment and the transfer of $5.9 billion of 
first lien mortgage loans to loans held for sale (LHFS), partially 
offset by originations of $12.5 billion.

Residential Mortgage – Junior Lien Portfolio  The residential 
mortgage – junior lien portfolio consists of residential mortgage 
lines and loans that are subordinate in rights to an existing lien on 
the same property. It is not unusual for these lines and loans to 
have draw periods, interest-only payments, balloon payments, 
adjustable rates and similar features. Junior lien loan products are 
primarily amortizing payment loans with fixed interest rates and 
repayment periods between five to 30 years. We continuously 
monitor the credit performance of our residential mortgage – 
junior lien portfolio for trends and factors that influence the 

frequency and severity of losses, such as residential mortgage – 
junior lien performance when the residential mortgage – first lien 
loan is delinquent. 

The decrease in the residential mortgage – junior lien 

portfolio at March 31, 2021, compared with December 31, 2020, 
reflected loan paydowns. Beginning in second quarter 2020, we 
suspended the origination of residential mortgage – junior lien 
loans. Table 16 shows certain delinquency and loss information 
for the residential mortgage – junior lien portfolio and lists the 
top five states by outstanding balance.

CLTV represents the ratio of the total loan balance of first 

and junior lien mortgages (including unused line amounts for 
credit line products) to property collateral value. For additional 
information on consumer loans by LTV/CLTV, see Table 4.11 in 
Note 4 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

As of March 31, 2021, with respect to loans in the residential 
mortgage – junior lien portfolio that had a CLTV ratio in excess of 
100%: 
• 

such loans totaled 3% of the outstanding balance of the 
residential mortgage – junior lien portfolio; 
2% were 30 days or more past due. Customer payment 
deferral activities instituted in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic could continue to delay the recognition of 
delinquencies; and 
the unsecured portion (the outstanding amount that was in 
excess of the most recent property collateral value) of the 
outstanding balances of these loans totaled 1% of the 
residential mortgage – junior lien portfolio.

Residential Mortgage – Junior Lien Line and Loan and 
Residential Mortgage – First Lien Line  Our junior lien, as well as 
first lien, lines of credit portfolios generally have draw periods of 
10, 15 or 20 years with variable interest rate and payment 
options available during the draw period of (1) interest-only or 
(2) 1.5% of outstanding principal balance plus accrued interest. 
As of March 31, 2021, lines of credit in a draw period primarily 
used the interest-only option. 

During the draw period, the borrower has the option of 
converting all or a portion of the line from a variable interest rate 
to a fixed rate with terms including interest-only payments for a 
fixed period between three to seven years or a fully amortizing 
payment with a fixed period between five to 30 years. At the end 
of the draw period, a line of credit generally converts to an 
amortizing payment schedule with repayment terms of up to 
30 years based on the balance at time of conversion. Certain lines 
and loans have been structured with a balloon payment, which 
requires full repayment of the outstanding balance at the end of 
the term period. The conversion of lines or loans to fully 
amortizing or balloon payoff may result in a significant payment 

increase, which can affect some borrowers’ ability to repay the 
outstanding balance. 

The lines that enter their amortization period may 

experience higher delinquencies and higher loss rates than the 
ones in their draw or term period. We have considered this 
increased risk in our ACL for loans estimate. 

In anticipation of our borrowers reaching the end of their 
contractual commitment, we have created a program to inform, 
educate and help these borrowers transition from interest-only 
to fully-amortizing payments or full repayment. We monitor the 
performance of the borrowers moving through the program in an 
effort to refine our ongoing program strategy. 

Table 17 reflects the outstanding balance of our portfolio of 
residential mortgage – junior liens, including lines and loans, and 
residential mortgage – first lien lines segregated into scheduled 
end of draw or end-of-term periods and products that are 
currently amortizing, or in balloon repayment status. The 
unfunded credit commitments for residential mortgage – junior 
and first lien lines totaled $51.9 billion at March 31, 2021.

Substantially all lines and loans are scheduled to convert to amortizing loans by the end of 2030, with annual scheduled amounts through 2030 ranging from $1.0 billion to $3.5 billion and averaging 
$1.8 billion per year. 
Includes $69 million of end-of-term balloon payments which were past due. 

At March 31, 2021, $344 million, or 2%, of lines in their draw 

period were 30 days or more past due, compared with 
$351 million, or 5%, of amortizing lines of credit. Customer 
payment deferral activities instituted in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic could continue to delay the recognition of 
delinquencies. On a monthly basis, we monitor the payment 
characteristics of borrowers in our residential mortgage – first 
and junior lien lines of credit portfolios. In March 2021, excluding 
borrowers with COVID-related loan modification payment 
deferrals: 
• 

Approximately 42% of these borrowers paid only the 
minimum amount due and approximately 53% paid more 
than the minimum amount due. The rest were either 
delinquent or paid less than the minimum amount due. 
For the borrowers with an interest-only payment feature, 
approximately 27% paid only the minimum amount due and 
approximately 69% paid more than the minimum amount 
due. 

• 

CREDIT CARD  Our credit card portfolio totaled $34.2 billion at 
March 31, 2021, compared with $36.7 billion at December 31, 
2020. The decrease in the outstanding balance at March 31, 
2021, compared with December 31, 2020, was driven by 
seasonal paydowns. 

AUTO  Our auto portfolio totaled $49.2 billion at March 31, 2021, 
compared with $48.2 billion at December 31, 2020. The 
outstanding balance at March 31, 2021, compared with 
December 31, 2020, increased slightly as originations exceeded 
paydowns. 

OTHER CONSUMER  Other consumer loans, which include 
revolving credit and installment loans, totaled $24.9 billion at 
March 31, 2021, compared with $24.4 billion at December 31,

Residential mortgage loans predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA are not placed on nonaccrual status because they are insured or guaranteed. 
Consistent with regulatory reporting requirements, foreclosed real estate resulting from government insured/guaranteed loans are classified as nonperforming. Both principal and interest related to 
these foreclosed real estate assets are collectible because the loans were predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA. Receivables related to the foreclosure of certain government 
guaranteed real estate mortgage loans are excluded from this table and included in Accounts Receivable in Other Assets. For additional information on foreclosed assets, see Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Commercial nonaccrual loans decreased $549 million from 

December 31, 2020, driven by a decline in commercial and 
industrial nonaccrual loans in the oil, gas and pipelines industry 
reflecting improvement in the economic environment. For 
additional information on commercial and industrial nonaccrual 
loans, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – 
Commercial and Industrial Loans and Lease Financing” section in 
this Report. 

Consumer nonaccrual loans decreased $124 million from 

December 31, 2020, driven by a decline in residential mortgage 
nonaccrual loans.

Table 20 provides an analysis of the changes in nonaccrual 

loans. Typically, changes to nonaccrual loans period-over-period 
represent inflows for loans that are placed on nonaccrual status 
in accordance with our policies, offset by reductions for loans 
that are paid down, charged off, sold, foreclosed, or are no longer 

Table 20:  Analysis of Changes in Nonaccrual Loans 

classified as nonaccrual as a result of continued performance and 
an improvement in the borrower’s financial condition and loan 
repayment capabilities.

We believe exposure to loss on nonaccrual loans is mitigated 

by the following factors at March 31, 2021: 
• 

94% of total commercial nonaccrual loans and 99% of total 
consumer nonaccrual loans are secured. Of the consumer 
nonaccrual loans, 94% are secured by real estate and 91% 
have a combined LTV (CLTV) ratio of 80% or less. 
losses of $661 million and $1.0 billion have already been 
recognized on 16% of commercial nonaccrual loans and 30% 
of consumer nonaccrual loans, respectively, in accordance 
with our charge-off policies. Once we write down loans to 
the net realizable value (fair value of collateral less estimated 
costs to sell), we re-evaluate each loan regularly and record 
additional write-downs if needed. 
75% of commercial nonaccrual loans were current on 
interest and 66% of commercial nonaccrual loans were 
current on both principal and interest, but were on 
nonaccrual status because the full or timely collection of 
interest or principal had become uncertain.

of the $1.1 billion of consumer loans in bankruptcy or 
discharged in bankruptcy, and classified as nonaccrual, 
$723 million were current. 
the remaining risk of loss of all nonaccrual loans has been 
considered in developing our allowance for loan losses. 

We continue to work with our customers experiencing 
financial difficulty to determine if they can qualify for a loan 
modification. Under our proprietary modification programs, 
customers may be required to provide updated documentation, 
and some programs require completion of payment during trial 
periods to demonstrate sustained performance before the loan 
can be removed from nonaccrual status.

Foreclosed government insured/guaranteed loans are temporarily transferred to and held by us as servicer, until reimbursement is received from FHA or VA. 
Includes loans moved into foreclosed assets from nonaccrual status and repossessed autos. 

Foreclosed assets at March 31, 2021, included $59 million of 
foreclosed residential real estate, of which 28% is predominantly 
FHA insured or VA guaranteed and expected to have minimal or 
no loss content. The remaining amount of foreclosed assets has 
been written down to estimated net realizable value. Of the 
$140 million in foreclosed assets at March 31, 2021, 56% have 
been in the foreclosed assets portfolio for one year or less. 
As part of our actions to support customers during the 

COVID-19 pandemic, we have temporarily suspended certain 
mortgage foreclosure activities, which has affected the amount 
of our foreclosed assets. For additional information on loans in 
process of foreclosure, see Note 4 (Loans and Related Allowance 
for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs)  Table 22 provides 
information regarding the recorded investment of loans 
modified in TDRs. TDRs at March 31, 2021, decreased, compared 
with December 31, 2020, due to paydowns primarily in the 
commercial and industrial portfolio. The amount of our TDRs at 
March 31, 2021, would have otherwise been higher without the 
TDR relief provided by the CARES Act and Interagency 
Statement.

In those situations where principal is forgiven, the entire 
amount of such forgiveness is immediately charged off. When we 
delay the timing on the repayment of a portion of principal 
(principal forbearance), we charge off the amount of forbearance 
if that amount is not considered fully collectible. The allowance 
for loan losses for TDRs was $509 million and $565 million at 
March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. As part of 
our actions to support customers during the COVID-19 
pandemic, we have provided borrowers relief in the form of loan 
modifications. Under the CARES Act and the Interagency 
Statement, loan modifications related to the COVID-19 
pandemic will not be classified as TDRs if they meet certain 
eligibility criteria. For additional information on the CARES Act 

and the Interagency Statement, see the “Risk Management – 
Credit Risk Management – Credit Quality Overview – COVID-
Related Lending Accommodations” section in this Report. 
For information on our nonaccrual policies when a 

restructuring is involved, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk 
Management – Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs)” section in 
our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Table 23 provides an analysis of the changes in TDRs. Loans 
modified more than once as a TDR are reported as inflows only in 
the period they are first modified. In addition to foreclosures, 
sales and transfers to held for sale, we may remove loans from 
TDR classification, but only if they have been refinanced or 
restructured at market terms and qualify as a new loan.

Inflows include loans that modify, even if they resolve within the period, as well as gross advances on term loans that modified in a prior period and net advances on revolving TDRs that modified in a 
prior period. 

(2)  Other outflows include normal amortization/accretion of loan basis adjustments and loans transferred to held for sale. Occasionally, loans that have been refinanced or restructured at market terms 

qualify as new loans, which are also included as other outflows. 

(3)  Net change in trial modifications includes: inflows of new TDRs entering the trial payment period, net of outflows for modifications that either (i) successfully perform and enter into a permanent 

modification, or (ii) did not successfully perform according to the terms of the trial period plan and are subsequently charged-off, foreclosed upon or otherwise resolved.

90 days or more past due are still accruing if they are (1) well-
secured and in the process of collection or (2) residential 
mortgage loans or consumer loans exempt under regulatory 
rules from being classified as nonaccrual until later delinquency,

Represents loans whose repayments are predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA. 

Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing, excluding 
government insured/guaranteed loans, at March 31, 2021, were 
up from December 31, 2020, due to an increase in delinquent 
commercial real estate mortgage and construction loans. 
Customer payment deferral activities instituted in response to 
the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to delay the recognition 
of delinquencies for customers who would have otherwise moved 
into past due status. 

Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing whose 
repayments are largely insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the 
VA for mortgages at March 31, 2021, were down from 
December 31, 2020, consistent with the overall decrease in 
residential mortgage loans.

We apply a disciplined process and methodology to establish 

our ACL each quarter. The process for establishing the ACL for 
loans takes into consideration many factors, including historical 
and forecasted loss trends, loan-level credit quality ratings and 
loan grade-specific characteristics. The process involves 
subjective and complex judgments. In addition, we review a 
variety of credit metrics and trends. These credit metrics and 
trends, however, do not solely determine the amount of the 
allowance as we use several analytical tools. For additional 
information on our ACL, see the “Critical Accounting Policies – 
Allowance for Credit Losses” section and Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 
2020 Form 10-K. For additional information on our ACL for 
loans, see Note 4 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit 
Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report, and for additional 
information on our ACL for debt securities, see the “Balance 
Sheet Analysis – Available-For-Sale and Held-To-Maturity Debt 
Securities” section and Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-
Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

quarter 2021, compared with the prior quarter, was driven by: 
• 

lower commercial and industrial loan losses primarily in the 
oil, gas and pipelines industry; and 
lower commercial real estate mortgage loan losses primarily 
in the shopping center property type. 

• 

The increase in consumer net loan charge-offs in first 
quarter 2021, compared with the prior quarter, was driven by: 
credit card customers who exited deferral programs; and 
• 
additional losses in other consumer loans due to the sale of a 
• 
portion of our student loan portfolio. 

The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact the credit 
quality of our loan portfolio. Although the potential impacts were 
considered in our allowance for credit losses for loans, payment 
deferral activities instituted in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic could continue to delay the recognition of net loan 
charge-offs. For additional information on customer 
accommodations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, see 
the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – COVID-
Related Lending Accommodations” section in this Report. 

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  We maintain an allowance for 
credit losses (ACL) for loans, which is management’s estimate of 
the expected credit losses in the loan portfolio and unfunded 
credit commitments, at the balance sheet date, excluding loans 
and unfunded credit commitments carried at fair value or held 
for sale. Additionally, we maintain an ACL for debt securities 
classified as either AFS or HTM, other financial assets measured 
at amortized cost, net investments in leases, and other off-
balance sheet credit exposures.

Disclosure is not comparative due to our adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial 
Instruments (CECL) on January 1, 2020. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2020 Form 10-K. 
Total net loan charge-offs are annualized for the quarter ended March 31, 2021. 

The ratios for the allowance for loan losses and the ACL for 
loans presented in Table 26 may fluctuate from period to period 
due to such factors as the mix of loan types in the portfolio, 
borrower credit strength, and the value and marketability of 
collateral. 

The ACL for loans decreased $1.7 billion, or 8%, from 
December 31, 2020, reflecting continued improvement in the 
economic environment. Total provision for credit losses for loans 
was $(1.1) billion in first quarter 2021, compared with $3.8 billion 
in the same period a year ago, reflecting lower net charge-offs 
and improvement in the economic environment. The detail of the 
changes in the ACL for loans by portfolio segment (including 
charge-offs and recoveries by loan class) is included in Note 4 
(Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

We consider multiple economic scenarios to develop our 

estimate of the ACL for loans. The scenarios generally include a 
base scenario, along with an optimistic (upside) and one or more 
pessimistic (downside) scenarios. Our estimate of the ACL for 
loans at March 31, 2021, was based on a weighting of the base 
and a downside economic scenario of 50% and 50%, respectively, 
with no weighting applied to an upside scenario. The base 
scenario assumed economic improvements in the near term with 
a return to normalized levels near the end of 2022. The downside 
scenario assumed more sustained adverse economic impacts 
resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with the base 
scenario. The downside scenario assumed U.S. real GDP growth 

rates increasing in the near term followed by a decline with a 
return to normalized levels after 2023 and a sustained elevation 
in the U.S. unemployment rate until late 2022. We considered 
within each scenario our expectations for the impact of customer 
accommodation activity, as well as the estimated impact on 
certain industries that we consider to be directly and most 
adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

In addition to quantitative estimates, we consider qualitative 

factors that represent risks inherent in our processes and 
assumptions such as economic environmental factors, modeling 
assumptions and performance, and other subjective factors, 
including industry trends and emerging risk assessments. We 
also considered the significant uncertainty related to the 
duration and severity of the economic impacts from the 
COVID-19 pandemic and the incremental risks to our loan 
portfolio. 

The forecasted key economic variables used in our estimate 
of the ACL for loans at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, 
are presented in Table 27.

Future amounts of the ACL for loans will be based on a 
variety of factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit 
quality and mix changes, and changes in general economic 
conditions and expectations (including for unemployment and 
GDP), among other factors. We observed economic 
improvements in first quarter 2021; however, there remained 
significant uncertainty related to the length and severity of the 
economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of 
other factors that may influence the level of eventual losses and 
corresponding requirements for future amounts of the ACL, 
including the impact of economic stimulus programs and 
customer accommodation activity. The COVID-19 pandemic 
could continue to impact the recognition of credit losses in our 
loan portfolios and may result in increases in our ACL, particularly 
if the impact on the economy worsens. 

We believe the ACL for loans of $18.0 billion at March 31, 

2021, was appropriate to cover expected credit losses, including 
unfunded credit commitments, at that date. The entire allowance 
is available to absorb credit losses from the total loan portfolio. 
The ACL for loans is subject to change and reflects existing 
factors as of the date of determination, including economic or 
market conditions and ongoing internal and external examination 
processes. Due to the sensitivity of the ACL for loans to changes 
in the economic and business environment, it is possible that we 
will incur incremental credit losses not anticipated as of the 
balance sheet date. Our process for determining the ACL is 
discussed in the “Critical Accounting Policies – Allowance for 
Credit Losses” section and Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2020 Form 
10-K. 

LIABILITY FOR MORTGAGE LOAN REPURCHASE LOSSES  For 
information on our repurchase liability, see the “Risk 
Management – Credit Risk Management – Liability For Mortgage 
Loan Repurchase Losses” section in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

RISKS RELATING TO SERVICING ACTIVITIES  In addition to servicing 
loans in our portfolio, we act as servicer and/or master servicer of 
residential mortgage loans included in GSE-guaranteed 
mortgage securitizations, GNMA-guaranteed mortgage 
securitizations of FHA-insured/VA-guaranteed mortgages and 

private label mortgage securitizations, as well as for 
unsecuritized loans owned by institutional investors. 

As a servicer, we are required to advance certain delinquent 

payments of principal and interest on mortgage loans we service. 
The amount and timing of reimbursement of advances of 
delinquent payments vary by investor and the applicable 
servicing agreements. Due to continued customer requests for 
payment deferrals as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
amount of our servicing advances of principal and interest 
remained elevated. The amount of these advances may continue 
to increase if additional payment deferrals are provided. Payment 
deferrals also delay the collection of contractually specified 
servicing fees, resulting in lower net servicing income. 

Upon transfer as servicer, we retain the option to repurchase 

loans from GNMA loan securitization pools, which becomes 
exercisable when three scheduled loan payments remain unpaid 
by the borrower. We generally repurchase these loans for cash 
and as a result, our total consolidated assets do not change. As a 
result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our repurchases of these loans 
were elevated in 2020 but returned to more normalized levels in 
first quarter 2021. 

Repurchased loans that regain current status or are 
otherwise modified in accordance with applicable servicing 
guidelines may be included in future GNMA loan securitization 
pools. However, in accordance with guidance issued by GNMA, 
certain loans repurchased after June 30, 2020, are ineligible for 
inclusion in future GNMA loan securitization pools until the 
borrower has timely made six consecutive payments. This 
requirement may delay our ability to resell loans into the 
securitization market. 

For additional information about the risks related to our 
servicing activities, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk 
Management – Risks Relating to Servicing Activities” section in 
our 2020 Form 10-K. For additional information on mortgage 
banking activities, see Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Asset/Liability Management 
Asset/liability management involves evaluating, monitoring and 
managing interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity and funding. For 
information on our oversight of asset/liability risks, see the “Risk

INTEREST RATE RISK  Interest rate risk is created in our role as a 
financial intermediary for customers based on investments such 
as loans and other extensions of credit and debt securities. 
Interest rate risk can have a significant impact to our earnings. 
We are subject to interest rate risk because: 
• 

assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different 
times. If assets reprice faster than liabilities and interest 
rates are generally rising, earnings will initially increase; 
assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by 
different amounts; 
short-term and long-term market interest rates may change 
by different amounts. For example, the shape of the yield 
curve may affect yield for new loans and funding costs 
differently; 
the remaining maturity for various assets or liabilities may 
shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. For example, if 
long-term mortgage interest rates increase sharply, MBS 
held in the debt securities portfolio may pay down at a 
slower rate than anticipated, which could impact portfolio 
income; or

• 

interest rates may have a direct or indirect effect on loan 
demand, collateral values, credit losses, mortgage 
origination volume, and the fair value of MSRs and other 
financial instruments. 

Currently, our profile is such that we project net interest 
income will benefit from higher interest rates as our assets would 
reprice faster and to a greater degree than our liabilities, while in 
the case of lower interest rates, our assets would reprice 
downward and to a greater degree than our liabilities resulting in 
lower net interest income. 

We assess interest rate risk by comparing outcomes under 

various net interest income simulations using many interest rate 
scenarios that differ in the direction of interest rate changes, the 
degree of change over time, the speed of change and the 
projected shape of the yield curve. These simulations require 
assumptions regarding drivers of earnings and balance sheet 
composition such as loan originations, prepayment speeds on 
loans and debt securities, deposit flows and mix, as well as pricing 
strategies. 

Our most recent simulations, as presented in Table 28, 
estimate net interest income sensitivity over the next 12 months 
using instantaneous movements across the yield curve with both 
lower and higher interest rates relative to our base scenario. 
Steeper and flatter scenarios measure non-parallel changes in 
the yield curve, with long-term interest rates defined as all tenors 
three years and longer (e.g., 10-year U.S. Treasury securities) and 
short-term interest rates defined as all tenors less than three 
years. Where applicable, U.S. dollar interest rates are floored at 
0.00%. The following describes the simulation assumptions for 
the scenarios presented in Table 28: 
• 

Simulations are dynamic and reflect anticipated changes to 
our assets and liabilities. 

•  Other macroeconomic variables that could be correlated 
with the changes in interest rates are held constant. 
•  Mortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary 

across scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or 
lower interest rates. 

•  Our base scenario deposit forecast incorporates mix changes 
consistent with the base interest rate trajectory. Deposit 
mix is modeled to be the same as in the base scenario across 
the alternative scenarios. In higher interest rate scenarios, 
customer activity that shifts balances into higher-yielding 
products could reduce expected net interest income. 
•  We hold the size of the projected debt and equity securities 

portfolios constant across scenarios.

The sensitivity results above do not capture noninterest 

income or expense impacts. Our interest rate sensitive 
noninterest income and expense are predominantly driven by 
mortgage banking activities, and may move in the opposite 
direction of our net interest income. See the “Risk Management 

– Asset/Liability Management – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate 
and Market Risk” section in our 2020 Form 10-K for additional 
information. For additional information on our trading assets and 
liabilities, see Note 2 (Trading Activities) to Financial Statements 
in this Report. 

We use the debt securities portfolio and exchange-traded 

and over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives to manage 
our interest rate exposures. See Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies), Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-
Maturity Debt Securities) and Note 14 (Derivatives) to Financial 
Statements in our 2020 Form 10-K for additional information. 

MORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK  We 
originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subjects us to 
various risks, including credit, liquidity and interest rate risks. For 
additional information on mortgage banking interest rate and 
market risk, see Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities) to 
Financial Statements in this Report and the “Risk Management – 
Asset/Liability Management – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate 
and Market Risk” section in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in mortgage 

banking is a complex process that requires sophisticated 
modeling and constant monitoring. There are several potential 
risks to earnings from mortgage banking related to origination 
volumes and mix, valuation of MSRs and associated hedging 
results, the relationship and degree of volatility between short-
term and long-term interest rates, and changes in servicing and 
foreclosures costs. While we attempt to balance our mortgage 
banking interest rate and market risks, the financial instruments 
we use may not perfectly correlate with the values and income 
being hedged. 

MARKET RISK  Market risk is the risk of possible economic loss 
from adverse changes in market risk factors such as interest 
rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and 
commodity prices, and the risk of possible loss due to 
counterparty exposure. This applies to implied volatility risk, 
basis risk, and market liquidity risk. It also includes price risk in 
the trading book, mortgage servicing rights and the hedge 
effectiveness risk associated with the mortgage book, and 
impairment on private equity investments. For information on 
our oversight of market risk, see the “Risk Management – Asset/ 
Liability Management – Market Risk” section in our 2020 Form 
10-K. 

MARKET RISK – TRADING ACTIVITIES  We engage in trading 
activities to accommodate the investment and risk management 
activities of our customers and to execute economic hedging to 
manage certain balance sheet risks. These trading activities 
predominantly occur within our CIB businesses and to a lesser 
extent other businesses of the Company. Debt securities held for 
trading, equity securities held for trading, trading loans and 
trading derivatives are financial instruments used in our trading 
activities, and all are carried at fair value. Income earned on the 
financial instruments used in our trading activities include net 
interest income, changes in fair value and realized gains and 
losses. Net interest income earned from our trading activities is 
reflected in the interest income and interest expense 
components of our consolidated statement of income. Changes 
in fair value of the financial instruments used in our trading 
activities are reflected in net gains from trading activities. For 
additional information on the financial instruments used in our 
trading activities and the income from these trading activities, 
see Note 2 (Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this 
Report.

Value-at-risk (VaR) is a statistical risk measure used to 
estimate the potential loss from adverse moves in the financial 
markets. The Company uses VaR metrics complemented with 
sensitivity analysis and stress testing in measuring and 
monitoring market risk. For additional information on our 
monitoring activities, sensitivity analysis and stress testing, see 
the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Market 
Risk – Trading Activities” section in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Trading VaR is the measure used to provide insight into the 

market risk exhibited by the Company’s trading positions. The 
Company calculates Trading VaR for risk management purposes 
to establish line of business and Company-wide risk limits. 

Table 29:  Trading 1-Day 99% General VaR by Risk Category 

Trading VaR is calculated based on all trading positions on our 
consolidated balance sheet. 

Table 29 shows the Company’s Trading General VaR by risk 
category. The increase in average Company Trading General VaR 
for the quarter ended March 31, 2021, compared with the same 
period a year ago, was driven by a greater presence of market 
volatility in the 12-month historical lookback window used to 
calculate average Company Trading General VaR for the quarter 
ended March 31, 2021. Market volatility was driven by the 
COVID-19 pandemic, in particular, changes in interest rate curves 
and a significant widening of credit spreads.

The period-end VaR was less than the sum of the VaR components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect arises because the risks are not perfectly 
correlated causing a portfolio of positions to usually be less risky than the sum of the risks of the positions alone. The diversification benefit is not meaningful for low and high metrics since they may 
occur on different days. 

MARKET RISK – EQUITY SECURITIES  We are directly and indirectly 
affected by changes in the equity markets. We make and manage 
direct investments in start-up businesses, emerging growth 
companies, management buy-outs, acquisitions and corporate 
recapitalizations. We also invest in non-affiliated funds that 
make similar private equity investments. For additional 
information, see the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability 
Management – Market Risk – Equity Securities” section in our 
2020 Form 10-K. 

We also have marketable equity securities that include 

investments relating to our venture capital activities. The fair 
value changes in these marketable equity securities are 
recognized in net income. For additional information, see Note 6 
(Equity Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Changes in equity market prices may also indirectly affect 

our net income by (1) the value of third-party assets under 
management and, hence, fee income, (2) borrowers whose ability 
to repay principal and/or interest may be affected by the stock 
market, or (3) brokerage activity, related commission income and 
other business activities. Each business line monitors and 
manages these indirect risks. 

LIQUIDITY RISK AND FUNDING  In the ordinary course of business, 
we enter into contractual obligations that may require future 
cash payments, including funding for customer loan requests, 
customer deposit maturities and withdrawals, debt service, 
leases for premises and equipment, and other cash 
commitments. The objective of effective liquidity management is 
to ensure that we can meet our contractual obligations and other 
cash commitments efficiently under both normal operating 
conditions and under periods of Wells Fargo-specific and/or 
market stress. To help achieve this objective, we monitor both 
the consolidated company and the Parent on a stand-alone basis 
to ensure that the Parent is a source of strength for its regulated, 

deposit-taking banking subsidiaries. The Parent acts as a source 
of funding for the Company through the issuance of long-term 
debt and equity, and WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding 
company and subsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), provides 
funding support for the ongoing operational requirements of the 
Parent and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries. For 
additional information on liquidity risk and funding management, 
see the “Risk Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding” section 
in our 2020 Form 10-K. For additional information on the IHC, 
see the “Regulatory Matters – ‘Living Will’ Requirements and 
Related Matters” section in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Liquidity Standards  We are subject to a rule, issued by the FRB, 
OCC and FDIC, that establishes a quantitative minimum liquidity 
requirement consistent with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) 
established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 
(BCBS). The rule requires a covered banking organization, such as 
Wells Fargo, to hold high-quality liquid assets (HQLA), 
predominantly consisting of central bank deposits, government 
debt securities, and mortgage-backed securities of federal 
agencies that can be converted easily and quickly into cash, in an 
amount equal to or greater than its projected net cash outflows 
during a 30-day stress period. The LCR applies to the Company 
on a consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions 
(IDIs) with total assets of $10 billion or more. In addition, rules 
issued by the FRB impose enhanced liquidity risk management 
standards on large BHCs, such as Wells Fargo. 

The FRB, OCC and FDIC have also issued a rule implementing 

a stable funding requirement, known as the net stable funding 
ratio (NSFR), which requires a covered banking organization, such 
as Wells Fargo, to maintain a minimum amount of stable funding, 
including common equity, long-term debt and most types of 
deposits, in relation to its assets, derivative exposures and

a consolidated basis and to our IDIs with total assets of 
$10 billion or more. Based on our liquidity profile at March 31, 
2021, we expect to be compliant with the NSFR requirement. 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio  As of March 31, 2021, the 
consolidated Company, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., and Wells Fargo 

National Bank West exceeded the minimum LCR requirement of 
100%, which is calculated as HQLA divided by projected net cash 
outflows, as each is defined under the LCR rule. Table 30 presents 
the Company’s quarterly average values for the daily-calculated 
LCR and its components calculated pursuant to the LCR rule 
requirements.

Liquidity Sources  We maintain liquidity in the form of cash, cash 
equivalents and unencumbered high-quality, liquid debt 
securities. These assets make up our primary sources of liquidity. 
Our primary sources of liquidity are substantially the same in 
composition as HQLA under the LCR rule; however, our primary 
sources of liquidity will generally exceed HQLA calculated under 
the LCR rule due to the applicable haircuts to HQLA and the 
exclusion of excess HQLA at our subsidiary IDIs required under 
the LCR rule. Our primary sources of liquidity are presented in 
Table 31, which also includes encumbered securities that are not 
included as available HQLA in the calculation of the LCR.

Our cash is predominantly on deposit with the Federal 
Reserve. Debt securities included as part of our primary sources 
of liquidity are comprised of U.S. Treasury and federal agency 
debt, and MBS issued by federal agencies within our debt 
securities portfolio. We believe these debt securities provide 
quick sources of liquidity through sales or by pledging to obtain 
financing, regardless of market conditions. Some of these debt 
securities are within our HTM portfolio and, as such, are not 
intended for sale but may be pledged to obtain financing.

In addition to our primary sources of liquidity shown in 
Table 31, liquidity is also available through the sale or financing of 
other debt securities including trading and/or AFS debt 
securities, as well as through the sale, securitization or financing 
of loans, to the extent such debt securities and loans are not 
encumbered. As of March 31, 2021, we also maintained 
approximately $227.3 billion of available borrowing capacity at 
various Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Reserve 
Discount Window. 

Deposits have historically provided a sizable source of 
relatively low-cost funds. Deposits were 167% and 158% of total 
loans at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. 
Additional funding is provided by long-term debt and short-term 
borrowings. Table 32 shows selected information for short-term 
borrowings, which generally mature in less than 30 days. We 
pledge certain financial instruments that we own to collateralize 
repurchase agreements and other securities financings. For 
additional information, see the “Pledged Assets” section of 
Note 12 (Pledged Assets and Collateral) to Financial Statements 
in this Report.

Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management (continued) 

Long-Term Debt  We access domestic and international capital 
markets for long-term funding (generally greater than one year) 
through issuances of registered debt securities, private 
placements and asset-backed secured funding. We issue long-
term debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve 
cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity 
profile. Proceeds from securities issued were used for general 
corporate purposes, and, unless otherwise specified in the 
applicable prospectus or prospectus supplement, we expect the 

proceeds from securities issued in the future will be used for the 
same purposes. Depending on market conditions, we may 
purchase our outstanding debt securities from time to time in 
privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender 
offer, or otherwise. We issued $110 million of long-term debt in 
first quarter 2021. Table 33 provides the aggregate carrying 
value of long-term debt maturities (based on contractual 
payment dates) for the remainder of 2021 and the following 
years thereafter, as of March 31, 2021.

Credit Ratings  Investors in the long-term capital markets, as 
well as other market participants, generally will consider, among 
other factors, a company’s debt rating in making investment 
decisions. Rating agencies base their ratings on many 
quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, 
liquidity, asset quality, business mix, the level and quality of 
earnings, and rating agency assumptions regarding the 
probability and extent of federal financial assistance or support 
for certain large financial institutions. Adverse changes in these 
factors could result in a reduction of our credit rating; however, 
our debt securities do not contain credit rating covenants. 

There were no actions undertaken by the rating agencies 

with regard to our credit ratings during first quarter 2021.

Financial Statements in this Report for information regarding 
additional collateral and funding obligations required for certain 
derivative instruments in the event our credit ratings were to fall 
below investment grade.

FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK MEMBERSHIP  The Federal Home 
Loan Banks (the FHLBs) are a group of cooperatives that lending 
institutions use to finance housing and economic development in 
local communities. We are a member of the FHLBs based in 
Dallas, Des Moines and San Francisco. FHLB members are 
required to maintain a minimum investment in capital stock of 
the applicable FHLB. The board of directors of each FHLB can 

increase the minimum investment requirements in the event it 
has concluded that additional capital is required to allow it to 
meet its own regulatory capital requirements. Any increase in the 
minimum investment requirements outside of specified ranges 
requires the approval of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. 
Because the extent of any obligation to increase our investment

Capital Management 

We have an active program for managing capital through a 
comprehensive process for assessing the Company’s overall 
capital adequacy. Our objective is to maintain capital at an 
amount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance 
objectives, and to meet both regulatory and market 
expectations. We primarily fund our capital needs through the 
retention of earnings net of both dividends and share 
repurchases, as well as through the issuance of preferred stock 
and long- and short-term debt. Retained earnings at March 31, 
2021, increased $3.9 billion from December 31, 2020, 
predominantly as a result of $4.7 billion of Wells Fargo net 
income, partially offset by $755 million of common and 
preferred stock dividends. During first quarter 2021, we issued 
$724 million of common stock, substantially all of which was 
issued in connection with employee compensation and benefits, 
excluding conversions of preferred shares. During first quarter 
2021, we repurchased 17 million shares of common stock at a 
cost of $596 million. For additional information about capital 
planning, including the FRB’s recent announcement on capital 
distributions, see the “Capital Planning and Stress Testing” 
section below. 

In first quarter 2021, we issued $4.6 billion of preferred 

stock and redeemed $4.5 billion of preferred stock. For 
additional information, see Note 16 (Preferred Stock) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements 
The Company and each of our IDIs are subject to various 
regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the 
FRB and the OCC. Risk-based capital rules establish risk-adjusted 
ratios relating regulatory capital to different categories of assets 
and off-balance sheet exposures as discussed below. 

RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS The Company 
is subject to rules issued by federal banking regulators to 
implement Basel III capital requirements for U.S. banking 
organizations. The rules contain two frameworks for calculating 
capital requirements, a Standardized Approach and an Advanced 
Approach applicable to certain institutions, including Wells Fargo. 
Our capital adequacy is assessed based on the lower of our risk-
based capital ratios calculated under the two approaches. The 
Company is required to satisfy the risk-based capital ratio 
requirements to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and 
discretionary bonus payments. Table 35 and Table 36 present the 
risk-based capital requirements applicable to the Company on a 
fully phased-in basis under the Standardized Approach and 
Advanced Approach, respectively, as of March 31, 2021. 

Table 35:  Risk-Based Capital Requirements – Standardized Approach 

Table 36:  Risk-Based Capital Requirements – Advanced Approach 

In addition to the risk-based capital requirements described 
in Table 35 and Table 36, if the FRB determines that a period of 
excessive credit growth is contributing to an increase in systemic 
risk, a countercyclical buffer of up to 2.50% could be added to the 
risk-based capital ratio requirements under federal banking 
regulations. 

The capital conservation buffer is applicable to certain 
institutions, including Wells Fargo, under the Advanced Approach 
and is intended to absorb losses during times of economic or 
financial stress. 

The stress capital buffer is calculated based on the decrease 

in a BHC’s risk-based capital ratios under the severely adverse 
scenario in the FRB’s annual supervisory stress test and related 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), plus four 
quarters of planned common stock dividends. Because the stress 
capital buffer is calculated annually based on data that can differ 
over time, our stress capital buffer, and thus our risk-based 
capital ratio requirements under the Standardized Approach, are 
subject to change in future periods. The Company’s stress capital 
buffer for the period October 1, 2020, through September 30, 
2021, is 2.50%.

Capital Management (continued) 

As a global systemically important bank (G-SIB), we are 

also subject to the FRB’s rule implementing an additional 
capital surcharge of between 1.00-4.50% on the risk-based 
capital ratio requirements of G-SIBs. Under the rule, we must 
annually calculate our surcharge under two methods and use 
the higher of the two surcharges. The first method (method 
one) considers our size, interconnectedness, cross-
jurisdictional activity, substitutability, and complexity, 
consistent with the methodology developed by the BCBS and 
the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The second method 
(method two) uses similar inputs, but replaces substitutability 
with use of short-term wholesale funding and will generally 
result in higher surcharges than under method one. Because 
the G-SIB capital surcharge is calculated annually based on 
data that can differ over time, the amount of the surcharge is 
subject to change in future years. 

The Basel III capital requirements for calculating CET1 and 
tier 1 capital, along with risk-weighted assets (RWAs), are fully 
phased-in. However, the requirements for determining tier 2 and 
total capital are still in accordance with transition requirements 
and are scheduled to be fully phased-in by the end of 2021. 

Under the risk-based capital rules, on-balance sheet assets 

and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance 
sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories 
according to the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the 

Table 37:  Capital Components and Ratios (Fully Phased-In) 

nature of any collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk 
category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with 
that category. The resulting weighted values from each of the 
risk categories are aggregated for determining total RWAs. 

The tables that follow provide information about our risk-

based capital and related ratios as calculated under Basel III 
capital rules. Although we report certain capital amounts and 
ratios in accordance with transition requirements for bank 
regulatory reporting purposes, we manage our capital on a fully 
phased-in basis. For information about our capital requirements 
calculated in accordance with transition requirements, see 
Note 23 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other 
Restrictions) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Table 37 summarizes our CET1, tier 1 capital, total capital, 
RWAs and capital ratios on a fully phased-in basis at March 31, 
2021, and December 31, 2020. Fully phased-in total capital 
amounts and ratios are considered non-GAAP financial measures 
that are used by management, bank regulatory agencies, 
investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Company’s 
capital position. See Table 38 for information regarding the 
calculation and components of our CET1, tier 1 capital, total 
capital and RWAs, as well as a corresponding reconciliation to 
GAAP financial measures for our fully phased-in total capital 
amounts.

Determined by applying the combined federal statutory rate and composite state income tax rates to the difference between book and tax basis of the respective goodwill and intangible assets at 
period end. 
At March 31, 2021, the impact of the CECL transition provision issued by federal banking regulators on our regulatory capital was an increase in capital of $1.3 billion, reflecting a $991 million (post-
tax) increase in capital recognized upon our initial adoption of CECL, offset by 25% of the $9.2 billion increase in our ACL under CECL from January 1, 2020, through March 31, 2021. 
Under the Advanced Approach the allowance for credit losses that exceeds expected credit losses is eligible for inclusion in tier 2 capital, to the extent the excess allowance does not exceed 0.60% of 
Advanced credit RWAs, and under the Standardized Approach, the allowance for credit losses is includable in tier 2 capital up to 1.25% of Standardized credit RWAs, in each case with any excess 
allowance for credit losses being deducted from the respective total RWAs. 
RWAs calculated under the Advanced Approach utilize a risk-sensitive methodology, which relies upon the use of internal credit models based upon our experience with internal rating grades. 
Advanced Approach also includes an operational risk component, which reflects the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events. 
Includes an increase of $1.0 billion under the Standardized Approach and a decrease of $1.4 billion under the Advanced Approach related to the impact of the CECL transition provision on our excess 
allowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2021. See footnote (3) to this table.

TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY  We also evaluate our business based 
on certain ratios that utilize tangible common equity. Tangible 
common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents 
total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, 
goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs) 
and goodwill and other intangibles on nonmarketable equity 
securities, net of applicable deferred taxes. The ratios are (i) 
tangible book value per common share, which represents 
tangible common equity divided by common shares outstanding; 
and (ii) return on average tangible common equity (ROTCE), 

which represents our annualized earnings as a percentage of 
tangible common equity. The methodology of determining 
tangible common equity may differ among companies. 
Management believes that tangible book value per common 
share and return on average tangible common equity, which 
utilize tangible common equity, are useful financial measures 
because they enable management, investors, and others to 
assess the Company’s use of equity. 

Table 41 provides a reconciliation of these non-GAAP 

financial measures to GAAP financial measures.

LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS  As a BHC, we are required to maintain 
a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) to avoid restrictions on 
capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments and 
maintain a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio. Table 42 presents the 
leverage requirements applicable to the Company as of 
March 31, 2021. 

Table 42:  Leverage Requirements Applicable to the Company 

The FRB and OCC have proposed amendments to the SLR 
rules. For information regarding the proposed amendments to 
the SLR rules, see the “Capital Management – Leverage 
Requirements” section in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

In April 2020, the FRB issued an interim final rule that 
temporarily allowed a BHC to exclude on-balance sheet amounts 
of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks 
from the calculation of its total leverage exposure in the 
denominator of the SLR. This interim final rule became effective 
on April 1, 2020, and expired on April 1, 2021. 

At March 31, 2021, the Company’s SLR was 7.91%, and each 

of our IDIs exceeded their applicable SLR requirements. In 
addition, the Company’s SLR at March 31, 2021, would have been 
6.97% without relying on the FRB’s April 2020 interim final rule 
that temporarily allowed for the exclusion of specific on-balance 
sheet amounts. Table 43 presents information regarding the 
calculation and components of the Company’s SLR and tier 1 
leverage ratio. 

In addition, our IDIs are required to maintain an SLR of at 
least 6.00% to be considered well capitalized under applicable 
regulatory capital adequacy rules and maintain a minimum tier 1 
leverage ratio of 4.00%.

Adjustment represents derivatives and collateral netting exposures as defined for

Adjustment represents counterparty credit risk for repo-style transactions where 
Wells Fargo & Company is the principal counterparty facing the client. 
Adjustment represents credit equivalent amounts of other off-balance sheet exposures 
not already included as derivatives and repo-style transactions exposures. 
The tier 1 leverage ratio consists of tier 1 capital divided by total average assets, excluding 
goodwill and certain other items as determined under the rule. 

TOTAL LOSS ABSORBING CAPACITY  As a G-SIB, we are required to 
have a minimum amount of equity and unsecured long-term 
debt for purposes of resolvability and resiliency, often referred to 
as Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC). U.S. G-SIBs are required 
to have a minimum amount of TLAC (consisting of CET1 capital 
and additional tier 1 capital issued directly by the top-tier or 
covered BHC plus eligible external long-term debt) to avoid 
restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus 
payments, as well as a minimum amount of eligible unsecured 
long-term debt. Our minimum TLAC and eligible unsecured long-
term debt requirements as of March 31, 2021, are presented in 
Table 44.

information regarding these proposed amendments, see the 
“Capital Management – Total Loss Absorbing Capacity” section in 
our 2020 Form 10-K. 

As of March 31, 2021, our eligible external TLAC as a 

percentage of total RWAs was 25.18%, compared with a required 
minimum of 21.50%. Similar to the risk-based capital 

requirements, our minimum TLAC requirement is assessed based 
on the greater of RWAs determined under the Standardized and 
Advanced Approaches. 

OTHER REGULATORY CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY MATTERS  For 
information regarding the U.S. implementation of the Basel III 
LCR and NSFR, see the “Risk Management – Asset/ Liability 
Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding – Liquidity Standards” 
section in this Report. 

Capital Planning and Stress Testing 
Our planned long-term capital structure is designed to meet 
regulatory and market expectations. We believe that our long-
term targeted capital structure enables us to invest in and grow 
our business, satisfy our customers’ financial needs in varying 
environments, access markets, and maintain flexibility to return 
capital to our shareholders. Our long-term targeted capital 
structure also considers capital levels sufficient to exceed capital 
requirements including the G-SIB capital surcharge. Accordingly, 
we currently target a long-term CET1 capital ratio at or in excess 
of 10.00%. Our capital targets are subject to change based on 
various factors, including changes to the regulatory capital 
framework and expectations for large banks promulgated by 
bank regulatory agencies, changes to the regulatory 
requirements for our capital ratios, planned capital actions, 
changes in our risk profile and other factors. 

The FRB capital plan rule establishes capital planning and 
other requirements that govern capital distributions, including 
dividends and share repurchases, by certain BHCs, including 
Wells Fargo. The FRB assesses, among other things, the overall 
financial condition, risk profile, and capital adequacy of BHCs 
when evaluating their capital plans. 

We submitted our 2021 capital plan to the FRB on April 5, 

2021. As part of the 2021 CCAR, the FRB also generated a 
supervisory stress test. The FRB is expected to review the 
supervisory stress test results as required under the Dodd-Frank 
Act using a common set of capital actions for all large BHCs and 
is also expected to review the Company’s proposed capital 
actions. The FRB has indicated it will publish its supervisory 
stress test results by July 1, 2021. 

On March 25, 2021, the FRB announced that it was 

extending measures it previously announced limiting large BHCs, 
including Wells Fargo, from making any capital distribution 
(excluding any capital distribution arising from the issuance of a 
capital instrument eligible for inclusion in the numerator of a 
regulatory capital ratio), unless otherwise approved by the FRB. 
The FRB has generally authorized BHCs to (i) provided that the 
BHC does not increase the amount of its common stock 
dividends to be larger than the level paid in second quarter 2020, 
pay common stock dividends and make share repurchases that, 
in the aggregate, do not exceed an amount equal to the average 
of the BHC’s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters; 
(ii) make share repurchases that equal the amount of share 
issuances related to expensed employee compensation; and (iii) 
redeem and make scheduled payments on additional tier 1 and 
tier 2 capital instruments. The FRB has also announced that if a 
BHC remains above all of its minimum risk-based capital 
requirements in this year's supervisory stress test, these 
additional limitations on capital distributions will end for that 
BHC after June 30, 2021. However, a BHC that falls below any of 
its minimum risk-based capital requirements in this year's 
supervisory stress test will remain subject to the additional 
limitations on capital distributions through September 30, 2021, 
and if the BHC remains below the capital required by the 
supervisory stress test at that time, the existing stress capital

buffer framework will impose even stricter capital distribution 
limitations. 

Concurrently with CCAR, federal banking regulators also 

require large BHCs and banks to conduct their own stress tests 
to evaluate whether the institution has sufficient capital to 
continue to operate during periods of adverse economic and 
financial conditions. 

Securities Repurchases 
From time to time the Board authorizes the Company to 
repurchase shares of our common stock. Although we announce 
when the Board authorizes share repurchases, we typically do not 
give any public notice before we repurchase our shares. Various 
factors determine the amount of our share repurchases, 
including our capital requirements, the number of shares we 

expect to issue for employee benefit plans and acquisitions, 
market conditions (including the trading price of our stock), and 
regulatory and legal considerations, including under the FRB’s 
capital plan rule. Due to the various factors that may impact the 
amount of our share repurchases and the fact that we tend to be 
in the market regularly to satisfy repurchase considerations 
under our capital plan, our share repurchases occur at various 
price levels. We may suspend share repurchase activity at any 
time. 

At March 31, 2021, we had remaining Board authority to 

repurchase approximately 650 million shares, subject to 
regulatory and legal conditions. For additional information about 
share repurchases during first quarter 2021, see Part II, Item 2 in 
this Report. 

Regulatory Matters 

The U.S. financial services industry is subject to significant 
regulation and regulatory oversight initiatives. This regulation 
and oversight may continue to impact how U.S. financial services 
companies conduct business and may continue to result in 
increased regulatory compliance costs. 

For a discussion of certain consent orders applicable to the 

Company, see the “Overview” section in this Report. For a 
discussion of other significant regulations and regulatory 
oversight initiatives that have affected or may affect our 
business, see the “Regulatory Matters” and “Risk Factors” 
sections in our 2020 Form 10-K.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our significant accounting policies (see Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 
2020 Form 10-K) are fundamental to understanding our results 
of operations and financial condition because they require that 
we use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of 
our assets or liabilities and financial results. Six of these policies 
are critical because they require management to make difficult, 
subjective and complex judgments about matters that are 
inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially 
different amounts would be reported under different conditions 
or using different assumptions. These policies govern:

Forward-Looking Statements 

This document contains forward-looking statements. In addition, 
we may make forward-looking statements in our other 
documents filed or furnished with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, and our management may make forward-looking 
statements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the 
media and others. Forward-looking statements can be identified 
by words such as “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” 
“believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “target,” “projects,” “outlook,” 
“forecast,” “will,” “may,” “could,” “should,” “can” and similar 
references to future periods. In particular, forward-looking 
statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make 
about: (i) the future operating or financial performance of the 
Company, including our outlook for future growth; (ii) our 
noninterest expense and efficiency ratio; (iii) future credit quality 
and performance, including our expectations regarding future 
loan losses, our allowance for credit losses, and the economic 
scenarios considered to develop the allowance; (iv) our 
expectations regarding net interest income and net interest 
margin; (v) loan growth or the reduction or mitigation of risk in 
our loan portfolios; (vi) future capital or liquidity levels, ratios or 
targets; (vii) the performance of our mortgage business and any 
related exposures; (viii) the expected outcome and impact of 
legal, regulatory and legislative developments, as well as our 
expectations regarding compliance therewith; (ix) future 
common stock dividends, common share repurchases and other 
uses of capital; (x) our targeted range for return on assets, return 
on equity, and return on tangible common equity; (xi) 
expectations regarding our effective income tax rate; (xii) the 
outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings; (xiii) 
environmental, social and governance related goals or 
commitments; and (xiv) the Company’s plans, objectives and 
strategies. 

Forward-looking statements are not based on historical 

facts but instead represent our current expectations and 
assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other 
future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to 
the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and 
changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual 
results may differ materially from those contemplated by the 
forward-looking statements. We caution you, therefore, against 
relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are 
neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or 
assurances of future performance. While there is no assurance 
that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ 
materially from those in the forward-looking statements include 
the following, without limitation: 
• 

current and future economic and market conditions, 
including the effects of declines in housing prices, high 
unemployment rates, U.S. fiscal debt, budget and tax 
matters, geopolitical matters, and any slowdown in global 
economic growth; 
the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, including on our 
credit quality and business operations, as well as its impact 
on general economic and financial market conditions; 
our capital and liquidity requirements (including under 
regulatory capital standards, such as the Basel III capital 
standards) and our ability to generate capital internally or 
raise capital on favorable terms; 
current, pending or future legislation or regulation that 
could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses,

including rules and regulations relating to bank products and 
financial services; 
developments in our mortgage banking business, including 
the extent of the success of our mortgage loan modification 
efforts, the amount of mortgage loan repurchase demands 
that we receive, any negative effects relating to our 
mortgage servicing, loan modification or foreclosure 
practices, and the effects of regulatory or judicial 
requirements or guidance impacting our mortgage banking 
business and any changes in industry standards; 
our ability to realize any efficiency ratio or expense target as 
part of our expense management initiatives, including as a 
result of business and economic cyclicality, seasonality, 
changes in our business composition and operating 
environment, growth in our businesses and/or acquisitions, 
and unexpected expenses relating to, among other things, 
litigation and regulatory matters; 
the effect of the current interest rate environment or 
changes in interest rates or in the level or composition of our 
assets or liabilities on our net interest income, net interest 
margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing 
rights and mortgage loans held for sale; 
significant turbulence or a disruption in the capital or 
financial markets, which could result in, among other things, 
reduced investor demand for mortgage loans, a reduction in 
the availability of funding or increased funding costs, and 
declines in asset values and/or recognition of impairments of 
securities held in our debt securities and equity securities 
portfolios; 
the effect of a fall in stock market prices on our investment 
banking business and our fee income from our brokerage 
and wealth management businesses; 
negative effects from the retail banking sales practices 
matter and from other instances where customers may have 
experienced financial harm, including on our legal, 
operational and compliance costs, our ability to engage in 
certain business activities or offer certain products or 
services, our ability to keep and attract customers, our 
ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and our 
reputation; 
resolution of regulatory matters, litigation, or other legal 
actions, which may result in, among other things, additional 
costs, fines, penalties, restrictions on our business activities, 
reputational harm, or other adverse consequences; 
a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems 
or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors or 
other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks; 
the effect of changes in the level of checking or savings 
account deposits on our funding costs and net interest 
margin; 
fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board; 
changes to U.S. tax guidance and regulations, as well as the 
effect of discrete items on our effective income tax rate; 
our ability to develop and execute effective business plans 
and strategies; and 
the other risk factors and uncertainties described under 
“Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 
year ended December 31, 2020. 

In addition to the above factors, we also caution that the 
amount and timing of any future common stock dividends or

financial condition of the Company, market conditions, capital 
requirements (including under Basel capital standards), common 
stock issuance requirements, applicable law and regulations 
(including federal securities laws and federal banking 
regulations), and other factors deemed relevant by the 
Company’s Board of Directors, and may be subject to regulatory 
approval or conditions. 

For additional information about factors that could cause 
actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to 
our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
including the discussion under “Risk Factors” in our Annual 
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, as 
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available 
on its website at www.sec.gov.1 

Any forward-looking statement made by us speaks only as 

of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could 
cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, 
and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake 
no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, 
whether as a result of new information, future developments or 
otherwise, except as may be required by law. 

Forward-looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures. From time to 
time management may discuss forward-looking non-GAAP 
financial measures, such as forward-looking estimates or targets 
for return on average tangible common equity. We are unable to 
provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial 
measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial 
measures because we are unable to provide, without 
unreasonable effort, a meaningful or accurate calculation or 
estimation of amounts that would be necessary for the 
reconciliation due to the complexity and inherent difficulty in 
forecasting and quantifying future amounts or when they may 
occur. Such unavailable information could be significant to future 
results.

Risk Factors 

An investment in the Company involves risk, including the 
possibility that the value of the investment could fall 
substantially and that dividends or other distributions on the 
investment could be reduced or eliminated. For a discussion of 
risk factors that could adversely affect our financial results and 
condition, and the value of, and return on, an investment in the 
Company, we refer you to the “Risk Factors” section in our 2020 
Form 10-K.
