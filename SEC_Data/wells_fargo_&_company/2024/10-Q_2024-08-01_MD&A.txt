**Overview**

Wells Fargo & Company is a leading financial services company with approximately $1.9 trillion in assets. We provide a diversified set of banking, investment, and mortgage products and services, as well as consumer and commercial finance, through our four reportable operating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending; Commercial Banking; Corporate and Investment Banking; and Wealth and Investment Management. Wells Fargo ranked No. 34 on Fortune’s 2024 rankings of America’s largest corporations. We ranked fourth in assets and third in the market value of our common stock among all U.S. banks at June 30, 2024.

Wells Fargo’s top priority remains building a risk and control infrastructure appropriate for its size and complexity. The Company is subject to a number of consent orders and other regulatory actions, some of which are described below. These regulatory actions may require the Company, among other things, to undertake certain changes to its business, operations, products and services, and risk management practices. Addressing these regulatory actions is expected to take multiple years, and we are likely to continue to experience issues or delays along the way in satisfying their requirements. We are also likely to continue to identify more issues as we implement our risk and control infrastructure, which may result in additional regulatory actions. Regulators have indicated the potential for escalating consequences for banks that do not timely resolve open issues or have repeat issues. Furthermore, issues or delays with one regulatory action could affect our progress on others. Failure to satisfy the requirements of a regulatory action on a timely basis could result in additional fines, penalties, business restrictions, limitations on subsidiary capital distributions, increased capital or liquidity requirements, enforcement actions, and other adverse consequences, which could be significant. While we still have significant work to do and have not yet satisfied certain aspects of these regulatory actions, the Company is committed to devoting the resources necessary to operate with strong business practices and controls, maintain the highest level of integrity, and have an appropriate culture in place.

**Federal Reserve Board Consent Order Regarding Governance Oversight and Compliance and Operational Risk Management**  
On February 2, 2018, the Company entered into a consent order with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB). As required by the consent order, the Company’s Board of Directors submitted to the FRB a plan to further enhance the Board’s governance and oversight of the Company, and the Company submitted to the FRB a plan to further improve the Company’s compliance and operational risk management program. The Company continues to engage with the FRB as the Company works to address the consent order provisions. The consent order also requires the Company, following the FRB’s acceptance and approval of the plans and the Company’s adoption and implementation of the plans, to complete an initial third‑party review of the enhancements and improvements provided for in the plans. Until this third‑party review is complete and the plans are adopted and implemented to the satisfaction of the FRB, the Company’s total consolidated assets as defined under the consent order will be limited to the level as of December 31, 2017. Compliance with this asset cap is measured on a two‑quarter daily average basis to allow for management of temporary fluctuations. After removal of the asset cap, a second third‑party review must also be conducted to assess the efficacy and sustainability of the enhancements and improvements.

**Consent Orders with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Regarding Compliance Risk Management Program, Automobile Collateral Protection Insurance Policies, and Mortgage Interest Rate Lock Extensions**  
On April 20, 2018, the Company entered into consent orders with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to pay an aggregate of $1 billion in civil money penalties to resolve matters regarding the Company’s compliance risk management program and past practices involving certain automobile collateral protection insurance policies and certain mortgage interest rate lock extensions. As required by the consent orders, the Company submitted to the CFPB and OCC an enterprise‑wide compliance risk management plan and a plan to enhance the Company’s internal audit program with respect to federal consumer financial law and the terms of the consent orders. In addition, as required by the consent orders, the Company submitted for non‑objection plans to remediate customers affected by the automobile collateral protection insurance and mortgage interest rate lock matters, as well as a plan for the management of remediation activities conducted by the Company. The Company continues to work to address the provisions of the consent orders. On September 9, 2021, the OCC assessed a $250 million civil money penalty against the Company related to insufficient progress in addressing requirements under the OCC’s April 2018 consent order and loss mitigation activities in the Company’s Home Lending business. On December 20, 2022, the CFPB modified its consent order to clarify how it would terminate.

**Consent Order with the OCC Regarding Loss Mitigation Activities**  
On September 9, 2021, the Company entered into a consent order with the OCC requiring the Company to improve the execution, risk management, and oversight of loss mitigation activities in its Home Lending business. In addition, the consent order restricts the Company from acquiring certain third‑party residential mortgage servicing and limits transfers of certain mortgage loans requiring customer remediation out of the Company’s mortgage servicing portfolio until remediation is provided.

**Consent Order with the CFPB Regarding Automobile Lending, Consumer Deposit Accounts, and Mortgage Lending**  
On December 20, 2022, the Company entered into a consent order with the CFPB requiring the Company to provide customer remediation for multiple matters related to automobile lending, consumer deposit accounts, and mortgage lending; maintain practices designed to ensure auto lending customers receive refunds for the unused portion of certain guaranteed automobile protection agreements; comply with certain business practice requirements related to consumer deposit accounts; and pay a $1.7 billion civil penalty to the CFPB. The required actions related to many of these matters were already substantially complete at the time we entered into the consent order, and the consent order lays out a path to termination after the Company completes the remainder of the required actions.

**Customer Remediation Activities**  
Our work to build a better company has included an effort to identify areas or instances where customers may have experienced financial harm, provide remediation as appropriate, and implement additional operational and control procedures. We are working with our regulatory agencies in this effort. We have accrued for the probable and estimable costs related to our customer remediation activities, which amounts may change based on additional facts and information, as well as ongoing reviews and communications with our regulators.

Recent Developments

Capital Matters  
On June 28, 2024, the Company announced that it had completed the 2024 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) stress test process. The Company expects its stress capital buffer (SCB) to be 3.80% for the period October 1, 2024, through September 30, 2025. The FRB has indicated that it will publish the Company's final SCB by August 31, 2024. Our SCB for the period October 1, 2023, through September 30, 2024, is 2.90%.

On July 23, 2024, the Board approved an increase to the Company's third quarter 2024 common stock dividend to $0.40 per share.

In July 2024, we issued $2.0 billion of our Preferred Stock, Series FF.

For additional information about capital planning, see the “Capital Management – Capital Planning and Stress Testing” section in this Report.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Special Assessment  
In November 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) finalized a rule to recover losses to the FDIC deposit insurance fund as a result of bank failures in the first half of 2023. Under the rule, the FDIC will collect a special assessment based on an insured depository institution’s estimated amount of uninsured deposits. Upon the FDIC’s finalization of the rule, we expensed an estimated amount of our special assessment of $1.9 billion (pre‑tax) in fourth quarter 2023. During 2024, the FDIC provided updates on losses to the deposit insurance fund, and we expensed an additional $52 million and $336 million (pre‑tax) in the second quarter and first half of 2024, respectively, for the estimated amount of the special assessment. We expect the ultimate amount of the special assessment may continue to change as the FDIC determines the actual net losses to the deposit insurance fund.

Overdraft Fees Proposal  
On January 17, 2024, the CFPB issued a proposed rule that would limit overdraft fees charged by certain banks. We expect a significant reduction to our overdraft fees, which are included in deposit‑related fees, if the rule is adopted as currently proposed.

Debit Card Interchange Fees Proposal  
On October 25, 2023, the FRB issued a proposed rule that would reduce the amount of debit card interchange fees received by debit card issuers. In addition, the proposed rule would allow for an update to the debit card interchange fee cap every other year based on an analysis of certain costs incurred by debit card issuers. We expect a significant reduction to our debit card interchange fees, which are included in card fees, if the rule is adopted as currently proposed.

Financial Performance  
This section reviews key income statement items, performance ratios, and balance sheet metrics for both the second quarter and the first half of 2024 compared with prior periods. Key highlights include:  
• A decrease in total revenue primarily driven by lower net interest income due to a decline in average loan balances and a shift in our deposit mix.  
• Partially offsetting increases in noninterest income.  
• Detailed comparisons of operating expenses, including increases in noninterest expense driven by higher operating losses, technology, telecommunications and equipment expenses, and other factors.  
• Tabulated comparisons of selected income statement and balance sheet data accompanied by commentary on the factors affecting performance.



Below is **Segment 3 (Pages 31–56)** of the MD&A section from the second‑quarter 10‑Q filing (for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2024), reproduced verbatim from the document. (For clarity, repetitive headers, footers, and pagination markers have been omitted while preserving all substantive text exactly as it appears.)

**Earnings Performance (continued)**

Wells Fargo net income for second quarter 2024 was $4.9 billion ($1.33 diluted EPS), compared with $4.9 billion ($1.25 diluted EPS) in the same period a year ago. Net income was stable in second quarter 2024, compared with the same period a year ago, predominantly due to a $1.2 billion decrease in net interest income, a $321 million increase in income tax expense, and a $306 million increase in noninterest expense, offset by a $1.4 billion increase in noninterest income and a $477 million decrease in provision for credit losses.

Net income for the first half of 2024 was $9.5 billion ($2.53 diluted EPS), compared with $9.9 billion ($2.48 diluted EPS) in the same period a year ago. Net income decreased in the first half of 2024, compared with the same period a year ago, predominantly due to a $2.3 billion decrease in net interest income and a $1.0 billion increase in noninterest expense, partially offset by a $2.6 billion increase in noninterest income.

**Net Interest Income**  
Net interest income and net interest margin decreased in both the second quarter and the first half of 2024 compared with the same periods a year ago. This decline was driven by the impact of higher interest rates on interest‑bearing deposits and long‑term debt as well as lower loan balances, partially offset by higher interest rates on interest‑earning assets. Late in second quarter 2024, we increased pricing on sweep deposits in advisory brokerage accounts, which we expect will lower future net interest income.

Table 1 presents the individual components of net interest income and net interest margin. Net interest income and net interest margin are presented on a taxable‑equivalent basis to consistently reflect income from both taxable and tax‑exempt loans and debt and equity securities. The taxable‑equivalent calculation is based on a federal statutory tax rate of 21%.

For additional information about net interest income and net interest margin, see the “Earnings Performance – Net Interest Income” section in our 2023 Form 10‑K.

**Operating Segment Results**  
Our management reporting is organized into four reportable operating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending; Commercial Banking; Corporate and Investment Banking; and Wealth and Investment Management. All other business activities that are not included in these segments have been aggregated within Corporate. For additional information, see Table 5 below. We define our reportable operating segments by type of product and customer segment, and their results are based on our management reporting process. This process measures segment performance based on our internal management structure and is regularly reviewed with our Chief Executive Officer and other senior management. The process is based on U.S. GAAP and includes specific adjustments—such as funds transfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared revenue and expenses, and taxable‑equivalent adjustments—to consistently reflect income from taxable and tax‑exempt sources, allowing management to assess performance consistently across segments.

**Funds Transfer Pricing**  
Corporate treasury manages a funds transfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating segments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a funding credit for their deposits; both are included in net interest income. The net impact of these charges or credits is recognized in corporate treasury.

**Revenue and Expense Sharing**  
When lines of business jointly serve customers, the line responsible for providing the product or service recognizes revenue or expense—with a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line—based on established internal revenue-sharing agreements. When a line of business uses a service provided by another line or enterprise function (included in Corporate), expenses are allocated based on the cost and usage of the service provided. We periodically review and update these allocation methodologies.

**Taxable‑Equivalent Adjustments**  
Taxable‑equivalent adjustments related to tax‑exempt income on certain loans and debt securities are included in net interest income, while those related to income tax credits for affordable housing and renewable energy investments are included in noninterest income. In each case, the adjustments include corresponding impacts to income tax expense (benefit) and are eliminated in reconciliation to our consolidated financial results.

**Allocated Capital**  
Reportable operating segments are allocated capital under a risk‑sensitive framework primarily based on aspects of our regulatory capital requirements. The assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are periodically reviewed and updated. Management believes that return on allocated capital is a useful financial measure because it enables an assessment of each segment’s use of capital.

**Selected Metrics**  
We present various financial and nonfinancial metrics that management uses to evaluate segment results. These metrics help investors assess performance, customer growth, and trends within each reportable segment or line of business.
