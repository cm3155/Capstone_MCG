Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets (other than 
mortgage servicing rights) and goodwill and other intangibles on nonmarketable equity securities, net of applicable deferred taxes. The methodology of determining tangible common equity may 
differ among companies. Management believes that return on average tangible common equity and tangible book value per common share, which utilize tangible common equity, are useful financial 
measures because they enable investors and others to assess the Company’s use of equity. For additional information, including a corresponding reconciliation to generally accepted accounting 
principles (GAAP) financial measures, see the “Capital Management – Tangible Common Equity” section in this Report. 
The efficiency ratio is noninterest expense divided by total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income). 
Pre-tax pre-provision profit (PTPP) is total revenue less noninterest expense. Management believes that PTPP is a useful financial measure because it enables investors and others to assess the 
Company’s ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through a credit cycle. 
In second quarter 2020, diluted average common shares outstanding equaled average common shares outstanding because our securities convertible into common shares had an anti-dilutive effect. 
Consumer and small business banking deposits are total deposits excluding mortgage escrow and wholesale deposits. 
The risk-based capital ratios were calculated under the lower of the Standardized or Advanced Approach determined pursuant to Basel III. Beginning January 1, 2018, the requirements for calculating 
common equity tier 1 and tier 1 capital, along with risk-weighted assets, became fully phased-in. Accordingly, the information presented reflects fully phased-in common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 
capital and risk-weighted assets, but reflects total capital still in accordance with Transition Requirements. See the “Capital Management” section and Note 23 (Regulatory and Agency Capital 
Requirements) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information. 
Book value per common share is common stockholders’ equity divided by common shares outstanding. Tangible book value per common share is tangible common equity divided by common shares 
outstanding.

Financial Review 

Overview 

Wells Fargo & Company is a diversified, community-based 
financial services company with $1.97 trillion in assets. Founded 
in 1852 and headquartered in San Francisco, we provide banking, 
investment and mortgage products and services, as well as 
consumer and commercial finance, through 7,300 locations, more 
than 13,000 ATMs, digital (online, mobile and social), and contact 
centers (phone, email and correspondence), and we have offices in 
31 countries and territories to support customers who conduct 
business in the global economy. With approximately 266,000 
active, full-time equivalent team members, we serve one in three 
households in the United States and ranked No. 30 on 
Fortune’s 2020 rankings of America’s largest corporations. We 
ranked fourth in both assets and in the market value of our 
common stock among all U.S. banks at June 30, 2020. 

Wells Fargo’s top priority remains meeting its regulatory 
requirements to build the right foundation for all that lies ahead. 
To do that, the Company is committing the resources necessary 
to ensure that we operate with the strongest business practices 
and controls, maintain the highest level of integrity, and have an 
appropriate culture in place. 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been 

working diligently to protect employee safety while continuing to 
carry out Wells Fargo’s role as a provider of critical and essential 
services to the public. We have taken comprehensive steps to 
help customers, employees and communities. 

For our customers, we have suspended residential property 
foreclosure activities, offered fee waivers, and provided payment 
deferrals, among other actions. We have also rapidly expanded 
digital access and deployed new tools, including changes to our 
ATMs and mobile technology for the convenience of our 
customers. 

For our employees, we have enabled approximately 200,000 

to work remotely. For jobs that cannot be done from home, we 
have taken significant actions to help ensure employee safety, 
including adopting social distancing measures, requiring 
employees to wear facial coverings, and implementing an 
enhanced cleaning program. 

To support our communities, we are directing $175 million in 

charitable donations from the Wells Fargo Foundation to help 
address food, shelter, small business and housing stability, as well 
as providing help to public health organizations fighting to 
contain the spread of COVID-19. We have also committed to 
donating the gross processing fees received from the Paycheck 
Protection Program to help small businesses impacted by the 
COVID-19 pandemic and will work with nonprofit organizations 
to provide capital, technical support, and long-term resiliency 
programs to small businesses with an emphasis on serving 
minority-owned businesses. 

We have strong levels of capital and liquidity, and we remain 
focused on delivering for our customers and communities to get 
through these unprecedented times. 

Federal Reserve Board Consent Order Regarding 
Governance Oversight and Compliance and Operational 
Risk Management 
On February 2, 2018, the Company entered into a consent order 
with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
(FRB). As required by the consent order, the Company’s Board of 
Directors (Board) submitted to the FRB a plan to further enhance 
the Board’s governance and oversight of the Company, and the 
Company submitted to the FRB a plan to further improve the 
Company’s compliance and operational risk management 
program. The Company continues to engage with the FRB as the 
Company works to address the consent order provisions. The 
consent order also requires the Company, following the FRB’s 
acceptance and approval of the plans and the Company’s 
adoption and implementation of the plans, to complete an initial 
third-party review of the enhancements and improvements 
provided for in the plans. Until this third-party review is complete 
and the plans are approved and implemented to the satisfaction 
of the FRB, the Company’s total consolidated assets as defined 
under the consent order will be limited to the level as of 
December 31, 2017. Compliance with this asset cap is measured 
on a two-quarter daily average basis to allow for management of 
temporary fluctuations. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on 
April 8, 2020, the FRB amended the consent order to allow the 
Company to exclude from the asset cap any on-balance sheet 
exposure resulting from loans made by the Company in 
connection with the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck 
Protection Program and the FRB’s Main Street Lending Program. 
As required under the amendment to the consent order, certain 
fees and other economic benefits received by the Company from 
loans made in connection with these programs shall be 
transferred to the U.S. Treasury or to non-profit organizations 
approved by the FRB that support small businesses. After 
removal of the asset cap, a second third-party review must also 
be conducted to assess the efficacy and sustainability of the 
enhancements and improvements. 

Consent Orders with the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 
Regarding Compliance Risk Management Program, 
Automobile Collateral Protection Insurance Policies, and 
Mortgage Interest Rate Lock Extensions 
On April 20, 2018, the Company entered into consent orders with 
the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Office 

3 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overview (continued) 

of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to pay an aggregate of 
$1 billion in civil money penalties to resolve matters regarding the 
Company’s compliance risk management program and past 
practices involving certain automobile collateral protection 
insurance (CPI) policies and certain mortgage interest rate lock 
extensions. As required by the consent orders, the Company 
submitted to the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-wide compliance 
risk management plan and a plan to enhance the Company’s 
internal audit program with respect to federal consumer financial 
law and the terms of the consent orders. In addition, as required 
by the consent orders, the Company submitted for non-objection 
plans to remediate customers affected by the automobile 
collateral protection insurance and mortgage interest rate lock 
matters, as well as a plan for the management of remediation 
activities conducted by the Company. 

Retail Sales Practices Matters 
In September 2016, we announced settlements with the CFPB, 
the OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney, and 
entered into related consent orders with the CFPB and the OCC, 
in connection with allegations that some of our retail customers 
received products and services they did not request. As a result, it 
remains a top priority to rebuild trust through a comprehensive 
action plan that includes making things right for our customers, 
team members, and other stakeholders, and building a better 
Company for the future. Our priority of rebuilding trust has 
included numerous actions focused on identifying potential 
financial harm to customers resulting from these matters and 
providing remediation. 

For additional information regarding retail sales practices 
matters, including related legal matters, see the “Risk Factors” 
section in our 2019 Form 10-K and Note 14 (Legal Actions) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Other Customer Remediation Activities 
Our priority of rebuilding trust has also included an effort to 
identify other areas or instances where customers may have 
experienced financial harm, provide remediation as appropriate, 
and implement additional operational and control procedures. We 
are working with our regulatory agencies in this effort. We have 
previously disclosed key areas of focus as part of our rebuilding 
trust efforts and are in the process of providing remediation for 
those matters. We have accrued for the reasonably estimable 
remediation costs related to our rebuilding trust efforts, which 
amounts may change based on additional facts and information, 
as well as ongoing reviews and communications with our 
regulators. 

As our ongoing reviews continue, it is possible that in the 
future we may identify additional items or areas of potential 
concern. To the extent issues are identified, we will continue to 
assess any customer harm and provide remediation as 
appropriate. For more information, including related legal and 
regulatory risk, see the “Risk Factors” section in our 2019 Form 
10-K and Note 14 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

Financial Performance 
Wells Fargo had a net loss of $2.4 billion in second quarter 2020 
with diluted loss per common share of $0.66, compared with net 
income of $6.2 billion and diluted income per common share 
(EPS) of $1.30 a year ago. Financial performance items for second 
quarter 2020 compared with the same period a year ago included: 
• 

revenue of $17.8 billion, down $3.7 billion, with net interest 
income of $9.9 billion, down $2.2 billion, or 18%, and 
noninterest income of $8.0 billion, down $1.5 billion, or 16%;

•

• 
• 

a net interest margin of 2.25%, down 57 basis points; 
provision for credit losses of $9.5 billion, up $9.0 billion; 
noninterest expense of $14.6 billion, up $1.1 billion, or 8%; 
an efficiency ratio of 81.6%, compared with 62.3%; 
average loans of $971.3 billion, up $23.8 billion; 
average deposits of $1.39 trillion, up $117.7 billion; 
net loan charge-off rate of 0.46% (annualized) of average 
loans, compared with 0.28% (annualized); 
nonaccrual loans of $7.6 billion, up $1.7 billion, or 28%; and 
return on assets (ROA) of (0.49)% and return on equity (ROE) 
of (6.63)%, down from 1.31% and 13.26%, respectively. 

Balance Sheet and Liquidity 
Our balance sheet remained strong during second quarter 2020 
with solid levels of liquidity and capital. Our total assets were 
$1.97 trillion at June 30, 2020. Cash and other short-term 
investments increased $98.4 billion from December 31, 2019, 
reflecting an increase in cash balances, partially offset by lower 
federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale 
agreements. Debt securities decreased $24.5 billion from 
December 31, 2019, predominantly due to a decrease in 
available-for-sale debt securities, partially offset by an increase in 
held-to-maturity debt securities. Loans decreased $27.1 billion 
from December 31, 2019, due to paydowns in real estate 1-4 
family mortgage loans, credit card loans, and commercial and 
industrial loans, as well as the designation in second quarter 2020 
of real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans as mortgage loans held 
for sale (MLHFS). The decrease in loans was partially offset by an 
increase in commercial real estate loans driven by new 
originations and draws on construction loans. 

Average deposits in second quarter 2020 were $1.39 trillion, 
up $117.7 billion from second quarter 2019, on growth across the 
deposit gathering businesses reflecting customers’ preferences 
for liquidity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Credit Quality 
Credit quality declined due to the economic impact that the 
COVID-19 pandemic had on our customer base. 

Net loan charge-offs were $1.1 billion, or 0.46% (annualized) 

of average loans, in second quarter 2020, compared with 
$653 million a year ago (0.28%)(annualized). Our commercial 
portfolio net loan charge-offs were $602 million, or 44 basis 
points (annualized) of average commercial loans, in second 
quarter 2020, compared with net loan charge-offs of 
$165 million, or 13 basis points (annualized), a year ago, 
predominantly driven by increased losses in our commercial and 
industrial and commercial real estate loan portfolios. The 
increased losses in our commercial and industrial portfolio were 
primarily related to higher net loan charge-offs in our oil and gas 
portfolio. Our consumer portfolio net loan charge-offs were 
$511 million, or 48 basis points (annualized) of average consumer 
loans, in second quarter 2020, compared with net loan charge-
offs of $488 million, or 45 basis points (annualized), a year ago, 
predominantly driven by increased losses in our residential real 
estate and automobile loan portfolios, partially offset by lower 
losses in our credit card and other revolving credit and installment 
loan portfolios. 

The allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans of $20.4 billion 
at June 30, 2020, increased $9.8 billion, compared with a year ago, 
and increased $10.0 billion from December 31, 2019. We had a 
$11.4 billion increase in the allowance for credit losses for loans in 
the first half of 2020, partially offset by a $1.3 billion decrease as 
a result of our adoption on January 1, 2020, of Accounting 
Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit 
Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In first quarter 2020, we issued $2.0 billion of Non-
Cumulative Perpetual Class A Preferred Stock, Series Z. 
Additionally, we redeemed the remaining $1.8 billion of our Fixed-
to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Class A Preferred 
Stock, Series K. We also redeemed $669 million of our Non-
Cumulative Perpetual Class A Preferred Stock, Series T. 

On July 28, 2020, the Company reduced its third quarter 

2020 common stock dividend to $0.10 per share.

 We believe an important measure of our capital strength is 

the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio, which was 10.97% at 
June 30, 2020, down from 11.14% at December 31, 2019, but still 
above our internal target of 10% and the regulatory minimum of 
9%. As of June 30, 2020, our eligible external total loss absorbing 
capacity (TLAC) as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets was 
25.33%, compared with the required minimum of 22.0%. Likewise, 
our other regulatory capital ratios remained strong. See the 
“Capital Management” section in this Report for more 
information regarding our capital, including the calculation of our 
regulatory capital amounts. 

Instruments (CECL). The allowance coverage for total loans was 
2.19% at June 30, 2020, compared with 1.12% a year ago and 
1.09% at December 31, 2019. The allowance covered 4.6 times 
annualized net loan charge-offs in second quarter 2020, 
compared with 4.0 times in second quarter 2019. Our provision 
for credit losses for loans was $9.6 billion in second quarter 2020, 
up from $503 million a year ago. The increase in the allowance for 
credit losses for loans and the provision for credit losses reflected 
current and forecasted economic conditions due to the COVID-19 
pandemic. 

Nonperforming assets (NPAs) at June 30, 2020, of 

$7.8 billion, increased $1.4 billion, or 22%, from March 31, 2020, 
and $2.2 billion, or 38%, from December 31, 2019, and 
represented 0.83% of total loans at June 30, 2020. Nonaccrual 
loans increased $1.4 billion from March 31, 2020, due to increases 
in commercial loans driven by the oil and gas portfolio and 
increases in real estate mortgage loans, as the economic impact 
of the COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact our customer 
base. Foreclosed assets decreased $57 million from March 31, 
2020. For information on how we are assisting our customers in 
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, see the “Risk Management 
– Credit Risk Management” section in this Report. 

Capital 
We maintained a solid capital position in the first half of 2020, 
with total equity of $180.1 billion at June 30, 2020, compared 
with $188.0 billion at December 31, 2019. We reduced our 
common shares outstanding by 14.9 million shares from 
December 31, 2019, through share repurchases, partially offset 
by issuances and conversions of preferred shares. On March 15, 
2020, we, along with the other members of the Financial Services 
Forum (which consists of the eight largest and most diversified 
financial institutions headquartered in the U.S.), decided to 
temporarily suspend share repurchases for the remainder of the 
first quarter and for second quarter 2020. On June 25, 2020, the 
FRB announced that it was prohibiting large bank holding 
companies (BHCs) subject to the FRB’s capital plan rule, including 
Wells Fargo, from making any capital distribution (excluding any 
capital distribution arising from the issuance of a capital 
instrument eligible for inclusion in the numerator of a regulatory 
capital ratio), unless otherwise approved by the FRB. Through the 
end of third quarter 2020, the FRB authorized certain limited 
exceptions to this prohibition, which are described in the “Capital 
Management – Capital Planning and Stress Testing” section in 
this Report.

Earnings Performance 

Wells Fargo net loss for second quarter 2020 was $2.4 billion 
($0.66 diluted loss per common share), compared with net 
income of $6.2 billion ($1.30 diluted income per common share) 
in the same period a year ago. Net income decreased to a net loss 
in second quarter 2020, compared with the same period a year 
ago, due to a $2.2 billion decrease in net interest income, a 
$9.0 billion increase in our provision for credit losses, a $1.5 billion 
decrease in noninterest income, and a $1.1 billion increase in 
noninterest expense, partially offset by a $5.2 billion decrease in 
income tax expense. Net loss for the first half of 2020 was 
$1.7 billion, compared with net income of $12.1 billion in the 
same period a year ago. Net income decreased to a net loss in the 
first half of 2020, compared with the same period a year ago, due 
to a $3.2 billion decrease in net interest income, a $12.2 billion 
increase in our provision for credit losses, a $4.4 billion decrease in 
noninterest income, and a $234 million increase in noninterest 
expense, partially offset by a $5.9 billion decrease in income tax 
expense. 

Revenue, the sum of net interest income and noninterest 
income, was $17.8 billion in second quarter 2020, compared with 
$21.6 billion in the same period a year ago. Revenue for the first 
half of 2020 was $35.6 billion, compared with $43.2 billion in the 
same period a year ago. Net interest income represented 55% of 
revenue in second quarter 2020, compared with 56% in the same 
period a year ago, and 60% of revenue in the first half of 2020, 
compared with 57% in the same period a year ago. Noninterest 
income represented 45% of revenue in second quarter 2020, 
compared with 44% in the same period a year ago, and 40% of 
revenue in the first half of 2020, compared with 43% in the same 
period a year ago.

Net Interest Income 
Net interest income is the interest earned on debt securities, 
loans (including yield-related loan fees) and other interest-
earning assets minus the interest paid on deposits, short-term 
borrowings and long-term debt. The net interest margin is the 
average yield on earning assets minus the average interest rate 
paid for deposits and our other sources of funding. Net interest 
income and the net interest margin are presented on a taxable-
equivalent basis in Table 1 to consistently reflect income from 
taxable and tax-exempt loans and debt and equity securities 
based on a 21% federal statutory tax rate for the periods ending 
June 30, 2020 and 2019.

 Net interest income and the net interest margin in any one 

period can be significantly affected by a variety of factors 
including the mix of earning assets in our portfolio, the overall 
size of our earning assets portfolio, and the cost of funding those 
assets. In addition, variable sources of interest income, such as 
loan fees, periodic dividends, and collection of interest on 
nonaccrual loans, can fluctuate from period to period. 

Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis was 
$10.0 billion and $21.5 billion in the second quarter and first half 
of 2020, respectively, compared with $12.3 billion and 
$24.7 billion for the same periods a year ago. Net interest margin 
on a taxable-equivalent basis was 2.25% and 2.42% in the second 
quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, compared with 2.82% 
and 2.86% for the same periods a year ago. The decrease in net 
interest income and net interest margin in the second quarter and 
first half of 2020, compared with the same periods a year ago, 
was driven by unfavorable impacts of repricing due to lower 
market rates and changes in mix of earning assets and funding 
sources, including sales of high yielding Pick-a-Pay loans in 2019. 
Average earning assets increased $40.0 billion in second 
quarter 2020, compared with the same period a year ago. The 
change was driven by increases in: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
partially offset by decreases in: 
• 

average interest-earning deposits with banks of $35.3 billion; 
average loans of $23.8 billion; 
average mortgage loans held for sale of $7.5 billion; and 
other earning assets of $3.0 billion; 

average federal funds sold and securities purchased under 
resale agreements of $21.7 billion; and 
average equity securities of $7.8 billion. 

• 

Average earning assets increased $44.9 billion in the first half 

of 2020, compared with the same period a year ago. The change 
was driven by increases in: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

average loans of $19.4 billion; 
average interest-earning deposits with banks of $12.0 billion; 
average mortgage loans held for sale of $7.0 billion; 
average debt securities of $4.2 billion; 
other earning assets of $3.0 billion; and 
average federal funds sold and securities purchased under 
resale agreements of $1.1 billion; 

partially offset by decreases in: 
• 

average equity securities of $1.7 billion. 

Deposits are an important low-cost source of funding and 

affect both net interest income and the net interest margin. 
Deposits include noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing 
checking, market rate and other savings, savings certificates, 
other time deposits, and deposits in non-U.S. offices. Average 
deposits were $1.39 trillion and $1.36 trillion in the second 
quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, compared with 
$1.27 trillion for both the second quarter and first half of 2019, 
and represented 143% of average loans in second quarter 2020 
and 141% in the first half of 2020, compared with 134% in second 
quarter 2019 and 133% in the first half of 2019. Average deposits 
were 78% and 76% of average earning assets in the second 
quarter and first half of 2020, compared with 73% in both periods 
a year ago. The average deposit cost for second quarter 2020 was 
17 basis points, down 53 basis points from a year ago, reflecting 
the lower interest rate environment.

NM – Not meaningful 
(1) 

In second quarter 2020, insurance income was reclassified to all other noninterest income. Prior period balances have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. 

Noninterest income decreased $1.5 billion and $4.4 billion in the 
second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, compared with 
the same periods a year ago, due to overall lower income driven 
by the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. For more 
information on the nature of services performed for certain of 
our revenues discussed below, see Note 18 (Revenue from 
Contracts with Customers) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

Service charges on deposit accounts decreased $276 million 

and $161 million in the second quarter and first half of 2020, 
respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago, due to 
lower customer transaction volumes and higher average account 
balances. We have provided certain fee waivers and reversals to 
support customers during the COVID-19 pandemic, which also 
negatively impacted income from service charges on deposit 
accounts. 

Brokerage advisory, commissions and other fees decreased 

$201 million in second quarter 2020, compared with the same 
period a year ago, due to lower asset-based fees and lower 
transactional revenue. Brokerage advisory, commissions and 
other fees increased $88 million in the first half of 2020, 
compared with the same period a year ago, due to higher asset-
based fees. Asset-based fees include fees from advisory accounts 
that are based on a percentage of the market value of the assets 
as of the beginning of the quarter. All retail brokerage services are 
provided by our Wealth and Investment Management (WIM) 
operating segment. For additional information on retail 

10 

brokerage client assets, including asset composition, see the 
“Operating Segment Results – Wealth and Investment 
Management – Retail Brokerage Client Assets” section in this 
Report. 

Trust and investment management fees decreased 

$108 million and $193 million in the second quarter and first half 
of 2020, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago, 
driven by lower trust fees due to the sale of our Institutional 
Retirement and Trust (IRT) business in 2019. 

Our assets under management (AUM) totaled $766.6 billion 
at June 30, 2020, compared with $682.0 billion at June 30, 2019. 
Substantially all of our AUM is managed by our WIM operating 
segment. Our assets under administration (AUA) totaled 
$1.7 trillion at June 30, 2020 and $1.8 trillion at June 30, 2019. 
Management believes that AUM and AUA are useful metrics 
because they allow investors and others to assess how changes in 
asset amounts may impact the generation of certain asset-based 
fees. 

Our AUM and AUA included IRT client assets of $21 billion 

and $730 billion, respectively, at June 30, 2020, which we 
continue to administer at the direction of the buyer pursuant to a 
transition services agreement that will terminate no later than 
July 2021. 

Additional information regarding our WIM operating 

segment AUM is provided in Table 4f and the related discussion in 
the “Operating Segment Results – Wealth and Investment 

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Management – Trust and Investment Client Assets Under 
Management” section in this Report. 

Card fees decreased $228 million and $280 million in the 
second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, compared with 
the same periods a year ago. The decrease in the second quarter 
and first half of 2020, compared with the same periods a year 
ago, was due to lower interchange fees driven by decreased 
purchase volume due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
and higher fee waivers as part of our actions to support 
customers during the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by 
lower rewards costs. 

Other fees decreased $222 million and $360 million in the 
second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, compared with 
the same periods a year ago, driven by a decline in commission 
fees as a result of the sale of our commercial real estate 
brokerage business, Eastdil Secured (Eastdil), in fourth quarter 
2019, and lower business payroll income due to the sale of our 
Business Payroll Services business in first quarter 2019. 
Additionally, we waived or reversed certain lending related 
charges or fees as part of our actions to support customers 
during the COVID-19 pandemic, which also negatively impacted 
other fees. 

Mortgage banking noninterest income, consisting of net 
servicing income and net gains on mortgage loan origination/ 
sales activities, decreased $441 million and $770 million in the 
second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, compared with 
the same periods a year ago. For more information, see Note 11 
(Mortgage Banking Activities) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

Our portfolio of loans serviced for others was $1.6 trillion at 

both June 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019. At June 30, 2020, 
the ratio of combined residential and commercial mortgage 
servicing rights (MSRs) to related loans serviced for others was 
0.52%, compared with 0.79% at December 31, 2019. 

Net servicing income decreased $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion in 
the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, compared 
with the same periods a year ago. The decrease in net servicing 
income in the second quarter and first half of 2020, compared 
with the same periods a year ago, was driven by MSR valuation 
losses, net of hedge results, reflecting higher expected servicing 
costs and updates to other valuation model assumptions 
affecting prepayment estimates that are independent of interest 
rate changes, such as changes in home prices and in customer 
credit profiles. The decrease in net servicing income in the second 
quarter and first half of 2020 also reflected continued 
prepayments and the impacts of customer accommodations 
associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. See the “Risk 
Management – Asset/Liability Management – Mortgage Banking 
Interest Rate and Market Risk” section in this Report for 
additional information regarding our MSRs risks and hedging 
approach. 

Net gains on mortgage loan origination/sales activities 
increased $525 million and $289 million in the second quarter 
and first half of 2020, respectively, compared with the same 
periods a year ago, due to higher residential real estate held for 
sale origination volumes and margins. 

The production margin on residential held for sale mortgage 

loan originations, which represents net gains on residential 
mortgage loan origination/sales activities divided by total 
residential held for sale mortgage loan originations, provides a 
measure of the profitability of our residential mortgage 
origination activity. The increase in the production margin in the 
second quarter and first half of 2020, compared with the same 
periods a year ago, was due to higher margins in both our retail 
and correspondent production channels, as well as a shift to more 

retail origination volume, which has a higher margin. Table 2a 
presents the information used in determining the production 
margin.

loss mitigation activities, interest rate management activities and changes in estimate to 
the liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses. 
Balances presented are as of June 30, 2020 and 2019. 

Net gains from trading activities, which reflect unrealized 
changes in fair value of our trading positions and realized gains 
and losses, increased $578 million and $285 million in the second 
quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, compared with the 
same periods a year ago. The increase in the second quarter and 
first half of 2020, compared with the same periods a year ago, 
reflected trading volatility created by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The increase in second quarter 2020, compared with the same 
period a year ago, also reflected higher gains driven by market 
liquidity and improvements in the energy sector, as well as 
increased demand for interest rate products due to lower interest 
rates. The increase in the first half of 2020, compared with the 
same period a year ago, also reflected higher income driven by 
demand for interest rate products due to lower interest rates, as 
well as higher equities and credit trading volume, partially offset 
by lower income from wider credit spreads and lower trading 
volumes in asset-backed securities. Net gains from trading 
activities exclude interest and dividend income and expense on 
trading securities, which are reported within interest income from 
debt and equity securities and other interest income. For 
additional information about trading activities, see the “Risk 
Management – Asset/Liability Management – Market Risk-
Trading Activities” section and Note 4 (Trading Activities) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Net gains from debt securities increased $192 million and 

$304 million in the second quarter and first half of 2020, 
respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago, 
reflecting higher gains from the sale of agency mortgage-backed 
securities (MBS). 

Net gains from equity securities decreased $89 million and 

$2.3 billion in the second quarter and first half of 2020, 
respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago, driven

Earnings Performance (continued) 

by changes in the value of deferred compensation plan 
investments (largely offset in personnel expense) and higher 
unrealized losses. The decrease in the first half of 2020, compared 
with the same period a year ago, also included a $1.0 billion 
impairment on equity securities. Table 3a presents results for our 
deferred compensation plan and related investments. 

Lease income decreased $90 million and $181 million in the 

second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, compared with 
the same periods a year ago, driven by reductions in the size of 
the equipment leasing portfolio. 

All other income decreased $736 million and $941 million in 
the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, compared 
with the same periods a year ago. All other income includes 
insurance income, income or losses from equity method 
investments, including low-income housing tax credit 

investments (excluding related tax credits recorded in income tax 
expense), foreign currency adjustments and related hedges of 
foreign currency risks, and certain economic hedges. The decrease 
in the second quarter and first half of 2020, compared with the 
same periods a year ago, was driven by higher income in the 
second quarter and first half of 2019 from gains on the sales of 
purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans, as well as lower equity 
method investments income in the second quarter and first half 
of 2020, partially offset by gains on the sales of loans reclassified 
to held for sale in 2019 and sold in the second quarter and first 
half of 2020. The decrease in the first half of 2020, compared 
with the same period a year ago, also reflected a pre-tax gain on 
the sale of our Business Payroll Services business in first quarter 
2019, partially offset by transition services fees in the first half of 
2020 associated with the sale of our IRT business.

In second quarter 2020, personnel-related expenses were combined into a single line item, and expenses for cloud computing services were reclassified from contract services expense to technology 
and equipment expense. Prior period balances have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. 
Represents expenses for both leased and owned properties. 
Represents expenses for assets we lease to customers. 

Noninterest expense increased $1.1 billion and $234 million in 
the second quarter and first half of 2020, compared with the 
same periods a year ago, predominantly driven by higher 
operating losses and occupancy expense. 

Personnel expense increased $437 million in second quarter 
2020, compared with the same period a year ago, and decreased 
$457 million in the first half of 2020, compared with the same 
period a year ago. The increase in second quarter 2020, 
compared with the same period a year ago, was driven by higher 
deferred compensation expense (offset in net gains from equity 
securities), and higher salaries expense. The decrease in the first 
half of 2020, compared with the same period a year ago, was 
driven by lower deferred compensation expense (offset in net 
losses from equity securities), partially offset by an increase in 
salaries and employee benefits expense. The second quarter and 
first half of 2020 also reflected higher salaries driven by annual 
salary increases and higher staffing levels, as well as increased 
employee benefits and incentive compensation expense related 
to the COVID-19 pandemic, including additional payments for 

12 

certain customer-facing and support employees and back-up 
childcare services. 

Table 3a presents results for our deferred compensation 
plan and related hedges. Historically, we used equity securities as 
economic hedges of our deferred compensation plan liabilities. 
Changes in the fair value of the equity securities used as 
economic hedges were recorded in net gains (losses) from equity 
securities within noninterest income. In second quarter 2020, we 
entered into arrangements to transition our economic hedges 
from equity securities to derivative instruments. Changes in fair 
value of derivatives used as economic hedges are presented 
within the same financial statement line as the related business 
activity being hedged. As a result of this transition, we presented

Occupancy expense increased $152 million and $150 million 

in the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, 
compared with the same periods a year ago, due to additional 
cleaning fees, supplies, and equipment expenses related to the 
COVID-19 pandemic. 

Operating losses increased $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion in the 

second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, compared 
with the same periods a year ago, due to higher litigation and 
customer remediation accruals. The increase in customer 
remediation accruals reflected expansions of the population of 
affected customers, remediation payments, and/or remediation 
time frames for a variety of matters. 

Outside professional and contract services expense 
decreased $19 million in second quarter 2020, compared with 
the same period a year ago, and increased $85 million in the first 
half of 2020, compared with the same period a year ago. The 
decrease in second quarter 2020, compared with the same 
period a year ago, was due to lower legal expenses and reduced 
project spending. The increase in the first half of 2020, compared 
with the same period a year ago, was due to an increase in project 
spending, partially offset by lower legal expenses. 

Advertising and promotion expense decreased $192 million 

and $248 million in the second quarter and first half of 2020, 
respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago, driven 
by decreases in marketing and brand campaign volumes due to 
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Travel and entertainment expense decreased $148 million and 

$202 million in the second quarter and first half of 2020, 
respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago, driven 
by a reduction in business travel and company events due to 
ongoing expense management initiatives, as well as the impact of 
the COVID-19 pandemic.

All other expense increased $69 million in second quarter 
2020, compared with the same period a year ago, and decreased 
$61 million in the first half of 2020, compared with the same 
period a year ago. The increase in second quarter 2020, compared 
with the same period a year ago, was due to higher pension plan 
settlement expenses and lower gains on the extinguishment of 
debt, partially offset by a reduction in the insurance claims 
reserve and lower pension benefit plan expenses. The decrease in 
the first half of 2020, compared with the same period a year ago, 
was due to a reduction in the insurance claims reserve and lower 
pension benefit plan expenses, partially offset by higher pension 
plan settlement expenses. 

Income Tax Expense 
Income tax benefit was $3.9 billion and $3.8 billion in the second 
quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, compared with 
income tax expense of $1.3 billion and $2.2 billion in the same 
periods a year ago. The decrease in income tax expense to an 
income tax benefit in both the second quarter and first half of 
2020, compared with the same periods a year ago, was driven by 
lower income. Our effective income tax rate was 62.2% and 68.5% 
for the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, 
compared with 17.3% and 15.3% for the same periods a year ago. 
The higher rate in second quarter 2020, compared with the same 
period a year ago, reflected the impact of annual income tax 
benefits, primarily tax credits, driven by the reported pre-tax loss, 
and included net discrete income tax benefits of $98 million 
predominantly related to the resolution of prior period U.S. 
federal income tax matters.

Earnings Performance (continued) 

Operating Segment Results 
As of June 30, 2020, we were organized for management 
reporting purposes into three operating segments: Community 
Banking; Wholesale Banking; and Wealth and Investment 
Management (WIM). These segments are defined by product 
type and customer segment and their results are based on our 
management reporting process. The management reporting 
process is based on U.S. GAAP with specific adjustments, such as 
for funds transfer pricing for asset/liability management, for 
shared revenues and expenses, and tax-equivalent adjustments to 
consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt sources. 
On February 11, 2020, we announced a new organizational 
structure with five principal lines of business: Consumer and Small 
Business Banking; Consumer Lending; Commercial Banking; 
Corporate and Investment Banking; and Wealth and Investment 
Management. This new organizational structure is intended to 
help drive operating, control, and business performance. In 
July 2020, the Company completed the transition to this new 
organizational structure, including finalizing leadership for these 
principal business lines and aligning management reporting and 
allocation methodologies. These changes will not impact the 
consolidated financial results of the Company. Accordingly, we will 
update our operating segment disclosures, including comparative 
financial results, in third quarter 2020. Table 4 and the following 
discussion present our results by operating segment. For 
additional description of our operating segments, including 
additional financial information and the underlying management 
reporting process, see Note 22 (Operating Segments) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

We perform a goodwill impairment assessment annually in 

the fourth quarter. However, in second quarter 2020, we 
performed another interim, quantitative impairment assessment 
of our goodwill given deteriorated macroeconomic conditions 
from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These market 
conditions led to a sharp decline in share prices for Wells Fargo 
and other companies across many industries. As part of our 
interim assessment, we updated our assumptions used in both 
the income and market approaches for estimating fair values of 
our reporting units. The update to assumptions incorporated 
current market-based information such as price-earnings 
information and a regular update to our internal enterprise-wide 

Table 4:  Operating Segment Results – Highlights 

forecasts, which reflected lower interest rates and higher 
expected credit losses, as well as a weaker macroeconomic 
outlook. 

Since our annual assessment, we have observed declines in 
the fair values of our reporting units and the amount of excess 
fair value over the carrying amount of our reporting units; 
however, we did not have evidence of goodwill impairment as of 
June 30, 2020. The fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its 
corresponding carrying amount by 18% or higher. The estimated 
fair value of our corporate and investment banking reporting unit, 
included within the Wholesale Banking operating segment, 
increased in second quarter 2020 as it reflected recent updates in 
price-earnings information used in our market approach 
valuations. The increase in fair value resulted in significant excess 
fair value over the carrying amount for the reporting unit 
compared with the prior quarter. 

The aggregate fair value of our reporting units exceeded our 

market capitalization as of June 30, 2020. Our individual 
reporting unit fair values cannot be directly correlated to the 
Company’s market capitalization. However, we considered several 
factors in the comparison of aggregate fair value to market 
capitalization, including (i) control premiums adjusted for the 
current market environment, which include synergies that may 
not be reflected in current market pricing, (ii) degree of 
complexity and execution risk at the reporting unit level 
compared with the enterprise level, and (iii) issues or risks related 
to the Company level that may not be included in the fair value of 
the individual reporting units. Given the uncertainty of the 
severity or length of the current economic downturn, we will 
continue to monitor our performance against our internal 
forecasts as well as market conditions for circumstances that 
could have a further negative effect on the estimated fair values 
of our reporting units. 

In connection with the planned change to our operating 
segment disclosures, we will realign our goodwill to the reporting 
units that underlie our operating segments, which could impact 
the results of our goodwill impairment assessment. We will 
reassess goodwill for impairment at the time of the realignment. 
For additional information about goodwill, see Note 1 (Summary 
of Significant Accounting Policies) in our 2019 Form 10-K.

Represents income on products and services for WIM customers served through Community Banking distribution channels which is eliminated in consolidation. 
Includes underwriting fees paid to Wells Fargo Securities for services related to the issuance of our corporate securities which are offset in our Wholesale Banking segment and eliminated in 
consolidation. 
Primarily represents gains resulting from venture capital investments. 
In second quarter 2020, insurance income was reclassified to other noninterest income, and expenses for cloud computing services were reclassified from contract services expense (within other 
noninterest expense) to technology and equipment expense. Prior period balances have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. 
Reflects results attributable to noncontrolling interests predominantly associated with the Company’s consolidated venture capital investments.

(5) 

Community Banking reported a net loss of $331 million in 
second quarter 2020, compared with net income of $3.1 billion in 
the same period a year ago, and reported a net loss of 
$176 million in the first half of 2020, compared with net income 
of $6.0 billion in the same period a year ago. 

Revenue decreased $3.0 billion and $5.3 billion in the second 

quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, compared with the 
same periods a year ago. The decrease in the second quarter and 
first half of 2020, compared with the same periods a year ago, 
was driven by lower net interest income reflecting the lower 
interest rate environment and lower noninterest income 
reflecting lower fees from reduced consumer spending and 
transaction activity due to the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic, partially offset by higher net gains on debt securities. 
The decrease in the first half of 2020, compared with the same 
period a year ago, also reflected net losses on equity securities 
(including lower deferred compensation plan investment results, 

which were largely offset in personnel expense). 

The provision for credit losses increased $2.9 billion and 

$3.9 billion in the second quarter and first half of 2020, 
respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago, due to 
increases in the allowance for credit losses reflecting current and 
forecasted economic conditions due to the impact of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. 

Noninterest expense increased $1.1 billion and $561 million 

in the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, 
compared with the same periods a year ago. The increase in the 
second quarter and first half of 2020, compared with the same 
periods a year ago, was due to higher operating losses, occupancy 
expense, outside professional services expense, and technology 
and equipment expense, partially offset by lower other expenses. 
The increase in second quarter 2020, compared with the same 
period a year ago, also reflected higher personnel expense.

Earnings Performance (continued) 

Average loans decreased $8.4 billion and $1.9 billion in the 
second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, compared with 
the same periods a year ago. The decrease in second quarter 
2020, compared with the same period a year ago, was driven by 
lower real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans and lower junior 
lien mortgage loans, partially offset by higher commercial loans. 
The decrease in the first half of 2020, compared with the same 
period a year ago, was due to lower junior lien mortgage loans, 
partially offset by higher automobile loans. 

Average deposits increased $70.9 billion and $51.9 billion, in 
the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, compared 

with the same periods a year ago, driven by customers’ 
preferences for liquidity due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In second quarter 2020, insurance income was reclassified to other noninterest income, and expenses for cloud computing services were reclassified from contract services expense (within other 
noninterest expense) to technology and equipment expense. Prior period balances have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. 
Income tax expense for our Wholesale Banking operating segment included income tax credits related to low-income housing and renewable energy investments of $465 million and $956 million for 
the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, and $423 million and $850 million for the second quarter and first half of 2019, respectively.

Wholesale Banking reported a net loss of $2.1 billion in 
second quarter 2020, compared with net income of $2.8 billion in 
the same period a year ago, and reported a net loss of $1.8 billion 
in the first half of 2020, compared with net income of $5.6 billion 
in the same period a year ago. 

Net interest income decreased $644 million and $1.0 billion 

in the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, 
compared with the same periods a year ago, driven by the impact 
of the lower interest rate environment, partially offset by higher 
average deposit balances and higher average loan balances. 

investment banking fees, partially offset by lower other 
noninterest income including lower lease income, and lower 
commercial real estate brokerage fees within other fees related 
to our sale of Eastdil in fourth quarter 2019. Noninterest income 
decreased $754 million in the first half of 2020, compared with 
the same period a year ago, due to lower other income from 
higher amortization on renewable energy and community lending 
investments and lower lease income, lower other fees related to 
our sale of Eastdil, and lower mortgage banking fees, partially 
offset by higher investment banking fees. 

Noninterest income increased $142 million in second quarter 

The provision for credit losses increased $6.0 billion and 

2020, compared with the same period a year ago, due to 
increased market sensitive revenue (represents net gains (losses) 
from trading activities, debt securities, and equity securities) and 

$8.2 billion in the second quarter and first half of 2020, 
respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago, due to 
increases in the allowance for credit losses reflecting current and

forecasted economic conditions due to the impact of the 
COVID-19 pandemic and higher charge-offs in the oil and gas and 
commercial real estate portfolios. 

Noninterest expense increased $81 million and $6 million in 
the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, compared 
with the same periods a year ago. The increase in second quarter 
2020, compared with the same period a year ago, was driven by 
higher operating losses primarily due to litigation accruals, 
partially offset by lower personnel expense. The increase in the 
first half of 2020, compared with the same period a year ago, was 
due to higher operating losses and increased regulatory and risk 
related expense within other noninterest expense, partially offset 
by lower personnel expense, and lower lease and travel expenses 
within other noninterest expense, as well as the impact of the sale 
of Eastdil in fourth quarter 2019. 

Average loans increased $30.3 billion and $19.2 billion in the 
second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, compared with 
the same periods a year ago, reflecting broad-based growth 
across the lines of businesses driven by draws of revolving lines 
due to the economic slowdown associated with the COVID-19 
pandemic. 

Table 4c:  Wealth and Investment Management 

Average deposits increased $30.8 billion and $38.8 billion in 
the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, compared 
with the same periods a year ago, reflecting customers’ 
preferences for liquidity due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

with the same periods a year ago. 

Net interest income decreased $301 million and $535 million 

in the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, 
compared with the same periods a year ago, driven by lower 

interest rates, partially offset by higher average deposit balances 
and higher average loan balances. 

Noninterest income decreased $89 million and $219 million

other noninterest expense and higher broker commissions within 
personnel expense. 

Average loans increased $3.7 billion and $3.9 billion in the 
second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, compared with 
the same periods a year ago, driven by growth in real estate 1-4 
first mortgage loans. 

Average deposits increased $28.3 billion and $13.3 billion in 
the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, compared 
with the same periods a year ago, primarily due to growth in 
brokerage clients’ cash balances. 

The following discussions provide additional information for 
client assets we oversee in our retail brokerage advisory and trust 
and investment management business lines. 

Retail Brokerage Client Assets  Brokerage advisory, commissions 
and other fees are received for providing full-service and discount 
brokerage services predominantly to retail brokerage clients. 
Offering advisory account relationships to our brokerage clients is 
an important component of our broader strategy of meeting 
their financial needs. Although a majority of our retail brokerage 
client assets are in accounts that earn brokerage commissions, 
the fees from those accounts generally represent transactional 
commissions based on the number and size of transactions 
executed at the client’s direction. Fees from advisory accounts are 
based on a percentage of the market value of the assets as of the 
beginning of the quarter, which vary across the account types 
based on the distinct services provided, and are affected by 
investment performance as well as asset inflows and outflows. A 
majority of our brokerage advisory, commissions and other fee 
income is earned from advisory accounts. Table 4d shows advisory 
account client assets as a percentage of total retail brokerage 
client assets at June 30, 2020 and 2019.

Earnings Performance (continued) 

was driven by lower asset-based fees and lower brokerage 
transaction revenue, partially offset by net gains from equity 
securities driven by an increase in deferred compensation plan 
investment results (largely offset by lower personnel expense). 
The decrease in the first half of 2020, compared with the same 
period a year ago, was driven by net losses from equity securities 
driven by a decline in deferred compensation plan investment 
results (largely offset by lower personnel expense) and lower 
trust and investment management income, partially offset by 
higher retail brokerage advisory fees (priced at the beginning of 
the quarter). 

The provision for credit losses increased $258 million and 

$262 million in the second quarter and first half of 2020, 
respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago, driven 
by current and forecasted economic conditions due to the impact 
of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Noninterest expense decreased $93 million and $293 million 

in the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, 
compared with the same periods a year ago. The decrease in 
second quarter 2020, compared with the same period a year ago, 
was driven by lower personnel expense from lower commissions 
and other incentive compensation, and lower technology and 
equipment expense related to the reversal of an accrual for 
software costs, partially offset by higher project spending on 
regulatory and compliance related initiatives included within 
other noninterest expense and higher deferred compensation 
plan expense within personnel expense (largely offset by net 
gains from equity securities). The decrease in the first half of

Retail Brokerage advisory accounts include assets that are 
financial advisor-directed and separately managed by third-party 
managers, as well as certain client-directed brokerage assets 
where we earn a fee for advisory and other services, but do not 
have investment discretion. For second quarter 2020 and 2019, 
the average fee rate by account type ranged from 80 to 120 basis

Trust and Investment Client Assets Under Management  We 
earn trust and investment management fees from managing and 
administering assets, including mutual funds, separate accounts, 
and personal trust assets, through our asset management and 
wealth businesses. Prior to the sale of our IRT business, which 
closed on July 1, 2019, we also earned fees from managing 
employee benefit trusts through the retirement business. Our 
asset management business is conducted by Wells Fargo Asset 
Management (WFAM), which offers Wells Fargo proprietary 
mutual funds and manages institutional separate accounts, and 

our wealth business, which manages assets for high net worth 
clients. Generally, our trust and investment management fee 
income is earned from AUM where we have discretionary 
management authority over the investments and generate fees 
as a percentage of the market value of the AUM. For additional 
information on the sale of our IRT business, including its impact 
on our AUM and AUA, see the “Earnings Performance – 
Noninterest Income” section in this Report. Table 4f presents 
AUM activity for the second quarter and first half of 2020 and

Balance Sheet Analysis 

At June 30, 2020, our assets totaled $1.97 trillion, up $41.2 billion 
from December 31, 2019. Asset growth reflected an increase in 
cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $121.3 billion, 
partially offset by declines in debt securities and loans of 
$24.5 billion and $27.1 billion, respectively, as well as a 
$22.9 billion decrease in federal funds sold and securities 
purchased under resale agreements and a $15.7 billion decrease 
in equity securities.

Represents amortized cost of the securities, net of the allowance for credit losses, of $114 million related to available-for-sale debt securities and $20 million related to held-to-maturity debt 
securities at June 30, 2020. The allowance for credit losses related to available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities was $0 at December 31, 2019, due to our adoption of CECL on 
January 1, 2020. For more information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
Available-for-sale debt securities are carried on the balance sheet at fair value, which includes the allowance for credit losses, subsequent to the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020. 
Held-to-maturity debt securities are carried on the balance sheet at amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses, subsequent to the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020. 

Table 5 presents a summary of our available-for-sale and 
held-to-maturity debt securities, which decreased $19.5 billion in 
balance sheet carrying value from December 31, 2019, as 
purchases were more than offset by runoff and sales. 

The total net unrealized gains on available-for-sale debt 

securities were $4.4 billion at June 30, 2020, up from net 
unrealized gains of $3.4 billion at December 31, 2019, driven by 
lower interest rates, partially offset by wider credit spreads. For a 
discussion of our investment management objectives and 
practices, see the “Balance Sheet Analysis” section in our 2019 
Form 10-K. Also, see the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability 
Management” section in this Report for information on our use of 
investments to manage liquidity and interest rate risk. 

After adoption of CECL, we recorded an allowance for credit 

losses on available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt 
securities. Total provision/(reversal of provision) for credit losses 
on debt securities was $(31) million and $141 million in the 
second quarter and first half of 2020. For a discussion of our 
accounting policies relating to the allowance for credit losses on 
debt securities and underlying considerations and analysis, see 
Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 5 
(Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

At June 30, 2020, debt securities included $47.3 billion of 
municipal bonds, of which 97.7% were rated “A-” or better based 
predominantly on external ratings. Additionally, some of the debt 
securities in our total municipal bond portfolio are guaranteed 
against loss by bond insurers. These guaranteed bonds are 
predominantly investment grade and were generally 
underwritten in accordance with our own investment standards 
prior to the determination to purchase, without relying on the 
bond insurer’s guarantee in making the investment decision. The 
credit quality of our municipal bond holdings are monitored as 
part of our ongoing evaluation of the appropriateness of the 
allowance for credit losses on debt securities. 

The weighted-average expected maturity of debt securities 
available-for-sale was 4.3 years at June 30, 2020. The expected 

20 

remaining maturity is shorter than the remaining contractual 
maturity for the 65% of this portfolio that is mortgage-backed 
securities (MBS) because borrowers generally have the right to 
prepay obligations before the underlying mortgages mature. The 
estimated effects of a 200 basis point increase or decrease in 
interest rates on the fair value and the expected remaining 
maturity of the MBS available-for-sale portfolio are shown in 
Table 6.

The weighted-average expected remaining maturity of debt 

securities held-to-maturity (HTM) was 4.4 years at June 30, 
2020. HTM debt securities are measured at amortized cost and, 
therefore, changes in the fair value of our held-to-maturity MBS 
resulting from changes in interest rates are not recognized in 
earnings. See Note 5 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity 
Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report for a 
summary of debt securities by security type. 

Loan Portfolios 
Table 7 provides a summary of total outstanding loans by 
portfolio segment. Total loans decreased $27.1 billion from 
December 31, 2019, predominantly due to a decrease in 
consumer loans. 

Commercial loans decreased $2.5 billion from December 31, 

2019, driven by paydowns of commercial and industrial loans 

 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
following increased loan draws in first quarter 2020, partially 
offset by growth in commercial real estate loans driven by new 
originations and construction loan fundings. 

Consumer loans decreased $24.6 billion from December 31, 

2019, due to paydowns exceeding originations. Also, in second 
quarter 2020, we designated $10.4 billion of real estate 1-4 
family first lien mortgage loans as MLHFS.

our 2019 Form 10-K for information regarding contractual loan 
maturities and the distribution of loans to changes in interest 
rates. 

Deposits 
Deposits were $1.4 trillion at June 30, 2020, up $88.1 billion from 
December 31, 2019, reflecting strong growth across our deposit 
gathering businesses driven by impacts from the COVID-19 
pandemic including customers’ preferences for liquidity, loan 
payment deferrals, tax payment deferrals, stimulus checks, and 
lower consumer spending. The increase in deposits was partially 
offset by actions taken to manage to the asset cap resulting in 

declines in other time deposits driven by lower brokered 
certificates of deposit (CDs) and declines in deposits in non-U.S. 
offices. 

Table 8 provides additional information regarding deposits.

See Note 16 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report for additional information on fair value 
measurements and a description of the Level 1, 2 and 3 fair value 
hierarchy. 

Equity 
Total equity was $180.1 billion at June 30, 2020, compared with 
$188.0 billion at December 31, 2019. The decrease was driven by 
common stock repurchases of $3.4 billion (substantially all of 
which occurred in first quarter 2020), preferred stock 
redemptions of $2.5 billion, dividends of $4.8 billion, and a net 
loss of $1.8 billion, partially offset by the issuance of common and 
preferred stock of $4.0 billion. 

Balance Sheet Analysis (continued) 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
We use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments 
to certain financial instruments and to determine fair value 
disclosures. See the “Critical Accounting Policies” section in our 
2019 Form 10-K and Note 16 (Fair Values of Assets and 
Liabilities) to Financial Statements in this Report for a description 
of our critical accounting policy related to fair value of financial 
instruments and a discussion of our fair value measurement 
techniques. 

Table 9 presents the summary of the fair value of financial 
instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, and the 
amounts measured using significant Level 3 inputs (before 
derivative netting adjustments). The fair value of the remaining 
assets and liabilities were measured using valuation 
methodologies involving market-based or market-derived 
information (collectively Level 1 and 2 measurements).

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

In the ordinary course of business, we engage in financial 
transactions that are not recorded on the balance sheet, or may 
be recorded on the balance sheet in amounts that are different 
from the full contract or notional amount of the transaction. Our 
off-balance sheet arrangements include commitments to lend 
and purchase debt and equity securities, transactions with 
unconsolidated entities, guarantees, derivatives, and other 
commitments. These transactions are designed to (1) meet the 
financial needs of customers, (2) manage our credit, market or 
liquidity risks, and/or (3) diversify our funding sources. For 
additional information on our contractual obligations that may 
require future cash payments, see the “Off-Balance Sheet 
Arrangements – Contractual Cash Obligations” section in our 
2019 Form 10-K. 

Commitments to Lend 
We enter into commitments to lend to customers, which are 
usually at a stated interest rate, if funded, and for specific 
purposes and time periods. When we enter into commitments, we 
are exposed to credit risk. The maximum credit risk for these 
commitments will generally be lower than the contractual 
amount because a significant portion of these commitments are 
not funded. For more information, see Note 6 (Loans and Related 
Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

Commitments to Purchase Debt and Equity Securities 
We enter into commitments to purchase securities under resale 
agreements. We also may enter into commitments to purchase 
debt and equity securities to provide capital for customers’ 
funding, liquidity or other future needs. For more information, see 
Note 13 (Guarantees, Pledged Assets and Collateral, and Other 
Commitments) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Transactions with Unconsolidated Entities 
In the normal course of business, we enter into various types of 
on- and off-balance sheet transactions with special purpose 
entities (SPEs), which are corporations, trusts, limited liability 
companies or partnerships that are established for a limited 
purpose. Generally, SPEs are formed in connection with 
securitization transactions and are considered variable interest 
entities (VIEs). For more information, see Note 10 
(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Guarantees and Other Arrangements 
Guarantees are contracts that contingently require us to make 
payments to a guaranteed party based on an event or a change in 
an underlying asset, liability, rate or index. Guarantees are 
generally in the form of standby letters of credit, direct pay 
letters of credit, written options, recourse obligations, exchange 
and clearing house guarantees, indemnifications, and other types 
of similar arrangements. For more information, see Note 13 
(Guarantees, Pledged Assets and Collateral, and Other 
Commitments) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Derivatives 
We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including 
interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to 
assist customers with their risk management objectives. 
Derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, and 
volume can be measured in terms of the notional amount, which 
is generally not exchanged, but is used only as the basis on which 
interest and other payments are determined. The notional 
amount is not recorded on the balance sheet and is not, when 
viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure of the risk profile of the 
instruments. For more information, see Note 15 (Derivatives) to 
Financial Statements in this Report.

Risk Management 

Wells Fargo manages a variety of risks that can significantly affect 
our financial performance and our ability to meet the 
expectations of our customers, shareholders, regulators and 
other stakeholders. For more information about how we manage 
risk, see the “Risk Management” section in our 2019 Form 10-K. 
The discussion that follows supplements our discussion of the 
management of certain risks contained in the “Risk 
Management” section in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Credit Risk Management 
We define credit risk as the risk of loss associated with a borrower 
or counterparty default (failure to meet obligations in accordance 
with agreed upon terms). Credit risk exists with many of our 
assets and exposures such as debt security holdings, certain 
derivatives, and loans. 

The Board’s Credit Committee has primary oversight 
responsibility for credit risk. At the management level, Credit 
Risk, which is part of the Company’s Independent Risk 
Management (IRM) organization, has primary oversight 
responsibility for credit risk. Credit Risk reports to the Chief Risk 
Officer (CRO) and also provides periodic reports related to credit 
risk to the Board’s Credit Committee. 

Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act 
On March 25, 2020, the U.S. Senate approved the Coronavirus 
Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act), a bill 
designed to provide a wide range of economic relief to consumers 
and businesses in the U.S. 

PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM  The CARES Act created 
funding for the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) loan 
program providing forgiveness of up to the full principal amount 
of qualifying loans guaranteed under a new program called the 
Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The intent of the PPP is to 
provide loans to small businesses in order to keep their 
employees on the payroll and make certain other eligible 
payments. Loans granted under the PPP are guaranteed by the 
SBA and are fully forgivable if used for qualifying expenses such 
as payroll, mortgage interest, rent and utilities. If the loans are 
not forgiven, they must be repaid over a term not to exceed 
five years. Under the PPP, through June 30, 2020, we funded 
$10.1 billion in loans to more than 179,000 borrowers. As of 
June 30, 2020, $9.8 billion of principal remained outstanding on 
these PPP loans. We deferred $397 million of SBA processing fees 
that will be recognized as interest income over the term of the 
loans. We have committed to donating the gross processing fees 
received from funding PPP loans to non-profit organizations that 
support small businesses as the fees are recognized in earnings. 
We did not donate any processing fees during second quarter 
2020. 

PPP LIQUIDITY FACILITY  The FRB established the Paycheck 
Protection Program Liquidity Facility which is intended to provide 
liquidity to financial institutions participating in PPP lending. 
Under this program, we act as a correspondent between the 
Federal Reserve Banks and community development financial 
institutions (CDFIs) to facilitate cash flows between the two 
entities. We do not receive any fees for our participation in this 
program. 

SBA SIX MONTH PAYMENT ASSISTANCE  Under the CARES Act, the 
SBA will make principal and interest payments on behalf of 

24 

certain borrowers for six months. As of June 30, 2020, over 
20,000 of our lending customers were eligible for SBA payment 
assistance, and we had received $193 million in payments from 
the SBA. 

MAIN STREET LENDING PROGRAM  The Federal Reserve Board 
(FRB) established the Main Street Lending Program to provide 
additional financial support for small and medium sized 
businesses. Under the terms of the program, eligible lenders will 
perform underwriting and originate loans to eligible borrowers 
and subsequently sell 95% of the loan to a special purpose vehicle 
established by the FRB. We have registered as an eligible lender 
under the program and anticipate that we will begin funding 
customer loans in third quarter 2020. 

Loan Portfolios 
The following discussion focuses on our loan portfolios, which 
represent the largest component of assets on our balance sheet 
for which we have credit risk. Table 10 presents our total loans 
outstanding by portfolio segment and class of financing 
receivable.

We manage our credit risk by establishing what we believe 

are sound credit policies for underwriting new business, while 
monitoring and reviewing the performance of our existing loan 
portfolios. We employ various credit risk management and 
monitoring activities to mitigate risks associated with multiple 
risk factors affecting loans we hold, could acquire or originate 
including: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
•  Merger and acquisition activities 
• 

Loan concentrations and related credit quality 
Counterparty credit risk 
Economic and market conditions 
Legislative or regulatory mandates 
Changes in interest rates 

Reputation risk 

Our credit risk management oversight process is governed 

centrally, but provides for decentralized management and 
accountability by our lines of business. Our overall credit process 

 
  
 
includes comprehensive credit policies, disciplined credit 
underwriting, frequent and detailed risk measurement and 
modeling, extensive credit training programs, and a continual loan 
review and audit process. 

A key to our credit risk management is adherence to a well-
controlled underwriting process, which we believe is appropriate 
for the needs of our customers as well as investors who purchase 
the loans or securities collateralized by the loans. 

Credit Quality Overview  Credit quality in second quarter 2020 
continued to decline due to the economic impact that the 
COVID-19 pandemic had on our customer base. Second quarter 
2020 results reflected: 
•  Nonaccrual loans were $7.6 billion at June 30, 2020, up from 

$5.3 billion at December 31, 2019, predominantly due to a 
$2.0 billion increase in commercial nonaccrual loans driven by 
increases in the commercial and industrial and commercial 
real estate portfolios as the economic impact of the 
COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact our customer base. 
Commercial nonaccrual loans increased to $4.3 billion at 
June 30, 2020, compared with $2.3 billion at December 31, 
2019, and consumer nonaccrual loans increased to 
$3.3 billion at June 30, 2020, compared with $3.1 billion at 
December 31, 2019. Nonaccrual loans represented 0.81% of 
total loans at June 30, 2020, compared with 0.56% at 
December 31, 2019. 

•  Net loan charge-offs (annualized) as a percentage of our 
average commercial and consumer loan portfolios were 
0.44% and 0.48% in the second quarter and 0.35% and 0.51% 
in the first half of 2020, respectively, compared with 0.13% 
and 0.45% in the second quarter and 0.12% and 0.48% in the 
first half of 2019. 
Loans that are not government insured/guaranteed and 
90 days or more past due and still accruing were $145 million 
and $672 million in our commercial and consumer portfolios, 
respectively, at June 30, 2020, compared with $78 million 
and $855 million at December 31, 2019. 

• 

•  Our provision for credit losses for loans was $9.6 billion and 
$13.4 billion in the second quarter and first half of 2020, 
respectively, compared with $503 million and $1.3 billion for 
the same periods a year ago. The increase in provision for 
credit losses for loans in the second quarter and first half of 
2020, compared with the same periods a year ago, reflected 
an increase in the allowance for credit losses for loans driven 
by current and forecasted economic conditions due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, and higher net loan charge-offs driven 
by higher losses in our commercial real estate portfolio and 
continued weakness in our oil and gas portfolio. 
The allowance for credit losses for loans totaled $20.4 billion, 
or 2.19% of total loans, at June 30, 2020, up from 
$10.5 billion, or 1.09%, at December 31, 2019. 

• 

Additional information on our loan portfolios and our credit 

quality trends follows. 

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURING RELIEF  The CARES Act provides 
banks optional, temporary relief from accounting for certain loan 
modifications as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). The 
modifications must be related to the adverse effects of 
COVID-19, and certain other criteria are required to be met in 
order to apply the relief. In first quarter 2020, we elected to apply 
the TDR relief provided by the CARES Act, which expires no later 
than December 31, 2020. 

On April 7, 2020, federal banking regulators issued the 
Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for 

Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the 
Coronavirus (Revised) (the Interagency Statement). The 
Interagency Statement provides additional TDR relief as it 
clarifies that it is not necessary to consider the impact of 
COVID-19 on the financial condition of a borrower in connection 
with short-term (e.g., six months or less) loan modifications 
related to COVID-19 provided the borrower is current at the date 
the modification program is implemented. For additional 
information regarding the TDR relief provided by the CARES Act 
and the clarifying TDR accounting guidance from the Interagency 
Statement, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting 
Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

The TDR relief provided under the CARES Act, as well as from 

the Interagency Statement, does not change our processes for 
monitoring the credit quality of our loan portfolios or for 
updating our measurement of the allowance for credit losses for 
loans based on expected losses. 

Additionally, our election to apply the TDR relief provided by 

the CARES Act and the Interagency Statement impacts our 
regulatory capital ratios as these loan modifications related to 
COVID-19 are not adjusted to a higher risk-weighting normally 
required with TDR classification. 

COVID-Related Lending Accommodations 
During second quarter 2020, we continued to provide 
accommodations to our customers in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic, including fee reversals for consumer and small business 
banking customers, and payment deferrals, fee waivers, covenant 
waivers, and other expanded assistance for mortgage, credit card, 
automobile, small business, personal and commercial lending 
customers. Foreclosure, collection and credit bureau reporting 
activities have also been suspended. Additionally, we deferred 
rental payments on certain leased assets for which we are the 
lessor. Customer payment deferral activities instituted in 
response to the COVID-19 pandemic could delay the recognition 
of net charge-offs, delinquencies, and nonaccrual status for those 
customers who would have otherwise moved into past due or 
nonaccrual status. 

Table 11 and Table 11a summarize the unpaid principal 

balance (UPB) of commercial and consumer loans at June 30, 
2020, that received accommodations under loan modification 
programs established to assist customers with the economic 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (COVID-related 
modifications), and exclude accommodations made for customers 
with loans that we service for others. COVID-related 
modifications primarily included payment deferrals of principal, 
interest or both as well as interest and fee waivers. As of June 30, 
2020, the unpaid principal balance of loans with COVID-related 
modifications represented 7% and 13% of our total commercial 
and consumer loan portfolios, respectively, and included 
customers that continued to make payments after receiving a 
modification and those that were no longer in a deferral period. 
If the COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause economic 

uncertainty, customers may request additional or extended 
accommodations. During second quarter 2020, we provided 
certain extensions of prior modifications for up to an additional 
90 days. As of June 30, 2020, the unpaid principal balance of 
commercial and consumer loans that received extensions of prior 
modifications was $9.7 billion and $876 million, respectively. 
Of the loans that received COVID-related modifications, 

$38 billion and $50 billion of unpaid principal balance of 
commercial and consumer loans, respectively, were not classified 
as TDRs as of June 30, 2020, of which 5% for both commercial 
and consumer loans qualified for TDR designation relief under the 
CARES Act or Interagency Statement. Additionally, the tables 

25 

  
 
 
 
 
Risk Management - Credit Risk Management (continued) 

include $241 million and $3 billion of unpaid principal balance of 
commercial and consumer loans, respectively, that were already 
classified as TDRs when the COVID-related modification was 
granted. 

For information related to loans that are classified as TDRs, 
see Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial 
Statements this Report.

Significant Loan Portfolio Reviews  Measuring and monitoring 
our credit risk is an ongoing process that tracks delinquencies, 
collateral values, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores, economic 
trends by geographic areas, loan-level risk grading for certain 
portfolios (typically commercial) and other indications of credit 
risk. Our credit risk monitoring process is designed to enable early 
identification of developing risk and to support our determination 
of an appropriate allowance for credit losses. The following 
discussion provides additional characteristics and analysis of our 
significant loan portfolios. See Note 6 (Loans and Related 
Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this 
Report for more analysis and credit metric information for each 
of the following portfolios. 

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASE FINANCING  For 
purposes of portfolio risk management, we aggregate 
commercial and industrial loans and lease financing according to 
market segmentation and standard industry codes. We generally 
subject commercial and industrial loans and lease financing to 
individual risk assessment using our internal borrower and 
collateral quality ratings. Our ratings are aligned to federal 
banking regulators’ definitions of pass and criticized categories 
with the criticized category including special mention, 
substandard, doubtful, and loss categories. 

The commercial and industrial loans and lease financing 
portfolio totaled $367.5 billion, or 39% of total loans, at June 30, 
2020. The net charge-off rate (annualized) of average loans for 
this portfolio was 0.54% and 0.45% in the second quarter and first 

26 

  
  
  
  
half of 2020, respectively, compared with 0.18% and 0.17% for 
the same periods a year ago. At June 30, 2020, 0.83% of this 
portfolio was nonaccruing, compared with 0.44% at December 31, 
2019. Nonaccrual loans in this portfolio increased $1.4 billion 
from December 31, 2019, primarily in the oil, gas and pipelines 
category due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Also, $27.8 billion of the commercial and industrial loan and lease 
financing portfolio was internally classified as criticized in 
accordance with regulatory guidance at June 30, 2020, compared 
with $16.6 billion at December 31, 2019, reflecting increases 
primarily in the oil, gas and pipelines, real estate and construction, 
entertainment and recreation, and retail categories due to the 
economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The majority of our commercial and industrial loans and lease 

financing portfolio is secured by short-term assets, such as 
accounts receivable, inventory, and debt securities, as well as 
long-lived assets, such as equipment and other business assets. 
Generally, the collateral securing this portfolio represents a 
secondary source of repayment. 

Table 12 provides our commercial and industrial loans and 

lease financing by industry, and includes non-U.S. loans of 
$68.2 billion and $71.7 billion at June 30, 2020, and 
December 31, 2019, respectively. Significant industry 
concentrations of non-U.S. loans included $32.7 billion and 
$31.2 billion in the financials except banks category, and 
$15.5 billion and $19.9 billion in the banks category, at June 30, 
2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. The oil, gas and 
pipelines category included $1.6 billion of non-U.S. loans at both 
June 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019. The industry categories 
are based on the North American Industry Classification System. 

Loans to financials except banks, our largest industry 
concentration, were $112.1 billion, or 12% of total outstanding 

Table 12:  Commercial and Industrial Loans and Lease Financing by Industry 

loans, at June 30, 2020, compared with $117.3 billion, or 12% of 
total outstanding loans, at December 31, 2019. This industry 
category is comprised of loans to investment firms, financial 
vehicles, and non-bank creditors, including those that invest in 
financial assets backed predominantly by commercial or 
residential real estate or consumer loan assets. We had 
$72.4 billion and $75.2 billion of loans originated by our Asset 
Backed Finance (ABF) lines of business at June 30, 2020, and 
December 31, 2019, respectively. These ABF loans are limited to a 
percentage of the value of the underlying financial assets 
considering underlying credit risk, asset duration, and ongoing 
performance. These ABF loans may also have other features to 
manage credit risk such as cross-collateralization, credit 
enhancements, and contractual re-margining of collateral 
supporting the loans. Loans to financials except banks included 
collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) in loan form of $7.7 billion 
and $7.0 billion at June 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, 
respectively. 

Oil, gas and pipelines loans totaled $12.6 billion, or 1% of 

total outstanding loans, at June 30, 2020, compared with 
$13.6 billion, or 1% of total outstanding loans, at December 31, 
2019. Oil, gas and pipelines loans included $8.9 billion and 
$9.2 billion of senior secured loans outstanding at June 30, 2020 
and December 31, 2019, respectively. Oil, gas and pipelines 
nonaccrual loans increased to $1.4 billion at June 30, 2020, 
compared with $615 million at December 31, 2019, due to new 
downgrades to nonaccrual status in second quarter 2020. 

In addition to the oil, gas and pipelines category, industries 
with escalated credit monitoring include retail, entertainment and 
recreation, transportation services, and commercial real estate.

Risk Management - Credit Risk Management (continued) 

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE (CRE)  We generally subject CRE loans 
to individual risk assessment using our internal borrower and 
collateral quality ratings. Our ratings are aligned to federal 
banking regulators' definitions of pass and criticized categories 
with criticized segmented among special mention, substandard, 
doubtful and loss categories. The CRE portfolio, which included 
$8.2 billion of non-U.S. CRE loans, totaled $145.7 billion, or 16% 
of total loans, at June 30, 2020, and consisted of $124.0 billion of 
mortgage loans and $21.7 billion of construction loans. 

Table 13 summarizes CRE loans by state and property type 

with the related nonaccrual totals at June 30, 2020. The portfolio 
is diversified both geographically and by property type. The 
largest geographic concentrations of CRE loans are in California, 
New York, Florida, and Texas, which combined represented 49% of 
the total CRE portfolio. By property type, the largest 

concentrations are office buildings at 26% and apartments at 19% 
of the portfolio. CRE nonaccrual loans totaled 0.86% of the CRE 
outstanding balance at June 30, 2020, compared with 0.43% at 
December 31, 2019. The increase in CRE nonaccrual loans was 
driven by the hotel/motel, shopping center, and office buildings 
property types and reflected the economic impact of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. At June 30, 2020, we had $9.1 billion of 
criticized CRE mortgage loans, compared with $3.8 billion at 
December 31, 2019, and $1.3 billion of criticized CRE 
construction loans, compared with $187 million at December 31, 
2019. The increase in criticized CRE mortgage and CRE 
construction loans was driven by the hotel/motel, shopping 
center, retail (excluding shopping center), and office building 
property types and reflected the economic impact of the 
COVID-19 pandemic.

NON-U.S LOANS  Our classification of non-U.S. loans is based on 
whether the borrower’s primary address is outside of the United 
States. At June 30, 2020, non-U.S. loans totaled $76.6 billion, 
representing approximately 8% of our total consolidated loans 
outstanding, compared with $80.5 billion, or approximately 8% of 
total consolidated loans outstanding, at December 31, 2019. 
Non-U.S. loans were approximately 4% of our consolidated total 
assets at both June 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019. 

COUNTRY RISK EXPOSURE  Our country risk monitoring process 
incorporates centralized monitoring of economic, political, social, 
legal, and transfer risks in countries where we do or plan to do 
business, along with frequent dialogue with our customers, 
counterparties and regulatory agencies. We establish exposure 
limits for each country through a centralized oversight process 
based on customer needs, and through consideration of the 
relevant and distinct risk of each country. We monitor exposures 
closely and adjust our country limits in response to changing 
conditions. 

We evaluate our individual country risk exposure based on 
our assessment of the borrower’s ability to repay, which gives 
consideration for allowable transfers of risk such as guarantees 
and collateral and may be different from the reporting based on 
the borrower’s primary address. Our largest single country 
exposure outside the U.S. based on our assessment of risk at 
June 30, 2020, was the United Kingdom, which totaled 
$36.3 billion, or approximately 2% of our total assets, and 
included $11.6 billion of sovereign claims. Our United Kingdom 
sovereign claims arise predominantly from deposits we have 
placed with the Bank of England pursuant to regulatory 
requirements in support of our London branch. 

The United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union 

(Brexit) on January 31, 2020, and is currently subject to a 

Table 14:  Select Country Exposures 

transition period during which the terms and conditions of its exit 
are being negotiated. As the United Kingdom exits from the 
European Union, our primary goal is to continue to serve our 
existing clients in the United Kingdom and the European Union as 
well as to continue to meet the needs of our domestic clients as 
they do business in those locations. We have an existing 
authorized bank in Ireland and an asset management entity in 
Luxembourg. Additionally, we established a broker dealer in 
France. We are in the process of leveraging these entities to 
continue to serve clients in the European Union and continue to 
take actions to update our business operations in the United 
Kingdom and European Union, including implementing new 
supplier contracts and staffing arrangements. For additional 
information on risks associated with Brexit, see the “Risk Factors” 
section in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Table 14 provides information regarding our top 
20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.), based on our 
assessment of risk, which gives consideration to the country of 
any guarantors and/or underlying collateral. With respect to 
Table 14: 
• 

Lending exposure includes outstanding loans, unfunded 
credit commitments, and deposits with non-U.S. banks. 
These balances are presented prior to the deduction of 
allowance for credit losses or collateral received under the 
terms of the credit agreements, if any. 
Securities exposure represents debt and equity securities of 
non-U.S. issuers. Long and short positions are netted, and 
net short positions are reflected as negative exposure. 
•  Derivatives and other exposure represents foreign exchange 
contracts, derivative contracts, securities resale agreements, 
and securities lending agreements.

Real estate 1-4 mortgage loans by state are presented in 
Table 16. Our real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans to borrowers 
in California represented 13% of total loans at June 30, 
2020, located predominantly within the larger metropolitan 
areas, with no single California metropolitan area consisting of 
more than 5% of total loans. We monitor changes in real estate 
values and underlying economic or market conditions for all 
geographic areas of our real estate 1-4 family mortgage 
portfolios as part of our credit risk management process. Our 
underwriting and periodic review of loans and lines secured by 
residential real estate collateral includes original appraisals 
adjusted for the change in Home Price Index (HPI) or estimates 
from automated valuation models (AVMs) to support property 
values. Additional information about appraisals and AVMs and our 
policy for their use can be found in Note 6 (Loans and Related 
Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this 
Report and the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – 
Real Estate 1-4 Family Mortgage Loans” section in our 2019

The real estate 1-4 family mortgage loan portfolio includes 

some loans with an interest-only feature as part of the loan terms 
and some with adjustable-rate features. Interest-only loans were 
approximately 3% of total loans at both June 30, 2020, and 
December 31, 2019. We believe we have manageable adjustable-
rate mortgage (ARM) reset risk across our mortgage loan 
portfolios, including ARM loans that have negative amortizing 
features that were acquired in prior business combinations. We do 
not offer option ARM products, nor do we offer variable-rate 
mortgage products with fixed payment amounts, commonly 
referred to within the financial services industry as negative 
amortizing mortgage loans. In connection with our adoption of 
CECL on January 1, 2020, our real estate 1-4 family mortgage 
purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans, which had a carrying value 
of $568 million, were reclassified as purchased credit-
deteriorated (PCD) loans. PCD loans are generally accounted for 
in the same manner as non-PCD loans. For more information on 
PCD loans, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting 
Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

We continue to modify real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans 
to assist homeowners and other borrowers experiencing financial 
difficulties. For more information on our modification programs, 
see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – Real 
Estate 1-4 Family Mortgage Loans” section in our 2019 
Form 10-K. For more information on customer accommodations, 
including loan modifications, in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management 
– COVID-Related Lending Accommodations” section in this 
Report. 

Part of our credit monitoring includes tracking delinquency, 
current FICO scores and loan/combined loan to collateral values 
(LTV/CLTV) on the entire real estate 1-4 family mortgage loan 
portfolio. These credit risk indicators on the mortgage portfolio 
exclude government insured/guaranteed loans. Loans 30 days or 
more delinquent at June 30, 2020, totaled $2.9 billion, or 1% of 
total mortgages, compared with $3.0 billion, or 1%, at 
December 31, 2019. Loans with FICO scores lower than 640 
totaled $6.8 billion, or 2% of total mortgages at June 30, 2020, 
compared with $7.6 billion, or 2%, at December 31, 2019. 
Mortgages with a LTV/CLTV greater than 100% totaled 
$2.3 billion at June 30, 2020, or 1% of total mortgages, compared 
with $2.5 billion, or 1%, at December 31, 2019. Information 
regarding credit quality indicators can be found in Note 6 (Loans 
and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements 
in this Report.

First Lien Mortgage Portfolio  Our total real estate 1-4 family 
first lien mortgage portfolio (first mortgage) decreased 
$15.0 billion and $15.9 billion in the second quarter and first half 
of 2020, respectively. Mortgage loan originations of $16.4 billion 
and $30.7 billion in the second quarter and first half of 2020, 
respectively, were more than offset by paydowns. In addition, in 
second quarter 2020 we designated $10.4 billion of first 
mortgage loans as MLHFS. 

Net loan charge-offs (annualized) as a percentage of average 

first mortgage loans were 0.00% in both the second quarter and 
first half of 2020, compared with a net recovery of 0.04% and 

0.03% for the same periods a year ago. Nonaccrual loans were 
$2.4 billion at June 30, 2020, up $243 million from December 31, 
2019. The increase in nonaccrual loans from December 31, 2019 
was driven by the implementation of CECL, which required PCI 
loans to be classified as nonaccruing based on performance. For 
additional information, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk 
Management – Nonperforming Assets (Nonaccrual Loans and 
Foreclosed Assets)” section in this Report.

In connection with our adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, PCI loans were reclassified as PCD loans and are therefore included with other non-PCD loans in this table. For more information, see 
Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Junior Lien Mortgage Portfolio  The junior lien mortgage 
portfolio consists of residential mortgage lines and loans that are 
subordinate in rights to an existing lien on the same property. It is 
not unusual for these lines and loans to have draw periods, 
interest-only payments, balloon payments, adjustable rates, and 
similar features. Junior lien loan products are mostly amortizing 
payment loans with fixed interest rates and repayment periods 
between five to 30 years. 

We continuously monitor the credit performance of our 

junior lien mortgage portfolio for trends and factors that 
influence the frequency and severity of loss, such as junior lien 
mortgage performance when the first mortgage loan is 
delinquent. Table 18 shows certain delinquency and loss 
information for the junior lien mortgage portfolio and lists the 
top five states by outstanding balance. The decrease in 
outstanding balances since December 31, 2019, predominantly 

reflected loan paydowns. In second quarter 2020, we suspended 
the origination of junior lien mortgages. As of June 30, 2020, 4% 
of the outstanding balance of the junior lien mortgage portfolio 
was associated with loans that had a combined loan to value 
(CLTV) ratio in excess of 100%. Of those junior lien mortgages 
with a CLTV ratio in excess of 100%, 3% were 30 days or more 
past due. CLTV means the ratio of the total loan balance of first 
mortgages and junior lien mortgages (including unused line 
amounts for credit line products) to property collateral value. The 
unsecured portion (the outstanding amount that was in excess of 
the most recent property collateral value) of the outstanding 
balances of these loans totaled 1% of the junior lien mortgage 
portfolio at June 30, 2020. For additional information on 
consumer loans by LTV/CLTV, see Table 6.12 in Note 6 (Loans and 
Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in 
this Report.

Risk Management - Credit Risk Management (continued) 

Our junior lien, as well as first lien, lines of credit portfolios 
generally have draw periods of 10, 15 or 20 years with variable 
interest rate and payment options available during the draw 
period of (1) interest only or (2) 1.5% of outstanding principal 
balance plus accrued interest. As of June 30, 2020, lines of credit 
in a draw period primarily used the interest-only option. During 
the draw period, the borrower has the option of converting all or a 
portion of the line from a variable interest rate to a fixed rate with 
terms including interest-only payments for a fixed period 
between three to seven years or a fully amortizing payment with 
a fixed period between five to 30 years. At the end of the draw 
period, a line of credit generally converts to an amortizing 
payment schedule with repayment terms of up to 30 years based 
on the balance at time of conversion. Certain lines and loans have 
been structured with a balloon payment, which requires full 
repayment of the outstanding balance at the end of the term 
period. The conversion of lines or loans to fully amortizing or 
balloon payoff may result in a significant payment increase, which 
can affect some borrowers’ ability to repay the outstanding 
balance. 

On a monthly basis, we monitor the payment characteristics 
of borrowers in our first and junior lien lines of credit portfolios. In 
June 2020, excluding borrowers with COVID-19 related loan 
modification payment deferrals, approximately 44% of borrowers 
paid only the minimum amount due and approximately 52% paid 
more than the minimum amount due. The rest were either 

delinquent or paid less than the minimum amount due. For the 
borrowers with an interest-only payment feature, approximately 
28% paid only the minimum amount due and approximately 68% 
paid more than the minimum amount due. 

The lines that enter their amortization period may 

experience higher delinquencies and higher loss rates than the 
ones in their draw or term period. We have considered this 
increased inherent risk in our allowance for credit loss estimate. 

In anticipation of our borrowers reaching the end of their 
contractual commitment, we have created a program to inform, 
educate and help these borrowers transition from interest-only to 
fully-amortizing payments or full repayment. We monitor the 
performance of the borrowers moving through the program in an 
effort to refine our ongoing program strategy. 

Table 19 reflects the outstanding balance of our portfolio of 
junior lien mortgages, including lines and loans, and first lien lines 
segregated into scheduled end-of-draw or end-of-term periods 
and products that are currently amortizing, or in balloon 
repayment status. At June 30, 2020, $367 million, or 1%, of lines 
in their draw period were 30 days or more past due, compared 
with $344 million, or 4%, of amortizing lines of credit. Included in 
the amortizing amounts in Table 19 is $61 million of end-of-term 
balloon payments which were past due. The unfunded credit 
commitments for junior and first lien lines totaled $57.7 billion at 
June 30, 2020.

Substantially all lines and loans are scheduled to convert to amortizing loans by the end of 2029, with annual scheduled amounts through 2029 ranging from $1.7 billion to $4.3 billion and averaging 
$2.9 billion per year. 

CREDIT CARDS  Our credit card portfolio totaled $36.0 billion at 
June 30, 2020, which represented 4% of our total outstanding 
loans. The net charge-off rate (annualized) for our credit card 
portfolio was 3.60% for second quarter 2020, compared with 
3.68% for second quarter 2019, and 3.71% for the first half of 
both 2020 and 2019. The decrease in the net charge-off rate in 
second quarter 2020, compared with the same period a year ago, 
was driven by payment deferral activities in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic. 

AUTOMOBILE  Our automobile portfolio totaled $48.8 billion at 
June 30, 2020. The net charge-off rate (annualized) for our 
automobile portfolio was 0.88% for second quarter 2020, 
compared with 0.46% for second quarter 2019, and 0.78% and 
0.64% for the first half of 2020 and 2019, respectively. The 
increase in the net charge-off rate in the second quarter and first 
half of 2020, compared with the same periods in 2019, was driven 
by lower recoveries due to the temporary suspension of 
involuntary repossessions in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic. 

OTHER REVOLVING CREDIT AND INSTALLMENT  Other revolving 
credit and installment loans totaled $32.4 billion at June 30, 
2020, and largely included student and securities-based loans. 
Our private student loan portfolio totaled $10.3 billion at 
June 30, 2020. On July 1, 2020, we announced that only 
customers with an outstanding private student loan balance will 
be eligible for new loans for the upcoming academic year. The net 
charge-off rate (annualized) for other revolving credit and 
installment loans was 1.09% for second quarter 2020, compared 
with 1.56% for second quarter 2019, and 1.35% and 1.52% for the 
first half of 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in the net 
charge-off rate in the second quarter and first half of 2020, 
compared with the same periods a year ago, was driven by 
payment deferral activities in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic.

NONPERFORMING ASSETS (NONACCRUAL LOANS AND FORECLOSED 
ASSETS)  Table 20 summarizes nonperforming assets (NPAs) for 
each of the last four quarters. Total NPAs increased $1.4 billion 
from first quarter 2020 to $7.8 billion. Nonaccrual loans of 
$7.6 billion increased $1.4 billion from first quarter 2020. The 
increase in nonaccrual loans was driven by an increase in 
commercial nonaccrual loans predominantly due to an increase in 
oil and gas and real estate mortgage nonaccrual loans as the 
economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact 
our customer base. Customer payment deferral activities 
instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may delay 
recognition of delinquencies for customers who otherwise would 
have moved into nonaccrual status. Prior to January 1, 2020, PCI 
loans were excluded from nonaccrual loans because they 
continued to earn interest income from accretable yield, 
independent of performance in accordance with their contractual 
terms. However, as a result of our adoption of CECL on January 1, 

2020, $275 million of real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans were 
reclassified from PCI to PCD loans, and as a result, were also 
classified as nonaccrual loans given their contractual delinquency. 
For more information on PCD loans, see Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

For information about when we generally place loans on 

nonaccrual status, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2019 Form 
10-K. For more information on customer accommodations, 
including loan modifications, in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management 
– COVID-Related Lending Accommodations” section in this 
Report. 

Foreclosed assets of $195 million were down $57 million 

from first quarter 2020.

Real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA are not placed on nonaccrual status because they are insured or guaranteed. 
Consistent with regulatory reporting requirements, foreclosed real estate resulting from government insured/guaranteed loans are classified as nonperforming. Both principal and interest related to 
these foreclosed real estate assets are collectible because the loans were predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA. Receivables related to the foreclosure of certain government 
guaranteed residential real estate mortgage loans are excluded from this table and included in Accounts Receivable in Other Assets. For more information on foreclosed assets, see Note 1 (Summary 
of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2019 Form 10-K.

In connection with our adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, we classified $275 million of PCD loans as nonaccruing based on performance. 

• 

• 

• 

80% of commercial nonaccrual loans were current on interest 
and 75% of commercial nonaccrual loans were current on 
both principal and interest, but were on nonaccrual status 
because the full or timely collection of interest or principal 
had become uncertain. 
of the $1.3 billion of consumer loans in bankruptcy or 
discharged in bankruptcy, and classified as nonaccrual, 
$866 million were current. 
the remaining risk of loss of all nonaccrual loans has been 
considered and we believe is adequately covered by the 
allowance for loan losses. 

We continue to work with our customers experiencing 
financial difficulty to determine if they can qualify for a loan 
modification so that they can stay in their homes. Under our 
proprietary modification programs, customers may be required to 
provide updated documentation, and some programs require 
completion of payment during trial periods to demonstrate 
sustained performance before the loan can be removed from 
nonaccrual status. 

Typically, changes to nonaccrual loans period-over-period 
represent inflows for loans that are placed on nonaccrual status in 
accordance with our policy, offset by reductions for loans that are 
paid down, charged off, sold, foreclosed, or are no longer classified 
as nonaccrual as a result of continued performance and an 
improvement in the borrower’s financial condition and loan 
repayment capabilities. 

While nonaccrual loans are not free of loss content, we believe 
exposure to loss is significantly mitigated by the following factors 
at June 30, 2020: 
• 

90% of total commercial nonaccrual loans and 99% of total 
consumer nonaccrual loans are secured. Of the consumer 
nonaccrual loans, 95% are secured by real estate and 89% 
have a combined LTV (CLTV) ratio of 80% or less. 
losses of $708 million and $990 million have already been 
recognized on 16% of commercial nonaccrual loans and 34% 
of consumer nonaccrual loans, respectively, in accordance 
with our charge-off policies. Once we write down loans to the 
net realizable value (fair value of collateral less estimated 
costs to sell), we re-evaluate each loan regularly and record 
additional write-downs if needed.

Foreclosed government insured/guaranteed loans are temporarily transferred to and held by us as servicer, until reimbursement is received from FHA or VA. 
Includes loans moved into foreclosed assets from nonaccrual status and repossessed automobiles. 

Foreclosed assets at June 30, 2020, included $138 million of 
foreclosed residential real estate, of which 22% is predominantly 
FHA insured or VA guaranteed and expected to have minimal or 
no loss content. The remaining amount of foreclosed assets has 
been written down to estimated net realizable value. Of the 
$195 million in foreclosed assets at June 30, 2020, 64% have 
been in the foreclosed assets portfolio one year or less. 

As part of our actions to support customers during the 
COVID-19 pandemic, we have suspended certain mortgage 
foreclosure activities, which may affect the amount of our 
foreclosed assets for the remainder of the year. For additional 
information on loans in process of foreclosure, see Note 6 (Loans 
and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements 
in this Report.

For more information on our nonaccrual policies when a 
restructuring is involved, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk 
Management – Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs)” section in 
our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Table 24 provides an analysis of the changes in TDRs. Loans 
modified more than once are reported as TDR inflows only in the 
period they are first modified. Other than resolutions such as 
foreclosures, sales and transfers to held for sale, we may remove 
loans held for investment from TDR classification, but only if they 
have been refinanced or restructured at market terms and qualify 
as new loans. 

Table 23 provides information regarding the recorded 
investment of loans modified in TDRs. The allowance for loan 
losses for TDRs was $607 million and $1.0 billion at June 30, 
2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. See Note 6 (Loans 
and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements 
in this Report for additional information regarding TDRs. In those 
situations where principal is forgiven, the entire amount of such 
forgiveness is immediately charged off. When we delay the timing 
on the repayment of a portion of principal (principal forbearance), 
we charge off the amount of forbearance if that amount is not 
considered fully collectible. As part of our actions to support 
customers during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have provided 
borrowers relief in the form of loan modifications. Under the 
CARES Act and the Interagency Statement, loan modifications 
related to the COVID-19 pandemic will not be classified as TDRs 
if they meet certain eligibility criteria. For more information on 
the CARES Act and the Interagency Statement, see the “Risk 
Management – Credit Risk Management – Credit Quality 
Overview – Troubled Debt Restructuring Relief” section in this 
Report.

Net change in trial modifications includes: inflows of new TDRs entering the trial payment period, net of outflows for modifications that either (i) successfully perform and enter into a permanent 
modification, or (ii) did not successfully perform according to the terms of the trial period plan and are subsequently charged-off, foreclosed upon or otherwise resolved.

Risk Management - Credit Risk Management (continued) 

LOANS 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE AND STILL ACCRUING  Loans 90 
days or more past due are still accruing if they are (1) well-
secured and in the process of collection or (2) real estate 1-4 
family mortgage loans or consumer loans exempt under 
regulatory rules from being classified as nonaccrual until later 
delinquency, usually 120 days past due. Prior to January 1, 2020, 
PCI loans were excluded from loans 90 days or more past due and 
still accruing because they continued to earn interest income 
from accretable yield, independent of performance in accordance 
with their contractual terms. In connection with our adoption of 
CECL, PCI loans were reclassified as PCD loans and classified as 
accruing or nonaccruing based on performance. 

Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing, excluding 

insured/guaranteed loans, at June 30, 2020, were down 
$116 million, or 12%, from December 31, 2019 due to payoffs 
and lower delinquencies in consumer loans as payment deferral 
activities instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic

increase in commercial loans 90 days or more past due and still 
accruing driven by credit deterioration due to the economic 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing whose 
repayments are predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed 
by the VA for mortgages were $8.9 billion at June 30, 2020, up 
from $6.4 billion at December 31, 2019, due to the economic 
slowdown related to the COVID-19 pandemic affecting our 
customers.

(1)  Quarterly net loan charge-offs (recoveries) as a percentage of average respective loans are annualized. 

Table 26 presents net loan charge-offs for second quarter 2020 
and the previous four quarters. Net loan charge-offs in second 
quarter 2020 were $1.1 billion (0.46% of average total loans 
outstanding), compared with $653 million (0.28%) in second 
quarter 2019. 

The increase in commercial net loan charge-offs in second 

quarter 2020 from the prior quarter was driven by higher 
commercial and industrial losses primarily in our oil and gas 
portfolio, as well as higher commercial real estate mortgage 
losses. The decrease in consumer net loan charge-offs in second 
quarter 2020 from the prior quarter was driven by lower losses in 
credit card, and other revolving credit and installment loans 
driven by payment deferral activities in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic. 

The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact the credit 
quality of our loan portfolio. Although the potential impacts were 
considered in our allowance for credit losses for loans, payment 
deferral activities instituted in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic could delay the recognition of net loan charge-offs. For 
more information on customer accommodations in response to 
the COVID-19 pandemic, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk 
Management – COVID-Related Lending Accommodations” 
section in this Report. 

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  We maintain an allowance for 
credit losses for loans, which is management’s estimate of the 
expected credit losses in the loan portfolio and unfunded credit 
commitments, at the balance sheet date, excluding loans and 
unfunded credit commitments carried at fair value or held for 
sale. Additionally, we maintain an allowance for credit losses for 
debt securities classified as either available-for-sale or held-to-
maturity, other financial assets measured at amortized cost, net 
investments in leases, and other off-balance sheet credit 
exposures. 

We apply a disciplined process and methodology to establish 

our allowance for credit losses each quarter. The process for 
establishing the allowance for credit losses for loans takes into 
consideration many factors, including historical and forecasted 
loss trends, loan-level credit quality ratings and loan grade-
specific characteristics. The process involves subjective and 
complex judgments. In addition, we review a variety of credit 
metrics and trends. These credit metrics and trends, however, do 
not solely determine the amount of the allowance as we use 
several analytical tools. For additional information on our 
allowance for credit losses, see the “Critical Accounting Policies – 
Allowance for Credit Losses” section and Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. For additional information on our allowance for credit 
losses for loans, see Note 6 (Loans and Related Allowance for 
Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report, and for 
additional information on our allowance for credit losses for debt 
securities, see the “Balance Sheet Analysis – Available-For-Sale 
and Held-To-Maturity Debt Securities” section and Note 5 
(Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Table 27 presents the allocation of the allowance for credit 

losses for loans by loan segment and class for the most recent 
quarter end and last four year ends. The detail of the changes in 
the allowance for credit losses for loans by portfolio segment 
(including charge-offs and recoveries by loan class) is included in

Disclosure is not comparative due to our adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020. For more information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
Total net loan charge-offs are annualized for the quarter ended June 30, 2020. 

The ratios for the allowance for loan losses and the allowance 

for credit losses for loans presented in Table 27 may fluctuate 
from period to period due to such factors as the mix of loan types 
in the portfolio, borrower credit strength, and the value and 
marketability of collateral. 

The allowance for credit losses for loans increased 
$10.0 billion, or 95%, from December 31, 2019, driven by a 
$11.4 billion increase in the allowance for credit losses for loans in 
the first half of 2020, partially offset by a $1.3 billion decrease as 
a result of adopting CECL. The increase in the allowance for credit 
losses for loans reflected current and forecasted economic 
conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Total provision for 
credit losses for loans was $9.6 billion in second quarter 2020, 
compared with $503 million in second quarter 2019. The increase 
in the provision for credit losses for loans in second quarter 2020, 
compared with the same period a year ago, reflected an increase 
in the allowance for credit losses for loans due to the economic 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

We consider multiple economic scenarios to develop our 

estimate of the allowance for credit losses for loans. The 
scenarios include a base case considered to be the most likely 
economic forecast, along with an optimistic (upside) and a 

pessimistic (downside) economic forecast. Our estimate of the 
allowance for credit losses for loans at June 30, 2020, was based 
on a weighting of the base case and downside economic scenarios 
of 80% and 20%, respectively, with no weighting applied to the 
upside scenario. The base case economic forecast assumed near-
term economic stress recovering into late 2021. The downside 
scenario assumed more sustained adverse economic impacts 
resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic compared with the base 
case. The downside scenario assumed U.S. real GDP increasing 
slowly and not fully recovering during the remainder of 2020 and 
2021, and a sustained elevation in the U.S. unemployment rate 
until mid-2022. We considered expectations for the impact of 
government economic stimulus programs in effect on June 30, 
2020;  however, we did not consider the impact of future 
government economic stimulus programs. In addition, we 
considered expectations for the impact of customer 
accommodation activity, as well as the estimated impact on 
certain industries that we consider to be directly and most 
adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

In addition to quantitative estimates, we consider qualitative 

factors that represent risks inherent in our processes and 
assumptions such as economic environmental factors, modeling 

40 

  
 
 
assumptions and performance, and other subjective factors, 
including industry trends and emerging risk assessments. At 
June 30, 2020, the qualitative portion of our allowance for credit 
losses for loans included adjustments for model performance 
relative to management's loss expectations, including specific 
incremental risks from the oil and gas, commercial real estate, 
and home lending portfolios due to the continued economic 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The forecasted key economic variables inherent in our 
estimate of the allowance for credit losses for loans at June 30, 
2020, are presented in Table 28.

Future amounts of the allowance for credit losses for loans 

will be based on a variety of factors, including loan balance 
changes, portfolio credit quality and mix changes, and changes in 
general economic conditions and expectations (including for 
unemployment and GDP), among other factors. Based on 
economic conditions at the end of second quarter 2020, it was 
difficult to estimate the length and severity of the economic 
downturn that may result from the COVID-19 pandemic and the 
impact of other factors that may influence the level of eventual 
losses and corresponding requirements for future amounts of the 
allowance for credit losses, including the impact of economic 
stimulus programs and customer accommodation activity. The 
COVID-19 pandemic could continue to result in the recognition of 
credit losses in our loan portfolios and increases in our allowance 
for credit losses, particularly if the impact on the economy 
worsens. 

We believe the allowance for credit losses for loans of 

$20.4 billion at June 30, 2020, was appropriate to cover expected 
credit losses, including unfunded credit commitments, at that 
date. The entire allowance is available to absorb expected credit 
losses from the total loan portfolio. The allowance for credit 
losses for loans is subject to change and reflects existing factors 
as of the date of determination, including economic or market 
conditions and ongoing internal and external examination 
processes. Due to the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses 
for loans to changes in the economic and business environment, it 
is possible that we will incur incremental credit losses not 
anticipated as of the balance sheet date. 

LIABILITY FOR MORTGAGE LOAN REPURCHASE LOSSES  For 
information on our repurchase liability, see the “Risk 
Management – Credit Risk Management – Liability For Mortgage 
Loan Repurchase Losses” section in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

RISKS RELATING TO SERVICING ACTIVITIES  In addition to servicing 
loans in our portfolio, we act as servicer and/or master servicer of 
residential mortgage loans included in GSE-guaranteed mortgage 
securitizations, GNMA-guaranteed mortgage securitizations of 
FHA-insured/VA-guaranteed mortgages and private label 

mortgage securitizations, as well as for unsecuritized loans owned 
by institutional investors. In connection with our servicing 
activities, we could become subject to consent orders and 
settlement agreements with federal and state regulators for 
alleged servicing issues and practices. In general, these can 
require us to provide customers with loan modification relief, 
refinancing relief, and foreclosure prevention and assistance, as 
well as can impose certain monetary penalties on us. 

As a servicer, we are required to advance certain delinquent 

payments of principal and interest on the mortgage loans we 
service. The amount and timing of reimbursement of these 
advances vary by investor and the applicable servicing 
agreements in place. Due to an increase in customer requests for 
payment deferrals as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
amount of principal and interest advances we were required to 
make as a servicer increased in second quarter 2020. The amount 
of these advances may continue to increase if additional payment 
deferrals are provided. Payment deferrals also delay the collection 
of contractually specified servicing fees, resulting in lower net 
servicing income. 

In accordance with applicable servicing guidelines, 

delinquency status continues to advance for loans with COVID-
related payment deferrals, which has resulted in an increase in 
delinquent loans serviced for others and a corresponding increase 
in loans eligible for repurchase from GNMA loan securitization 
pools. Our option to repurchase loans from GNMA loan 
securitization pools becomes exercisable when three scheduled 
loan payments remain unpaid by the borrower. We generally 
repurchase these loans for cash and as a result, our total 
consolidated assets do not change. In July 2020, we repurchased 
$14.1 billion of these delinquent loans and we expect to 
repurchase $5.6 billion of these delinquent loans in August 2020. 
Loans that regain current status or are otherwise modified in 
accordance with applicable servicing guidelines may be included in 
future GNMA loan securitization pools. However, in accordance 
with guidance issued by GNMA in June 2020, repurchased loans 
with COVID-related payment deferrals are ineligible for inclusion 
in future GNMA loan securitization pools until the borrower has 
timely made six consecutive payments. This requirement may 
delay our ability to resell loans into the securitization market. 
For additional information about the risks related to our 
servicing activities, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk 
Management – Risks Relating to Servicing Activities” section in 
our 2019 Form 10-K. For additional information on mortgage 
banking activities, see Note 11 (Mortgage Banking Activities) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Asset/Liability Management 
Asset/liability management involves evaluating, monitoring and 
managing interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity and funding. 
Primary oversight of interest rate risk and market risk resides 
with the Finance Committee of our Board, which oversees the 
administration and effectiveness of financial risk management 
policies and processes used to assess and manage these risks. 
Primary oversight of liquidity and funding resides with the Risk 
Committee of the Board. At the management level we utilize a 
Corporate Asset/Liability Committee (Corporate ALCO), which 
consists of management from finance, risk and business groups, 
to oversee these risks and provide periodic reports to the Board’s 
Finance Committee and Risk Committee as appropriate. As 
discussed in more detail for market risk activities below, we 
employ separate management level oversight specific to market 
risk.

Asset/Liability Management (continued) 

INTEREST RATE RISK  Interest rate risk, which potentially can have 
a significant earnings impact, is an integral part of being a 
financial intermediary. We are subject to interest rate risk 
because: 
• 

assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times 
(for example, if assets reprice faster than liabilities and 
interest rates are generally rising, earnings will initially 
increase); 
assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by 
different amounts (for example, when the general level of 
interest rates is rising, we may increase rates paid on 
checking and savings deposit accounts by an amount that is 
less than the general rise in market interest rates); 
short-term and long-term market interest rates may change 
by different amounts (for example, the shape of the yield 
curve may affect new loan yields and funding costs 
differently); 
the remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may 
shorten or lengthen as interest rates change (for example, if 
long-term mortgage interest rates increase sharply, MBS 
held in the debt securities portfolio may pay down slower 
than anticipated, which could impact portfolio income); or 
interest rates may also have a direct or indirect effect on loan 
demand, collateral values, credit losses, mortgage origination 
volume, the fair value of MSRs and other financial 
instruments, the value of the pension liability and other 
items affecting earnings. 

• 

• 

• 

• 

We assess interest rate risk by comparing outcomes under 

various net interest income simulations using many interest rate 
scenarios that differ in the direction of interest rate changes, the 
degree of change over time, the speed of change and the 
projected shape of the yield curve. These simulations require 
assumptions regarding drivers of earnings and balance sheet 
composition such as loan originations, prepayment speeds on 
loans and debt securities, deposit flows and mix, as well as pricing 
strategies. 

Currently, our profile is such that we project net interest 
income will benefit from higher interest rates as our assets would 
reprice faster and to a greater degree than our liabilities, while in 
the case of lower interest rates, our assets would reprice 
downward and to a greater degree than our liabilities. 

Our most recent simulations estimate net interest income 
sensitivity over the next two years under a range of both lower 
and higher interest rates. Measured impacts from standardized 
ramps (gradual changes) and shocks (instantaneous changes) are 
summarized in Table 29, indicating net interest income sensitivity 
relative to the Company’s base net interest income plan. Ramp 
scenarios assume interest rates move gradually in parallel across 
the yield curve relative to the base scenario in year one, and the 
full amount of the ramp is held as a constant differential to the 
base scenario in year two. The following describes the simulation 
assumptions for the scenarios presented in Table 29: 
• 

Simulations are dynamic and reflect anticipated growth 
across assets and liabilities. 

•  Other macroeconomic variables that could be correlated with 

the changes in interest rates are held constant. 

•  Mortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary 

across scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or 
lower interest rates. 

•  Our base scenario deposit forecast incorporates mix changes 
consistent with the base interest rate trajectory. Deposit mix 
is modeled to be the same as in the base scenario across the 
alternative scenarios. In higher interest rate scenarios, 

42 

customer activity that shifts balances into higher-yielding 
products could reduce expected net interest income. 
•  We hold the size of the projected debt and equity securities 

portfolios constant across scenarios.

The sensitivity results above do not capture interest rate 
sensitive noninterest income and expense impacts. Our interest 
rate sensitive noninterest income and expense are predominantly 
driven by mortgage banking activities, and may move in the 
opposite direction of our net interest income. Mortgage 
originations generally decline in response to higher interest rates 
and generally increase, particularly refinancing activity, in 
response to lower interest rates. Mortgage results are also 
impacted by the valuation of MSRs and related hedge positions. 
See the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – 
Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk” section in this 
Report for more information. 

Interest rate sensitive noninterest income also results from 
changes in earnings credit for noninterest-bearing deposits that 
reduce treasury management deposit service fees. Additionally, 
for the trading portfolio, our trading assets are (before the 
effects of certain economic hedges) generally less sensitive to 
changes in interest rates than the related funding liabilities. As a 
result, net interest income from the trading portfolio contracts 
and expands as interest rates rise and fall, respectively. The 
impact to net interest income does not include the fair value 
changes of trading securities and loans, which, along with the 
effects of related economic hedges, are recorded in noninterest 
income. 

We use the debt securities portfolio and exchange-traded 
and over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives to hedge 
our interest rate exposures. See the “Balance Sheet Analysis – 
Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities” section 
in this Report for more information on the use of the available-
for-sale and held-to-maturity securities portfolios. The notional 
or contractual amount, credit risk amount and fair value of the 
derivatives used to hedge our interest rate risk exposures as of 
June 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, are presented in Note 15 
(Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report. We use 
derivatives for asset/liability management in two main ways: 

  
 
MARKET RISK – TRADING ACTIVITIES  We engage in trading 
activities to accommodate the investment and risk management 
activities of our customers and to execute economic hedging to 
manage certain balance sheet risks. These trading activities 
predominantly occur within our Wholesale Banking businesses 
and to a lesser extent other divisions of the Company. Debt 
securities held for trading, equity securities held for trading, 
trading loans and trading derivatives are financial instruments 
used in our trading activities, and all are carried at fair value. 
Income earned on the financial instruments used in our trading 
activities include net interest income, changes in fair value and 
realized gains and losses. Net interest income earned from our 
trading activities is reflected in the interest income and interest 
expense components of our income statement. Changes in fair 
value of the financial instruments used in our trading activities are 
reflected in net gains on trading activities, a component of 
noninterest income in our income statement. For more 
information on the financial instruments used in our trading 
activities and the income from these trading activities, see Note 4 
(Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
Value-at-risk (VaR) is a statistical risk measure used to 
estimate the potential loss from adverse moves in the financial 
markets. The Company uses VaR metrics complemented with 
sensitivity analysis and stress testing in measuring and 
monitoring market risk. For more information, including 
information regarding our monitoring activities, sensitivity 
analysis and stress testing, see the “Risk Management – Asset/ 
Liability Management – Market Risk – Trading Activities” section 
in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Trading VaR is the measure used to provide insight into the 

market risk exhibited by the Company’s trading positions. The 
Company calculates Trading VaR for risk management purposes 
to establish line of business and Company-wide risk limits. 
Trading VaR is calculated based on all trading positions on our 
balance sheet. 

Table 30 shows the Company’s Trading General VaR by risk 

category. As presented in Table 30, average Company Trading 
General VaR was $155 million for the quarter ended June 30, 
2020, compared with $33 million for the quarter ended March 31, 
2020, and $20 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2019. The 
increase in average as well as period end Company Trading 
General VaR for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, compared with 
the quarter ended June 30, 2019, was driven by recent market 
volatility, in particular changes in interest rate curves and a 
significant widening of credit spreads entering the 12-month 
historical lookback window used to calculate VaR.

to convert the cash flows from selected asset and/or liability 
instruments/portfolios including investments, commercial 
loans and long-term debt, from fixed-rate payments to 
floating-rate payments, or vice versa; and 
to economically hedge our mortgage origination pipeline, 
funded mortgage loans and MSRs using interest rate swaps, 
swaptions, futures, forwards and options. 

MORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK  We 
originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subjects us to 
various risks, including credit, liquidity and interest rate risks. For 
more information on mortgage banking interest rate and market 
risk, see the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – 
Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk” section in our 
2019 Form 10-K. 

While our hedging activities are designed to balance our 
mortgage banking interest rate risks, the financial instruments 
we use may not perfectly correlate with the values and income 
being hedged. For example, the change in the value of ARM 
production held for sale from changes in mortgage interest rates 
may or may not be fully offset by index-based financial 
instruments used as economic hedges for such ARMs. Hedge 
results may also be impacted as the overall level of hedges 
changes as interest rates change, or as there are other changes in 
the market for mortgage forwards that may affect the implied 
carry on the MSRs. 

The total carrying value of our residential and commercial 

MSRs was $8.2 billion at June 30, 2020, and $12.9 billion at 
December 31, 2019. The weighted-average note rate on our 
portfolio of loans serviced for others was 4.13% at June 30, 2020, 
and 4.25% at December 31, 2019. The carrying value of our total 
MSRs represented 0.52% and 0.79% of mortgage loans serviced 
for others at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. 

MARKET RISK  Market risk is the risk of possible economic loss 
from adverse changes in market risk factors such as interest 
rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and 
commodity prices, and the risk of possible loss due to 
counterparty exposure. This applies to implied volatility risk, basis 
risk, and market liquidity risk. It also includes price risk in the 
trading book, mortgage servicing rights and the hedge 
effectiveness risk associated with the mortgage book, and 
impairment on private equity investments. 

The Board’s Finance Committee has primary oversight 
responsibility for market risk and oversees the Company’s market 
risk exposure and market risk management strategies. In 
addition, the Board’s Risk Committee has certain oversight 
responsibilities with respect to market risk, including adjusting 
the Company’s market risk appetite with input from the Finance 
Committee. The Finance Committee also reports key market risk 
matters to the Risk Committee. 

At the management level, the Market and Counterparty Risk 

Management function, which is part of IRM, has primary 
oversight responsibility for market risk. The Market and 
Counterparty Risk Management function reports into the CRO 
and also provides periodic reports related to market risk to the 
Board’s Finance Committee.

The period-end VaR was less than the sum of the VaR components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect arises because the risks are not perfectly 
correlated causing a portfolio of positions to usually be less risky than the sum of the risks of the positions alone. The diversification benefit is not meaningful for low and high metrics since they may 
occur on different days. 

MARKET RISK – EQUITY SECURITIES  We are directly and indirectly 
affected by changes in the equity markets. We make and manage 
direct investments in start-up businesses, emerging growth 
companies, management buy-outs, acquisitions and corporate 
recapitalizations. We also invest in non-affiliated funds that make 
similar private equity investments. These private equity 
investments are made within capital allocations approved by 
management and the Board. The Board’s policy is to review 
business developments, key risks and historical returns for the 
private equity investment portfolio at least annually. 
Management reviews these investments at least quarterly and 
assesses them for possible other-than-temporary impairment 
(OTTI) and observable price changes. For nonmarketable equity 
securities, the analysis is based on facts and circumstances of 
each individual investment and the expectations for that 
investment’s cash flows, capital needs, the viability of its business 
model, our exit strategy, and observable price changes that are 
similar to the investments held. Investments in nonmarketable 
equity securities include private equity investments accounted 
for under the equity method, fair value through net income, and 
the measurement alternative. 

In conjunction with the March 2008 initial public offering 

(IPO) of Visa, Inc. (Visa), we received approximately 20.7 million 
shares of Visa Class B common stock, the class which was 
apportioned to member banks of Visa at the time of the IPO. To 
manage our exposure to Visa and realize the value of the 
appreciated Visa shares, we incrementally sold these shares 
through a series of sales, thereby eliminating this position as of 
September 30, 2015. As part of these sales, we agreed to 
compensate the buyer for any additional contributions to a 
litigation settlement fund for the litigation matters associated 
with the Class B shares we sold. Our exposure to this retained 
litigation risk has been updated quarterly and is reflected on our 
balance sheet. For additional information about the associated 
litigation matters, see the “Interchange Litigation” section in 
Note 14 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
As part of our business to support our customers, we trade 

public equities, listed/OTC equity derivatives and convertible 
bonds. We have parameters that govern these activities. We also 
have marketable equity securities that include investments 
relating to our venture capital activities. We manage these 
marketable equity securities within capital risk limits approved by 
management and the Board and monitored by Corporate ALCO 
and the Market Risk Committee. The fair value changes in these 
marketable equity securities are recognized in net income. For 

44 

more information, see Note 8 (Equity Securities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Changes in equity market prices may also indirectly affect 

our net income by (1) the value of third party assets under 
management and, hence, fee income, (2) borrowers whose ability 
to repay principal and/or interest may be affected by the stock 
market, or (3) brokerage activity, related commission income and 
other business activities. Each business line monitors and 
manages these indirect risks. 

LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING  The objective of effective liquidity 
management is to ensure that we can meet customer loan 
requests, customer deposit maturities/withdrawals and other 
cash commitments efficiently under both normal operating 
conditions and under periods of Wells Fargo-specific and/or 
market stress. To achieve this objective, the Board establishes 
liquidity guidelines that require sufficient asset-based liquidity to 
cover potential funding requirements and to avoid over-
dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. These 
guidelines are monitored on a monthly basis by the Corporate 
ALCO and on a quarterly basis by the Board. These guidelines are 
established and monitored for both the consolidated company 
and for the Parent on a stand-alone basis to ensure that the 
Parent is a source of strength for its regulated, deposit-taking 
banking subsidiaries. 

Liquidity Standards  We are subject to a rule, issued by the FRB, 
OCC and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), that 
includes a quantitative liquidity requirement consistent with the 
liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) established by the Basel Committee 
on Banking Supervision (BCBS). The rule requires banking 
institutions, such as Wells Fargo, to hold high-quality liquid assets 
(HQLA), such as central bank reserves and government and 
corporate debt that can be converted easily and quickly into cash, 
in an amount equal to or greater than its projected net cash 
outflows during a 30-day stress period. The rule is applicable to 
the Company on a consolidated basis and to our insured 
depository institutions (IDIs) with total assets greater than 
$10 billion. In addition, rules issued by the FRB impose enhanced 
liquidity management standards on large BHCs such as Wells 
Fargo. 

The FRB, OCC and FDIC have proposed a rule that would 
implement a stable funding requirement, the net stable funding 
ratio (NSFR), which would require large banking organizations, 
such as Wells Fargo, to maintain a sufficient amount of stable 

  
 
  
 
funding in relation to their assets, derivative exposures and 
commitments over a one-year horizon period. 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio  As of June 30, 2020, the consolidated 
Company, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo National Bank 
West were above the minimum LCR requirement of 100%, which 
is calculated as HQLA divided by projected net cash outflows, as 
each is defined under the LCR rule. Table 31 presents the 
Company’s quarterly average values for the daily-calculated LCR 
and its components calculated pursuant to the LCR rule 
requirements.

securities. These assets make up our primary sources of liquidity 
which are presented in Table 32. Our primary sources of liquidity 
are substantially the same in composition as HQLA under the LCR 
rule; however, our primary sources of liquidity will generally 
exceed HQLA calculated under the LCR rule due to the applicable 
haircuts to HQLA and the exclusion of excess HQLA at our 
subsidiary IDIs required under the LCR rule. 

Our cash is predominantly on deposit with the Federal 
Reserve. Debt securities included as part of our primary sources 
of liquidity are comprised of U.S. Treasury and federal agency 
debt, and mortgage-backed securities issued by federal agencies 
within our debt securities portfolio. We believe these debt 
securities provide quick sources of liquidity through sales or by 
pledging to obtain financing, regardless of market conditions. 
Some of these debt securities are within our held-to-maturity 
portfolio and as such are not intended for sale, but may be 
pledged to obtain financing. Some of the legal entities within our 
consolidated group of companies are subject to various 
regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions that can limit the 
transferability of their funds. We believe we maintain adequate 
liquidity for these entities in consideration of such funds transfer 
restrictions.

financing of loans, to the extent such debt securities and loans are 
not encumbered. As of June 30, 2020, we also maintained 
approximately $276.1 billion of available borrowing capacity at 
various Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Reserve

Asset/Liability Management (continued) 

Long-Term Debt  We access domestic and international capital 
markets for long-term funding (generally greater than one year) 
through issuances of registered debt securities, private 
placements and asset-backed secured funding. We issue long-
term debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve 
cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity 
profile. Proceeds from securities issued were used for general 
corporate purposes, and, unless otherwise specified in the 
applicable prospectus or prospectus supplement, we expect the 
proceeds from securities issued in the future will be used for the 
same purposes. Long-term debt of $230.9 billion at June 30, 

Table 34:  Maturity of Long-Term Debt 

2020, increased $2.7 billion from December 31, 2019. We issued 
$18.8 billion and $37.7 billion of long-term debt in the second 
quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, and $187 million in 
July 2020. Depending on market conditions, we may purchase our 
outstanding debt securities from time to time in privately 
negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer, or 
otherwise. Table 34 provides the aggregate carrying value of 
long-term debt maturities (based on contractual payment dates) 
for the remainder of 2020 and the following years thereafter, as 
of June 30, 2020.

Credit Ratings  Investors in the long-term capital markets, as well 
as other market participants, generally will consider, among other 
factors, a company’s debt rating in making investment decisions. 
Rating agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and 
qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset 
quality, business mix, the level and quality of earnings, and rating 
agency assumptions regarding the probability and extent of 
federal financial assistance or support for certain large financial 
institutions. Adverse changes in these factors could result in a 
reduction of our credit rating; however, our debt securities do not 
contain credit rating covenants. 

On April 22, 2020, Fitch Ratings, Inc. (Fitch) affirmed the 
Company’s long-term and short-term issuer default ratings and 
revised the rating outlook to negative from stable as Fitch 
expects significant operating environment headwinds from the 
disruption to economic activity and financial markets as a result 
of the COVID-19 pandemic. This rating action followed Fitch’s 
event-driven review of the commercially-oriented U.S. global

systemically important banks (G-SIBs). On May 21, 2020, DBRS 
Morningstar confirmed the Company’s ratings and revised the 
rating trend to negative from stable, citing the economic 
disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. On July 22, 2020, 
Standard & Poor's (S&P) Global Ratings lowered the long-term 
rating of the Company to BBB+ from A- and revised the rating 
outlook to stable from negative. 

See the “Risk Factors” section in our 2019 Form 10-K for 

additional information regarding our credit ratings and the 
potential impact a credit rating downgrade would have on our 
liquidity and operations, as well as Note 15 (Derivatives) to 
Financial Statements in this Report for information regarding 
additional collateral and funding obligations required for certain 
derivative instruments in the event our credit ratings were to fall 
below investment grade.

FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK MEMBERSHIP  The Federal Home Loan 
Banks (the FHLBs) are a group of cooperatives that lending 
institutions use to finance housing and economic development in 
local communities. We are a member of the FHLBs based in 
Dallas, Des Moines and San Francisco. Each member of the FHLBs 
is required to maintain a minimum investment in capital stock of 
the applicable FHLB. The board of directors of each FHLB can 
increase the minimum investment requirements in the event it 
has concluded that additional capital is required to allow it to 
meet its own regulatory capital requirements. Any increase in the 
minimum investment requirements outside of specified ranges 
requires the approval of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. 
Because the extent of any obligation to increase our investment 
in any of the FHLBs depends entirely upon the occurrence of a 
future event, potential future payments to the FHLBs are not 
determinable. 

LIBOR TRANSITION  Due to uncertainty surrounding the suitability 
and sustainability of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), 
central banks and global regulators have called for financial 
market participants to prepare for the discontinuation of LIBOR 
by the end of 2021. LIBOR is a widely-referenced benchmark rate, 
which is published in five currencies and a range of tenors, and 
seeks to estimate the cost at which banks can borrow on an 
unsecured basis from other banks. We have a significant number 
of assets and liabilities referenced to LIBOR and other interbank 
offered rates (IBORs), such as commercial loans, adjustable-rate 
mortgage loans, derivatives, debt securities, and long-term debt. 
Accordingly, we established a LIBOR Transition Office (LTO) 
in February 2018, with senior management and Board oversight. 
The LTO is responsible for developing a coordinated strategy to 
transition the IBOR-linked contracts and processes across Wells 
Fargo to alternative reference rates and serves as the primary 
conduit between Wells Fargo and relevant industry groups, such 
as the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC). 

In addition, the Company is actively working with regulators, 

industry working groups (such as the ARRC) and trade 
associations that are developing guidance to facilitate an orderly 
transition away from the use of LIBOR. We are closely monitoring 
and seeking to follow the recommendations and guidance 
announced by such organizations, including those announced by 
the ARRC and the Bank of England’s Working Group on Sterling 
Risk-Free Reference Rates. We continue to assess the risks and 
related impacts associated with a transition away from IBORs. 
See the “Risk Factors” section in the 2019 Form 10-K for 
additional information regarding the potential impact of a 
benchmark rate, such as LIBOR, or other referenced financial 
metric being significantly changed, replaced, or discontinued. 
On March 12, 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards 
Board (FASB) issued ASU 2020-04 – Facilitation of the Effects of 
Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (Update) that 
provides temporary relief from existing GAAP accounting 
requirements for entities that perform activities related to 
reference rate reform. The relief provided by the Update is 
primarily related to contract modifications and hedge accounting 
relationships that are impacted by the Company’s reference rate 
reform activities. For additional information on the Update, see

Capital Management 

We have an active program for managing capital through a 
comprehensive process for assessing the Company’s overall 
capital adequacy. Our objective is to maintain capital at an 
amount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance 
objectives, and to meet both regulatory and market expectations. 
We primarily fund our working capital needs through the 
retention of earnings net of both dividends and share 
repurchases, as well as through the issuance of preferred stock 
and long and short-term debt. Retained earnings decreased 
$6.7 billion from December 31, 2019, predominantly as a result of 
common and preferred stock dividends of $4.9 billion and net 
losses of $1.7 billion. During second quarter 2020, we issued 
$367 million of common stock, excluding conversions of 
preferred shares. On March 15, 2020, we suspended our share 
repurchase activities for the remainder of the first quarter and for 
second quarter 2020. On June 25, 2020, the FRB announced that 
it was prohibiting large BHCs subject to the FRB’s capital plan rule, 
including Wells Fargo, from making any capital distribution 
(excluding any capital distribution arising from the issuance of a 
capital instrument eligible for inclusion in the numerator of a 
regulatory capital ratio), unless otherwise approved by the FRB. 
Through the end of third quarter 2020, the FRB authorized 
certain limited exceptions to this prohibition, which are described 
in the “Capital Planning and Stress Testing” section below. For 
additional information about capital distributions, see the 
“Capital Planning and Stress Testing” and “Securities 
Repurchases” sections below. 

In January 2020, we issued $2.0 billion of our Preferred 
Stock, Series Z. In March 2020, we redeemed the remaining 
$1.8 billion of our Preferred Stock, Series K, and redeemed 
$669 million of our Preferred Stock, Series T. For more 
information, see Note 17 (Preferred Stock) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

On July 28, 2020, the Company reduced its third quarter 

2020 common stock dividend to $0.10 per share. 

Regulatory Capital Guidelines 
The Company and each of our IDIs are subject to various 
regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the 
FRB and the OCC. Risk-based capital (RBC) guidelines establish a 
risk-adjusted ratio relating capital to different categories of 
assets and off-balance sheet exposures as discussed below. 

RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS  The Company is 
subject to rules issued by federal banking regulators to 
implement Basel III capital requirements for U.S. banking 
organizations. The federal banking regulators’ capital rules, 
among other things, required on a fully phased-in basis as of 
June 30, 2020: 
• 

a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 9.00%, 
comprised of a 4.50% minimum requirement plus a capital 
conservation buffer of 2.50% and for us, as a global 
systemically important bank (G-SIB), a capital surcharge of 
2.00%; 
a minimum tier 1 capital ratio of 10.50%, comprised of a 
6.00% minimum requirement plus the capital conservation 
buffer of 2.50% and the G-SIB capital surcharge of 2.00%; 
a minimum total capital ratio of 12.50%, comprised of a 
8.00% minimum requirement plus the capital conservation 
buffer of 2.50% and the G-SIB capital surcharge of 2.00%; 

• 

• 

48 

• 

• 

a potential countercyclical buffer of up to 2.50% to be added 
to the minimum capital ratios, which could be imposed by 
regulators at their discretion if it is determined that a period 
of excessive credit growth is contributing to an increase in 
systemic risk; and 
a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.00%. 

The Basel III capital requirements for calculating CET1 and 
tier 1 capital, along with risk-weighted assets (RWAs), are fully 
phased-in. However, the requirements for determining tier 2 and 
total capital are still in accordance with Transition Requirements 
and are scheduled to be fully phased-in by the end of 2021. The 
Basel III capital rules contain two frameworks for calculating 
capital requirements, a Standardized Approach and an Advanced 
Approach applicable to certain institutions, including Wells 
Fargo. Accordingly, in the assessment of our capital adequacy, we 
must report the lower of our CET1, tier 1 and total capital ratios 
calculated under the Standardized Approach and under the 
Advanced Approach. The difference between RWAs under the 
Standardized and Advanced Approach has narrowed in recent 
quarters due to economic conditions from the COVID-19 
pandemic impacting our calculation of Advanced Approach 
RWAs. In particular, downgrades of loans in our loan portfolio, 
which drive negative credit risk migration, increased our 
Advanced Approach RWAs at June 30, 2020. We expect this 
trend to continue if the economic impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic continues to affect our customer base. 

Effective October 1, 2020, a stress capital buffer will be 
included in the minimum capital ratio requirements. The stress 
capital buffer is calculated based on the decrease in a BHC’s 
risk-based capital ratios under the severely adverse scenario in 
the FRB’s annual supervisory stress test and related 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), plus four 
quarters of planned common stock dividends. The stress capital 
buffer will replace the current 2.50% capital conservation buffer 
under the Standardized Approach. On June 29, 2020, following 
the FRB’s release of the results of the 2020 supervisory stress 
test and related CCAR, the Company announced that it expects 
its stress capital buffer to be 2.50%, which is the lowest 
possible under the new framework and would keep the 
regulatory minimum for the Company’s CET1 ratio at 9.00%. 
The FRB has indicated that it will publish the final stress capital 
buffer for each BHC by August 31, 2020. Because the stress 
capital buffer is calculated annually as part of the FRB’s 
supervisory stress test and related CCAR and will be based on 
data that can differ over time, our stress capital buffer, and thus 
the regulatory minimums for our capital ratios, are subject to 
change in future years. 

As a G-SIB, we are also subject to the FRB’s rule 
implementing the additional capital surcharge of between 
1.00-4.50% on the minimum capital requirements of G-SIBs. 
Under the rule, we must annually calculate our surcharge under 
two methods and use the higher of the two surcharges. The 
first method (method one) considers our size, 
interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, 
substitutability, and complexity, consistent with the 
methodology developed by the BCBS and the Financial Stability 
Board (FSB). The second method (method two) uses similar 
inputs, but replaces substitutability with use of short-term 
wholesale funding and will generally result in higher surcharges 
than the BCBS methodology. Because the G-SIB capital 
surcharge is calculated annually based on data that can differ 

 
 
over time, the amount of the surcharge is subject to change in 
future years. 

In second quarter 2020, the Company elected to apply a 

modified transition provision issued by federal banking 
regulators in March 2020 related to the impact of CECL on 
regulatory capital. The rule permits certain banking organizations 
to exclude from regulatory capital the initial adoption impact of 
CECL, plus 25% of the cumulative changes in the ACL under CECL 
for each period until December 31, 2021, followed by a three-
year phase-out of the benefits. 

The tables that follow provide information about our risk-

based capital and related ratios as calculated under Basel III 

Table 36:  Capital Components and Ratios (Fully Phased-In) (1) 

capital guidelines. Although we report certain capital amounts 
and ratios in accordance with Transition Requirements for 
banking industry regulatory reporting purposes, we manage our 
capital based on a fully phased-in basis. For information about 
our capital requirements calculated in accordance with Transition 
Requirements, see Note 23 (Regulatory and Agency Capital 
Requirements) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Determined by applying the combined federal statutory rate and composite state income tax rates to the difference between book and tax basis of the respective goodwill and intangible assets at 
period end. 
In second quarter 2020, the Company elected to apply a modified transition provision issued by federal banking regulators in March 2020 related to the impact of CECL on regulatory capital. The rule 
permits certain banking organizations to exclude from regulatory capital the initial adoption impact of CECL, plus 25% of the cumulative changes in the ACL under CECL for each period until 
December 31, 2021, followed by a three-year phase-out of the benefits. The impact of the CECL transition provision on our regulatory capital at June 30, 2020, was an increase in capital of 
$1.9 billion, reflecting a $991 million (post-tax) increase in capital recognized upon our initial adoption of CECL, offset by 25% of the $11.4 billion increase in our ACL under CECL from January 1, 
2020, through June 30, 2020. 
Under the Advanced Approach the allowance for credit losses that exceeds expected credit losses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital, to the extent the excess allowance does not exceed 0.60% of 
Advanced credit RWAs, and under the Standardized Approach, the allowance for credit losses is includable in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of Standardized credit RWAs, in each case with any excess 
allowance for credit losses being deducted from the respective total RWAs. 
RWAs calculated under the Advanced Approach utilize a risk-sensitive methodology, which relies upon the use of internal credit models based upon our experience with internal rating grades. 
Advanced Approach also includes an operational risk component, which reflects the risk of operating loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems. 
Under the regulatory guidelines for risk-based capital, on-balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk 
categories according to the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of any collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with 
that category. The resulting weighted values from each of the risk categories are aggregated for determining total RWAs. 
Includes an increase of $1.5 billion under both the Advanced Approach and Standardized Approach related to the impact of the CECL transition provision on our excess allowance for credit losses as 
of June 30, 2020. See footnote (3) to this table. 
Amounts for December 31, 2019, have been revised as a result of a decrease in RWAs under the Advanced Approach due to the correction of duplicated operational loss amounts.

Capital Management (continued) 

TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY  We also evaluate our business based 
on certain ratios that utilize tangible common equity. Tangible 
common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents 
total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, 
goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs) 
and goodwill and other intangibles on nonmarketable equity 
securities, net of applicable deferred taxes. These tangible 
common equity ratios are as follows: 
• 

Tangible book value per common share, which represents 
tangible common equity divided by common shares 
outstanding; and 

• 

Return on average tangible common equity (ROTCE), which 
represents our annualized earnings contribution as a 
percentage of tangible common equity. 

The methodology of determining tangible common equity 
may differ among companies. Management believes that tangible 
book value per common share and return on average tangible 
common equity, which utilize tangible common equity, are useful 
financial measures because they enable investors and others to 
assess the Company’s use of equity. 

Table 40 provides a reconciliation of these non-GAAP 

financial measures to GAAP financial measures.

SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO  As a BHC, we are required to 
maintain a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of at least 5.00% 
(comprised of a 3.00% minimum requirement plus a 
supplementary leverage buffer of 2.00%) to avoid restrictions on 
capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Our IDIs 
are required to maintain a SLR of at least 6.00% to be considered 
well-capitalized under applicable regulatory capital adequacy 
guidelines. In April 2018, the FRB and OCC proposed rules 
(Proposed SLR rules) that would replace the 2.00% 
supplementary leverage buffer with a buffer equal to one-half of 
our G-SIB capital surcharge. The Proposed SLR rules would 
similarly tailor the current 6.00% SLR requirement for our IDIs. In 
April 2020, the FRB issued an interim final rule that temporarily 
allows a BHC to exclude on-balance sheet amounts of U.S. 
Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from 
the calculation of its total leverage exposure in the denominator 
of the SLR. This interim final rule became effective on April 1, 
2020, and expires on March 31, 2021. In May 2020, federal 
banking regulators issued an interim final rule that permits IDIs to 
choose to similarly exclude these items from the denominator of 
their SLRs; however, if an IDI chooses to exclude such amounts 
from the calculation of its SLR, it will be required to request 
approval from its primary federal banking regulator before 
making capital distributions, such as paying dividends, to its 
parent company. As of June 30, 2020, none of the Company’s IDIs 
elected to apply this exclusion. 

At June 30, 2020, our SLR for the Company was 7.52%, and 

we also exceeded the applicable SLR requirements for each of our 
IDIs. See Table 41 for information regarding the calculation and 
components of the SLR.

TOTAL LOSS ABSORBING CAPACITY As a G-SIB, we are required to 
have a minimum amount of equity and unsecured long-term debt 
for purposes of resolvability and resiliency, often referred to as 
Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC). U.S. G-SIBs are required to 
have a minimum TLAC amount (consisting of CET1 capital and 
additional tier 1 capital issued directly by the top-tier or covered 
BHC plus eligible external long-term debt) equal to the greater of 
(i) 18.00% of RWAs and (ii) 7.50% of total leverage exposure (the 
denominator of the SLR calculation). Additionally, U.S. G-SIBs are 
required to maintain (i) a TLAC buffer equal to 2.50% of RWAs 

plus our applicable G-SIB capital surcharge calculated under 
method one plus any applicable countercyclical buffer to be added 
to the 18.00% minimum and (ii) an external TLAC leverage buffer 
equal to 2.00% of total leverage exposure to be added to the 
7.50% minimum, in order to avoid restrictions on capital 
distributions and discretionary bonus payments. U.S. G-SIBs are 
also required to have a minimum amount of eligible unsecured 
long-term debt equal to the greater of (i) 6.00% of RWAs plus our 
applicable G-SIB capital surcharge calculated under method two 
and (ii) 4.50% of the total leverage exposure. Under the Proposed 
SLR rules, the 2.00% external TLAC leverage buffer would be 
replaced with a buffer equal to one-half of our applicable G-SIB 
capital surcharge, and the leverage component for calculating the 
minimum amount of eligible unsecured long-term debt would be 
modified from 4.50% of total leverage exposure to 2.50% of total 
leverage exposure plus one-half of our applicable G-SIB capital 
surcharge. As of June 30, 2020, our eligible external TLAC as a 
percentage of total risk-weighted assets was 25.33% compared 
with a required minimum of 22.00%. Similar to the risk-based 
capital requirements, we determine minimum required TLAC 
based on the greater of RWAs determined under the 
Standardized and Advanced approaches. 

OTHER REGULATORY CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY MATTERS  As 
discussed in the “Risk Management – Asset/ Liability 
Management – Liquidity and Funding – Liquidity Standards” 
section in this Report, federal banking regulators have issued a 
final rule regarding the U.S. implementation of the Basel III LCR 
and a proposed rule regarding the NSFR. 

Capital Planning and Stress Testing 
Our planned long-term capital structure is designed to meet 
regulatory and market expectations. We believe that our long-
term targeted capital structure enables us to invest in and grow 
our business, satisfy our customers’ financial needs in varying 
environments, access markets, and maintain flexibility to return 
capital to our shareholders. Our long-term targeted capital 
structure also considers capital levels sufficient to exceed capital 
requirements including the G-SIB capital surcharge. Accordingly, 
based on the final Basel III capital rules under the lower of the 
Standardized or Advanced Approaches CET1 capital ratios, we 
currently target a long-term CET1 capital ratio at or in excess of 
10.00%, which includes a 2.00% G-SIB capital surcharge. Our 
capital targets are subject to change based on various factors, 
including changes to the regulatory capital framework and 
expectations for large banks promulgated by bank regulatory 
agencies, changes to the regulatory minimums for our capital 
ratios (including changes to our stress capital buffer), planned 
capital actions, changes in our risk profile and other factors. 

Under the FRB’s capital plan rule, large BHCs are required to 
submit capital plans annually for review to determine if the FRB 
has any objections before making any capital distributions. The 
rule requires updates to capital plans in the event of material 
changes in a BHC’s risk profile, including as a result of any 
significant acquisitions. The FRB assesses, among other things, 
the overall financial condition, risk profile, and capital adequacy of 
BHCs when evaluating capital plans. 

Our 2020 capital plan, which was submitted on April 3, 2020, 

as part of CCAR, included a comprehensive capital outlook 
supported by an assessment of expected sources and uses of 
capital over a given planning horizon under a range of expected 
and stress scenarios. As part of the 2020 CCAR, the FRB also 
generated a supervisory stress test, which assumed a sharp 
decline in the economy and significant decline in asset pricing 
using the information provided by the Company to estimate 

53 

  
 
certain limited exceptions to this prohibition, which are described 
in the “Capital Planning and Stress Testing” section above. 

At June 30, 2020, we had remaining Board authority to 

repurchase approximately 168 million shares, subject to 
regulatory and legal conditions. For more information about share 
repurchases during second quarter 2020, see Part II, Item 2 in this 
Report. 

Historically, our policy has been to repurchase shares under 

the “safe harbor” conditions of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 including a limitation on the daily volume 
of repurchases. Rule 10b-18 imposes an additional daily volume 
limitation on share repurchases during a pending merger or 
acquisition in which shares of our stock will constitute some or all 
of the consideration. Our management may determine that 
during a pending stock merger or acquisition when the safe 
harbor would otherwise be available, it is in our best interest to 
repurchase shares in excess of this additional daily volume 
limitation. In such cases, we intend to repurchase shares in 
compliance with the other conditions of the safe harbor, including 
the standing daily volume limitation that applies whether or not 
there is a pending stock merger or acquisition. 

For additional information about share repurchases, see 
Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Capital Management (continued) 

performance. The FRB reviewed the supervisory stress test 
results both as required under the Dodd-Frank Act using a 
common set of capital actions for all large BHCs and by taking 
into account the Company’s proposed capital actions. The FRB 
published its supervisory stress test results as required under the 
Dodd-Frank Act on June 25, 2020. 

On June 25, 2020, the FRB also announced that it is requiring 

large BHCs, including Wells Fargo, to update and resubmit their 
capital plans within 45 days after the FRB provides updated 
scenarios. Requiring resubmission will prohibit each BHC from 
making any capital distribution (excluding any capital distribution 
arising from the issuance of a capital instrument eligible for 
inclusion in the numerator of a regulatory capital ratio), unless 
otherwise approved by the FRB. Through the end of third quarter 
2020, the FRB is authorizing each BHC to (i) make share 
repurchases relating to issuances of common stock related to 
employee stock ownership plans; (ii) provided that the BHC does 
not increase the amount of its common stock dividends, pay 
common stock dividends that do not exceed an amount equal to 
the average of the BHC’s net income for the four preceding 
calendar quarters, unless otherwise specified by the FRB; and (iii) 
make scheduled payments on additional tier 1 and tier 2 capital 
instruments. These provisions may be extended by the FRB 
quarter-by-quarter. 

Concurrently with CCAR, federal banking regulators also 
require large BHCs and banks to conduct their own stress tests to 
evaluate whether the institution has sufficient capital to continue 
to operate during periods of adverse economic and financial 
conditions. These stress testing requirements set forth the 
timing and type of stress test activities large BHCs and banks 
must undertake as well as rules governing stress testing controls, 
oversight and disclosure requirements. We submitted the results 
of our stress test to the FRB and disclosed a summary of the 
results in June 2020. 

Securities Repurchases 
From time to time the Board authorizes the Company to 
repurchase shares of our common stock. Although we announce 
when the Board authorizes share repurchases, we typically do not 
give any public notice before we repurchase our shares. Future 
stock repurchases may be private or open-market repurchases, 
including block transactions, accelerated or delayed block 
transactions, forward repurchase transactions, and similar 
transactions. Additionally, we may enter into plans to purchase 
stock that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934. Various factors determine the amount of 
our share repurchases, including our capital requirements, the 
number of shares we expect to issue for employee benefit plans 
and acquisitions, market conditions (including the trading price of 
our stock), and regulatory and legal considerations, including the 
FRB’s response to our capital plan and to changes in our risk 
profile. Due to the various factors impacting the amount of our 
share repurchases and the fact that we tend to be in the market 
regularly to satisfy repurchase considerations under our capital 
plan, our share repurchases occur at various price levels. We may 
suspend share repurchase activity at any time. On March 15, 
2020, we, along with the other members of the Financial Services 
Forum, suspended our share repurchase activities for the 
remainder of the first quarter and for second quarter 2020. On 
June 25, 2020, the FRB announced that it was prohibiting large 
BHCs, including Wells Fargo, from making any capital distribution 
(excluding any capital distribution arising from the issuance of a 
capital instrument eligible for inclusion in the numerator of a 
regulatory capital ratio), unless otherwise approved by the FRB. 
Through the end of third quarter 2020, the FRB authorized

Regulatory Matters 

Since the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, the U.S. 
financial services industry has been subject to a significant 
increase in regulation and regulatory oversight initiatives. This 
increased regulation and oversight has substantially changed how 
most U.S. financial services companies conduct business and has 
increased their regulatory compliance costs. 

For a discussion of certain consent orders applicable to the 
Company, see the “Overview” section in this Report. The following 
supplements our discussion of the other significant regulations 
and regulatory oversight initiatives that have affected or may 
affect our business contained in the “Regulatory Matters” and 
“Risk Factors” sections in our 2019 Form 10-K and in our 2020 
First Quarter Report on Form 10-Q. 

In addition, the OCC and the FRB have issued guidelines for 
banks and BHCs related to working with customers affected by 
the COVID-19 pandemic, including guidance with respect to 
waiving fees, offering repayment accommodations, providing 
payment deferrals, and increasing daily withdrawal limits at 
automated teller machines. In addition, the federal government 
has instituted a moratorium on certain mortgage foreclosure 
activities. Any current or future rules, regulations, and guidance 
related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts could require 
us to change certain of our business practices, reduce our revenue 
and earnings, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise 
adversely affect our business operations and/or competitive 
position. 

REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS RELATED TO COVID-19  In response 
to the COVID-19 pandemic and related events, federal banking 
regulators have undertaken a number of measures to help 
stabilize the banking sector, support the broader economy, and 
facilitate the ability of banking organizations like Wells Fargo to 
continue lending to consumers and businesses. For example, in 
order to facilitate the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic 
Security Act (CARES Act), federal banking regulators issued 
interim final rules designed to encourage financial institutions to 
participate in stimulus measures, such as the Small Business 
Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program and the FRB’s 
Main Street Lending Program. Similarly, the FRB launched a 
number of lending facilities designed to enhance liquidity and the 
functioning of markets, including facilities covering money 
market mutual funds and term asset-backed securities loans. 
Federal banking regulators have also issued several joint interim 
final rules amending the regulatory capital and TLAC rules and 
other prudential regulations to ease certain restrictions on 
banking organizations and encourage the use of certain FRB-
established facilities in order to further promote lending to 
consumers and businesses.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our significant accounting policies (see Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 
2019 Form 10-K) are fundamental to understanding our results 
of operations and financial condition because they require that we 
use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our 
assets or liabilities and financial results. Five of these policies are 
critical because they require management to make difficult, 
subjective and complex judgments about matters that are 
inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially 
different amounts would be reported under different conditions 
or using different assumptions. These policies govern: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

the allowance for credit losses; 
the valuation of residential MSRs; 
the fair value of financial instruments; 
income taxes; and 
liability for contingent litigation losses. 

Management and the Board’s Audit Committee have 
reviewed and approved these critical accounting policies. These 
policies are described further in the “Financial Review – Critical 
Accounting Policies” section and Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2019 Form 
10-K. In connection with our adoption of CECL on January 1, 
2020, we have updated our critical accounting policy for the 
allowance for credit losses. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 
We maintain an allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans, which 
is management’s estimate of the expected credit losses in the 
loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments, at the balance 
sheet date, excluding loans and unfunded credit commitments 
carried at fair value or held for sale. Additionally, we maintain an 
allowance for credit losses for debt securities classified as either 
held-to-maturity (HTM) or available-for-sale (AFS), other 
financial assets measured at amortized cost, net investments in 
leases, and other off-balance sheet credit exposures. In 
connection with our adoption of CECL, we updated our approach 
for estimating expected credit losses, which includes new areas 
for management judgment, described more fully below, and 
updated our accounting policies. For more information, see Note 
1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

For loans and HTM debt securities, the ACL is measured 

based on the remaining contractual term of the financial asset 
(including off-balance sheet credit exposures) adjusted, as 
appropriate, for prepayments and permitted extension options 
using historical experience, current conditions, and forecasted 
information. For AFS debt securities, the ACL is measured using a 
discounted cash flow approach and is limited to the difference 
between the fair value of the security and its amortized cost. 

Changes in the ACL and, therefore, in the related provision 

for credit losses can materially affect net income. In applying the 
judgment and review required to determine the ACL, 
management considerations include the evaluation of past 
events, historical experience, changes in economic forecasts and 
conditions, customer behavior, collateral values, and the length of 
the initial loss forecast period, and other influences. From time to 
time, changes in economic factors or assumptions, business 
strategy, products or product mix, or debt security investment 
strategy, may result in a corresponding increase or decrease in our 
ACL. While our methodology attributes portions of the ACL to 
specific financial asset classes (loan and debt security portfolios) 

56 

or loan portfolio segments (commercial and consumer), the entire 
ACL is available to absorb credit losses of the company. 

• 

• 

Judgment is specifically applied in: 
Economic assumptions and the length of the initial loss forecast 
period.  Forecasted economic variables, such as gross 
domestic product (GDP), unemployment rate or collateral 
asset prices, are used to estimate expected credit losses. 
While many of these economic variables are evaluated at the 
macro-economy level, some economic variables may be 
forecasted at more granular levels, for example, using the 
metro statistical area (MSA) level for unemployment rates, 
home prices and commercial real estate prices. Quarterly, we 
assess the length of the initial loss forecast period and have 
currently set the period to one year. Management exercises 
judgment when assigning weight to the three economic 
scenarios that are used to estimate future credit losses. The 
three scenarios include a most likely expectation of economic 
variables referred to as the base case scenario, as well as an 
optimistic (upside) scenario and a pessimistic (downside) 
scenario. 
Reversion of losses beyond the initial forecast period.  We use a 
reversion approach to connect the losses estimated for our 
initial loss forecast period to the period of our historical loss 
forecast based on economic conditions at the measurement 
date. Our reversion methodology considers the type of 
portfolio, point in the credit cycle, expected length of 
recessions and recoveries, as well as other relevant factors. 
The length of reversion period varies by asset type – one year 
for shorter contractual term loans such as commercial loans 
and two years for longer contractual term loans such as real 
estate 1-4 family mortgage loans. We assess the reversion 
approach on a quarterly basis and the length of the reversion 
period by asset type annually. 

•  Historical loss expectations.  At the end of the reversion 

• 

• 

period, we incorporate the changes in economic variables 
observed during representative historical time periods that 
include both recessions and expansions. This analysis is used 
to compute average losses for any given portfolio and its 
associated credit characteristics. Annually, we assess the 
historical time periods and ensure the average loss estimates 
are representative of our historical loss experience. 
Credit risk ratings applied to individual commercial loans, 
unfunded credit commitments, and debt securities.  Individually 
assessed credit risk ratings are considered key credit 
variables in our modeled approaches to help assess 
probability of default and loss given default. Borrower quality 
ratings are aligned to the borrower’s financial strength and 
contribute to forecasted probability of default curves. 
Collateral quality ratings combined with forecasted collateral 
prices (as applicable) contribute to the forecasted severity of 
loss in the event of default. These credit risk ratings are 
reviewed by experienced senior credit officers and subjected 
to reviews by an internal team of credit risk specialists. 
Usage of credit loss estimation models.  We use internally 
developed models that incorporate credit attributes and 
economic variables to generate estimates of credit losses. 
Management uses a combination of judgement and 
quantitative analytics in the determination of segmentation, 
modeling approach, and variables that are leveraged in the 
models. These models are validated in accordance with the 
Company’s policies by an internal model validation group. We 
routinely assess our model performance and apply 

 
 
In our sensitivity analysis, we applied 50% weight to both the 

base case scenario and the downside scenario to reflect the 
potential for further economic deterioration from a COVID-19 
resurgence. The outcomes of both scenarios were influenced by 
the duration, severity, and timing of changes in economic 
variables within those scenarios. The result of the sensitivity 
analysis would have increased the ACL for loans by approximately 
$5.0 billion at June 30, 2020. 

This hypothetical increase in our ACL for loans represents 
changes to our quantitative estimate and does not incorporate 
the impact of management judgment for qualitative factors 
applied in the current ACL for loans, which may have a positive or 
negative effect on the results. Also, if this hypothetical result 
were to actually materialize, the increase in our ACL for loans may 
be recognized over time if actual loss expectations exceed our 
historical loss experience. 

This sensitivity analysis does not represent management’s 

view of expected credit losses at the balance sheet date. The 
sensitivity analysis excludes the ACL for debt securities given its 
size relative to the overall ACL. Management believes that the 
estimate for the ACL for loans was appropriate at the balance 
sheet date. Because significant judgment is used, it is possible 
that others performing similar analyses could reach different 
conclusions. 

• 

• 

adjustments when necessary to improve the accuracy of loss 
estimation. We also assess our models for limitations against 
the company-wide risk inventory to help ensure that we 
appropriately capture known and emerging risks in our 
estimate of expected credit losses and apply overlays as 
needed. 
Valuation of collateral.  The current fair value of collateral is 
utilized to assess the expected credit losses when a financial 
asset is considered to be collateral dependent. We apply 
judgment when valuing the collateral either through 
appraisals, evaluation of the cash flows of the property, or 
other quantitative techniques. Decreases in collateral 
valuations support incremental charge-downs and increases 
in collateral valuation are included in the allowance for credit 
losses as a negative allowance when the financial asset has 
been previously written-down below current recovery value. 
Contractual term considerations.  The remaining contractual 
term of a loan is adjusted for expected prepayments and 
certain expected extensions, renewals, or modifications. We 
extend the contractual term when we are not able to 
unconditionally cancel contractual renewals or extension 
options. We also incorporate into our allowance for credit 
losses any scenarios where we reasonably expect to provide 
an extension through a TDR. 

•  Qualitative factors which may not be adequately captured in 
the loss models.  These amounts represent management’s 
judgment of risks inherent in the processes and assumptions 
used in establishing the ACL. We also consider economic 
environmental factors, modeling assumptions and 
performance, process risk, and other subjective factors, 
including industry trends and emerging risk assessments. 

Sensitivity  The ACL for loans is sensitive to changes in key 
assumptions which requires significant judgment to be used by 
management. Future amounts of the ACL for loans will be based 
on a variety of factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio 
credit quality, and general economic conditions. General 
economic conditions are forecasted using economic variables, 
which could have varying impacts on different financial assets or 
portfolios. Additionally, throughout numerous credit cycles, there 
are observed changes in economic variables such as the 
unemployment rate, GDP and real estate prices which may not 
move in a correlated manner as variables may move in opposite 
directions or differ across portfolios or geography.

Current Accounting Developments 

Table 42 provides the significant accounting updates applicable to 
us that have been issued by the Financial Accounting Standards 
Board (FASB) but are not yet effective. 

Table 42:  Current Accounting Developments – Issued Standards 

Description 

Effective date and financial statement impact 

ASU 2018-12 – Financial Services – Insurance (Topic 944): 
Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts and subsequent related updates 

The Update requires all features in long-duration insurance 
contracts that meet the definition of a market risk benefit to 
be measured at fair value through earnings with changes in 
fair value attributable to our own credit risk recognized in 
other comprehensive income. Currently, two measurement 
models exist for these features, fair value and insurance 
accrual. The Update requires the use of a standardized 
discount rate and routine updates for insurance assumptions 
used in valuing the liability for future policy benefits for 
traditional long-duration contracts. The Update also simplifies 
the amortization of deferred acquisition costs. 

The guidance becomes effective on January 1, 2022. Certain of our variable annuity 
reinsurance products meet the definition of market risk benefits and will require the 
associated insurance related reserves for these products to be measured at fair value 
as of the earliest period presented, with the cumulative effect on fair value for 
changes attributable to our own credit risk recognized in the beginning balance of 
accumulated other comprehensive income. The cumulative effect of the difference 
between fair value and carrying value, excluding the effect of our own credit, will be 
recognized in the opening balance of retained earnings. As of June 30, 2020, we held 
$1.1 billion in insurance-related reserves of which $568 million was in scope of the 
Update. A total of $509 million was associated with products that meet the definition 
of market risk benefits, and of this amount, $52 million was measured at fair value 
under current accounting standards. The market risk benefits are largely indexed to 
U.S. equity and fixed income markets. Upon adoption, we may incur periodic earnings 
volatility from changes in the fair value of market risk benefits generally due to the 
long duration of these contracts. We plan to economically hedge this volatility, where 
feasible. The ultimate impact of these changes will depend on the composition of our 
market risk benefits portfolio at the date of adoption. Changes in the accounting for 
the liability of future policy benefits for traditional long-duration contracts and 
deferred acquisition costs will be applied to all outstanding long-duration contracts on 
the basis of their existing carrying amounts at the beginning of the earliest period 
presented, and are not expected to be material.

“outlook,” “forecast,” “will,” “may,” “could,” “should,” “can” and 
similar references to future periods. In particular, forward-looking 
statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make 
about: (i) the future operating or financial performance of the 
Company, including our outlook for future growth; (ii) our 
noninterest expense and efficiency ratio; (iii) future credit quality 
and performance, including our expectations regarding future 
loan losses, our allowance for credit losses, and the economic 
scenarios considered to develop the allowance; (iv) our 
expectations regarding net interest income and net interest 
margin; (v) loan growth or the reduction or mitigation of risk in 
our loan portfolios; (vi) future capital or liquidity levels, ratios or 
targets; (vii) the performance of our mortgage business and any 
related exposures; (viii) the expected outcome and impact of 
legal, regulatory and legislative developments, as well as our 
expectations regarding compliance therewith; (ix) future common 
stock dividends, common share repurchases and other uses of 
capital; (x) our targeted range for return on assets, return on 
equity, and return on tangible common equity; (xi) expectations 
regarding our effective income tax rate; (xii) the outcome of 
contingencies, such as legal proceedings; and (xiii) the Company’s 
plans, objectives and strategies. 

Forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts 

but instead represent our current expectations and assumptions 
regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. 
Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they 
are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in 
circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual results may 
differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-
looking statements. We caution you, therefore, against relying on 
any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither 
statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of 
future performance. While there is no assurance that any list of 
risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, important 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from 
those in the forward-looking statements include the following, 
without limitation: 
• 

current and future economic and market conditions, 
including the effects of declines in housing prices, high 
unemployment rates, U.S. fiscal debt, budget and tax 
matters, geopolitical matters, and any slowdown in global 
economic growth; 
the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, including on our credit 
quality and business operations, as well as its impact on 
general economic and financial market conditions; 
our capital and liquidity requirements (including under 
regulatory capital standards, such as the Basel III capital 
standards) and our ability to generate capital internally or 
raise capital on favorable terms; 
financial services reform and other current, pending or future 
legislation or regulation that could have a negative effect on 
our revenue and businesses, including the Dodd-Frank Act 
and other legislation and regulation relating to bank products 
and services;

• 

developments in our mortgage banking business, including 
the extent of the success of our mortgage loan modification 
efforts, the amount of mortgage loan repurchase demands 
that we receive, any negative effects relating to our 
mortgage servicing, loan modification or foreclosure 
practices, and the effects of regulatory or judicial 
requirements or guidance impacting our mortgage banking 
business and any changes in industry standards; 
our ability to realize any efficiency ratio or expense target as 
part of our expense management initiatives, including as a 
result of business and economic cyclicality, seasonality, 
changes in our business composition and operating 
environment, growth in our businesses and/or acquisitions, 
and unexpected expenses relating to, among other things, 
litigation and regulatory matters; 
the effect of the current interest rate environment or 
changes in interest rates or in the level or composition of our 
assets or liabilities on our net interest income, net interest 
margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing 
rights and mortgage loans held for sale; 
significant turbulence or a disruption in the capital or 
financial markets, which could result in, among other things, 
reduced investor demand for mortgage loans, a reduction in 
the availability of funding or increased funding costs, and 
declines in asset values and/or recognition of impairments of 
securities held in our debt securities and equity securities 
portfolios; 
the effect of a fall in stock market prices on our investment 
banking business and our fee income from our brokerage, 
asset and wealth management businesses; 
negative effects from the retail banking sales practices 
matter and from other instances where customers may have 
experienced financial harm, including on our legal, 
operational and compliance costs, our ability to engage in 
certain business activities or offer certain products or 
services, our ability to keep and attract customers, our ability 
to attract and retain qualified team members, and our 
reputation; 
resolution of regulatory matters, litigation, or other legal 
actions, which may result in, among other things, additional 
costs, fines, penalties, restrictions on our business activities, 
reputational harm, or other adverse consequences; 
a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or 
infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors or other 
service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks; 
the effect of changes in the level of checking or savings 
account deposits on our funding costs and net interest 
margin; 
fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board; 
changes to U.S. tax guidance and regulations, as well as the 
effect of discrete items on our effective income tax rate; 
our ability to develop and execute effective business plans 
and strategies; and 
the other risk factors and uncertainties described under “Risk 
Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year 
ended December 31, 2019, as supplemented by the “Risk 
Factors” section in this Report. 

In addition to the above factors, we also caution that the 
amount and timing of any future common stock dividends or 
repurchases will depend on the earnings, cash requirements and 
financial condition of the Company, market conditions, capital 

59 

 
Forward-Looking Statements (continued) 

requirements (including under Basel capital standards), common 
stock issuance requirements, applicable law and regulations 
(including federal securities laws and federal banking regulations), 
and other factors deemed relevant by the Company’s Board of 
Directors, and may be subject to regulatory approval or 
conditions. 

For more information about factors that could cause actual 

results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to our 
reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
including the discussion under “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report 
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as 
supplemented by the “Risk Factors” section in this Report, as filed 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available on its 
website at www.sec.gov1. 

Any forward-looking statement made by us speaks only as of 

the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause 
our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it 
is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no 
obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, 
whether as a result of new information, future developments or 
otherwise, except as may be required by law. 

Forward-looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures.  From time to 
time management may discuss forward-looking non-GAAP 
financial measures, such as forward-looking estimates or targets 
for return on average tangible common equity. We are unable to 
provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial 
measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial 
measures because we are unable to provide, without 
unreasonable effort, a meaningful or accurate calculation or 
estimation of amounts that would be necessary for the 
reconciliation due to the complexity and inherent difficulty in 
forecasting and quantifying future amounts or when they may 
occur. Such unavailable information could be significant to future 
results.

Moreover, the pandemic has created additional operational 

and compliance risks, including the need to quickly implement 
and execute new programs and procedures for the products and 
services we offer our customers, provide enhanced safety 
measures for our employees and customers, comply with rapidly 
changing regulatory requirements, address any increased risk of 
fraudulent activity, and protect the integrity and functionality of 
our systems and networks as a larger number of our employees 
work remotely. The pandemic could also result in or contribute to 
additional downgrades to our credit ratings or credit outlook. In 
response to the pandemic, we have suspended residential 
property foreclosure sales and evictions, and are offering fee 
waivers, payment deferrals, and other expanded assistance for 
credit card, automobile, mortgage, small business, personal and 
commercial lending customers, and future governmental actions 
may require these and other types of customer-related 
responses. In addition, we have reduced our common stock 
dividend and temporarily suspended share repurchases, and we 
could take, or be required to take, other capital actions in the 
future. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our 
business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as 
our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend on future 
developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be 
predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and 
actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties 
in response to the pandemic. 

Risk Factors 

An investment in the Company involves risk, including the 
possibility that the value of the investment could fall substantially 
and that dividends or other distributions on the investment could 
be reduced or eliminated. For a discussion of risk factors that 
could adversely affect our financial results and condition, and the 
value of, and return on, an investment in the Company, we refer 
you to the “Risk Factors” section in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

The following risk factor supplements the “Risk Factors” 

section in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our business 
and financial results, and the ultimate impact will depend on 
future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be 
predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic 
and actions taken by governmental authorities in response to 
the pandemic.  The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted 
the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, lowered 
equity market valuations, created significant volatility and 
disruption in financial markets, and increased unemployment 
levels. In addition, the pandemic has resulted in temporary 
closures of many businesses and the institution of social 
distancing and sheltering in place requirements in many states 
and communities. As a result, the demand for our products and 
services may continue to be significantly impacted, which could 
adversely affect our revenue. Furthermore, the pandemic could 
continue to result in the recognition of credit losses in our loan 
portfolios and increases in our allowance for credit losses, 
particularly if businesses remain closed, the impact on the global 
economy worsens, or more customers draw on their lines of 
credit or seek additional loans to help finance their businesses. 
Similarly, because of changing economic and market conditions 
affecting issuers, we may be required to recognize further 
impairments on the securities we hold, as well as reductions in 
other comprehensive income. Moreover, the persistence of 
adverse economic conditions and reduced revenue may adversely 
affect the fair value of our operating segments and underlying 
reporting units which may result in goodwill impairment. Our 
business operations may be further disrupted if significant 
portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including 
because of illness, quarantines, government actions, or other 
restrictions in connection with the pandemic, and we have already 
temporarily closed certain of our branches and offices.

Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Company’s management evaluated the effectiveness, as of June 30, 2020, of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. The 
Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer participated in the evaluation. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s chief 
executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of 
June 30, 2020. 

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process 
designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company’s 
Board, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the 
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and 
includes those policies and procedures that: 

• 

• 

• 

pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of 
assets of the Company; 
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations 
of management and directors of the Company; and 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the 
Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections 
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. No change occurred during second quarter 
2020 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Prior to our adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (CECL), on 
January 1, 2020, provision for credit losses from debt securities was not applicable and is therefore presented as $0 for both the second quarter and first half of 2019. For more information, see 
Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
In second quarter 2020, insurance income was reclassified to other noninterest income, personnel-related expenses were combined into a single line item, and expenses for cloud computing services 
were reclassified from contract services expense (within other noninterest expense) to technology and equipment expense. Prior period balances have been revised to conform with the current 
period presentation. 
In second quarter 2020, diluted earnings per common share equaled earnings per common share because our securities convertible into common shares had an anti-dilutive effect. 

The accompanying notes are an integral part of these statements.

Prior to our adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, the allowance for credit losses (ACL) related to available-for-sale (AFS) and held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities was not applicable and is 
therefore presented as $0 at December 31, 2019. For more information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
Parenthetical amounts represent assets and liabilities that we are required to carry at fair value or for which we have elected the fair value option. 

(2) 
(3)  Our consolidated assets at June 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, include the following assets of certain variable interest entities (VIEs) that can only be used to settle the liabilities of those VIEs: 
Cash and due from banks, $26 million and $16 million; Interest-earning deposits with banks, $0 million and $284 million; Debt securities, $555 million and $540 million; Net loans, $11.6 billion and 
$13.2 billion; Derivative assets, $1 million and $1 million; Equity securities, $71 million and $118 million; Other assets, $215 million and $239 million; and Total assets, $12.4 billion and $14.4 billion, 
respectively. 

(4)  Our consolidated liabilities at June 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, include the following VIE liabilities for which the VIE creditors do not have recourse to Wells Fargo: Short-term borrowings, 

$300 million and $401 million; Derivative liabilities, $1 million and $3 million; Accrued expenses and other liabilities, $212 million and $235 million; Long-term debt, $225 million and $587 million; 
and Total liabilities, $738 million and $1.2 billion, respectively.

Note 1:  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Wells Fargo & Company is a diversified financial services company. 
We provide banking, trust and investments, mortgage banking, 
investment banking, retail banking, brokerage, and consumer and 
commercial finance through banking locations, the internet and 
other distribution channels to consumers, businesses and 
institutions in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and in 
foreign countries. When we refer to “Wells Fargo,” “the Company,” 
“we,” “our” or “us,” we mean Wells Fargo & Company and 
Subsidiaries (consolidated). Wells Fargo & Company (the Parent) 
is a financial holding company and a bank holding company. We 
also hold a majority interest in a real estate investment trust, 
which has publicly traded preferred stock outstanding. 

Our accounting and reporting policies conform with U.S. 
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and practices in 
the financial services industry. For discussion of our significant 
accounting policies, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 
year ended December 31, 2019 (2019 Form 10-K). 

To prepare the financial statements in conformity with GAAP, 
management must make estimates based on assumptions about 
future economic and market conditions (for example, 
unemployment, market liquidity, real estate prices, etc.) that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of 
the financial statements, income and expenses during the 
reporting period and the related disclosures. Although our 
estimates contemplate current conditions and how we expect 
them to change in the future, it is reasonably possible that actual 
conditions could be worse than anticipated in those estimates, 
which could materially affect our results of operations and 
financial condition. Management has made significant estimates 
in several areas, including: 
• 

allowance for credit losses (Note 6 (Loans and Related 
Allowance for Credit Losses); 
valuations of residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) 
(Note 10 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) and 
Note 11 (Mortgage Banking Activities)); 
valuations of financial instruments (Note 15 (Derivatives) 
and Note 16 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities)); 
liabilities for contingent litigation losses (Note 14 (Legal 
Actions)); and 
income taxes. 

• 

• 

• 

• 

Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

These unaudited interim financial statements reflect all 
adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary 
for a fair statement of the results for the periods presented. 
These adjustments are of a normal recurring nature, unless 
otherwise disclosed in this Form 10-Q. The results of operations 
in the interim financial statements do not necessarily indicate the 
results that may be expected for the full year. The interim 
financial information should be read in conjunction with our 2019 
Form 10-K. 

Accounting Standards Adopted in 2020 
In 2020, we adopted the following new accounting guidance: 
• 

Accounting Standards Update (ASU or Update) 2020-04 – 
Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects 
of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

ASU 2019-04 – Codification Improvements to Topic 326, 
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives 
and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments. This 
Update includes guidance on recoveries of financial assets, 
which is included in the discussion for ASU 2016-13 below. 
ASU 2018-17 – Consolidation (Topic 810): Targeted 
Improvements to Related Party Guidance for Variable Interest 
Entities 
ASU 2018-15 – Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Internal-
Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for 
Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing 
Arrangement That Is a Service Contract (a consensus of the 
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues 
Task Force) 
ASU 2018-13 – Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): 
Disclosure Framework – Changes to the Disclosure 
Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. 
ASU 2017-04 – Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): 
Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment 
ASU 2016-13 – Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 
326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments 
and related subsequent Updates 

ASU 2020-04 provides optional, temporary relief to ease the 
burden of accounting for reference rate reform activities that 
affect contractual modifications of floating rate financial 
instruments indexed to interbank offering rates (IBORs) and 
hedge accounting relationships. Modifications of qualifying 
contracts are accounted for as the continuation of an existing 
contract rather than as a new contract. Modifications of 
qualifying hedging relationships will not require discontinuation 
of the existing hedge accounting relationships. The application of 
the relief for qualifying existing hedging relationships may be 
made on a hedge-by-hedge basis and across multiple reporting 
periods. 

We adopted ASU 2020-04 on April 1, 2020, and the guidance 

will be followed until the Update terminates on December 31, 
2022. This guidance is applied on a prospective basis. The Update 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial 
statements in second quarter 2020. 

ASU 2018-17 updates the guidance used by decision-makers of 
VIEs. Indirect interests held through related parties in common 
control arrangements will be considered on a proportional basis 
for determining whether fees paid to decision-makers and service 
providers are variable interests. This is consistent with how 
indirect interests held through related parties under common 
control are considered for determining whether a reporting entity 
must consolidate a VIE. The Update did not have a material 
impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

ASU 2018-15 clarifies the accounting for implementation costs 
related to a cloud computing arrangement that is a service 
contract and enhances disclosures around implementation costs 
for internal-use software and cloud computing arrangements. 
The guidance aligns the requirements for capitalizing 
implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a 
service contract with the requirements for capitalizing 
implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use 

71 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Note 1:  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use 
software license). It also requires the expense related to the 
capitalized implementation costs be presented in the same line 
item in the statement of income as the fees associated with the 
hosting element of the arrangement and capitalized 
implementation costs be presented in the balance sheet in the 
same line item that a prepayment for the fees of the associated 
hosting arrangement are presented. The Update did not have a 
material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

ASU 2018-13 clarifies, eliminates and adds certain fair value 
measurement disclosure requirements for assets and liabilities, 
which affects our disclosures in Note 16 (Fair Values of Assets and 
Liabilities). Although the ASU became effective on 
January 1, 2020, it permitted early adoption of individual 
requirements without causing others to be early adopted and, as 
such, we partially adopted the Update during third quarter 2018 
and the remainder of the requirements in first quarter 2020. The 
Update did not have a material impact on our consolidated 
financial statements. 

ASU 2017-04 simplifies the goodwill impairment test by 
eliminating the requirement to assign the fair value of a reporting 
unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any 
unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been 
acquired in a business combination. The Update requires that a 
goodwill impairment loss is recognized if the fair value of the 
reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, including goodwill. 
The goodwill impairment loss is limited to the amount of goodwill 
allocated to the reporting unit. The guidance did not change the 
qualitative assessment of goodwill. This guidance is applied on a 
prospective basis, and accordingly, the Update did not have a 
material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

ASU 2016-13 changes the accounting for the measurement of 
credit losses on loans and debt securities. For loans and held-to-
maturity (HTM) debt securities, the Update requires a current 
expected credit loss (CECL) measurement to estimate the 
allowance for credit losses (ACL) for the remaining contractual 
term, adjusted for prepayments, of the financial asset (including 
off-balance sheet credit exposures) using historical experience, 
current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. 
Also, the Update eliminates the existing guidance for purchased 
credit-impaired (PCI) loans, but requires an allowance for 
purchased financial assets with more than an insignificant 
deterioration of credit since origination. In addition, the Update 
modifies the other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) model for 
available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities to require an allowance for 
credit impairment instead of a direct write-down, which allows for 
reversal of credit impairments in future periods based on 
improvements in credit. Upon adoption, we recognized an overall 
decrease in our ACL of approximately $1.3 billion (pre-tax) as a 
cumulative effect adjustment from a change in accounting 
policies, which increased our retained earnings and regulatory 
capital amounts and ratios. Loans previously classified as PCI were 
automatically transitioned to purchased credit-deteriorated 
(PCD) classification. We recognized an ACL for these new PCD 
loans and made a corresponding adjustment to the loan balance, 
with no impact to net income or transition adjustment to 
retained earnings. For more information on the impact of CECL by 
type of financial asset, see Table 1.1 below.

The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not result in a change to 
accounting policies, except as noted herein. Our accounting policy 
for the ACL was updated and is now inclusive of loans, debt 
securities and other financing receivables. Other than the ACL and 
the elimination of PCI loans, there were no changes to accounting 
policies for loans as described in the 2019 Form 10-K. For debt 
securities, other than the policies with respect to the ACL, all of 
the current accounting policies, including those that changed as a 

72 

result of CECL adoption, are included below under Debt 
Securities. 

  
 
Debt Securities 
Our investments in debt securities that are not held for trading 
purposes are classified as either debt securities available-for-sale 
(AFS) or held-to-maturity (HTM). 

Investments in debt securities for which the Company does 

not have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are 
classified as AFS. AFS debt securities are measured at fair value, 
with unrealized gains and losses reported in cumulative other 
comprehensive income (OCI), net of the allowance for credit 
losses and applicable income taxes. Investments in debt securities 
for which the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold 
to maturity are classified as HTM. HTM debt securities are 
measured at amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses. 

INTEREST INCOME AND GAIN/LOSS RECOGNITION  Unamortized 
premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income over 
the contractual life of the security using the effective interest 
method, except for purchased callable debt securities carried at a 
premium. For purchased callable debt securities carried at a 
premium, the premium is amortized into interest income to the 
earliest call date using the effective interest method. As principal 
repayments are received on securities (e.g., mortgage-backed 
securities (MBS)), a proportionate amount of the related 
premium or discount is recognized in income so that the effective 
interest rate on the remaining portion of the security continues 
unchanged. 

We recognize realized gains and losses on the sale of debt 

securities in net gains (losses) on debt securities within 
noninterest income using the specific identification method. 

IMPAIRMENT AND CREDIT LOSSES  Unrealized losses of AFS debt 
securities are driven by a number of factors, including changes in 
interest rates and credit spreads which impact most types of debt 
securities with additional considerations for certain types of debt 
securities: 
•  Debt securities of U.S. Treasury and federal agencies, 

including federal agency MBS, are not impacted by credit 
movements given the explicit or implicit guarantees provided 
by the U.S. government. 

•  Debt securities of U.S. states and political subdivisions are 
most impacted by changes in the relationship between 
municipal and term funding credit curves rather than by 
changes in the credit quality of the underlying securities. 
Structured securities, such as MBS and collateralized loan 
obligations (CLO), are also impacted by changes in projected 
collateral losses of assets underlying the security. 

• 

For debt securities where fair value is less than amortized 
cost basis, we recognize impairment in earnings if we have the 
intent to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that we 
will be required to sell the security before recovery of its 
amortized cost basis. Impairment is recognized equal to the 
entire difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair 
value of the security and is classified as net gains (losses) from 
debt securities within noninterest income. Following the 
recognition of impairment, the security’s new amortized cost 
basis is the previous basis less impairment. 

For debt securities where fair value is less than amortized 
cost basis where we did not recognize impairment in earnings, we 
set up an allowance for credit losses as of the balance sheet date. 
See “Allowance for Credit Losses” section in this Note. 

TRANSFERS BETWEEN CATEGORIES OF DEBT SECURITIES  AFS debt 
securities transferred to the HTM classification are recorded at 
fair value and the unrealized gains or losses resulting from the 
transfer of these securities continue to be reported in cumulative 

OCI. The cumulative OCI balance is amortized into earnings over 
the same period as the unamortized premiums and discounts 
using the effective interest method. Any allowance for credit 
losses previously recorded under the AFS model on securities 
transferred to HTM is reversed and an allowance for credit losses 
is subsequently recorded under the HTM debt security model. 

NONACCRUAL AND PAST DUE, AND CHARGE-OFF POLICIES  We 
generally place debt securities on nonaccrual status using factors 
similar to those described for loans. When we place a debt 
security on nonaccrual status, we reverse the accrued unpaid 
interest receivable against interest income and suspend the 
amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. If the 
ultimate collectability of the principal is in doubt on a nonaccrual 
debt security, any cash collected is first applied to reduce the 
security’s amortized cost basis to zero, followed by recovery of 
amounts previously charged off, and subsequently to interest 
income. Generally, we return a debt security to accrual status 
when all delinquent interest and principal become current under 
the contractual terms of the security and collectability of 
remaining principal and interest is no longer doubtful. 
Our debt securities are considered past due when 

contractually required principal or interest payments have not 
been made on the due dates. 

Our charge-off policy for debt securities are similar to those 
described for loans. Subsequent to charge-off, the debt security 
will be designated as nonaccrual and follow the process described 
above for any cash received. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 
The ACL is management’s estimate of the current expected credit 
losses in the loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments, at 
the balance sheet date, excluding loans and unfunded credit 
commitments carried at fair value or held for sale. Additionally, we 
maintain an ACL on AFS and HTM debt securities, other financing 
receivables measured at amortized cost, and other off-balance 
sheet credit exposures. While we attribute portions of the 
allowance to specific financial asset classes (loan and debt 
security portfolios), loan portfolio segments (commercial and 
consumer) or major security type, the entire ACL is available to 
absorb credit losses of the Company. 

Our ACL process involves procedures to appropriately 

consider the unique risk characteristics of our financial asset 
classes, portfolio segments, and major security types. For each 
loan portfolio segment and each major HTM debt security type, 
losses are estimated collectively for groups of loans or securities 
with similar risk characteristics. For loans and securities that do 
not share similar risk characteristics with other financial assets, 
the losses are estimated individually, which primarily includes our 
impaired large commercial loans and non-accruing HTM debt 
securities. For AFS debt securities, losses are estimated at the 
tax-lot level. 

Our ACL amounts are influenced by a variety of factors, 

including changes in loan and debt security volumes, portfolio 
credit quality, and general economic conditions. General 
economic conditions are forecasted using economic variables 
which will create volatility as those variables change over time. 
See Table 1.2 for key economic variables used for our loan 
portfolios.

Our approach for estimating expected life-time credit losses 

for loans and debt securities includes the following key 
components: 
• 

An initial loss forecast period of one year for all portfolio 
segments and classes of financing receivables and off-
balance-sheet credit exposures. This period reflects 
management’s expectation of losses based on forward-
looking economic scenarios over that time. 
A historical loss forecast period covering the remaining 
contractual term, adjusted for expected prepayments and 
certain expected extensions, renewals, or modifications, by 
portfolio segment and class of financing receivables based on 
the changes in key historical economic variables during 
representative historical expansionary and recessionary 
periods. 
A reversion period of up to two years to connect the losses 
estimated for our initial loss forecast period to the period of 
our historical loss forecast based on economic conditions at 
the measurement date. Our reversion methodology 
considers the type of portfolio, point in the credit cycle, 
expected length of recessions and recoveries, as well as other 
relevant factors. 
Utilization of discounted cash flow (DCF) methods to 
measure credit impairment for loans modified in a troubled 
debt restructuring, unless they are collateral dependent and 
measured at the fair value of the collateral. The DCF methods 
obtain estimated life-time credit losses using the initial and 
historical mean loss forecast periods described above. 
For AFS debt securities and certain beneficial interests 
classified as HTM, we utilize the DCF methods to measure 
the ACL, which incorporate expected credit losses using the 
conceptual components described above. The ACL on AFS 
debt securities is subject to a limitation based on the fair 
value of the debt securities (fair value floor). 

• 

• 

• 

• 

The ACL for financial assets held at amortized cost and AFS 
debt securities will be reversible with immediate recognition of 
recovery in earnings if credit improves. The ACL for financial 
assets held at amortized cost is a valuation account that is 
deducted from, or added to, the amortized cost basis of the 
financial assets to present the net amount expected to be 
collected, which can include a negative allowance limited to the 
cumulative amounts previously charged off. For financial assets 
with an ACL estimated using DCF methods, changes in the ACL 
due to the passage of time are recorded in interest income. The 
ACL for AFS debt securities reflects the amount of unrealized loss 
related to expected credit losses, limited by the amount that fair 
value is less than the amortized cost basis, and cannot have an 
associated negative allowance. 

For certain financial assets, such as residential real estate 

loans guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage 
Association (GNMA), an agency of the federal government, U. S. 
Treasury and Agency mortgage backed debt securities, as well as 
certain sovereign debt securities, the Company has not 

74 

recognized an ACL as our expectation of nonpayment of the 
amortized cost basis, based on historical losses, adjusted for 
current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts, is 
zero. 

A financial asset is collateral-dependent when the borrower is 

experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be 
provided substantially through the sale or operation of the 
collateral. When a collateral-dependent financial asset is probable 
of foreclosure, we will measure the ACL based on the fair value of 
the collateral. If we intend to sell the underlying collateral, we will 
measure the ACL based on the collateral’s net realizable value (fair 
value of collateral, less estimated costs to sell). In most situations, 
based on our charge-off policies, we will immediately write-down 
the financial asset to the fair value of the collateral or net 
realizable value. For consumer loans, collateral-dependent 
financial assets may have collateral in the form of residential real 
estate, automobiles or other personal assets. For commercial 
loans, collateral-dependent financial assets may have collateral in 
the form of commercial real estate or other business assets. 
We do not generally record an ACL for accrued interest 

receivables because uncollectible accrued interest is reversed 
through interest income in a timely manner in line with our non-
accrual and past due policies for loans and debt securities. For 
consumer credit card and certain consumer lines of credit, we 
include an ACL for accrued interest and fees since these loans are 
not placed on nonaccrual status and written off until the loan is 
180 days past due. Accrued interest receivables are included in 
other assets, except for certain revolving loans, such as credit card 
loans. 

COMMERCIAL LOAN PORTFOLIO SEGMENT ACL METHODOLOGY 
Generally, commercial loans, which include net investments in 
lease financing, are assessed for estimated losses by grading each 
loan using various risk factors as identified through periodic 
reviews. Our estimation approach for the commercial portfolio 
reflects the estimated probability of default in accordance with 
the borrower’s financial strength and the severity of loss in the 
event of default, considering the quality of any underlying 
collateral. Probability of default and severity at the time of 
default are statistically derived through historical observations of 
default and losses after default within each credit risk rating. 
These estimates are adjusted as appropriate based on additional 
analysis of long-term average loss experience compared with 
previously forecasted losses, external loss data or other risks 
identified from current economic conditions and credit quality 
trends. The estimated probability of default and severity at the 
time of default are applied to loan equivalent exposures to 
estimate losses for unfunded credit commitments. 

CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIO SEGMENT ACL METHODOLOGY  For 
consumer loans, we determine the allowance at the individual 
loan level. When developing historical loss experience, we pool 
loans, generally by product types with similar risk characteristics, 
such as residential real estate mortgages and credit cards. As 

  
 
 
  
 
appropriate and to achieve greater accuracy, we may further 
stratify selected portfolios by sub-product, origination channel, 
vintage, loss type, geographic location and other predictive 
characteristics. We use pooled loan data such as historic 
delinquency and default and loss severity in the development of 
our consumer loan models, in addition to home price trends, 
unemployment trends, and other economic variables that may 
influence the frequency and severity of losses in the consumer 
portfolio. 

AFS PORTFOLIO ACL METHODOLOGY  We develop our ACL estimate 
for AFS debt securities by utilizing a security-level multi-scenario, 
probability-weighted discounted cash flow model based on a 
combination of past events, current conditions, as well as 
reasonable and supportable forecasts. The projected cash flows 
are discounted at the security’s effective interest rate, except for 
certain variable rate securities which are discounted using 
projections of future changes in interest rates, prepayable 
securities which are adjusted for estimated prepayments, and 
securities part of a fair value hedge which use hedge-adjusted 
assumptions. The ACL on an AFS debt security is limited to the 
difference between its amortized cost basis and fair value (fair 
value floor) and reversals of the allowance are permitted up to the 
amount previously recorded. 

HTM PORTFOLIO ACL METHODOLOGY  For most HTM debt 
securities, the ACL is measured using an expected loss model, 
similar to the methodology used for loans. Unlike AFS debt 
securities, the ACL on an HTM debt security is not limited to the 
fair value floor. 

Certain beneficial interests categorized as HTM debt 

securities utilize a similar discounted cash flow model as 
described for AFS debt securities, without the limitation of the 
fair value floor. 

OTHER QUALITATIVE FACTORS  The ACL includes amounts for 
qualitative factors which may not be adequately reflected in our 
loss models. These amounts represent management’s judgment 
of risks in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the 
ACL. Generally, these amounts are established at a granular level 
below our loan portfolio segments. We also consider economic 
environmental factors, modeling assumptions and performance, 
process risk, and other subjective factors, including industry 
trends and emerging risk assessments. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET CREDIT EXPOSURES  Our off-balance sheet 
credit exposures include unfunded loan commitments (generally 
in the form of revolving lines of credit), financial guarantees not 
accounted for as insurance contracts or derivatives, including 
standby letters of credit, and other similar instruments. For off-
balance sheet credit exposures, we recognize an ACL associated 
with the unfunded amounts. We do not recognize an ACL for 
commitments that are unconditionally cancelable at our 
discretion. Additionally, we recognize an ACL for financial 
guarantees that create off-balance sheet credit exposure, such as 
loans sold with credit recourse and factoring guarantees. ACL for 
off-balance sheet credit exposures are reported as a liability in 
accrued expenses and other liabilities on our consolidated balance 
sheet. 

OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS  Other financial assets are evaluated for 
expected credit losses. These other financial assets include 
accounts receivable for fees, receivables from government-
sponsored entities, such as Federal National Mortgage 
Association (FNMA) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage 

Corporation (FHLMC), and GNMA, and other accounts receivable 
from high-credit quality counterparties, such as central clearing 
counterparties. Many of these financial assets are generally not 
expected to have an ACL as there is a zero loss expectation (for 
example, government guarantee) or no historical credit losses. 
Some financial assets, such as loans to employees, maintain an 
ACL that is presented on a net basis with the related amortized 
cost amounts in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet. 
Given the nature of these financial assets, provision for credit 
losses is not recognized separately from the regular income or 
expense associated with these financial assets. 

Securities purchased under resale agreements are generally 
over-collateralized by securities or cash and are generally short-
term in nature. We have elected the practical expedient for these 
financial assets given collateral maintenance provisions. These 
provisions require that we monitor the collateral value and 
customers are required to replenish collateral, if needed. 
Accordingly, we generally do not maintain an ACL for these 
financial assets. 

PURCHASED CREDIT DETERIORATED FINANCIAL ASSETS  Financial 
assets acquired that are of poor credit quality and with more than 
an insignificant evidence of credit deterioration since their 
origination or issuance are PCD assets. PCD assets are recorded 
at their purchase price plus an ACL estimated at the time of 
acquisition. Under this approach, there is no provision for credit 
losses recognized at acquisition; rather, there is a gross-up of the 
purchase price of the financial asset for the estimate of expected 
credit losses and a corresponding ACL recorded. Changes in 
estimates of expected credit losses after acquisition are 
recognized as provision for credit losses (or reversal of provision 
for credit losses) in subsequent periods. In general, interest 
income recognition for PCD financial assets is consistent with 
interest income recognition for the similar non-PCD financial 
asset. 

Troubled Debt Restructuring and Other Relief Related to 
COVID-19 
On March 25, 2020, the U.S. Senate approved the Coronavirus, 
Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act) providing 
optional, temporary relief from accounting for certain loan 
modifications as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). Under the 
CARES Act, TDR relief is available to banks for loan modifications 
related to the adverse effects of Coronavirus Disease 2019 
(COVID-19) (COVID-related modifications) granted to borrowers 
that are current as of December 31, 2019. TDR relief applies to 
COVID-related modifications made from March 1, 2020, until the 
earlier of December 31, 2020, or 60 days following the 
termination of the national emergency declared by the President 
of the United States. In first quarter 2020, we elected to apply 
the TDR relief provided by the CARES Act. 

On April 7, 2020, federal banking regulators issued the 
Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for 
Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the 
Coronavirus (Revised) (the Interagency Statement). The guidance 
in the Interagency Statement provides additional TDR relief as it 
clarifies that it is not necessary to consider the impact of the 
COVID-19 pandemic on the financial condition of a borrower in 
connection with a short-term (e.g., six months or less) COVID-
related modification provided the borrower is current at the date 
the modification program is implemented. 

For COVID-related modifications in the form of payment 
deferrals, delinquency status will not advance and loans that were 
accruing at the time the relief is provided will generally not be 
placed on nonaccrual status during the deferral period. COVID-

75 

  
 
Note 1:  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

related modifications that do not meet the provisions of the 
CARES Act or the Interagency Statement will be assessed for TDR 
classification. 

On April 10, 2020, the FASB Staff issued Accounting for Lease 

Concessions Related to the Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic, a 
question and answer guide. The guide provided an election for 
leases accounted for under Accounting Standards Codification 
(ASC) 842, Leases, that were modified due to COVID-19 and met 
certain criteria in order to not require a new lease classification 
test upon modification. In second quarter 2020, we elected to 
apply the lease modification relief provided by the guide. 

Share Repurchases 
During the first quarter of 2020 and 2019, we repurchased shares 
of our common stock under Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plans. On 
March 15, 2020, we, along with the other members of the 
Financial Services Forum, suspended our share repurchase 
activities for the remainder of the first quarter and for second 
quarter 2020. On June 25, 2020, the Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System (FRB) announced that it was prohibiting 
large bank holding companies (BHCs) subject to the FRB’s capital 

Table 1.3:  Supplemental Cash Flow Information 

plan rule, including Wells Fargo, from making any capital 
distribution (excluding any capital distribution arising from the 
issuance of a capital instrument eligible for inclusion in the 
numerator of a regulatory capital ratio), unless otherwise 
approved by the FRB. Through the end of third quarter 2020, the 
FRB is authorizing each BHC to (i) make share repurchases 
relating to issuances of common stock related to employee stock 
ownership plans; (ii) provided that the BHC does not increase the 
amount of its common stock dividends, pay common stock 
dividends that do not exceed an amount equal to the average of 
the BHC’s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters, 
unless otherwise specified by the FRB; and (iii) make scheduled 
payments on additional tier 1 and tier 2 capital instruments. 
These provisions may be extended by the FRB quarter-by-
quarter. For more information about share repurchases, see 
Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in our 2019 
Form 10-K.

Effective March 26, 2020, the FRB reduced reserve requirement ratios to 0%. The 
amount for December 31, 2019 represents an average for the year ended December 31, 
2019. 

Federal laws and regulations limit the dividends that a 
national bank may pay. Our national bank subsidiaries could 
have declared additional dividends of $1.0 billion at June 30, 
2020, without obtaining prior regulatory approval. We have 
elected to retain higher capital at our national bank subsidiaries 
in order to meet internal capital policy minimums and 
regulatory requirements. Our nonbank subsidiaries are also 
limited by certain federal and state statutory provisions and 
regulations covering the amount of dividends that may be paid 
in any given year. In addition, under a Support Agreement dated 
June 28, 2017, as amended and restated on June 26, 2019, 
among Wells Fargo & Company, the parent holding company 
(the “Parent”), WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding 
company and subsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), Wells Fargo 
Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Wells Fargo Clearing 
Services, LLC, and certain other direct and indirect subsidiaries 
of the Parent designated as material entities for resolution 
planning purposes or identified as related support entities in our 
resolution plan, the IHC may be restricted from making dividend 
payments to the Parent if certain liquidity and/or capital metrics 
fall below defined triggers or if the Parent’s board of directors 
authorizes it to file a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
Based on retained earnings at June 30, 2020, our nonbank 
subsidiaries could have declared additional dividends of 
$26.5 billion at June 30, 2020, without obtaining prior 
regulatory approval. For additional information see Note 3 
(Cash, Loan and Dividend Restrictions) in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

The FRB’s Capital Plan Rule (codified at 12 CFR 225.8 of 

Regulation Y) establishes capital planning and other 
requirements that govern capital distributions including 
dividends by certain large bank holding companies. The FRB has 
also published guidance regarding its supervisory expectations 
for capital planning, including capital policies regarding the 
process relating to common stock dividend and repurchase 
decisions in the FRB’s SR Letter 15-18. The Parent’s ability to 
make certain capital distributions is subject to review by the FRB 
as part of the Parent’s capital plan in connection with the FRB’s 
annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). Once 
the FRB’s stress capital buffer requirement becomes effective on 
October 1, 2020, the Parent’s ability to take certain capital 
actions will be subject to the Parent meeting or exceeding certain 
regulatory capital minimums, which include the stress capital 
buffer established by the FRB as part of the FRB’s annual 
supervisory stress test and related CCAR. 

On July 28, 2020, the Company reduced its third quarter 

2020 common stock dividend to $0.10 per share. 

On June 25, 2020, the FRB announced that it is requiring 

large BHCs, including Wells Fargo, to update and resubmit their 
capital plans within 45 days after the FRB provides updated 
scenarios. Requiring resubmission will prohibit each BHC from 
making any capital distribution (excluding any capital distribution 
arising from the issuance of a capital instrument eligible for 
inclusion in the numerator of a regulatory capital ratio), unless 
otherwise approved by the FRB. Through the end of third quarter 
2020, the FRB is authorizing each BHC to (i) make share 
repurchases relating to issuances of common stock related to 
employee stock ownership plans; (ii) provided that the BHC does 
not increase the amount of its common stock dividends, pay 
common stock dividends that do not exceed an amount equal to 
the average of the BHC’s net income for the four preceding 
calendar quarters, unless otherwise specified by the FRB; and (iii) 
make scheduled payments on additional tier 1 and tier 2 capital 
instruments. These provisions may be extended by the FRB 
quarter-by-quarter.

Note 5:  Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities 

Table 5.1 provides the amortized cost, net of the allowance for 
credit losses, and fair value by major categories of available-for-
sale debt securities, which are carried at fair value, and held-to-
maturity debt securities, which are carried at amortized cost, net 
of allowance for credit losses. The net unrealized gains (losses) for 
available-for-sale debt securities are reported as a component of 
cumulative OCI, net of the allowance for credit losses and 
applicable income taxes. Information on debt securities held for 
trading is included in Note 4 (Trading Activities). 

Outstanding balances exclude accrued interest receivable on 
available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities which are 
included in other assets. During the first half of 2020, we reversed 
accrued interest receivable on our available-for-sale and held-to-
maturity debt securities by reversing interest income of 
$6 million. See Note 9 (Other Assets) for additional information 
on accrued interest receivable.

Represents amortized cost of the securities, net of the allowance for credit losses of $114 million related to available-for-sale debt securities and $20 million related to held-to-maturity debt 
securities at June 30, 2020. Prior to our adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, the allowance for credit losses related to available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities was not applicable and 
is therefore presented as $0 at December 31, 2019. For more information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). 
Includes investments in tax-exempt preferred debt securities issued by investment funds or trusts that predominantly invest in tax-exempt municipal securities. The amortized cost net of allowance 
for credit losses and fair value of these types of securities was $5.8 billion at both June 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019. 
Predominantly consists of federal agency mortgage-backed securities at both June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

(4)  We held available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities from Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) that each exceeded 

10% of stockholders’ equity, with an amortized cost of $93.6 billion and $80.1 billion and a fair value of $98.1 billion and $83.8 billion at June 30, 2020 and an amortized cost of $98.5 billion and 
$84.1 billion and a fair value of $100.3 billion and $85.5 billion at December 31, 2019, respectively.

Total interest income from debt securities excludes interest income from trading debt securities, which is disclosed in Note 4 (Trading Activities). 
Prior to our adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, the provision for credit losses from debt securities was not applicable and is therefore presented as $0 for the prior period. For more information, 
see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). 
Realized gains and losses relate to available-for-sale debt securities. There were no realized gains or losses from held-to-maturity debt securities in all periods presented. 
For the second quarter and first half of 2020, credit-related impairment recognized in earnings is classified as provision for credit losses due to our adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020. For more 
information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). 

Credit Quality 
We monitor credit quality of debt securities by evaluating various 
attributes and utilize such information in our evaluation of the 
appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses. The credit 
quality indicators that we most closely monitor include credit 
ratings and delinquency status and are based on information as of 
our financial statement date. 

CREDIT RATINGS  Credit ratings express opinions about the credit 
quality of a debt security. We determine the credit rating of a 
security according to the lowest credit rating made available by 
national recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSRO). 
Debt securities rated investment grade, that is those with ratings 

80 

similar to BBB-/Baa3 or above, as defined by NRSRO, are 
generally considered by the rating agencies and market 
participants to be low credit risk. Conversely, debt securities rated 
below investment grade, labeled as “speculative grade” by the 
rating agencies, are considered to be distinctively higher credit 
risk than investment grade debt securities. 

For debt securities not rated by the NRSRO, we determine an 

internal credit grade of the debt securities (used for credit risk 
management purposes) equivalent to the credit ratings assigned 
by major credit agencies. The fair value of available-for-sale debt 
securities categorized as investment grade based on internal 
credit grades was $1.3 billion at June 30, 2020, and $2.2 billion at 
December 31, 2019. Held-to-maturity debt securities 

  
 
  
 
 
 
categorized as investment grade based on internal credit grades 
are not significant. If an internal credit grade was not assigned, we 
categorized the debt security as non-investment grade.

sale debt securities and amortized cost of held-to-maturity debt

DELINQUENCY STATUS AND NONACCRUAL DEBT SECURITIES  Debt 
security issuers that are delinquent in payment of amounts due 
under contractual debt agreements have a higher probability of 
recognition of credit losses. As such, as part of our monitoring of 
the credit quality of the debt security portfolio, we consider 
whether debt securities we own are past due in payment of 
principal or interest payments and whether any securities have 
been placed into nonaccrual status. 

We had no debt securities that were past due and still 

accruing at June 30, 2020 or December 31, 2019. The fair value of 
available-for-sale debt securities in nonaccrual status was 
$153 million and $110 million as of June 30, 2020, and 

December 31, 2019, respectively. There were no held-to-maturity 
debt securities in nonaccrual status as of June 30, 2020, or 
December 31, 2019. Purchased debt securities with credit 
deterioration (PCD) are not considered to be in nonaccrual status, 
as payments from issuers of these securities remain current. 

Table 5.5 presents detail of available-for-sale debt securities 
purchased with credit deterioration during the period. There were 
no available-for-sale debt securities purchased with credit 
deterioration during second quarter 2020. There were no held-
to-maturity debt securities purchased with credit deterioration 
during the second quarter and first half of 2020. The amounts 
presented are as of the date of the PCD assets were purchased.

Table 5.6 shows the gross unrealized losses and fair value of 
available-for-sale debt securities by length of time those 
individual securities in each category have been in a continuous 
loss position. Debt securities on which we have recorded credit 
impairment are categorized as being “less than 12 months” or 

“12 months or more” in a continuous loss position based on the 
point in time that the fair value declined to below the (1) for the 
current period presented, amortized cost basis net of allowance 
for credit losses, or the (2) for the prior period presented, 
amortized cost basis.

We have assessed each debt security with gross unrealized losses 
included in the previous table for credit impairment. As part of 
that assessment we evaluated and concluded that we do not 
intend to sell any of the debt securities, and that it is more likely 
than not that we will not be required to sell, prior to recovery of 
the amortized cost basis. We evaluate, where necessary, whether 
credit impairment exists by comparing the present value of the 
expected cash flows to the debt securities’ amortized cost basis. 
In prior periods, credit impairment was recorded as a write-down 
to the amortized cost basis of the security. In the current period, 
credit impairment is recorded as an allowance for credit losses. 
For descriptions of the factors we consider when analyzing 

debt securities for impairment as well as methodology and 
significant inputs used to measure credit losses, see Note 1 
(Summary of Significant Accounting Policies).

Prior to our adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, the allowance for credit losses related to available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities was not applicable and is therefore presented as $0 
at December 31, 2019. For more information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). 
Represents the impact of adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020. For more information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). 
Certain debt securities with an allowance for credit losses calculated by discounting expected cash flows using the securities’ effective interest rate over its remaining life, recognize changes in the 
allowance for credit losses attributable to the passage of time as interest income. 
The allowance for credit losses for debt securities largely relates to corporate debt securities as of June 30, 2020.

Table 5.8 shows the remaining contractual maturities, amortized 
cost net of allowance for credit losses, fair value and weighted-

remaining contractual principal maturities for MBS do not 
consider prepayments. Remaining expected maturities will differ 
from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the

Note 6:  Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses 

Table 6.1 presents total loans outstanding by portfolio segment 
and class of financing receivable. Outstanding balances include 
unearned income, net deferred loan fees or costs, and 
unamortized discounts and premiums. These amounts were less 
than 1% of our total loans outstanding at June 30, 2020, and 
December 31, 2019. 

Outstanding balances exclude accrued interest receivable on 
loans, except for certain revolving loans, such as credit card loans. 

During the first half of 2020, we reversed accrued interest 
receivable by reversing interest income of $21 million for our 
commercial portfolio segment and $114 million for our consumer 
portfolio segment. See Note 9 (Other Assets) for additional 
information on accrued interest receivable.

Commitments to Lend 
A commitment to lend is a legally binding agreement to lend 
funds to a customer, usually at a stated interest rate, if funded, 
and for specific purposes and time periods. We generally require a 
fee to extend such commitments. Certain commitments are 
subject to loan agreements with covenants regarding the financial 
performance of the customer or borrowing base formulas on an 
ongoing basis that must be met before we are required to fund 
the commitment. We may reduce or cancel consumer 
commitments, including home equity lines and credit card lines, in 
accordance with the contracts and applicable law. 

We may, as a representative for other lenders, advance funds 

or provide for the issuance of letters of credit under syndicated 
loan or letter of credit agreements. Any advances are generally 
repaid in less than a week and would normally require default of 
both the customer and another lender to expose us to loss. The 
unfunded amount of these temporary advance arrangements 
totaled approximately $77.8 billion at June 30, 2020. 

We issue commercial letters of credit to assist customers in 
purchasing goods or services, typically for international trade. At 
June 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, we had $922.6 million 
and $862 million, respectively, of outstanding issued commercial 
letters of credit. We also originate multipurpose lending 
commitments under which borrowers have the option to draw on 
the facility for different purposes in one of several forms, 
including a standby letter of credit. See Note 13 (Guarantees, 
Pledged Assets and Collateral, and Other Commitments) for 
additional information on standby letters of credit. 

When we make commitments, we are exposed to credit risk. 
The maximum credit risk for these commitments will generally be 
lower than the contractual amount because a significant portion 
of these commitments are not funded. We manage the potential 
risk in commitments to lend by limiting the total amount of 
commitments, both by individual customer and in total, by 
monitoring the size and maturity structure of these 
commitments and by applying the same credit standards for 
these commitments as for all of our credit activities. 

For loans and commitments to lend, we generally require 

collateral or a guarantee. We may require various types of 
collateral, including commercial and consumer real estate, 
automobiles, other short-term liquid assets such as accounts 
receivable or inventory and long-lived assets, such as equipment 
and other business assets. Collateral requirements for each loan 
or commitment may vary based on the loan product and our 
assessment of a customer’s credit risk according to the specific 
credit underwriting, including credit terms and structure. 
The contractual amount of our unfunded credit 

commitments, including unissued standby and commercial letters 
of credit, is summarized by portfolio segment and class of 
financing receivable in Table 6.4. The table excludes the issued 
standby and commercial letters of credit and temporary advance 
arrangements described above.

Allowance for Credit Losses for Loans 
Table 6.5 presents the allowance for credit losses for loans, which 
consists of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for 
unfunded credit commitments. On January 1, 2020, we adopted 
CECL. Additional information on our adoption of CECL is included 
in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). In second 
quarter 2020, ACL for loans increased $8.4 billion driven by 

current and forecasted economic conditions due to the COVID-19 
pandemic. These expected impacts were most significantly 
affected by anticipated changes to economic variables, as well as 
higher expected losses in the commercial real estate and 
consumer real estate mortgage loan portfolios and expected 
impacts of lower oil prices and deteriorating credit trends on the 
oil and gas portfolio.

Note 6:  Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses (continued) 

Credit Quality 
We monitor credit quality by evaluating various attributes and 
utilize such information in our evaluation of the appropriateness 
of the allowance for credit losses. The following sections provide 
the credit quality indicators we most closely monitor. The credit 
quality indicators are generally based on information as of our 
financial statement date, with the exception of updated Fair Isaac 
Corporation (FICO) scores and updated loan-to-value (LTV)/ 
combined LTV (CLTV). We obtain FICO scores at loan origination 
and the scores are generally updated at least quarterly, except in 
limited circumstances, including compliance with the Fair Credit 
Reporting Act (FCRA). Generally, the LTV and CLTV indicators are 
updated in the second month of each quarter, with updates no 
older than March 31, 2020. Amounts disclosed in the credit 
quality tables that follow are not comparative between reported 
periods due to our adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020. For 
more information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies). 

COMMERCIAL CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS  We manage a 
consistent process for assessing commercial loan credit quality. 
Generally, commercial loans are subject to individual risk 
assessment using our internal borrower and collateral quality 
ratings, which is our primary credit quality indicator. Our ratings 
are aligned to federal banking regulators’ definitions of pass and 
criticized categories with the criticized category including special 
mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss categories. 

Table 6.8 provides a breakdown of outstanding commercial 
loans by risk category. In connection with our adoption of CECL, 
credit quality information is provided with the year of origination 
for term loans. Revolving loans may convert to term loans as a 
result of a contractual provision in the original loan agreement or 
if modified in a TDR. At June 30, 2020, we had $475.0 billion and 
$38.2 billion of pass and criticized loans respectively.

Table 6.9 provides past due information for commercial 
loans, which we monitor as part of our credit risk management 
practices; however, delinquency is not a primary credit quality 
indicator for commercial loans. Payment deferral activities 
instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may delay 
recognition of delinquencies for customers who otherwise would 
have moved into past due status.

CONSUMER CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS  We have various classes 
of consumer loans that present unique credit risks. Loan 
delinquency, FICO credit scores and LTV for 1-4 family mortgage 
loans are the primary credit quality indicators that we monitor 
and utilize in our evaluation of the appropriateness of the 
allowance for credit losses for the consumer portfolio segment. 
Many of our loss estimation techniques used for the 
allowance for credit losses rely on delinquency-based models; 
therefore, delinquency is an important indicator of credit quality 
and the establishment of our allowance for credit losses. 
Table 6.10 provides the outstanding balances of our consumer 
portfolio by delinquency status. Payment deferral activities 
instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may delay 
recognition of delinquencies for customers who otherwise would 
have moved into past due status.

Represents loans whose repayments are predominantly insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Loans insured/guaranteed by 
the FHA/VA and 90+ DPD totaled $8.9 billion at June 30, 2020, compared with $6.4 billion at December 31, 2019. 
26% of the adjusted unpaid principal balance for consumer PCI loans was 30+ DPD at December 31, 2019. 

Of the $1.8 billion of consumer loans not government 

insured/guaranteed that are 90 days or more past due at June 30, 
2020, $672 million was accruing, compared with $1.9 billion past 
due and $855 million accruing at December 31, 2019. 

Table 6.11 provides a breakdown of our consumer portfolio 

by FICO. Substantially all of the scored consumer portfolio has an 
updated FICO of 680 and above, reflecting a strong current 
borrower credit profile. FICO is not available for certain loan 
types, or may not be required if we deem it unnecessary due to 
strong collateral and other borrower attributes. Loans not 
requiring a FICO score totaled $9.5 billion and $9.1 billion at 
June 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. 
Substantially all loans not requiring a FICO score are securities-
based loans originated through retail brokerage.

Disclosure is not comparative due to our adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020. For more information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). 
Represents loans whose repayments are predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA. 
41% of the adjusted unpaid principal balance for consumer PCI loans had FICO scores less than 680 and 19% where no FICO was available to us at December 31, 2019. 

LTV refers to the ratio comparing the loan’s unpaid principal 

balance to the property’s collateral value. CLTV refers to the 
combination of first mortgage and junior lien mortgage (including 
unused line amounts for credit line products) ratios. LTVs and 
CLTVs are updated quarterly using a cascade approach which first 
uses values provided by automated valuation models (AVMs) for 
the property. If an AVM is not available, then the value is 
estimated using the original appraised value adjusted by the 
change in Home Price Index (HPI) for the property location. If an 
HPI is not available, the original appraised value is used. The HPI 
value is normally the only method considered for high value 
properties, generally with an original value of $1 million or more, 
as the AVM values have proven less accurate for these properties. 

Table 6.12 shows the most updated LTV and CLTV 
distribution of the real estate 1-4 family first and junior lien 
mortgage loan portfolios. We consider the trends in residential 
real estate markets as we monitor credit risk and establish our 
allowance for credit losses. In the event of a default, any loss 
should be limited to the portion of the loan amount in excess of 
the net realizable value of the underlying real estate collateral 
value. Certain loans do not have an LTV or CLTV due to industry 
data availability and portfolios acquired from or serviced by other 
institutions.

NONACCRUAL LOANS  Table 6.13 provides loans on nonaccrual 
status. In connection with our adoption of CECL, nonaccrual loans 
may have an allowance for credit losses or a negative allowance 
for credit losses from expected recoveries of amounts previously 

written off. Payment deferral activities instituted in response to 
the COVID-19 pandemic may delay recognition of delinquencies 
for customers who otherwise would have moved into nonaccrual 
status.

Nonaccrual loans may not have an allowance for credit losses if the loss expectations are zero given solid collateral value. 

LOANS IN PROCESS OF FORECLOSURE  Our recorded investment in 
consumer mortgage loans collateralized by residential real estate 
property that are in process of foreclosure was $2.5 billion and 
$3.5 billion at June 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, 
respectively, which included $2.0 billion and $2.8 billion, 
respectively, of loans that are government insured/guaranteed. 
Under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau guidelines, we 
do not commence the foreclosure process on real estate 1-4 
family mortgage loans until after the loan is 120 days delinquent. 
Foreclosure procedures and timelines vary depending on whether 
the property address resides in a judicial or non-judicial state. 
Judicial states require the foreclosure to be processed through 
the state’s courts while non-judicial states are processed without 
court intervention. Foreclosure timelines vary according to state 
law. In connection with our actions to support customers during 
the COVID-19 pandemic, we have suspended certain mortgage 
foreclosure activities.

IMPAIRED LOANS  In connection with our adoption of CECL, we no 
longer provide information on impaired loans. We have retained 
impaired loans information for the period ended December 31, 
2019. Table 6.15 summarizes key information for impaired loans. 
Our impaired loans at December 31, 2019, predominantly 
included loans on nonaccrual status in the commercial portfolio 
segment and loans modified in a TDR, whether on accrual or 
nonaccrual status. Impaired loans generally had estimated losses 
which are included in the allowance for credit losses. We did have 
impaired loans with no allowance for credit losses when the loss 

content has been previously recognized through charge-offs, 
such as collateral dependent loans, or when loans are currently 
performing in accordance with their terms and no loss has been 
estimated. Impaired loans excluded PCI loans and loans that had 
been fully charged off or otherwise had zero recorded investment. 
Table 6.15 included trial modifications that totaled $115 million 
at December 31, 2019. 

For additional information on our legacy impaired loans and 
allowance for credit losses, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) in our 2019 Form 10-K.

Included interest recognized on accruing TDRs, interest recognized related to certain impaired loans which have an allowance calculated using discounting, and amortization of purchase accounting 
adjustments related to certain impaired loans. 

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs)  When, for economic or 
legal reasons related to a borrower’s financial difficulties, we grant 
a concession for other than an insignificant period of time to a 
borrower that we would not otherwise consider, the related loan 
is classified as a TDR, the balance of which totaled $12.0 billion 
and $11.8 billion at June 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, 
respectively. We do not consider loan resolutions such as 
foreclosure or short sale to be a TDR. In addition, COVID-related 
modifications are generally not classified as TDRs due to the relief 
under the CARES Act and the Interagency Statement. For more 
information on the TDR relief, see Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies). 

We may require some consumer borrowers experiencing 
financial difficulty to make trial payments generally for a period of 
three to four months, according to the terms of a planned 
permanent modification, to determine if they can perform 
according to those terms. These arrangements represent trial 
modifications, which we classify and account for as TDRs. While 
loans are in trial payment programs, their original terms are not 
considered modified and they continue to advance through 
delinquency status and accrue interest according to their original 
terms. 

Commitments to lend additional funds on loans whose terms 

have been modified in a TDR amounted to $442 million and 
$500 million at June 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, 
respectively. 

100 

  
 
 
Table 6.17 summarizes our TDR modifications for the 
periods presented by primary modification type and includes the 
financial effects of these modifications. For those loans that 
modify more than once, the table reflects each modification that 

occurred during the period. Loans that both modify and pay off 
within the period, as well as changes in recorded investment 
during the period for loans modified in prior periods, are not 
included in the table.

Amounts represent the recorded investment in loans after recognizing the effects of the TDR, if any. TDRs may have multiple types of concessions, but are presented only once in the first 
modification type based on the order presented in the table above. The reported amounts include loans remodified of $221 million and $323 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, 
respectively, and $484 million and $683 million for the first half of 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
Principal modifications include principal forgiveness at the time of the modification, contingent principal forgiveness granted over the life of the loan based on borrower performance, and principal 
that has been legally separated and deferred to the end of the loan, with a zero percent contractual interest rate. 

(3)  Other concessions include loans discharged in bankruptcy, loan renewals, term extensions and other interest and noninterest adjustments, but exclude modifications that also forgive principal and/or 

(4) 

(5) 

(6) 

reduce the contractual interest rate. 
Charge-offs include write-downs of the investment in the loan in the period it is contractually modified. The amount of charge-off will differ from the modification terms if the loan has been charged 
down prior to the modification based on our policies. In addition, there may be cases where we have a charge-off/down with no legal principal modification. Modifications resulted in deferring or 
legally forgiving principal (actual or contingent) of $3 million and $3 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $32 million and $6 million for the first half of 2020 and 
2019, respectively. 
Reflects the effect of reduced interest rates on loans with an interest rate concession as one of its concession types, which includes loans reported as a principal primary modification type that also 
have an interest rate concession. 
Trial modifications are granted a delay in payments due under the original terms during the trial payment period. However, these loans continue to advance through delinquency status and accrue 
interest according to their original terms. Any subsequent permanent modification generally includes interest rate related concessions; however, the exact concession type and resulting financial 
effect are usually not known until the loan is permanently modified. Trial modifications for the period are presented net of previously reported trial modifications that became permanent in the 
current period. 

102 

Table 6.18 summarizes permanent modification TDRs that 

have defaulted in the current period within 12 months of their 
permanent modification date. We are reporting these defaulted 
TDRs based on a payment default definition of 90 days past due 
for the commercial portfolio segment and 60 days past due for 
the consumer portfolio segment.

Note 7:  Leasing Activity 

The information below provides a summary of our leasing 
activities as a lessor and lessee. See Note 7 (Leasing Activity) in 
our 2019 Form 10-K for additional information about our leasing 
activities. 

As a Lessee 
Substantially all of our leases are operating leases. Table 7.2 
presents balances for our operating leases.

Includes $191 million and $3.8 billion at June 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, 
respectively, related to securities held as economic hedges of our deferred compensation 
plan liabilities. In second quarter 2020, we entered into arrangements to transition our 
economic hedges of our deferred compensation plan liabilities from equity securities to 
derivative instruments. 
Includes $3.8 billion and $4.8 billion at June 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively, 
related to investments in Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank stock. 
Represents nonmarketable equity securities accounted for under the measurement 
alternative. 

Equity Securities Held for Trading 
Equity securities held for trading purposes are marketable equity 
securities traded on organized exchanges. These securities are 
held as part of our customer accommodation trading activities. 
For more information on these activities, see Note 4 (Trading 
Activities). 

Equity Securities Not Held for Trading 
We also hold equity securities unrelated to trading activities. 
These securities include private equity and tax credit investments, 
securities held as economic hedges or to meet regulatory 
requirements (for example, Federal Reserve Bank and Federal 
Home Loan Bank stock). 

FAIR VALUE  Marketable equity securities held for purposes other 
than trading consist of exchange-traded equity funds held to 
economically hedge obligations related to our deferred 
compensation plans, as well as other holdings of publicly traded 
equity securities held for investment purposes. We account for 
certain nonmarketable equity securities under the fair value 
method, and substantially all of these securities are economically 
hedged with equity derivatives. 

EQUITY METHOD  Our equity method investments consist of tax 
credit and private equity investments, the majority of which are 
our low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) investments. 

We invest in affordable housing projects that qualify for the 

LIHTC, which are designed to promote private development of 
low-income housing. These investments generate a return mostly 
through realization of federal tax credit and other tax benefits. In 
the second quarter and first half of 2020, we recognized pre-tax 
losses of $340 million and $679 million, respectively, related to 
our LIHTC investments, compared with $298 million and 
$571 million, respectively, for the same periods a year ago. These 
losses were recognized in other noninterest income. We also 
recognized total tax benefits of $401 million and $799 million in 
the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, which 
included tax credits recorded to income taxes of $317 million and 
$631 million for the same periods, respectively. In the second 
quarter and first half of 2019, total tax benefits were 
$376 million and $746 million, respectively, which included tax 
credits of $303 million and $605 million for the same periods, 
respectively. We are periodically required to provide additional 
financial support during the investment period. A liability is 
recognized for unfunded commitments that are both legally 
binding and probable of funding. These commitments are 
predominantly funded within three years of initial investment. 
Our liability for these unfunded commitments was $4.2 billion at 
June 30, 2020, and $4.3 billion at December 31, 2019. This 
liability for unfunded commitments is included in long-term debt. 

OTHER  The remaining portion of our nonmarketable equity 
securities portfolio consists of securities accounted for using the 
cost or measurement alternative.

Involvement with Special Purpose Entities (SPEs) 
In the normal course of business, we enter into various types of 
on- and off-balance sheet transactions with SPEs, which are 
corporations, trusts, limited liability companies or partnerships 
that are established for a limited purpose. For further description 

of our involvement with SPEs, see Note 10 (Securitizations and

Mortgage Association (GNMA). 

Transactions with Unconsolidated VIEs 
Our transactions with unconsolidated VIEs include predominantly 
securitizations of residential and commercial mortgage loans, and 
investments in tax credit structures. We have various forms of 
involvement with VIEs, including servicing, holding senior or 

subordinated interests, and entering into liquidity arrangements 
and derivative contracts. Involvements with these unconsolidated 
VIEs are recorded on our balance sheet in debt and equity 
securities, loans, MSRs, derivative assets and liabilities, other 
assets, other liabilities, and long-term debt, as appropriate. 

108 

  
 
  
  
Table 10.2 provides a summary of our exposure to 

unconsolidated VIEs with which we have significant continuing 
involvement but for which we are not the primary beneficiary. 
We include transactions where we were the sponsor or 
servicer and also have other significant forms of continuing 
involvement. Sponsorship includes transactions where we solely 
or materially participated in the initial design or structuring of the 
VIE or marketed the transaction to investors. We consider 
investments in securities, loans, guarantees, liquidity agreements, 
commitments and certain derivatives to be other forms of 

continuing involvement that may be significant. We also include 
transactions where we transferred assets to a VIE, account for the 
transfer as a sale, and service the VIE collateral or have other 
forms of continuing involvement that may be significant (as 
described above). We exclude certain transactions with 
unconsolidated VIEs when our continuing involvement is 
temporary in nature or insignificant in size. We also exclude 
secured borrowing transactions with unconsolidated VIEs (for 
information on these transactions, see the Transactions with 
Consolidated VIEs and Secured Borrowings section in this Note).

held related to loans serviced for FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA. 
Carrying values include assets and related liabilities of $42 million and $556 million at June 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively, related to certain unexercised unconditional repurchase 
options. These amounts represent the carrying value of the loans and associated debt that would be payable if the option was exercised to repurchase eligible loans from GNMA residential and 
multifamily loan securitizations. These amounts are excluded from maximum exposure to loss as we are not obligated to exercise the options. 

In Table 10.2, “Total VIE assets” represents the remaining 
principal balance of assets held by unconsolidated VIEs using the 
most current information available. For VIEs that obtain exposure 
to assets synthetically through derivative instruments, the 
notional amount of the derivative is included in the asset balance. 

“Carrying value” is the amount in our consolidated balance sheet 
related to our involvement with the unconsolidated VIEs. 
“Maximum exposure to loss” is determined as the carrying value 
of our investment in the VIEs excluding the unconditional 
repurchase options that have not been exercised, plus the 

109 

  
 
Note 10:  Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities (continued) 

remaining undrawn liquidity and lending commitments, the 
notional amount of net written derivative contracts, and generally 
the notional amount of, or stressed loss estimate for, other 
commitments and guarantees. It represents estimated loss that 
would be incurred under severe, hypothetical circumstances, for 
which we believe the possibility is extremely remote, such as 
where the value of our interests and any associated collateral 
declines to zero, without any consideration of recovery or offset 
from any economic hedges. Accordingly, this disclosure is not an 
indication of expected loss. 

For complete descriptions of our transactions with 

unconsolidated VIEs with which we have a significant continuing 
involvement, but we are not the primary beneficiary, see Note 10 
(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) in our 2019 
Form 10-K. 

Loan Sales and Securitization Activity 
We periodically transfer consumer and commercial loans and 
other types of financial assets in securitization and whole loan 
sale transactions. We typically retain the servicing rights from 
these sales and may continue to hold other beneficial interests in 

Table 10.3:  Transfers With Continuing Involvement 

the transferred financial assets. We may also provide liquidity to 
investors in the beneficial interests and credit enhancements. 
Through these transfers we may be exposed to liability under 
limited amounts of recourse as well as standard representations 
and warranties we make to purchasers and issuers. 

Table 10.3 presents information about transfers of assets 
during the period to unconsolidated VIEs or third-party investors 
for which we recorded the transfers as sales and have continuing 
involvement with the transferred assets. In connection with these 
transfers, we recorded servicing assets, securities, and a liability 
for repurchase losses which reflects management’s estimate of 
probable losses related to various representations and warranties 
for the loans transferred. Each of these interests are initially 
measured at fair value. Servicing rights are classified as Level 3 
measurements, and generally securities are initially classified as 
Level 2. 

Sales with continuing involvement include securitizations of 

conforming residential mortgages that are sold to the 
government-sponsored entities (GSEs) or GNMA. Substantially all 
transfers to these entities resulted in no gain or loss because the 
loans were already measured at fair value on a recurring basis.

Includes securities retained upon initial transfer and subsequent sales during the periods presented, which may result in a net reduction of securities recognized. 

Table 10.5 presents the proceeds related to transfers 
accounted for as sales in which we have continuing involvement 
with the transferred financial assets, as well as current period cash 
flows from continuing involvement with previous transfers 
accounted for as sales. Cash flows from other interests held 
predominantly include principal and interest payments received 
on retained bonds. Repurchases of assets represents cash paid to 
repurchase loans from investors under representation and 
warranty obligations or in connection with the exercise of cleanup 
calls on securitizations. Loss reimbursements is cash paid to 
reimburse investors for losses on individual loans that are already 
liquidated. Government insured loans are delinquent loans that 
we service and have exercised our option to purchase out of 
GNMA pools. These loans are insured by the FHA or guaranteed 
by the VA. 

Table 10.4 presents the key weighted-average assumptions 

we used to measure residential MSRs at the date of

The prepayment speed assumption for residential MSRs includes a blend of prepayment 
speeds and default rates. Prepayment speed assumptions are influenced by mortgage 
interest rate inputs as well as our estimation of drivers of borrower behavior. 
Includes costs to service and unreimbursed foreclosure costs, which can vary period to 
period due to changes in model assumptions and the mix of modified government-
guaranteed loans sold to GNMA.

Retained Interests from Unconsolidated VIEs 
Table 10.6 provides key economic assumptions and the sensitivity 
of the current fair value of residential MSRs and other interests 
held related to unconsolidated VIEs to immediate adverse 
changes in those assumptions. Amounts for residential MSRs 
include purchased servicing rights as well as servicing rights 
resulting from the transfer of loans. See Note 16 (Fair Values of 
Assets and Liabilities) for additional information on key economic 
assumptions for residential MSRs. “Other interests held” were 
obtained when we securitized residential and commercial 
mortgage loans. Residential mortgage-backed securities retained 
in securitizations issued through GSEs or GNMA, are excluded 

Table 10.6:  Retained Interests from Unconsolidated VIEs 

from the table because these securities have a remote risk of 
credit loss due to the GSE or government guarantee. These 
securities also have economic characteristics similar to GSE or 
GNMA mortgage-backed securities that we purchase, which are 
not included in the table. Subordinated interests include only 
those bonds whose credit rating was below AAA by a major rating 
agency at issuance. Senior interests include only those bonds 
whose credit rating was AAA by a major rating agency at issuance. 
The information presented excludes trading positions held in 
inventory.

In addition to residential MSRs included in the previous table, 

we have a small portfolio of commercial MSRs, which are carried 
at the lower of cost or fair value (LOCOM), with a fair value of 

$1.4 billion and $1.9 billion at June 30, 2020, and December 31, 
2019, respectively. Prepayment assumptions do not significantly 
impact values of commercial MSRs and commercial mortgage 

112 

  
 
bonds as commercial loans generally include contractual 
restrictions on prepayment. Servicing costs are not a driver of our 
MSR value as we are typically primary or master servicer; the 
higher costs of servicing delinquent and foreclosed loans is 
generally borne by the special servicer. The primary economic 
driver impacting the fair value of our commercial MSRs is forward 
interest rates, which are derived from market observable yield 
curves used to price capital markets instruments. Market interest 
rates significantly affect interest earned on custodial deposit 
balances. The sensitivity of the current fair value of our 
commercial MSRs to a hypothetical immediate adverse 25% 
change in the assumption about interest earned on deposit 
balances at June 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, would result 
in a decrease in fair value of $94 million and $205 million, 
respectively. See Note 11 (Mortgage Banking Activities) for 
further information on our commercial MSRs. 

The sensitivities in the preceding paragraph and table are 
hypothetical and caution should be exercised when relying on this 
data. Changes in value based on variations in assumptions 
generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the 
change in the assumption to the change in value may not be 
linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on 
the value of the other interests held is calculated independently 

Table 10.7:  Off-Balance Sheet Loans Sold or Securitized 

without changing any other assumptions. In reality, changes in 
one factor may result in changes in others (for example, changes 
in prepayment speed estimates could result in changes in the 
credit losses), which might magnify or counteract the 
sensitivities. 

Off-Balance Sheet Loans 
Table 10.7 presents information about the principal balances of 
off-balance sheet loans that were sold or securitized, including 
residential mortgage loans sold to FNMA, FHLMC, GNMA and 
other investors, for which we have some form of continuing 
involvement (including servicer). Delinquent loans include loans 
90 days or more past due and loans in bankruptcy, regardless of 
delinquency status. In accordance with applicable servicing 
guidelines, delinquency status continues to advance for loans with 
COVID-related payment deferrals. For loans sold or securitized 
where servicing is our only form of continuing involvement, we 
would only experience a loss if we were required to repurchase a 
delinquent loan or foreclosed asset due to a breach in 
representations and warranties associated with our loan sale or 
servicing contracts.

We have raised financing through the securitization of 
certain financial assets in transactions with VIEs accounted for as 
secured borrowings. We also consolidate VIEs where we are the 
primary beneficiary. In certain transactions, we provide 
contractual support in the form of limited recourse and liquidity 
to facilitate the remarketing of short-term securities issued to 
third-party investors. Other than this limited contractual support, 
the assets of the VIEs are the sole source of repayment of the 
securities held by third parties. 

For complete descriptions of our accounting for transfers 

accounted for as secured borrowings and involvement with 
consolidated VIEs, see Note 10 (Securitizations and Variable 
Interest Entities) in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Other Transactions 
In addition to the transactions included in the previous tables, we 
have used wholly-owned trust preferred security VIEs to issue 
debt securities or preferred equity exclusively to third-party 
investors. As the sole assets of the VIEs are receivables from us, 
we do not consolidate the VIEs even though we own all of the 
voting equity shares of the VIEs, have fully guaranteed the 
obligations of the VIEs, and may have the right to redeem the 
third-party securities under certain circumstances. In our 

114 

consolidated balance sheet we reported the debt securities issued 
to the VIEs as long-term junior subordinated debt with a carrying 
value of $692 million and $2.1 billion at June 30, 2020, and 
December 31, 2019, respectively. During first quarter 2020, we 
liquidated certain of our trust preferred security VIEs. As part of 
these liquidations, the preferred securities issued by the trusts 
were canceled and junior subordinated debentures with a total 
carrying value of $1.4 billion were distributed to the preferred 
security holders. Prior to the liquidations, we held $10 million of 
these preferred securities, which were exchanged for junior 
subordinated debentures upon liquidation and subsequently 
retired with no impact to earnings. See Note 17 (Preferred Stock) 
for additional information about trust preferred securities. 

Certain money market funds are also excluded from the 
previous tables because they are exempt from the consolidation 
analysis. We voluntarily waived a portion of our management fees 
for these money market funds to maintain a minimum level of 
daily net investment income. The amount of fees waived was 
$22 million and $33 million in the second quarter and first half of 
2020, respectively, compared with $10 million and $20 million for 
the same periods a year ago.

Includes impacts associated with exercising cleanup calls on securitizations and our right to repurchase delinquent loans from GNMA loan securitization pools. MSRs may increase upon repurchase 
due to servicing liabilities associated with these delinquent GNMA loans. 
Includes sales and transfers of MSRs, which can result in an increase in MSRs if related to portfolios with servicing liabilities. 
Includes prepayment speed changes as well as other valuation changes due to changes in mortgage interest rates. 
Includes costs to service and unreimbursed foreclosure costs. 
Represents other changes in valuation model inputs or assumptions including prepayment speed estimation changes that are independent of mortgage interest rate changes.

At June 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, we had servicer 

advances, net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts, of 
$2.1 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. As the servicer of loans 
for others, we advance certain payments of principal, interest, 
taxes, insurance, and default-related expenses which are generally 
reimbursed within a short timeframe from cash flows from the 
trust, GSEs, insurer or borrower. The credit risk related to these 
advances is limited since the reimbursement is generally senior to 
cash payments to investors. We also advance payments of taxes 

and insurance for our owned loans which are collectible from the 
borrower. We maintain an allowance for uncollectible amounts for 
advances on loans serviced for others that may not be reimbursed 
if the payments were not made in accordance with applicable 
servicing agreements or if the insurance or servicing agreements 
contain limitations on reimbursements. Servicing advances on 
owned loans are charged-off when deemed uncollectible.

Note 13:  Guarantees, Pledged Assets and Collateral, and Other Commitments 

Guarantees are contracts that contingently require us to make 
payments to a guaranteed party based on an event or a change in 
an underlying asset, liability, rate or index. Guarantees are 
generally in the form of standby and direct pay letters of credit, 
written options, recourse obligations, and other types of similar 

arrangements. For complete descriptions of our guarantees, see 
Note 16 (Guarantees, Pledged Assets and Collateral, and Other 
Commitments) in our 2019 Form 10-K. Table 13.1 shows carrying 
value, maximum exposure to loss on our guarantees and the 
related non-investment grade amounts.

option trades. 
Represent recourse provided, predominantly to the GSEs, on loans sold under various programs and arrangements. 
Includes indemnifications provided to certain third-party clearing agents. Outstanding customer obligations under these arrangements were $77 million and $80 million with related collateral of 
$1.3 billion and $696 million at June 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. 

“Maximum exposure to loss” and “Non-investment grade” 

are required disclosures under GAAP. Maximum exposure to loss 
represents the estimated loss that would be incurred under an 
assumed hypothetical circumstance, despite what we believe is a 
remote possibility, where the value of our interests and any 
associated collateral declines to zero. Maximum exposure to loss 
estimates in Table 13.1 do not reflect economic hedges or 
collateral we could use to offset or recover losses we may incur 
under our guarantee agreements. Accordingly, this required 
disclosure is not an indication of expected loss. We believe the 
carrying value is more representative of our exposure to loss than 
maximum exposure to loss. The carrying value represents the fair 
value of the guarantee, if any, and also includes an ACL for 
guarantees, if applicable. 

 Non-investment grade represents those guarantees on 

which we have a higher risk of performance under the terms of 
the guarantee. If the underlying assets under the guarantee are 
non-investment grade (that is, an external rating that is below 
investment grade or an internal credit default grade that is 
equivalent to a below investment grade external rating), we 
consider the risk of performance to be high. Internal credit 
default grades are determined based upon the same credit 
policies that we use to evaluate the risk of payment or 
performance when making loans and other extensions of credit. 
Credit quality indicators we usually consider in evaluating risk of 

118 

payments or performance are described in Note 6 (Loans and 
Related Allowance for Credit Losses). 

We provide debit and credit card transaction processing 
services through the payment networks directly for merchants 
and as a sponsor for merchant processing servicers, including our 
joint venture with a third party that is accounted for as an equity 
method investment. In our role as the merchant acquiring bank, 
we have a potential obligation for payment and delivery disputes 
between the merchant and the cardholder that are resolved in 
favor of the cardholder. If we are unable to collect the amounts 
from the merchant, we incur a loss for the refund to the 
cardholder. We are secondarily obligated to make a refund for 
transactions involving the sponsored merchant processing 
servicers. We have a low likelihood of loss since most products 
and services are delivered when purchased and amounts are 
refunded when items are returned to the merchant. In addition, 
we may reduce our risk by withholding future payments and 
requiring cash or other collateral. For the first half of 2020, we 
processed card transaction volume of $608.3 billion as a 
merchant acquiring bank, and related losses, including those from 
our joint venture entity, were immaterial. 

The Parent fully and unconditionally guarantees the payment 

of principal, interest, and any other amounts that may be due on 
securities that its 100% owned finance subsidiary, Wells Fargo 
Finance LLC, may issue. These guaranteed liabilities were 
$2.4 billion and $1.6 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 

  
 
2019, respectively. These guarantees rank on parity with all of the 
Parent’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. 

Pledged Assets 
Table 13.2 provides the carrying amount of on-balance sheet 
pledged assets and the fair value of other pledged collateral. 
Other pledged collateral is collateral we have received from third 
parties, have the right to repledge and is not recognized on our 
balance sheet. 

TRADING RELATED ACTIVITY  Our trading businesses may pledge 
debt and equity securities in connection with securities sold under 
agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements) and 
securities lending arrangements. The collateral that we pledge 
related to our trading activities may include our own collateral as 
well as collateral that we have received from third parties and 
have the right to repledge. All of the trading activity pledged 
collateral is eligible to be repledged or sold by the secured party. 

NON-TRADING RELATED ACTIVITY  As part of our liquidity 
management strategy, we may pledge loans, debt securities, and 
other assets to secure trust and public deposits, borrowings and 
letters of credit from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and 
FRB and for other purposes as required or permitted by law or 
insurance statutory requirements. Substantially all of the non-
trading activity pledged collateral is not eligible to be repledged 
or sold by the secured party. 

VIE RELATED  We pledge assets in connection with various types of 
transactions entered into with VIEs. These pledged assets can 
only be used to settle the liabilities of those entities. We also have 
loans recorded on our balance sheet which represent certain 
delinquent loans that are eligible for repurchase from GNMA loan 
securitizations. See Note 10 (Securitizations and Variable Interest 
Entities) for additional information on consolidated VIE assets 
and VIEs accounted for as secured borrowings.

Securities Financing Activities 
We enter into resale and repurchase agreements and securities 
borrowing and lending agreements (collectively, “securities 
financing activities”) typically to finance trading positions 
(including securities and derivatives), acquire securities to cover 
short trading positions, accommodate customers’ financing 
needs, and settle other securities obligations. These activities are 
conducted through our broker-dealer subsidiaries and to a lesser 
extent through other bank entities. Our securities financing 
activities primarily involve high quality, liquid securities such as 
U.S. Treasury securities and government agency securities, and to 
a lesser extent, less liquid securities, including equity securities, 
corporate bonds and asset-backed securities. We account for 
these transactions as collateralized financings in which we 
typically receive or pledge securities as collateral. We believe 
these financing transactions generally do not have material credit 
risk given the collateral provided and the related monitoring 
processes.

OFFSETTING OF SECURITIES FINANCING ACTIVITIES  Table 13.3 
presents resale and repurchase agreements subject to master 
repurchase agreements (MRA) and securities borrowing and 
lending agreements subject to master securities lending 
agreements (MSLA). Collateralized financings with a single 
counterparty are presented net on our balance sheet, provided 
certain criteria are met that permit balance sheet netting. Most 
transactions subject to these agreements do not meet those 
criteria and thus are not eligible for balance sheet netting. 

Collateral we pledged consists of non-cash instruments, such 

as securities or loans, and is not netted on the balance sheet 
against the related liability. Collateral we received includes 
securities or loans and is not recognized on our balance sheet. 
Collateral pledged or received may be increased or decreased over 
time to maintain certain contractual thresholds, as the assets 
underlying each arrangement fluctuate in value. Generally, these 
agreements require collateral to exceed the asset or liability 
recognized on the balance sheet. The following table includes the 
amount of collateral pledged or received related to exposures 
subject to enforceable MRAs or MSLAs. While these agreements 

119 

 
  
 
 
Note 13:  Guarantees, Pledged Assets and Collateral, and Other Commitments (continued) 

are typically over-collateralized, U.S. GAAP requires disclosure in 
this table to limit the reported amount of such collateral to the 
amount of the related recognized asset or liability for each 
counterparty. 

In addition to the amounts included in Table 13.3, we also 
have balance sheet netting related to derivatives that is disclosed 
in Note 15 (Derivatives).

Represents recognized amount of resale and repurchase agreements with counterparties subject to enforceable MRAs that have been offset in the consolidated balance sheet. 
Includes $79.3 billion and $102.1 billion classified on our consolidated balance sheet in federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements at June 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, 
respectively. Also includes securities purchased under long-term resale agreements (generally one year or more) classified in loans, which totaled $18.0 billion and $19.5 billion, at June 30, 2020, and 
December 31, 2019, respectively. 
Represents the fair value of collateral we have received under enforceable MRAs or MSLAs, limited in the table above to the amount of the recognized asset due from each counterparty. At June 30, 
2020, and December 31, 2019, we have received total collateral with a fair value of $122.5 billion and $150.9 billion, respectively, all of which we have the right to sell or repledge. These amounts 
include securities we have sold or repledged to others with a fair value of $41.1 billion at June 30, 2020, and $59.1 billion at December 31, 2019. 
Represents the amount of our exposure (assets) or obligation (liabilities) that is not collateralized and/or is not subject to an enforceable MRA or MSLA. 
Amount is classified in short-term borrowings on our consolidated balance sheet. 
Represents the fair value of collateral we have pledged, related to enforceable MRAs or MSLAs, limited in the table above to the amount of the recognized liability owed to each counterparty. At 
June 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, we have pledged total collateral with a fair value of $64.3 billion and $113.3 billion, respectively, substantially all of which may be sold or repledged by the 
counterparty. 

REPURCHASE AND SECURITIES LENDING AGREEMENTS Securities 
sold under repurchase agreements and securities lending 
arrangements are effectively short-term collateralized 
borrowings. In these transactions, we receive cash in exchange for 
transferring securities as collateral and recognize an obligation to 
reacquire the securities for cash at the transaction’s maturity. 
These types of transactions create risks, including (1) the 
counterparty may fail to return the securities at maturity, (2) the 
fair value of the securities transferred may decline below the 
amount of our obligation to reacquire the securities, and 
therefore create an obligation for us to pledge additional 
amounts, and (3) the counterparty may accelerate the maturity 
on demand, requiring us to reacquire the security prior to 
contractual maturity. We attempt to mitigate these risks in 
various ways. Our collateral primarily consists of highly liquid 
securities. In addition, we underwrite and monitor the financial 
strength of our counterparties, monitor the fair value of collateral 
pledged relative to contractually required repurchase amounts, 
and monitor that our collateral is properly returned through the 
clearing and settlement process in advance of our cash 
repayment. Table 13.4 provides the gross amounts recognized on 
the balance sheet (before the effects of offsetting) of our 
liabilities for repurchase and securities lending agreements 
disaggregated by underlying collateral type.

Securities lending is executed under agreements that allow either party to terminate the transaction without notice, while repurchase agreements have a term structure to them that technically 
matures at a point in time. The overnight/continuous repurchase agreements require election of both parties to roll the trade rather than the election to terminate the arrangement as in securities 
lending. 

OTHER COMMITMENTS  To meet the financing needs of our 
customers, we may enter into commitments to purchase debt 
and equity securities to provide capital for their funding, liquidity 
or other future needs. As of June 30, 2020, and December 31, 
2019, we had commitments to purchase debt securities of 
$18 million in both periods and commitments to purchase equity 
securities of $3.3 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. 

As part of maintaining our memberships in certain clearing 

organizations, we are required to stand ready to provide liquidity 
to sustain market clearing activity in the event unforeseen events 
occur or are deemed likely to occur. Certain of these obligations 
are guarantees of other members’ performance and accordingly 
are included in Other guarantees and indemnifications in 
Table 13.1. 

Also, we have commitments to purchase loans and securities 

under resale agreements from certain counterparties, including 
central clearing organizations. The amount of our unfunded 
contractual commitments was $14.1 billion and $7.5 billion as of 
June 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. 

Given the nature of these commitments, they are excluded 

from Table 6.4 (Unfunded Credit Commitments) in Note 6 (Loans 
and Related Allowance for Credit Losses).

Note 14:  Legal Actions 

Wells Fargo and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in a 
number of judicial, regulatory, governmental, arbitration, and 
other proceedings or investigations concerning matters arising 
from the conduct of our business activities, and many of those 
proceedings and investigations expose Wells Fargo to potential 
financial loss. These proceedings and investigations include 
actions brought against Wells Fargo and/or our subsidiaries with 
respect to corporate-related matters and transactions in which 
Wells Fargo and/or our subsidiaries were involved. In addition, 
Wells Fargo and our subsidiaries may be requested to provide 
information or otherwise cooperate with government authorities 
in the conduct of investigations of other persons or industry 
groups. 

Although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate 
outcome, Wells Fargo and/or our subsidiaries have generally 
denied, or believe we have a meritorious defense and will deny, 
liability in all significant legal actions pending against us, including 
the matters described below, and we intend to defend vigorously 
each case, other than matters we describe as having settled. We 
establish accruals for legal actions when potential losses 
associated with the actions become probable and the costs can be 
reasonably estimated. For such accruals, we record the amount 
we consider to be the best estimate within a range of potential 
losses that are both probable and estimable; however, if we 
cannot determine a best estimate, then we record the low end of 
the range of those potential losses. The actual costs of resolving 
legal actions may be substantially higher or lower than the 
amounts accrued for those actions. 

ATM ACCESS FEE LITIGATION  In October 2011, plaintiffs filed a 
putative class action, Mackmin, et al. v. Visa, Inc. et al., against 
Wells Fargo & Company, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Visa, MasterCard, 
and several other banks in the United States District Court for the 
District of Columbia. Plaintiffs allege that the Visa and 
MasterCard requirement that if an ATM operator charges an 
access fee on Visa and MasterCard transactions, then that fee 
cannot be greater than the access fee charged for transactions on 
other networks, violates antitrust rules. Plaintiffs seek treble 
damages, restitution, injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees where 
available under federal and state law. Two other antitrust cases 
that make similar allegations were filed in the same court, but 
these cases did not name Wells Fargo as a defendant. On 
February 13, 2013, the district court granted defendants’ 
motions to dismiss the three actions. Plaintiffs appealed the 
dismissals and, on August 4, 2015, the United States Court of 
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the district 
court’s decisions and remanded the three cases to the district 
court for further proceedings. On June 28, 2016, the United 
States Supreme Court granted defendants’ petitions for writ of 
certiorari to review the decisions of the United States Court of 
Appeals for the District of Columbia. On November 17, 2016, the 
United States Supreme Court dismissed the petitions as 
improvidently granted, and the three cases returned to the 
district court for further proceedings. On March 18, 2020, the 
Company reached a settlement in principle pursuant to which the 
Company will pay $20.8 million to resolve the cases, subject to 
final documentation of the settlement agreement. 

AUTOMOBILE LENDING MATTERS  On April 20, 2018, the Company 
entered into consent orders with the Office of the Comptroller of 
the Currency (OCC) and the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau (CFPB) to resolve, among other things, investigations by 

122 

the agencies into the Company’s compliance risk management 
program and its past practices involving certain automobile 
collateral protection insurance (CPI) policies and certain 
mortgage interest rate lock extensions. The consent orders 
require remediation to customers and the payment of a total of 
$1.0 billion in civil money penalties to the agencies. In July 2017, 
the Company announced a plan to remediate customers who may 
have been financially harmed due to issues related to automobile 
CPI policies purchased through a third-party vendor on their 
behalf. Multiple putative class action cases alleging, among other 
things, unfair and deceptive practices relating to these CPI 
policies, have been filed against the Company and consolidated 
into one multi-district litigation in the United States District 
Court for the Central District of California. The Company has 
reached an agreement to resolve the multi-district litigation 
pursuant to which the Company has agreed to pay, consistent 
with its remediation obligations under the consent orders, 
approximately $609 million in remediation to customers with CPI 
policies placed between October 15, 2005, and September 30, 
2016. The settlement amount is not incremental to the 
Company’s remediation obligations under the consent orders, but 
instead encompasses those obligations, including remediation 
payments to date. The settlement amount is subject to change as 
the Company finalizes its remediation activity under the consent 
orders. In addition, the Company has agreed to contribute 
$1 million to a common fund for the class. The district court 
granted final approval of the settlement on November 21, 2019. 
A putative class of shareholders also filed a securities fraud class 
action against the Company and its executive officers alleging 
material misstatements and omissions of CPI-related 
information in the Company’s public disclosures. In January 2020, 
the court dismissed this action as to all defendants except the 
Company and a former executive officer and limited the action to 
two alleged misstatements. In addition, the Company is subject 
to a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the 
Central District of California alleging that customers are entitled 
to refunds related to the unused portion of guaranteed 
automobile protection (GAP) waiver or insurance agreements 
between the customer and dealer and, by assignment, the lender. 
Allegations related to the CPI and GAP programs are among the 
subjects of shareholder derivative lawsuits pending in federal and 
state court in California. The court dismissed the state court 
action in September 2018, but plaintiffs filed an amended 
complaint in November 2018. The parties to the state court 
action have entered into an agreement to resolve the action 
pursuant to which the Company will pay plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees 
and undertake certain business and governance practices. The 
state court granted final approval of the settlement on 
January 15, 2020, and a notice of appeal has been filed. These and 
other issues related to the origination, servicing, and collection of 
consumer automobile loans, including related insurance products, 
have also subjected the Company to formal or informal inquiries, 
investigations, or examinations from federal and state 
government agencies. In December 2018, the Company entered 
into an agreement with all 50 state Attorneys General and the 
District of Columbia to resolve an investigation into the 
Company’s retail sales practices, CPI and GAP, and mortgage 
interest rate lock matters, pursuant to which the Company paid 
$575 million. 

CONSENT ORDER DISCLOSURE LITIGATION  Wells Fargo 
shareholders have brought securities fraud class actions in the 

United States District Courts for the Northern District of 
California and the Southern District of New York alleging that the 
Company made false or misleading statements regarding its 
efforts to comply with the February 2018 consent order with the 
FRB and the April 2018 consent orders with the CFPB and OCC. 

CONSUMER DEPOSIT ACCOUNT RELATED REGULATORY 
INVESTIGATION  The CFPB is conducting an investigation into 
whether customers were unduly harmed by the Company’s 
historical practices associated with the freezing (and, in many 
cases, closing) of consumer deposit accounts after the Company 
detected suspected fraudulent activity (by third parties or 
account holders) that affected those accounts. 

CORONAVIRUS AID, RELIEF, AND ECONOMIC SECURITY ACT/ 
PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM  Plaintiffs have filed putative 
class actions in various federal courts against the Company. The 
actions seek damages and injunctive relief related to the 
Company’s offering of Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans 
under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, as 
well as claims for fees by purported agents who allegedly assisted 
customers with preparing PPP loan applications submitted to the 
Company. The Company has also received formal and informal 
inquiries from federal and state governmental agencies regarding 
its offering of PPP loans. 

FIDUCIARY AND CUSTODY ACCOUNT FEE CALCULATIONS  Federal 
government agencies are conducting formal or informal inquiries, 
investigations, or examinations regarding fee calculations within 
certain fiduciary and custody accounts in the Company’s 
investment and fiduciary services business, which is part of the 
wealth management business within the Wealth and Investment 
Management (WIM) operating segment. The Company has 
determined that there have been instances of incorrect fees 
being applied to certain assets and accounts, resulting in both 
overcharges and undercharges to customers. 

FOREIGN EXCHANGE BUSINESS  The United States Department of 
Justice (Department of Justice) is investigating certain activities 
in the Company’s foreign exchange business, including whether 
customers may have received pricing inconsistent with 
commitments made to those customers. Previous investigations 
by other federal government agencies have been resolved. 

INTERCHANGE LITIGATION  Plaintiffs representing a putative class 
of merchants have filed putative class actions, and individual 
merchants have filed individual actions, against Wells Fargo Bank, 
N.A., Wells Fargo & Company, Wachovia Bank, N.A., and Wachovia 
Corporation regarding the interchange fees associated with Visa 
and MasterCard payment card transactions. Visa, MasterCard, 
and several other banks and bank holding companies are also 
named as defendants in these actions. These actions have been 
consolidated in the United States District Court for the Eastern 
District of New York. The amended and consolidated complaint 
asserts claims against defendants based on alleged violations of 
federal and state antitrust laws and seeks damages, as well as 
injunctive relief. Plaintiff merchants allege that Visa, MasterCard, 
and payment card issuing banks unlawfully colluded to set 
interchange rates. Plaintiffs also allege that enforcement of 
certain Visa and MasterCard rules and alleged tying and bundling 
of services offered to merchants are anticompetitive. Wells Fargo 
and Wachovia, along with other defendants and entities, are 
parties to Loss and Judgment Sharing Agreements, which provide 
that they, along with other entities, will share, based on a formula, 
in any losses from the Interchange Litigation. On July 13, 2012, 

Visa, MasterCard, and the financial institution defendants, 
including Wells Fargo, signed a memorandum of understanding 
with plaintiff merchants to resolve the consolidated class action 
and reached a separate settlement in principle of the 
consolidated individual actions. The settlement payments to be 
made by all defendants in the consolidated class and individual 
actions totaled approximately $6.6 billion before reductions 
applicable to certain merchants opting out of the settlement. The 
class settlement also provided for the distribution to class 
merchants of 10 basis points of default interchange across all 
credit rate categories for a period of eight consecutive months. 
The district court granted final approval of the settlement, which 
was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the 
Second Circuit by settlement objector merchants. Other 
merchants opted out of the settlement and are pursuing several 
individual actions. On June 30, 2016, the Second Circuit vacated 
the settlement agreement and reversed and remanded the 
consolidated action to the United States District Court for the 
Eastern District of New York for further proceedings. On 
November 23, 2016, prior class counsel filed a petition to the 
United States Supreme Court, seeking review of the reversal of 
the settlement by the Second Circuit, and the Supreme Court 
denied the petition on March 27, 2017. On November 30, 2016, 
the district court appointed lead class counsel for a damages class 
and an equitable relief class. The parties have entered into a 
settlement agreement to resolve the money damages class 
claims pursuant to which defendants will pay a total of 
approximately $6.2 billion, which includes approximately 
$5.3 billion of funds remaining from the 2012 settlement and 
$900 million in additional funding. The Company’s allocated 
responsibility for the additional funding is approximately 
$94.5 million. The court granted final approval of the settlement 
on December 13, 2019, which was appealed to the United States 
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit by settlement objector 
merchants. Several of the opt-out and direct action litigations 
have been settled while others remain pending. Discovery is 
proceeding in the opt-out litigations and the equitable relief class 
case. 

LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS  Federal government agencies 
have undertaken formal or informal inquiries or investigations 
regarding the manner in which the Company purchased, and 
negotiated the purchase of, certain federal low income housing 
tax credits in connection with the financing of low income 
housing developments. 

MOBILE DEPOSIT PATENT LITIGATION  The Company is a defendant 
in two separate cases brought by United Services Automobile 
Association (USAA) in the United States District Court for the 
Eastern District of Texas alleging claims of patent infringement 
regarding mobile deposit capture technology patents held by 
USAA. Trial in the first case commenced on October 30, 2019, 
and resulted in a $200 million verdict against the Company. Trial 
in the second case commenced on January 6, 2020, and resulted 
in a $102.7 million verdict against the Company. The Company 
has filed post-trial motions to, among other things, vacate the 
verdicts, and USAA has filed post-trial motions seeking future 
royalty payments and damages for willful infringement. 

MORTGAGE LOAN MODIFICATION LITIGATION  Plaintiffs 
representing a putative class of mortgage borrowers have filed 
separate putative class actions, Hernandez v. Wells Fargo, et al., 
Coordes v. Wells Fargo, et al., Ryder v. Wells Fargo, Liguori v. 
Wells Fargo, and Dore v. Wells Fargo, against Wells Fargo Bank, 
N.A., in the United States District Court for the Northern District 

123 

  
  
  
Note 14:  Legal Actions (continued) 

of California, the United States District Court for the District of 
Washington, the United States District Court for the Southern 
District of Ohio, the United States District Court for the Southern 
District of New York, and the United States District Court for the 
Western District of Pennsylvania, respectively. Plaintiffs allege 
that Wells Fargo improperly denied mortgage loan modifications 
or repayment plans to customers in the foreclosure process due 
to the overstatement of foreclosure attorneys’ fees that were 
included for purposes of determining whether a customer in the 
foreclosure process qualified for a mortgage loan modification or 
repayment plan. The district court in the Hernandez case certified 
a nationwide breach of contract class for foreclosed borrowers 
and denied certification on claims pertaining to other impacted 
borrowers. In March 2020, the Company entered into an 
agreement pursuant to which the Company will pay $18.5 million 
to resolve the claims of the certified class in the Hernandez case. 

MORTGAGE-RELATED REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS  Federal and 
state government agencies, including the Department of Justice, 
have been investigating or examining certain mortgage related 
activities of Wells Fargo and predecessor institutions. Wells Fargo, 
for itself and for predecessor institutions, has responded, or 
continues to respond, to requests from these agencies seeking 
information regarding the origination, underwriting, and 
securitization of residential mortgages, including sub-prime 
mortgages. These agencies have advanced theories of purported 
liability with respect to certain of these activities. An agreement, 
pursuant to which the Company paid $2.09 billion, was reached in 
August 2018 to resolve the Department of Justice investigation, 
which related to certain 2005-2007 residential mortgage-backed 
securities activities. In addition, the Company reached an 
agreement with the Attorney General of the State of Illinois in 
November 2018 pursuant to which the Company paid $17 million 
in restitution to certain Illinois state pension funds and reached 
an agreement with the Attorney General of the State of Maryland 
in June 2020 pursuant to which the Company agreed to pay 
$20 million in restitution, in each case to resolve claims relating to 
certain residential mortgage-backed securities activities. Other 
financial institutions have entered into similar settlements with 
these agencies, the nature of which related to the specific 
activities of those financial institutions, including the imposition 
of significant financial penalties and remedial actions. 

NOMURA/NATIXIS MORTGAGE-RELATED LITIGATION  In 
August 2014 and August 2015, Nomura Credit & Capital Inc. 
(Nomura) and Natixis Real Estate Holdings, LLC (Natixis) filed a 
total of seven third-party complaints against Wells Fargo Bank, 
N.A., in New York state court. In the underlying first-party actions, 
Nomura and Natixis have been sued for alleged breaches of 
representations and warranties made in connection with 
residential mortgage-backed securities sponsored by them. In the 
third-party actions, Nomura and Natixis allege that Wells Fargo, 
as master servicer, primary servicer or securities administrator, 
failed to notify Nomura and Natixis of their own breaches, failed 
to properly oversee the primary servicers, and failed to adhere to 
accepted servicing practices. Natixis additionally alleges that 
Wells Fargo failed to perform default oversight duties. Wells 
Fargo has asserted counterclaims alleging that Nomura and 
Natixis failed to provide Wells Fargo notice of their 
representation and warranty breaches. 

OFAC RELATED INVESTIGATION  The Company has self-identified 
an issue whereby certain foreign banks utilized a Wells Fargo 
software-based solution to conduct import/export trade-related 
financing transactions with countries and entities prohibited by 

124 

the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the United States 
Department of the Treasury. We do not believe any funds related 
to these transactions flowed through accounts at Wells Fargo as a 
result of the aforementioned conduct. The Company has made 
voluntary self-disclosures to OFAC and is cooperating with an 
inquiry from the Department of Justice. 

ORDER OF POSTING LITIGATION  Plaintiffs filed a series of putative 
class actions against Wachovia Bank, N.A., and Wells Fargo Bank, 
N.A., as well as many other banks, challenging the “high to low” 
order in which the banks post debit card transactions to 
consumer deposit accounts. Most of these actions were 
consolidated in multi-district litigation proceedings (MDL 
proceedings) in the United States District Court for the Southern 
District of Florida. The court in the MDL proceedings has certified 
a class of putative plaintiffs, and Wells Fargo moved to compel 
arbitration of the claims of unnamed class members. The court 
denied the motions to compel arbitration in October 2016, and 
Wells Fargo appealed this decision to the United States Court of 
Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. In May 2018, the Eleventh 
Circuit ruled in Wells Fargo’s favor and found that Wells Fargo had 
not waived its arbitration rights and remanded the case to the 
district court for further proceedings. On September 26, 2019, 
the district court entered an order granting Wells Fargo’s motion 
and dismissed the claims of unnamed class members in favor of 
arbitration. Plaintiffs appealed this decision to the United States 
Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. 

RETAIL SALES PRACTICES MATTERS  A number of bodies or 
entities, including (a) federal, state, and local government 
agencies, including the Department of Justice, the United 
States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the 
United States Department of Labor, (b) state attorneys 
general, including the New York Attorney General, and (c) 
Congressional committees, have undertaken formal or 
informal inquiries, investigations, or examinations arising out 
of certain retail sales practices of the Company that were the 
subject of settlements with the CFPB, the OCC, and the Office 
of the Los Angeles City Attorney announced by the Company 
on September 8, 2016. These matters are at varying stages. 
The Company has responded, and continues to respond, to 
requests from certain of the foregoing. In October 2018, the 
Company entered into an agreement to resolve the New York 
Attorney General’s investigation pursuant to which the 
Company paid $65 million to the State of New York. In 
December 2018, the Company entered into an agreement with 
all 50 state Attorneys General and the District of Columbia to 
resolve an investigation into the Company’s retail sales 
practices, CPI and GAP, and mortgage interest rate lock 
matters, pursuant to which the Company paid $575 million. On 
February 21, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement 
with the Department of Justice to resolve the Department of 
Justice’s criminal investigation into the Company’s retail sales 
practices, as well as a separate agreement to resolve the 
Department of Justice’s civil investigation. As part of the 
Department of Justice criminal settlement, no charges will be 
filed against the Company provided the Company abides by all 
the terms of the agreement. The Department of Justice 
criminal settlement also includes the Company’s agreement 
that the facts set forth in the settlement document constitute 
sufficient facts for the finding of criminal violations of statutes 
regarding bank records and personal information. On 
February 21, 2020, the Company also entered into an order to 
resolve the SEC’s investigation arising out of the Company’s 
retail sales practices. The SEC order contains a finding, to which 

 
 
the Company consented, that the facts set forth include 
violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. As part of the resolution of 
the Department of Justice and SEC investigations, the 
Company has agreed to make payments totaling $3.0 billion. In 
addition, as part of the settlements and included in the 
$3.0 billion amount, the Company has agreed to the creation 
of a $500 million Fair Fund for the benefit of investors who 
were harmed by the conduct covered in the SEC settlement. 
In addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed by non-
governmental parties seeking damages or other remedies related 
to these retail sales practices. First, various class plaintiffs, 
purporting to represent consumers who allege that they received 
products or services without their authorization or consent, have 
brought separate putative class actions against the Company in 
the United States District Court for the Northern District of 
California and various other jurisdictions. On June 14, 2018, the 
district court granted final approval of a settlement entered into 
by the Company in the first-filed action, Jabbari v. Wells Fargo 
Bank, N.A., pursuant to which the Company will pay $142 million 
to resolve claims regarding certain products or services provided 
without authorization or consent for the time period May 1, 2002 
to April 20, 2017. On July 20, 2020, the United States Court of 
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's order 
granting final approval of the settlement. Second, the Company 
was subject to a consolidated securities fraud class action alleging 
certain misstatements and omissions in the Company’s 
disclosures related to sales practices matters. The Company 
entered into a settlement agreement to resolve this matter 
pursuant to which the Company paid $480 million. Third, 
Wells Fargo shareholders have brought numerous shareholder 
derivative lawsuits asserting breach of fiduciary duty claims 
against, among others, current and former directors and officers 
for their alleged involvement with and failure to detect and 
prevent sales practices issues. These actions are currently pending 
in the United States District Court for the Northern District of 
California and California state court as consolidated or 
coordinated proceedings. The parties have entered into 
settlement agreements to resolve the shareholder derivative 
lawsuits pursuant to which insurance carriers will pay the 
Company approximately $240 million for alleged damage to the 
Company, and the Company will pay plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees. 
The federal court granted final approval of the settlement for its 
action on April 7, 2020. The state court granted final approval of 
the settlement for its action on January 15, 2020. Fourth, a 
purported Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) 
class action was filed in the United States District Court for the 
District of Minnesota on behalf of 401(k) plan participants. The 
district court dismissed the action, and on July 27, 2020, the 
United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the 
dismissal. 

RMBS TRUSTEE LITIGATION  In November 2014, a group of 
institutional investors (Institutional Investor Plaintiffs), including 
funds affiliated with BlackRock, Inc., filed a putative class action in 
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New 
York against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., alleging claims against the 
Company in its capacity as trustee for a number of residential 
mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) trusts (Federal Court 
Complaint). Similar complaints have been filed against other 
trustees in various courts, including in the Southern District of 
New York, in New York state court, and in other states, by RMBS 
investors. The Federal Court Complaint alleged that Wells Fargo 
Bank, N.A., as trustee, caused losses to investors and asserted 
causes of action based upon, among other things, the trustee’s 

alleged failure to notify and enforce repurchase obligations of 
mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations 
and warranties, notify investors of alleged events of default, and 
abide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events of 
default. Plaintiffs sought money damages in an unspecified 
amount, reimbursement of expenses, and equitable relief. In 
December 2014 and December 2015, certain other investors 
filed additional complaints alleging similar claims against Wells 
Fargo Bank, N.A., in the Southern District of New York (Related 
Federal Cases). In January 2016, the Southern District of New 
York entered an order in connection with the Federal Court 
Complaint dismissing claims related to certain of the trusts at 
issue (Dismissed Trusts). The Company’s subsequent motion to 
dismiss the Federal Court Complaint and the complaints for the 
Related Federal Cases was granted in part and denied in part in 
March 2017. In May 2017, the Company filed third-party 
complaints against certain investment advisors affiliated with the 
Institutional Investor Plaintiffs seeking contribution with respect 
to claims alleged in the Federal Court Complaint (Third-Party 
Claims). 

In December 2016, the Institutional Investor Plaintiffs filed a 

new putative class action complaint in New York state court in 
respect of 261 RMBS trusts, including the Dismissed Trusts, for 
which Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., serves or served as trustee (State 
Court Action). A complaint raising similar allegations to those in 
the Federal Court Complaint was filed in May 2016 in New York 
state court by IKB International and IKB Deutsche Industriebank 
(IKB Action). 

In July 2017, certain of the plaintiffs from the State Court 
Action filed a civil complaint relating to Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.’s 
setting aside reserves for legal fees and expenses in connection 
with the liquidation of eleven RMBS trusts at issue in the State 
Court Action (Declaratory Judgment Action). The complaint 
sought, among other relief, declarations that the Company is 
not entitled to indemnification, the advancement of funds, or 
the taking of reserves from trust funds for legal fees and 
expenses it incurs in defending the claims in the State Court 
Action. 

In May 2019, the New York state court approved a 
settlement agreement among the Institutional Investor 
Plaintiffs and the Company pursuant to which, among other 
terms, the Company paid $43 million to resolve the Federal 
Court Complaint and the State Court Action. The settlement 
also resolved the Third Party Claims and the Declaratory 
Judgment Action. The settlement did not affect the Related 
Federal Cases or the IKB Action, which remain pending. 

SEMINOLE TRIBE TRUSTEE LITIGATION  The Seminole Tribe of 
Florida filed a complaint in Florida state court alleging that Wells 
Fargo, as trustee, charged excess fees in connection with the 
administration of a minor’s trust and failed to invest the assets of 
the trust prudently. The complaint was later amended to include 
three individual current and former beneficiaries as plaintiffs and 
to remove the Tribe as a party to the case. In December 2016, the 
Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on the 
grounds that the Tribe is a necessary party and that the individual 
beneficiaries lack standing to bring claims. The motion was denied 
in June 2018. The case is pending trial. 

WHOLESALE BANKING CONSENT ORDER INVESTIGATION  On 
November 19, 2015, the Company entered into a consent order 
with the OCC, pursuant to which the Wholesale Banking group 
was required to implement customer due diligence standards that 
include collection of current beneficial ownership information for 
certain business customers. The Company is responding to 

125 

 
  
Note 14:  Legal Actions (continued) 

inquiries from various federal government agencies regarding 
potentially inappropriate conduct in connection with the 
collection of beneficial ownership information. 

OUTLOOK  As described above, the Company establishes accruals 
for legal actions when potential losses associated with the actions 
become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. The 
high end of the range of reasonably possible potential losses in 
excess of the Company’s accrual for probable and estimable 
losses was approximately $2.3 billion as of June 30, 2020. The 
outcomes of legal actions are unpredictable and subject to 
significant uncertainties, and it is inherently difficult to determine 
whether any loss is probable or even possible. It is also inherently 
difficult to estimate the amount of any loss and there may be 
matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but not 
currently estimable. Accordingly, actual losses may be in excess of 
the established accrual or the range of reasonably possible loss. 
Wells Fargo is unable to determine whether the ultimate 
resolution of the retail sales practices matters will have a material 
adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition. Based on 
information currently available, advice of counsel, available 
insurance coverage, and established reserves, Wells Fargo believes 
that the eventual outcome of other actions against Wells Fargo 
and/or its subsidiaries will not, individually or in the aggregate, 
have a material adverse effect on Wells Fargo’s consolidated 
financial condition. However, it is possible that the ultimate 
resolution of a matter, if unfavorable, may be material to Wells 
Fargo’s results of operations for any particular period.

Note 15:  Derivatives 

We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including 
interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to 
assist customers with their risk management objectives. We 
designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments in qualifying 
hedge accounting relationships (fair value or cash flow hedges). 
Our remaining derivatives consist of economic hedges that do 
not qualify for hedge accounting, and derivatives held for 
customer accommodation trading or other purposes. For more 
information on our derivative activities, see Note 18 (Derivatives) 
in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Table 15.1:  Notional or Contractual Amounts and Fair Values of Derivatives 

Table 15.1 presents the total notional or contractual 

amounts and fair values for our derivatives. Derivative 
transactions can be measured in terms of the notional amount, 
but this amount is not recorded on the balance sheet and is not, 
when viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure of the risk profile 
of the instruments. The notional amount is generally not 
exchanged but is used only as the basis on which interest and 
other payments are determined.

We do not net non-cash collateral that we receive and pledge 
on the balance sheet. For disclosure purposes, we present the fair 
value of this non-cash collateral in the column titled “Gross 
amounts not offset in consolidated balance sheet (Disclosure-
only netting)” within the table. We determine and allocate the 
Disclosure-only netting amounts in the same manner as balance 
sheet netting amounts. 

The “Net amounts” column within Table 15.2 represents the 

aggregate of our net exposure to each counterparty after 
considering the balance sheet and Disclosure-only netting 
adjustments. We manage derivative exposure by monitoring the 
credit risk associated with each counterparty using counterparty 
specific credit risk limits, using master netting arrangements and 
obtaining collateral. Derivative contracts executed in OTC 
markets include bilateral contractual arrangements that are not 
cleared through a central clearing organization but are typically 
subject to master netting arrangements. Other derivative 
contracts that are settled through a central clearing organization 
whether OTC or exchange-traded, are excluded from that 
percentage. In addition to the netting amounts included in the 
table, we also have balance sheet netting related to resale and 
repurchase agreements that are disclosed within Note 13 
(Guarantees, Pledged Assets and Collateral, and Other 
Commitments). 

Note 15:  Derivatives (continued) 

Table 15.2 provides information on the gross fair values of 

derivative assets and liabilities, the balance sheet netting 
adjustments and the resulting net fair value amount recorded on 
our balance sheet, as well as the non-cash collateral associated 
with such arrangements. We execute substantially all of our 
derivative transactions under master netting arrangements and 
reflect all derivative balances and related cash collateral subject to 
enforceable master netting arrangements on a net basis within 
the balance sheet. The “Gross amounts recognized” column in the 
following table includes $59.6 billion and $54.7 billion of gross 
derivative assets and liabilities, respectively, at June 30, 2020, and 
$33.7 billion and $33.5 billion, respectively, at December 31, 
2019, with counterparties subject to enforceable master netting 
arrangements that are eligible for balance sheet netting 
adjustments. The majority of these amounts are interest rate 
contracts executed in over-the-counter (OTC) markets. The 
remaining gross derivative assets and liabilities of $8.3 billion and 
$5.1 billion, respectively, at June 30, 2020, and $5.6 billion and 
$4.4 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2019, include those 
with counterparties subject to master netting arrangements for 
which we have not assessed the enforceability because they are 
with counterparties where we do not currently have positions to 
offset, those subject to master netting arrangements where we 
have not been able to confirm the enforceability and those not 
subject to master netting arrangements. As such, we do not net 
derivative balances or collateral within the balance sheet for these 
counterparties. Cash collateral receivables and payables that have 
not been offset against our derivatives were $1.2 billion and 
$1.4 billion, respectively, at June 30, 2020, and $6.3 billion and 
$1.4 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2019. 

We determine the balance sheet netting adjustments based 
on the terms specified within each master netting arrangement. 
We disclose the balance sheet netting amounts within the column 
titled “Gross amounts offset in consolidated balance sheet.” 
Balance sheet netting adjustments are determined at the 
counterparty level for which there may be multiple contract 
types. For disclosure purposes, we allocate these netting 
adjustments to the contract type for each counterparty 
proportionally based upon the “Gross amounts recognized” by 
counterparty. As a result, the net amounts disclosed by contract 
type may not represent the actual exposure upon settlement of 
the contracts.

Represents amounts with counterparties subject to enforceable master netting arrangements that have been offset in the consolidated balance sheet, including related cash collateral and portfolio 
level counterparty valuation adjustments. Counterparty valuation adjustments related to derivative assets were $600 million and $231 million and debit valuation adjustments related to derivative 
liabilities were $229 million and $100 million at June 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. Cash collateral totaled $7.3 billion and $11.0 billion, netted against derivative assets and 
liabilities, respectively, at June 30, 2020, and $2.9 billion and $6.8 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2019. 

Fair Value and Cash Flow Hedges 
For fair value hedges, we use interest rate swaps to convert 
certain of our fixed-rate long-term debt and time certificates of 
deposit to floating rates to hedge our exposure to interest rate 
risk. We also enter into cross-currency swaps, cross-currency 
interest rate swaps and forward contracts to hedge our exposure 
to foreign currency risk and interest rate risk associated with the 
issuance of non-U.S. dollar denominated long-term debt. In 
addition, we use interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, cross-
currency interest rate swaps and forward contracts to hedge 
against changes in fair value of certain investments in available-
for-sale debt securities due to changes in interest rates, foreign 
currency rates, or both. We also use interest rate swaps to hedge 
against changes in fair value for certain mortgage loans held for 
sale. For certain fair value hedges of foreign currency risk, 
changes in fair value of cross-currency swaps attributable to 

changes in cross-currency basis spreads are excluded from the 
assessment of hedge effectiveness and recorded in other 
comprehensive income. See Note 26 (Other Comprehensive 
Income) for the amounts recognized in other comprehensive 
income. 

For cash flow hedges, we use interest rate swaps to hedge 
the variability in interest payments received on certain floating-
rate commercial loans and paid on certain floating-rate debt due 
to changes in the contractually specified interest rate. We also 
use cross-currency swaps to hedge variability in interest 
payments on fixed-rate foreign currency-denominated long-term 
debt due to changes in foreign exchange rates. 

We estimate $203 million pre-tax of deferred net losses 

related to cash flow hedges in OCI at June 30, 2020, will be 
reclassified into net interest income during the next twelve 
months. The deferred losses expected to be reclassified into net 

129 

  
  
Note 15:  Derivatives (continued) 

interest income are predominantly related to discontinued 
hedges of floating rate loans. For cash flow hedges as of June 30, 
2020, we are hedging our foreign currency exposure to the 
variability of future cash flows for all forecasted transactions for a 
maximum of 10 years. For more information on our accounting 

hedges, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) 
and Note 18 (Derivatives) in our 2019 Form 10-K.

Represents hedged items no longer designated in qualifying fair value hedging relationships for which an associated basis adjustment exists at the balance sheet date. 
Does not include the carrying amount of hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk. The carrying amount excluded $5.2 billion for debt securities and $(4.3) billion 
for long-term debt as of June 30, 2020, and $1.2 billion for debt securities and $(5.2) billion for long-term debt as of December 31, 2019. 
The balance includes $548 million and $143 million of debt securities and long-term debt cumulative basis adjustments, respectively, as of June 30, 2020, and $790 million and $109 million of debt 
securities and long-term debt cumulative basis adjustments, respectively, as of December 31, 2019, on terminated hedges whereby the hedged items have subsequently been re-designated into 
existing hedges. 
Represents the full carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability item as of the balance sheet date, except for circumstances in which only a portion of the asset or liability was designated as the 
hedged item in which case only the portion designated is presented.

Note 15:  Derivatives (continued) 

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments 
Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments include 
economic hedges and derivatives entered into for customer 
accommodation trading purposes. 

We use economic hedge derivatives to manage our exposure 

to interest rate risk, equity price risk, foreign currency risk, and 
credit risk. We also use economic hedge derivatives to mitigate 
the periodic earnings volatility caused by mismatches between 
the changes in fair value of the hedged item and hedging 
instrument recognized on our fair value accounting hedges. In 
second quarter 2020, we entered into arrangements to transition 

the economic hedges of our deferred compensation plan liabilities 
from equity securities to derivative instruments. Changes in the 
fair values of derivatives used to economically hedge the deferred 
compensation plan are reported in personnel expense. 

 For more information on economic hedges and other 
derivatives, see Note 18 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in 
our 2019 Form 10-K.

Note 15:  Derivatives (continued) 

Credit Derivatives 
Credit derivative contracts are arrangements whose value is 
derived from the transfer of credit risk of a reference asset or 
entity from one party (the purchaser of credit protection) to 
another party (the seller of credit protection). We use credit 
derivatives to assist customers with their risk management 
objectives. We may also use credit derivatives in structured 
product transactions or liquidity agreements written to special 
purpose vehicles. The maximum exposure of sold credit 
derivatives is managed through posted collateral, purchased 
credit derivatives and similar products in order to achieve our 
desired credit risk profile. This credit risk management provides 

Table 15.7:  Sold and Purchased Credit Derivatives 

an ability to recover a significant portion of any amounts that 
would be paid under the sold credit derivatives. We would be 
required to perform under sold credit derivatives in the event of 
default by the referenced obligors. Events of default include 
events such as bankruptcy, capital restructuring or lack of 
principal and/or interest payment. In certain cases, other triggers 
may exist, such as the credit downgrade of the referenced 
obligors or the inability of the special purpose vehicle for which 
we have provided liquidity to obtain funding. 

Table 15.7 provides details of sold and purchased credit 

derivatives.

Protection sold represents the estimated maximum 

exposure to loss that would be incurred under an assumed 
hypothetical circumstance, where the value of our interests and 
any associated collateral declines to zero, without any 
consideration of recovery or offset from any economic hedges. 
We believe this hypothetical circumstance to be an extremely 
remote possibility and accordingly, this required disclosure is not 
an indication of expected loss. The amounts under non-
investment grade represent the notional amounts of those credit 
derivatives on which we have a higher risk of being required to 
perform under the terms of the credit derivative and are a 
function of the underlying assets. 

We consider the risk of performance to be high if the 
underlying assets under the credit derivative have an external 
rating that is below investment grade or an internal credit default 
grade that is equivalent thereto. We believe the net protection 
sold, which is representative of the net notional amount of 
protection sold and purchased with identical underlyings, in 
combination with other protection purchased, is more 
representative of our exposure to loss than either non-
investment grade or protection sold. Other protection purchased 
represents additional protection, which may offset the exposure 
to loss for protection sold, that was not purchased with an 
identical underlying of the protection sold. 

136 

  
 
Credit-Risk Contingent Features 
Certain of our derivative contracts contain provisions whereby if 
the credit rating of our debt were to be downgraded by certain 
major credit rating agencies, the counterparty could demand 
additional collateral or require termination or replacement of 
derivative instruments in a net liability position. Table 15.8 
illustrates our exposure to such derivatives with credit-risk 
contingent features, collateral we have posted, and the additional 
collateral we would be required to post if the credit rating of our 
debt was downgraded below investment grade.

Note 16:  Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities 

We use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments 
to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value 
disclosures. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a 
recurring basis are presented in Table 16.2 in this Note. From time 
to time, we may be required to record fair value adjustments on a 
nonrecurring basis. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments 
typically involve application of LOCOM accounting, write-downs 
of individual assets or application of the measurement alternative 
for nonmarketable equity securities. Assets recorded on a 
nonrecurring basis are presented in Table 16.13 in this Note. 
Table 16.19 includes estimates of fair value for financial 
instruments that are not recorded at fair value. 

See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in 

our 2019 Form 10-K for discussion of how we determine fair 
value. For descriptions of the valuation methodologies we use for 
assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring or 
nonrecurring basis and for estimating fair value for financial 
instruments that are not recorded at fair value, see Note 19 (Fair 
Values of Assets and Liabilities) in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY  We classify our assets and liabilities 
measured at fair value as either Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 in the 
fair value hierarchy. The highest priority (Level 1) is assigned to 
valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets 
and the lowest priority (Level 3) is assigned to valuations based 
on significant unobservable inputs. See Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) in our 2019 Form 10-K for a 
detailed description of the fair value hierarchy. 

In the determination of the classification of financial 
instruments in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, we 
consider all available information, including observable market 
data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our 
understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs 
used. For securities in inactive markets, we use a predetermined 
percentage to evaluate the impact of fair value adjustments 

derived from weighting both external and internal indications of 
value to determine if the instrument is classified as Level 2 or 
Level 3. Otherwise, the classification of Level 2 or Level 3 is based 
upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or 
instrument category and judgments are made regarding the 
significance of the Level 3 inputs to the instruments’ fair value 
measurement in its entirety. If Level 3 inputs are considered 
significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. 

We do not classify equity securities in the fair value hierarchy 
if we use the non-published net asset value (NAV) per share (or its 
equivalent) that has been communicated to us as an investor as a 
practical expedient to measure fair value. We generally use NAV 
per share as the fair value measurement for certain 
nonmarketable equity fund investments. Marketable equity 
securities with published NAVs are classified in the fair value 
hierarchy. 

Fair Value Measurements from Vendors 
For certain assets and liabilities, we obtain fair value 
measurements from vendors and we record the fair value in our 
financial statements. For additional information, see Note 19 (Fair 
Values of Assets and Liabilities) in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Table 16.1 presents fair value measurements obtained from 

third-party pricing services classified within the fair value 
hierarchy. Fair value measurements obtained from brokers and 
fair value measurements obtained from third-party pricing 
services that we have adjusted using internal models or non-
vendor data to determine the fair value are excluded from 
Table 16.1. 

The unadjusted fair value measurements obtained from 
brokers for available-for-sale debt securities were $19 million in 
Level 2 assets and $123 million in Level 3 assets at June 30, 2020, 
and $45 million and $126 million at December 31, 2019, 
respectively.

Changes in Fair Value Levels 
We monitor the availability of observable market data to assess 
the appropriate classification of financial instruments within the 
fair value hierarchy and transfer between Level 1, Level 2, and 
Level 3 accordingly. Observable market data includes but is not 
limited to quoted prices and market transactions. Changes in 
economic conditions or market liquidity generally will drive 
changes in availability of observable market data. Changes in 
availability of observable market data, which also may result in 

changing the valuation technique used, are generally the cause of 
transfers between Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3. The amounts 
reported as transfers represent the fair value as of the beginning 
of the quarter in which the transfer occurred. 

The changes in Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair 

value on a recurring basis for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, 
are presented in Table 16.3.

For more information on the changes in mortgage servicing rights, see Note 11 (Mortgage Banking Activities). 

Weighted averages of inputs are calculated using 

outstanding unpaid principal balance for cash instruments, such 
as loans and securities, and notional amounts for derivative 
instruments. 

For information on how changes in significant unobservable 

inputs affect the fair values of Level 3 assets and liabilities, see 
Note 19 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) in our 2019 Form 
10-K. 

Table 16.11 and Table 16.12 provide quantitative 
information about the valuation techniques and significant 
unobservable inputs used in the valuation of substantially all of 
our Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a 
recurring basis for which we use an internal model. 

The significant unobservable inputs for Level 3 assets and 
liabilities inherent in the fair values obtained from third-party 
vendors are not included in the table, as the specific inputs 
applied are not provided by the vendor. 

In addition, the table excludes the valuation techniques and 

significant unobservable inputs for certain classes of Level 3 
assets and liabilities measured using internal models that we 
consider, both individually and in the aggregate, insignificant 
relative to our overall Level 3 assets and liabilities. We made this 
determination based upon an evaluation of each class, which 
considered the magnitude of the positions, nature of the 
unobservable inputs and potential for significant changes in fair 
value due to changes in those inputs.

Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a 
Nonrecurring Basis 
We may be required, from time to time, to measure certain assets 
at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP. 
These adjustments to fair value usually result from application of 
LOCOM accounting, write-downs of individual assets or use of 
the measurement alternative for nonmarketable equity 
securities. 

Table 16.13 provides the fair value hierarchy and fair value at 

the date of the nonrecurring fair value adjustment for all assets 

Table 16.13:  Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 

that were still held as of June 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019,

Note 16: Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities (continued) 

Table 16.15 provides quantitative information about the 
valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used in 
the valuation of our Level 3 assets that are measured at fair value 
on a nonrecurring basis primarily using an internal model. The 
table is limited to financial instruments that had nonrecurring fair 
value adjustments during the periods presented. Weighted 
averages of inputs are calculated using outstanding unpaid 
principal balance for cash instruments, such as loans, and carrying 
value prior to the nonrecurring fair value measurement for 
nonmarketable equity securities. 

Table 16.15:  Valuation Techniques – Nonrecurring Basis 

We have excluded from the table valuation techniques and 

significant unobservable inputs for certain classes of Level 3 
assets we consider both individually and in the aggregate, 
insignificant relative to our overall Level 3 nonrecurring 
measurements. We made this determination based upon an 
evaluation of each class that considered the magnitude of the 
positions, nature of the unobservable inputs and potential for 
significant changes in fair value due to changes in those inputs.

Refer to Note 19 (Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities) in our 2019 Form 10-K for a definition of the valuation technique(s) and significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of residential 
mortgage loans held for sale, mortgage servicing rights, and certain nonmarketable equity securities. 
Consists of approximately $1.3 billion of government insured/guaranteed loans purchased from GNMA-guaranteed mortgage securitizations at both June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, and 
approximately $500 million and $2.5 billion, respectively, of other mortgage loans that are not government insured/guaranteed. 
Applies only to non-government insured/guaranteed loans. 
Includes the impact on prepayment rate of expected defaults for government insured/guaranteed loans, which impact the frequency and timing of early resolution of loans. 
Includes $439 million of private equity and venture capital investments in consolidated portfolio companies classified in other assets on the balance sheet. 

We typically use a market approach to estimate the fair value 

of our nonmarketable private equity and venture capital 
investments in portfolio companies. The market approach bases 
the fair value measurement on market data (for example, use of 
market comparable pricing techniques) that are used to derive 
the enterprise value of the portfolio company. Market 
comparable pricing techniques include utilization of financial 
metrics of comparable public companies (multiples), such as 
ratios of enterprise value or market value of equity to revenue, 
EBITDA, net income or book value. Comparable company 
valuation multiples are evaluated and adjusted as necessary to 
reflect the comparative operational, financial or marketability 
differences between the public company and subject portfolio 
company in estimating its fair value. Market comparable pricing 

techniques also use recent or anticipated transactions (for 
example, a financing round, merger, acquisition or bankruptcy) 
involving the subject portfolio company, or participants in its 
industry or related industries. Based upon these recent or 
anticipated transactions, current market conditions and other 
factors specific to the issuer, we make adjustments to estimate 
the enterprise value of the portfolio company. As a result of the 
recent market environment, we also utilized other valuation 
techniques. These techniques included the use of company risk 
factors in the estimation of the fair value of certain 
nonmarketable equity securities. The company risk factors are 
based upon entity-specific considerations including the debt and 
liquidity profile, projected cash flow or funding issues as well as 
other factors that may affect the company’s outlook.

Fair Value Option 
The fair value option is an irrevocable election, generally only 
permitted upon initial recognition of financial assets or liabilities, 
to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value with 
changes in fair value reflected in earnings. We may elect the fair 
value option to align the measurement model with how the 
financial assets or liabilities are managed or to reduce complexity 

or accounting asymmetry. For more information, including the 
basis for our fair value option elections, see Note 19 (Fair Values 
of Assets and Liabilities) in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Table 16.16 reflects differences between the fair value 
carrying amount of the assets for which we have elected the fair 
value option and the contractual aggregate unpaid principal 
amount at maturity.

For performing loans, instrument-specific credit risk gains or 

losses were derived principally by determining the change in fair 
value of the loans due to changes in the observable or implied 
credit spread. Credit spread is the market yield on the loans less 
the relevant risk-free benchmark interest rate. For 

nonperforming loans, we attribute all changes in fair value to 
instrument-specific credit risk. Table 16.18 shows the estimated 
gains and losses from earnings attributable to instrument-
specific credit risk related to assets accounted for under the fair 
value option.

Note 16: Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities (continued) 

Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
Table 16.19 presents a summary of fair value estimates for 
financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on a 
recurring basis. Some financial instruments are excluded from 
scope of this table, such as certain insurance contracts and leases. 
This table also excludes assets and liabilities that are not financial 
instruments such as the value of the long-term relationships with 
our deposit, credit card and trust customers, MSRs, premises and 
equipment, goodwill and deferred taxes. 

Loan commitments, standby letters of credit and commercial 

and similar letters of credit are not included in Table 16.19. A 
reasonable estimate of the fair value of these instruments is the 
carrying value of deferred fees plus the allowance for unfunded 
credit commitments, which totaled $1.7 billion and $1.0 billion at 
June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. 

The total of the fair value calculations presented does not 

represent, and should not be construed to represent, the 
underlying value of the Company.

ESOP CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK  All shares of 
our ESOP Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (ESOP 
Preferred Stock) were issued to a trustee acting on behalf of the 
Wells Fargo & Company 401(k) Plan (the 401(k) Plan). Dividends 
on the ESOP Preferred Stock are cumulative from the date of 
initial issuance and are payable quarterly at annual rates based 
upon the year of issuance. Each share of ESOP Preferred Stock 
released from the unallocated reserve of the 401(k) Plan is 
converted into shares of our common stock based on the stated 

value of the ESOP Preferred Stock and the then current market 
price of our common stock. The ESOP Preferred Stock is also 
convertible at the option of the holder at any time, unless 
previously redeemed. We have the option to redeem the ESOP 
Preferred Stock at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption 
price per share equal to the higher of (a) $1,000 per share plus 
accrued and unpaid dividends or (b) the fair market value, as 
defined in the Certificates of Designation for the ESOP Preferred 
Stock.

We provide services to customers which have related 

performance obligations that we complete to recognize revenue. 
Our revenues are generally recognized either immediately upon 
the completion of our service or over time as we perform services. 
Any services performed over time generally require that we 
render services each period and therefore we measure our 
progress in completing these services based upon the passage of 
time. 

and include fees for account and overdraft services. Account 
charges include fees for periodic account maintenance activities 
and event-driven services such as stop payment fees. Our 
obligation for event-driven services is satisfied at the time of the 
event when the service is delivered, while our obligation for 
maintenance services is satisfied over the course of each month. 
Our obligation for overdraft services is satisfied at the time of the 
overdraft.

BROKERAGE ADVISORY, COMMISSIONS AND OTHER FEES are earned 
for providing full-service and discount brokerage services 
predominantly to retail brokerage clients. These revenues include 
fees earned on asset-based and transactional accounts and other 
brokerage advisory services. 

Asset-based revenues are charged based on the market value 

of the client’s assets. The services and related obligations 
associated with certain of these revenues, which include 
investment advice, active management of client assets, or 
assistance with selecting and engaging a third-party advisory 
manager, are generally satisfied over a month or quarter. The 
remaining revenues include trailing commissions which are earned 
for selling shares to investors. Our obligation associated with 
earning trailing commissions is satisfied at the time shares are 
sold. However, these fees are received and recognized over time 
during the period the customer owns the shares and we remain 
the broker of record. The amount of trailing commissions is 
variable based on the length of time the customer holds the 
shares and on changes in the value of the underlying assets. 

Transactional revenues are earned for executing transactions 
at the client’s direction. Our obligation is generally satisfied upon 
the execution of the transaction and the fees are based on the 
size and number of transactions executed. 

Other revenues earned from other brokerage advisory 

services include omnibus and networking fees received from 
mutual fund companies in return for providing record keeping and 
other administrative services, and annual account maintenance 
fees charged to customers. 

Table 18.3 presents our brokerage advisory, commissions and

TRUST AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES are earned for 
providing trust, investment management and other related 
services. 

Investment management services include managing and 

administering assets, including mutual funds, and institutional 
separate accounts. Fees for these services are generally 
determined based on a tiered scale relative to the market value of 
assets under management (AUM). In addition to AUM, we have 
client assets under administration (AUA) that earn various 
administrative fees which are generally based on the extent of the 
services provided to administer the account. Services with AUM 
and AUA-based fees are generally performed over time. 

Table 18.4:  Trust and Investment Management Fees by Operating Segment 

Trust services include acting as a trustee or agent for 

corporate trust, personal trust, and agency assets. Obligations for 
trust services are generally satisfied over time, while obligations 
for activities that are transactional in nature are satisfied at the 
time of the transaction. 

Other related services include the custody and safekeeping 

of accounts. Our obligation for these services is generally 
satisfied over time.

Note 19:  Employee Benefits and Other Expenses 

We sponsor a frozen noncontributory qualified defined benefit 
retirement plan, the Wells Fargo & Company Cash Balance Plan 
(Cash Balance Plan), which covers eligible employees of 
Wells Fargo. The Cash Balance Plan was frozen on July 1, 2009, 
and no new benefits have accrued after that date. For additional 
information on our pension and postretirement plans, including 
plan assumptions, investment strategy and asset allocation, 
projected benefit payments, and valuation methodologies used 
for assets measured at fair value, see Note 23 (Employee Benefits 
and Other Expenses) in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

We recognize settlement losses for our Cash Balance Plan 

based on an assessment of whether lump sum benefit payments 
will, in aggregate for the year, exceed the sum of its annual service 
and interest cost. Settlement losses of $70 million were 
recognized during second quarter 2020 representing the pro rata 
portion of the net loss in cumulative other comprehensive income 

based on the percentage reduction in the Cash Balance Plan’s 
projected benefit obligation attributable to lump sum benefit 
payments during the first half of 2020. As a result of the 
settlement losses, we re-measured the Cash Balance Plan 
obligation and plan assets as of June 30, 2020, and used a 
discount rate of 2.75% based on our consistent methodology of 
determining our discount rate using a yield curve with maturity 
dates that closely match the estimated timing of the expected 
benefit payments. The result of the settlement losses and re-
measurement increased the Cash Balance Plan liability by 
$674 million and decreased other comprehensive income by 
$604 million (pre tax) in second quarter 2020. 

Table 19.1 presents the components of net periodic benefit 
cost. Service cost is reported in personnel expense and all other 
components of net periodic benefit cost are reported in other 
noninterest expense on the consolidated statement of income.

The six months ended June 30, 2020, balance includes $272 million from the elimination of discounts or issuance costs associated with redemptions of preferred stock. 
Calculated using the treasury stock method. In the second quarter and first half of 2020, diluted average common shares outstanding equaled average common shares outstanding because our 
securities convertible into common shares had an anti-dilutive effect. 

Table 20.2 presents the outstanding securities that were 

anti-dilutive and therefore not included in the calculation of 
diluted earnings per common share.

Calculated using the treasury stock method. Since we had net losses attributable to common shareholders for the second quarter and first half of 2020, all RSRs outstanding were anti-dilutive. 
Weighted average RSRs outstanding were 50.7 million and 54.7 million for the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively.

Note 22:  Operating Segments 

As of June 30, 2020, we were organized for management 
reporting purposes into three operating segments: Community 
Banking; Wholesale Banking; and Wealth and Investment 
Management (WIM). These segments are defined by product 
type and customer segment and their results are based on our 
management reporting process. The management reporting 
process is based on U.S. GAAP with specific adjustments, such as 
for funds transfer pricing for asset/liability management, for 
shared revenues and expenses, and tax-equivalent adjustments to 
consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt sources. 
On February 11, 2020, we announced a new organizational 
structure with five principal lines of business: Consumer and Small 
Business Banking; Consumer Lending; Commercial Banking; 

Corporate and Investment Banking; and Wealth and Investment 
Management. This new organizational structure is intended to 
help drive operating, control, and business performance. In 
July 2020, the Company completed the transition to this new 
organizational structure, including finalizing leadership for these 
principal business lines and aligning management reporting and 
allocation methodologies. These changes will not impact the 
consolidated financial results of the Company. Accordingly, we will 
update our operating segment disclosures, including comparative 
financial results, in third quarter 2020. For a description of our 
operating segments, see Note 27 (Operating Segments) in our 
2019 Form 10-K. Table 22.1 presents our results by operating 
segment.

Includes the elimination of certain items that are included in more than one business segment, most of which represents products and services for WIM customers served through Community 
Banking distribution channels. 
Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on assets and the cost of liabilities to fund those assets. Interest earned includes actual interest earned on segment assets as well as 
interest credits for any funding of a segment available to be provided to other segments. The cost of liabilities includes actual interest expense on segment liabilities as well as funding charges for any 
funding provided from other segments. 
Income tax expense (benefit) for our Wholesale Banking operating segment included income tax credits related to low-income housing and renewable energy investments of $465 million and 
$956 million for the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, and $423 million and $850 million for the second quarter and first half of 2019, respectively.

Note 23:  Regulatory and Agency Capital Requirements 

The Company and each of its subsidiary banks are subject to 
regulatory capital adequacy requirements promulgated by federal 
banking regulators. The Federal Reserve establishes capital 
requirements for the consolidated financial holding company, and 
the OCC has similar requirements for the Company’s national 
banks, including Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the Bank). 

Table 23.1 presents regulatory capital information for Wells 

Fargo & Company and the Bank in accordance with Basel III capital 
requirements. We must report the lower of our Common Equity 
Tier 1 (CET1), tier 1 and total capital ratios calculated under the 
Standardized Approach and under the Advanced Approach in the 
assessment of our capital adequacy. The Standardized Approach 
applies assigned risk weights to broad risk categories, while the 
calculation of risk-weighted assets (RWAs) under the Advanced 
Approach differs by requiring applicable banks to utilize a risk-
sensitive methodology, which relies upon the use of internal 
credit models, and includes an operational risk component. The 

Basel III capital requirements for calculating CET1 and tier 1 
capital, along with RWAs, are fully phased-in. However, the 
requirements for determining tier 2 and total capital are still in 
accordance with Transition Requirements and are scheduled to be 
fully phased-in by the end of 2021. Accordingly, the information 
presented below reflects fully phased-in CET1 capital, tier 1 
capital, and RWAs, but reflects total capital still in accordance 
with Transition Requirements. 

At June 30, 2020, the Bank and our other insured depository 

institutions were considered well-capitalized under the 
requirements of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. 

The Bank is an approved seller/servicer of mortgage loans 

and is required to maintain minimum levels of shareholders’ 
equity, as specified by various agencies, including the United 
States Department of Housing and Urban Development, GNMA, 
FHLMC and FNMA. At June 30, 2020, the Bank met these 
requirements.

*Denotes the lowest capital ratio as determined under the Advanced and Standardized Approaches.

In second quarter 2020, the Company elected to apply a modified transition provision issued by federal banking regulators in March 2020 related to the impact of CECL on regulatory capital. The rule 
permits certain banking organizations to exclude from regulatory capital the initial adoption impact of CECL, plus 25% of the cumulative changes in the ACL under CECL for each period until 
December 31, 2021, followed by a three-year phase-out of the benefits. The impact of the CECL transition provision on the regulatory capital of the Company at June 30, 2020, was an increase in 
capital of $1.9 billion, reflecting a $991 million (post-tax) increase in capital recognized upon our initial adoption of CECL, offset by 25% of the $11.4 billion increase in our ACL under CECL from 
January 1, 2020, through June 30, 2020. The impact of the CECL transition provision on the regulatory capital of the Bank at June 30, 2020, was an increase in capital of $1.8 billion. 
RWAs and capital ratios for December 31, 2019, have been revised as a result of a decrease in RWAs under the Advanced Approach due to the correction of duplicated operational loss amounts. 
RWAs for the Company and the Bank include an increase of $1.5 billion under both the Advanced Approach and Standardized Approach related to the impact of the CECL transition provision on the 
excess allowance for credit losses as of June 30, 2020. 
The leverage ratio consists of Tier 1 capital divided by total average assets, excluding goodwill and certain other items. 
The supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) consists of Tier 1 capital divided by total leverage exposure. Total leverage exposure consists of total average assets, less goodwill and other permitted Tier 1 
capital deductions (net of deferred tax liabilities), plus certain off-balance sheet exposures.

systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge of 2.000%. Only the 2.500% capital conservation buffer applies to the Bank at June 30, 2020. Effective October 1, 2020, the 2.500% capital 
conservation buffer will be replaced under the Standardized Approach by a stress capital buffer that is calculated annually as part of the FRB's supervisory stress test and related Comprehensive 
Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). 
The Company is required to maintain a SLR of at least 5.000% (comprised of a 3.000% minimum requirement plus a supplementary leverage buffer of 2.000%) to avoid restrictions on capital 
distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The Bank is required to maintain a SLR of at least 6.000% to be considered well-capitalized under applicable regulatory capital adequacy guidelines.
